2025-05-26T17:00:16.000Z,"Massive US Spot BTC ETF Inflows Hit $2.75B, Signaling Strong Demand","BitcoinWorld Massive US Spot BTC ETF Inflows Hit $2.75B, Signaling Strong Demand Are you tracking the latest moves in the crypto market? If so, you won’t want to miss this. US spot BTC ETFs just had a week that turned heads, attracting a substantial $2.75 billion in combined net inflows. This isn’t just a casual uptick; according to data compiled by SoSoValue, this figure marks the third-largest weekly inflow recorded since these investment vehicles launched. It’s a clear indicator of robust interest, particularly from institutional players looking for regulated exposure to the leading digital asset. What’s Behind the Surge in Bitcoin ETF Inflows ? The $2.75 billion figure for US spot BTC ETFs is significant for several reasons. Firstly, its sheer size demonstrates a high level of capital allocation into the Bitcoin space through these regulated products. This level of inflow suggests sustained demand, potentially driven by: Increasing Institutional Confidence: Traditional finance institutions, wealth managers, and hedge funds are becoming more comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin via familiar ETF structures. Macroeconomic Factors: Uncertainties in traditional markets, inflation concerns, and the search for uncorrelated assets can drive interest in Bitcoin. Market Momentum: Positive price action often attracts further investment, creating a virtuous cycle of inflows and price appreciation. Ease of Access: Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a simple and regulated way for a broad range of investors to gain exposure to BTC price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This inflow volume, ranking as the third-largest weekly total, underscores the growing maturity and acceptance of Bitcoin as an investable asset class within the traditional financial system. It highlights that the initial wave of post-launch excitement hasn’t entirely subsided and that significant capital continues to flow into these products during favorable market conditions. A Look at Ethereum ETF Inflows While Bitcoin dominates the headlines, other digital assets are also seeing interest through similar regulated products. During the same period, US spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs also recorded positive net inflows, totaling $248.31 million. Although this figure is considerably smaller than the Bitcoin ETF inflows, it is noteworthy, especially considering the relative market cap difference between ETH and BTC and the newer status of spot ETH ETFs compared to their BTC counterparts. The positive inflows into Ethereum ETF inflows suggest: Diversification within Crypto: Investors are not solely focused on Bitcoin but are also exploring other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum through regulated channels. Growing Interest in the Ethereum Ecosystem: Ethereum’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts makes it an attractive asset for those betting on the broader Web3 ecosystem. Anticipation of Future Developments: Positive sentiment surrounding potential future upgrades or increased utility for the Ethereum network could be driving investment. Comparing the two, the scale of Bitcoin ETF inflows clearly dwarfs that of Ethereum ETFs for the week. This reflects Bitcoin’s status as the primary gateway asset for institutional crypto investment and its longer history and larger market presence. However, the positive inflows for ETH ETFs indicate a broadening appetite for regulated crypto exposure beyond just Bitcoin. Decoding the Latest Crypto ETF Trends Observing the consistent, and at times massive, inflows into US spot BTC ETFs and the emerging inflows into ETH ETFs provides valuable insights into current market dynamics. These flows are often seen as a proxy for institutional and traditional investor sentiment towards the crypto asset class. Key trends highlighted by this data include: Institutional Accumulation: The significant volumes suggest that institutional players are actively accumulating Bitcoin and, to a lesser extent, Ethereum through these accessible products. This is a stark contrast to earlier cycles where retail investors primarily drove price action. Market Liquidity and Depth: ETF inflows contribute to increased liquidity and depth in the underlying spot markets as issuers purchase BTC and ETH to back the ETF shares. Validation of the Asset Class: The willingness of large investment firms and their clients to invest through regulated ETFs provides further validation for Bitcoin and Ethereum as legitimate asset classes. Impact on Price Discovery: While not the sole driver, consistent large inflows can exert upward pressure on prices due to the constant buying demand created by ETF issuers. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Investment ? The sustained interest, exemplified by the $2.75 billion week for US spot BTC ETFs , solidifies the narrative that institutional crypto investment is not a fleeting trend but a growing component of modern portfolio allocation. These ETFs act as a bridge, allowing institutions bound by mandates or regulatory hurdles that prevent direct crypto holdings to gain exposure. The implications for institutional crypto investment are profound: Increased Market Stability: As more institutional capital enters the market, it can potentially lead to greater stability compared to purely retail-driven cycles. Further Product Development: The success of BTC and ETH ETFs may pave the way for similar products tracking other digital assets, expanding the regulated investment landscape. Enhanced Regulatory Clarity: The operation of these ETFs requires significant regulatory oversight, potentially leading to clearer guidelines for the broader crypto market over time. While the picture is overwhelmingly positive regarding inflows, it’s important to remember that markets are dynamic. Outflows can occur due to profit-taking, changes in sentiment, or broader economic shifts. However, the current trend suggests a strong underlying demand from sophisticated investors. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite the impressive inflows, the market for US spot BTC ETFs and ETH ETFs is not without its challenges. Volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market, meaning the value of these ETFs can fluctuate significantly. Regulatory landscapes can also shift, potentially impacting the products or the underlying assets. Competition among ETF providers is also high, leading to fee pressures. Looking ahead, the sustainability of these inflow levels will depend on various factors, including global economic conditions, further regulatory developments, and the continued performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the strong start and significant capital attracted so far paint a bullish picture for the integration of crypto assets into traditional investment portfolios. Summary: A Watershed Moment for Crypto ETFs The past week’s performance of US spot BTC ETFs , pulling in $2.75 billion and marking the third-largest weekly inflow ever, is a powerful testament to the growing acceptance and demand for Bitcoin among traditional investors. Coupled with positive inflows into US spot Ethereum ETFs, these figures highlight robust Crypto ETF trends and underscore the increasing importance of Institutional crypto investment in shaping the market. While challenges remain, the trajectory suggests a continued path towards mainstream adoption through regulated investment vehicles.

2025-05-26T16:55:35.000Z,"Public Companies Could Hoard As Much as $259,395,600,000 in Bitcoin by End of 2026, According to Bitwise","Crypto asset manager Bitwise says publicly traded companies are increasingly investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the flagship cryptocurrency transitions from a speculative investment to a more strategic corporate asset. In a new report, Bitwise says c orporate Bitcoin holders grew their collective holdings from 394,131 to 786,857 BTC over a six-month period from November 15th, 2024 to May 15th, 2025. The increase amounts to 392,726 BTC, which is equivalent to 196,363 BTC acquired per quarter. Using the data, Bitwise projected the amount of Bitcoin that public companies will likely accumulate over the next six quarters through the end of 2026. The model suggests that corporate investors will likely buy 98,181 BTC per quarter if Bitcoin adoption slows by half. Companies will purchase 196,363 BTC per quarter if the pace remains the same and 392,726 BTC per quarter if the adoption rate doubles, as per the model. In the bull case scenario, public companies can hoard as much as 2.356 million BTC, which represents 11.22% of the total Bitcoin supply, or $259.395 billion based on Bitcoin’s current price of $110,100. The anticipated inflows in the bear and base case scenarios are 589,000 BTC and 1.178 million BTC, respectively. Say Bitwise analysts, “Collectively, these developments signal a new era of Bitcoin adoption in which public companies not only hold Bitcoin but design business models around it. Pioneered by Michael Saylor, the ‘Bitcoin Standard’ corporate playbook of reorienting excess cash into Bitcoin purchases and using a company’s capital structure to fund additional Bitcoin acquisition is becoming a repeatable model. As more companies adopt the Bitcoin Standard, it reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset and educates equity investors on its utility – driving broader institutional acceptance.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-26T16:53:46.000Z,"CZ’s YZi Labs Ignites Avalon, Bitcoin DeFi’s $500M Ecosystem","In a bold bet on Bitcoin’s DeFi future, Changpeng Zhao (CZ)–backed YZi Labs— formerly Binance Labs —has made an undisclosed investment in Avalon Labs, a fast-rising platform building on-chain capital markets powered by BTC. In an X post on May 26, the firm said the project is building financial infrastructure around BTC-collateralized lending, stablecoin USDa, savings products, and credit services, showing there is interest in Bitcoin-powered DeFi. https://twitter.com/yzilabs/status/1927000818680541674?s=61 USDa: Powering a Bitcoin-Backed Financial Ecosystem At the core of Avalon’s ecosystem is USDa, a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin that allows users to borrow, earn yield, and transact without selling their BTC. The firm has over $500 million in total value locked (TVL). USDa is the second-largest collateralized debt position (CDP) project tracked by DeFiLlama. The platform goes beyond stablecoins to include BTC-backed lending, yield-bearing savings accounts, and a Bitcoin-collateralized credit card, managing more than 20,000 BTC. Scaling Toward Regulation and Institutional Growth Avalon’s journey began in Season 8 of the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) accelerator—run in partnership with BNB Chain, CoinMarketCap, and YZi Labs. In a blog post, the firm explains that with this new capital injection, Avalon is preparing to scale globally, targeting regulatory licenses across key markets and working with elite law firms to launch a fully regulated public fund. At the same time, the company said it is ramping up its institutional lending business, seeking to become the world’s first fully regulated on-chain Bitcoin financial institution. “Avalon leverages Bitcoin’s security and liquidity to create a full-stack financial ecosystem,” said Alex Odagiu, Investment Director at YZi Labs. “It bridges the gap between Bitcoin’s vast potential and real-world usability.” “We’re building the premier financial hub for Bitcoin,” added Venus Li, Co-Founder of Avalon Labs. “With YZi Labs’ support, we’ll bring Bitcoin-backed products to everyday users and unlock yield for a global audience.” Binance Labs Rebrands to YZi Labs With CZ Engaging More In December, Binance Labs announced plans to rebrand in 2025. Changpeng Zhao (CZ) will lead and personally engage with investment projects. CZ served four months in prison for violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and other regulatory issues. Binance Labs broke away from the exchange Binance and became an independent entity in 2024. The rebranding reflects its evolving vision and distances itself from the exchange. The investment arm said Binance founder CZ will dedicate more time to investing and directly engaging with projects. CZ is permanently banned from being involved in Binance leadership but is allowed to focus on investments.

2025-05-26T16:50:47.000Z,"Bitcoin 2025: Trump Sons’ Attendance Signals Political Shift","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin 2025: Trump Sons’ Attendance Signals Political Shift The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency continues to heat up, and a recent announcement from the organizers of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas is making waves. It’s been revealed that none other than Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., sons of former President Donald Trump, are slated to attend the highly anticipated event. This news underscores the growing mainstream and political interest in digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. For many in the crypto community, seeing prominent political figures like the Trump Sons engaging directly with the space is a significant development, signaling potential shifts in how cryptocurrency is perceived and potentially regulated in the future. What is the Bitcoin 2025 Conference? The Bitcoin Conference series is widely regarded as one of the premier gatherings for the Bitcoin community globally. It brings together enthusiasts, developers, investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers to discuss the latest trends, innovations, and challenges facing the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Held annually, the conference serves as a major platform for: Networking and forging connections within the industry. Learning about new technologies and projects built on Bitcoin. Hearing from influential figures and thought leaders. Debating the future direction of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Showcasing new products and services. Hosting the event in Las Vegas Conference venues adds a layer of excitement and accessibility, attracting a diverse crowd from various backgrounds interested in the potential of decentralized finance and digital scarcity. Why Are the Trump Sons Attending? The attendance of Eric and Donald Trump Jr. is particularly noteworthy given their father’s evolving stance on cryptocurrency. While initially skeptical, former President Trump has recently shown increased openness, even launching NFT collections and accepting crypto donations for his campaign. Their presence at a major Crypto Conference like Bitcoin 2025 can be interpreted in several ways: Political Outreach: It provides an opportunity to connect directly with the passionate and increasingly influential crypto voter base. Signaling Interest: It sends a clear message that the Trump family, and potentially a future administration, is paying attention to the crypto space. Exploring Opportunities: They may be looking to understand the technology and market dynamics better, potentially for personal or business interests. Following the Trend: As crypto becomes more mainstream, engaging with it is becoming a standard part of political and business discourse. Their participation elevates the political profile of the event and highlights how deeply intertwined Bitcoin Politics is becoming with national discourse. Beyond the Trumps: A Diverse Crypto Conference Lineup While the Trump sons’ attendance has captured headlines, the reported speaker lineup for Bitcoin 2025 is diverse and includes figures from various corners of the political and crypto worlds, as noted by Bitcoin Magazine on X. This includes: U.S. Vice President JD Vance: Represents current high-level political engagement with tech and economic issues. Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht: A controversial figure from Bitcoin’s early history, his inclusion sparks debate and highlights discussions around freedom and regulation. Strategy founder Michael Saylor: A prominent corporate Bitcoin advocate and investor. Senator Cynthia Lummis: A well-known pro-Bitcoin voice in the U.S. Senate, active in legislative efforts. This mix of speakers suggests the conference will cover a wide range of topics, from mainstream adoption and investment to regulatory challenges and the philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin. Navigating Bitcoin Politics : What It Means The presence of political figures at events like Bitcoin 2025 is a clear indicator that Bitcoin Politics is no longer a fringe topic. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so does its potential impact on the economy, finance, and individual liberties. This necessitates engagement from policymakers. The benefits of political engagement for the crypto community include: Increased awareness and education among lawmakers. Potential for clearer and more favorable regulatory frameworks. Legitimization of the industry in the eyes of the public. However, challenges also exist: Risk of unfavorable regulation driven by misunderstanding or special interests. Potential for political polarization to impact policy. Navigating complex and sometimes conflicting government perspectives. The discussions at the Las Vegas Conference will likely touch upon these critical issues, offering attendees insight into the potential future landscape. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For those interested in Bitcoin and the broader crypto space, the news about the Bitcoin 2025 conference and its high-profile attendees offers several takeaways: Stay Informed: Follow news related to the conference and the speakers. Understand the different perspectives being discussed. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in conversations online and in your community about the importance of sound crypto policy. Understand the Political Landscape: Learn about where candidates and policymakers stand on crypto issues. Advocate for Clarity: Support efforts to create clear, sensible regulations that foster innovation while protecting consumers. The attendance of figures like the Trump Sons highlights that now is a crucial time for the crypto community to be informed and engaged. Summary: A New Era for the Crypto Conference Scene The announcement that Eric and Donald Trump Jr. will attend Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas is more than just a celebrity appearance; it’s a powerful symbol of cryptocurrency’s increasing relevance in mainstream politics and society. Alongside a diverse lineup of speakers from finance, technology, and government, their presence signals a critical juncture where the future of Bitcoin and crypto may be shaped not just by technological innovation, but by political will and policy decisions. The upcoming Las Vegas Conference promises to be a focal point for these discussions, offering valuable insights into the evolving relationship between digital assets and the corridors of power.

2025-05-26T16:50:00.000Z,"BlackRock nears Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin, tops Strategy and Binance","With over 621,000 BTC under management, BlackRock now sits just below Satoshi Nakamoto as the largest Bitcoin holder. As Bitcoin ( BTC ) quietly slips further into the grip of institutions, one asset manager has gone from newcomer to near-mythical status, now chasing only Bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto . BlackRock ‘s iShares Bitcoin Trust (or simply known by its ticker IBIT) debuted in January 2024 and has rapidly established itself as a dominant institutional vehicle for BTC exposure since then. As of May 26, the trust holds over 621,000 BTC, valued at around $64.5 billion, representing roughly 2.96% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million coins, according to data from BitBo. Bitcoin holdings by BlackRock and others | Source: BitBo However, when factoring in estimates that suggest up to 20% of all Bitcoin may be lost or inaccessible due to forgotten keys or lost wallets, BlackRock’s stake could represent well over 3.5% of the effective circulating supply, bringing it closer to Satoshi Nakamoto’s legendary 1.1 million BTC trove. For comparison, Michael Saylor’s Strategy holds 580,250 BTC, while crypto exchange Binance has 534,471 BTC, per Coinglass. You might also like: Abu Dhabi wealth fund Mubadala invests $408.5M in Bitcoin via BlackRock’s IBIT ETF This pace of accumulation is not merely a statistical footnote, it signals a deeper structural shift in the role of Bitcoin in global portfolios. BlackRock now holds more BTC than longstanding corporate holders such as Strategy or Binance. The trend is evidence that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset or a hedge against fiat, it is increasingly a core allocation in institutional investment strategies. Asymmetric upside In a commentary to crypto.news, MEXC chief operating officer Tracy Jin said the sharp pivot by many corporations integrating BTC into their long-term investment strategies “is fundamentally reshaping Bitcoin’s market dynamics,” adding that “what was once a retail-driven market and highly cyclical asset has become a cornerstone in institutional finance.” “This investor behaviour dynamics highlights that most institutions are less focused on short-term market volatility and have eyes on Bitcoin’s potential asymmetric upside and long-term value proposition.” Tracy Jin The data supports this shift: U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.75 billion in inflows last week as Bitcoin broke past its January all-time high of $109,000. That figure marks more than a 4-fold increase from the $608 million recorded the previous week. With sovereign debt burdens flashing red in economies like the U.S. and Japan, and bond yields climbing to multi-decade highs, traditional safe-haven assets are losing their appeal. As Jin explained, the change “is not a flight from risk — it’s a flight from the old model of risk.” “Bond yields in the U.S. and Japan are surging, sovereign debt burdens are flashing red, and even the last remaining AAA credit badge is gone. For decades, Treasurys were the safe haven during turbulent times. Today, capital is running from them.” Tracy Jin $140,000 by the end of summer The rise of regulated Bitcoin products appears to be encouraging capital allocators, who may be beginning to view BTC less as a speculative fringe asset and more as a potentially neutral, transparent, and increasingly liquid store of value. Unlike previous bull markets, often fueled by retail hype and meme-driven enthusiasm, the current rally seems to be supported by longer-term positioning and more measured institutional inflows. “Institutional momentum tends to be very self-reinforcing, and as more corporations announce Bitcoin allocations, others are incentivized to follow suit to remain competitive. With Bitcoin ETFs recording a $25 billion weekly trading volume and $2.75 billion inflows last week, institutional momentum remains resilient despite the macroeconomic headwinds.” Tracy Jin This institutional wave is not without volatility, however. Analysts caution that while the bullish structure remains intact, Bitcoin must defend key support zones. Jin sees the $94,000 level as a critical downside threshold, while a break above $112,000 could push BTC towards $140,000 by the end of summer. In her view, dips are now seen as “strategic entry points rather than capitulation signs,” a huge contrast to previous cycles. As Bitcoin’s narrative shifts from rebellion to resilience, BlackRock’s growing presence in the market serves as a clear signal that the line between traditional finance and crypto is blurring fast. While Nakamoto’s holdings remain untouched and symbolic, BlackRock’s wallet is very real and getting heavier.

YZi Labs announced the investment on May 26, 2025, prompting a sharp rally in Avalon’s native token, AVL, which traded around $0.27, just below its intraday high of over $0.29 following the news.

2025-05-26T16:38:59.000Z,"Strategy Buys More Bitcoin, Now Holds Nearly 3% of Total Supply","On Monday, Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, confirmed another massive Bitcoin (BTC) purchase, bringing its total holdings to 580,250 BTC. This move continues the company’s bold push into Bitcoin, which has already made it one of the biggest institutional holders of the digital asset. The firm now controls close to 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Strategy Spends Over $40B on Bitcoin in Latest Buy Up Between May 19 and May 23, Strategy raised hundreds of millions of dollars by selling various company stocks. This includes its class A common stock (MSTR), perpetual strike preferred stock (STRK), and Series A perpetual Strife preferred stock (STRF). These combined sales brought in over $427 million in net proceeds, which the company used to fund its latest Bitcoin purchases. These sales helped fund the company’s latest Bitcoin purchases. The Nasdaq-listed firm has spent $40.61 billion to acquire 580,250 BTC. Each coin was purchased at an average price of $69,979, including all fees and expenses. With Bitcoin’s current price rising, the Virginia-based company has a paper profit of around $22.7 billion. Michael Saylor Hints at More Bitcoin Buys Over the weekend, Strategy’s Chairman, Michael Saylor, posted an update to the company’s Bitcoin tracker, teasing another purchase. This came after the company announced plans to raise $2.1 billion from its 10% Series A STRF stock to buy more Bitcoin. It plans to grow its “42/42” plan to raise $84 billion by selling stocks and convertible notes to keep buying Bitcoin through 2027. Meanwhile, Strategy had bought 7,390 BTC for $765 million between May 12 and May 16 at an average price of $103,498 per coin. Market Reactions and Industry Impact Bitcoin’s price has continued to climb despite slightly recovering from $111,000 last week. The flagship crypto is trading at $109,904, up 2.17% during the previous 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite this, Strategy’s stock (MSTR) dropped 7% in pre-market trading. Analysts like Valentin Fournier of BRN warned that rising prices could lead to profit-taking, which might slow Strategy’s aggressive buying pace. Even so, Strategy’s influence is growing. More than 70 companies now hold Bitcoin in their treasuries. Firms such as Tether-backed Twenty One, Metaplanet, KURL, and Semler Scientific are following Strategy’s lead. Likewise, others such as Nakamoto, founded by Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, GD Culture Group, Basel Medical Group, and Brazil’s Méliuz, have revealed plans to follow similar Bitcoin strategies . These companies are looking to build their own Bitcoin treasuries. According to analysts at Bernstein, companies copying Strategy’s Bitcoin plan could add as much as $330 billion to Bitcoin’s total value over the next five years. This shows how much impact big companies can have on the market.

2025-05-26T16:35:00.000Z,"Next Major XRP Rally Could Surpass 2024 Highs, While Unilabs Surges 70% Since Launch","As the crypto markets gain momentum heading into mid-2025, two assets are leading the conversation, but for very different reasons. XRP price movement is edging closer to a breakout that might surpass its 2024 highs, as Unilabs (UNIL) seeks to record a 70% rally since its launch, delivering strong early returns through smart, AI-driven approaches. With over 200 million UNIL tokens sold, the AI-powered crypto asset manager is already recording an exceptional run within the presale market, backed by its four risk funds and a detailed passive income approach for its holders. Secure passive income and utility are a bucket list for many investors, and Unilabs seems to possess both. Let’s find out what makes Ripple and Unilabs top investment options for 2025. XRP Price Looking to Surge By 1,233% According to the latest XRP price analysis by CrediBull Crypto, Ripple has displayed an impulsive structure based on its recent lows that is unmatched by other altcoins. The crypto analyst emphasized that the recent action in the XRP price movement shouldn’t concern investors as Ripple’s strong consolidation within the $2.00 level could be a significant bullish signal. He noted that such a price behavior often sets the stage for massive upward movements. A good example is when Ripple broke out and surged 6X in 2024 after consolidating for several years. To support the analysis, CrediBull draws a parallel to BTC’s historic Wave 3 price surge, when the token surged from $25K to $74K. Source: X The comparison suggests that the recent XRP price consolidation and wave structure on its daily timeframe mirrors that of Bitcoin just before its breakout. Trading at above the $2.42, the XRP price needs to surge by 1,233% to achieve the $32.00 level as suggested by the analyst’s analysis. Unilabs (UNIL): A DeFi Powerhouse On the Rise As Ripple is preparing for its next macro move, Unilabs (UNIL) is already delivering impressive gains in stage two of its presale. Since its launch, Unilabs manages over $30.5M AUM through its AI-optimized platform. Moreover, as the world’s first AI-backed DeFi asset manager, Unilabs offers high-returns, transparency and complete asses to unique trading environments that were reserved for crypto whales only. This has seen Unilabs take huge leaps, leading renowned layer-1 blockchain projects with its impressive gains and growing adoption within the crypto market. Its significant gains can also be attributed to the fact that the platform delivers exceptional returns by providing institutional investment opportunities to retail traders. Built on Ethereum, Unilabs makes use of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to move capital across DeFi protocols, adjusting automatically for yield opportunities, risk factors, and market shifts in real-time. In addition to capital appreciation, Unilabs provides users with the opportunity to earn yield by depositing supported assets into vaults, where AI systems continuously optimize exposure. Similarly, investors can allocate funds to vaults using different strategies, such as higher-yield speculative instruments or stablecoin-based risk-minimized growth. With a stage two price of just $0,0051, the UNIL token is looking for more gains that could see it record a 70% rally since its launch in the next presale stage, while targeting Ripple’s impressive gains. Unilabs’ Impressive Gains Could Mirror XRP Gains Both Ripple and Unilabs represent a broader market shift towards utility and execution. The XRP price is already proving that compliance and institutional readiness can perfectly co-exist with innovation. Likewise, Unilabs is also proving that DeFi doesn’t have to be complex or risky to be effective. Its advanced AI tools, including the market pulse, which explores the market for high-yield opportunities, help in evaluating both on-chain and off-chain data to deliver actionable insights to Unilabs’ fund managers, generating returns to users’ portfolios. Unilabs contracts are also non-custodial, audited, and fully transparent. Unlike the traditional DeFi tools that usually lock user funds, here users can monitor an asset’s performance live while maintaining full control of their capital. With an incoming price rally, Unilabs is already delivering its promise, and investors seem to be noticing.

2025-05-26T16:31:34.000Z,"DEGEN price prediction: Will key support at $0.00395 trigger a 255% rally?","DEGEN is flashing a familiar structure that previously triggered an explosive 300% rally. After a sharp 9.83% impulsive move, price is now correcting into a critical confluence zone, setting the stage for another powerful breakout, provided bulls defend support. After a rise of nearly 10% DEGEN ( Degen ) is currently in a corrective phase, but this is far from bearish. Price is approaching a key level that mirrors a previous fractal which led to a breakout exceeding 300%. This gives traders a high-probability setup to monitor, especially if DEGEN confirms a higher low in the coming sessions. The region around $0.00395 is technically significant and now acts as the decision point for whether the trend continues higher — or breaks down into lower territory. Key technical points Support: $0.00395 — confluence of Point of Control, 0.618 Fibonacci, and daily support Fractal Repetition: Current structure mirrors a past impulse-correction-expansion phase that led to 300%+ gains Structure Breakout: Downtrend has been broken, and DEGEN is now entering what appears to be an expansion zone DEGENUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView The $0.00395 level is the most critical zone on the chart right now. It represents the intersection of three key technical signals: the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, the Point of Control, and a major daily support level. This confluence makes it a prime candidate for a higher low to form. If bulls hold this zone, the path of least resistance favors the upside. Adding to the bullish thesis is the repeating fractal structure. In a previous cycle, DEGEN experienced a nearly identical setup, a strong impulsive candle, consolidation range, then a retracement into the golden pocket before launching into a parabolic rally. The current price behavior suggests a similar expansion may be unfolding. You might also like: Bitcoin vs Strategy stock: which is the better buy? Moreover, DEGEN has broken out of its prior downtrend and likely completed a multi-week accumulation phase. Price is now entering what appears to be the expansion stage, a zone where large moves often begin. This transition, supported by technical confluence and a macro-level higher low, historically precedes strong rallies. What to expect in the coming price action If DEGEN holds above $0.00395, a higher low will be confirmed, validating the area as a potential launchpad. A bullish reaction here could quickly propel price toward the next resistance zone at $0.014, representing more than 255% upside. A breakdown below this key support, however, would invalidate the fractal and likely send price toward the value area low. The next 24–48 hours are pivotal. If bulls step in at this confluence zone, history could repeat itself. With multiple layers of technical alignment and a proven fractal setup, DEGEN appears well-positioned for a breakout, but only if the $0.00395 level remains intact.

2025-05-26T16:30:38.000Z,"Unveiling the Truth: Crypto Analyst View Fuels Hope for Sustained Bitcoin Bullish Momentum","BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Truth: Crypto Analyst View Fuels Hope for Sustained Bitcoin Bullish Momentum Bitcoin has once again captured the attention of the financial world, pushing past previous all-time highs and setting new records. This impressive rally has many investors and analysts wondering about the sustainability of the current trend. While various factors influence Bitcoin’s price action, understanding the underlying market dynamics is crucial. A recent Crypto Analyst View sheds light on a key determinant: the derivatives market. Understanding the Crypto Derivatives Market ‘s Influence The derivatives market, encompassing futures, options, and perpetual swaps, plays a significant role in price discovery and volatility within the cryptocurrency space. It allows traders to speculate on the future price of assets like Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. Here’s why it’s so important: Leverage: Derivatives enable traders to control large positions with relatively small amounts of capital, amplifying potential gains but also losses. High leverage can exacerbate price swings. Sentiment Indicator: The positioning (long vs. short) and funding rates in the derivatives market often reflect prevailing market sentiment. Liquidity and Price Discovery: High trading volume in derivatives contributes to market liquidity and helps establish the asset’s price. Analysts closely monitor metrics like open interest (the total number of outstanding derivative contracts) and funding rates (payments exchanged between long and short positions) to gauge market health and potential future movements. Excessive leverage or heavily skewed positioning can sometimes signal potential reversals or volatility spikes. Bitcoin Analysis : What Jamie Coutts Observed Jamie Coutts, a respected Chief Crypto Analyst at Real Vision, recently shared his insights on X (formerly Twitter) regarding Bitcoin’s recent surge past its previous all-time high. His Bitcoin Analysis focused specifically on the derivatives market, offering a reassuring perspective for those concerned about the rally being built on shaky foundations. Coutts highlighted that, unlike some past rallies, the recent breach of the all-time high was not primarily driven by an excessive buildup of added leverage or heavily one-sided positioning in the derivatives market. This is a critical observation because rallies fueled purely by high leverage can be fragile and prone to sharp corrections if leverage is suddenly unwound (a ‘long squeeze’). His analysis suggests a healthier, perhaps more organic, price movement this time around. By noting the absence of outsized leverage additions, Coutts implies that the buying pressure pushing Bitcoin higher is potentially coming from more sustainable sources, such as spot market demand or institutional interest, rather than just highly leveraged speculative plays in derivatives. Is the BTC Bullish Momentum Sustainable? Given the analyst’s findings regarding the derivatives market, the question naturally arises: is the current BTC Bullish Momentum likely to continue? According to Coutts, the answer leans towards the positive. He explicitly stated that the current bullish trend is ‘likely to continue’ because, in his view, there is ‘still some support.’ This support could manifest in various forms: Market Structure: The way the price has moved, consolidating or finding floors at certain levels after breaking resistance. Underlying Demand: Continued buying interest from various market participants, including retail investors, institutions, or even corporations. Macro Factors: Broader economic conditions or narratives that favor scarce, decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Reduced Selling Pressure: Holders being less inclined to sell at current levels, perhaps anticipating further upside. The combination of a rally not primarily fueled by precarious leverage and the presence of ongoing support suggests a more robust foundation for the current upward trajectory. While market corrections are always possible, this analysis provides a reason to believe the trend has further room to run. What This Crypto Analyst View Means for Investors For investors navigating the current market, this Crypto Analyst View offers valuable perspective. It’s not a guarantee of future price movements, but it provides insights into one crucial market dynamic. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights: Understand Leverage Risks: Recognize that while leverage can amplify gains, it significantly increases risk. Coutts’ analysis highlights the potential fragility of leverage-driven rallies. Focus on Market Structure: Pay attention to how Bitcoin’s price behaves around key support and resistance levels. The presence of ‘support’ noted by Coutts is a technical signal. Diversify Information Sources: While analyst views are helpful, combine them with your own research into on-chain data, macroeconomic trends, and overall market sentiment. Consider Long-Term Potential: An analysis suggesting a healthy rally not solely based on leverage might reinforce a longer-term bullish outlook for those already invested or considering investment. Manage Risk: Regardless of bullish predictions, always employ sound risk management strategies, including setting stop-losses and not investing more than you can afford to lose. This perspective from a seasoned analyst provides a layer of confidence by suggesting that the rally’s foundation might be stronger than some might fear, particularly concerning derivatives market health. Beyond the Bitcoin Price Prediction : Other Factors to Watch While Jamie Coutts’ analysis of the derivatives market is insightful, it’s important to remember that numerous factors influence Bitcoin’s price. A comprehensive understanding requires looking beyond a single data point or prediction. Other significant factors include: Institutional Adoption: Continued investment from large financial institutions and corporations. Regulatory Landscape: Government regulations and policies impacting cryptocurrencies globally. Macroeconomic Environment: Inflation rates, interest rates, and global economic stability. Technological Developments: Upgrades or changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Geopolitical Events: Global events that can drive demand for decentralized assets. A balanced view incorporates insights from various domains to form a more complete picture of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook Rooted in Market Structure Jamie Coutts’ analysis provides a compelling argument for the continuation of Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum. By highlighting that the recent break of the all-time high was not driven by excessive leverage in the derivatives market and that underlying support remains, his Crypto Analyst View offers a reassuring perspective. This suggests the rally may have a more solid foundation than those solely dependent on highly leveraged speculation. While the crypto market is known for its volatility, this particular Bitcoin Analysis from a respected source adds weight to the argument for sustained upward movement, informing the broader Bitcoin price prediction narrative with crucial market structure details.

2025-05-26T16:30:27.000Z,"Japanese firm Remixpoint commits more capital to Bitcoin amid climb to $110k ATH","Remixpoint, an energy consulting firm in Japan, has approved 1 billion Yen ($7 million) to purchase more Bitcoins. The Japanese firm disclosed this in its latest regulatory filing. According to the filing , Remixpoint has committed 12 billion yen, approximately $84 million, to crypto purchases since it decided to add crypto assets to its treasury. So far, the company has spent 10.5 billion Yen on acquiring cryptocurrencies. While it has now allocated more funds for Bitcoin, the announcement did not specify when Remixpoint will acquire the additional BTC, only noting that it would consider market conditions. It said: “The additional purchase of crypto assets this time will be Bitcoin, and the total purchase amount is expected to be 1 billion yen. The timing of the purchase will be determined based on market conditions.” Given that BTC is currently in the middle of a price rebound that has seen it gain 2% in the last 24 hours and rise to $109,000, the firm would likely plan for when there is a cooldown and drop in price so as not to buy at the top. Following the announcement, the firm’s shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange increased by more than 5%, signaling the market’s positive reception to the development. Remixpoint made its last Bitcoin acquisition on May 15, when it spent 500 million Yen, around $3.5 million, to purchase 32.83 BTC at an average price of over $104,000. Remixpoint doubles down on crypto efforts Meanwhile, Remixpoint announced that this additional purchase of Bitcoin is based on its board of directors’ resolution. Thus, it is separate from the 4.42 billion yen it plans to invest in Bitcoin from the proceeds of its 24th stock acquisition rights issuance. This clarification concerns the May 19 notice, where the firm stated its plan to raise 5.5 billion Yen by selling 125,000 units of its stock. While it allocated most of the proceeds to Bitcoin purchases, the rest was meant for Web3-related investments between August 2025 and April 2026. The firm’s clarification shows how it plans to increase its Bitcoin purchase this year using funds from multiple sources. Remixpoint started investing in BTC in September 2024 as part of its cash-management strategy. Unlike other companies, Remixpoint’s acquisition strategy is not limited to BTC, with the company also investing in Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and other crypto. Following its last Bitcoin purchase, the firm now holds 648.82 Bitcoin and other digital assets Interestingly, the company, which has been around since 2004 and currently focuses on the energy and automotive industry, is looking to dive further into the crypto industry. It recently announced that it would launch a crypto staking and validator business in partnership with Omakase. Under the deal, Omakase will provide technical support, operational monitoring, and risk management services. Remixpoint has experience with the crypto business, given that it owned the crypto exchange BITPoint before selling it to securities firm SBI in 2023. While it remains bullish on crypto, the volatility of the assets has also affected it. The company reported a net loss of 593 million Yen ($4.1 million) for its last fiscal year ending March 2025. It noted that the decline in the valuation of crypto assets within the first quarter of 2025 contributed to this loss. More Japanese companies embrace Bitcoin Meanwhile, Remixpoint is part of a small group of Japanese firms that are acquiring Bitcoin. Since Metaplanet adopted the strategy earlier last year, other companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange listed companies have also done the same. Companies such as logistics firm Value Creation and gaming firms Enish, Gumi, and NEXON have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheet. Metaplanet remains the biggest with over 5,555 BTC and is focused on reaching 10,000 BTC by the end of this year. Nevertheless, the moves in Japan are not happening in isolation and highlight a broader and global trend for corporate institutions. Since Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) pioneered the idea, several other companies have been replicating it, leading to over 90 companies with corporate Bitcoin treasuries.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor ( TAO ) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers. That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker. DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: Cointelegraph Miglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund. “The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor , a decentralized, open-source machine learning network. Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said. A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: Taostats Related: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI ‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’ Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said. It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.” While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society. The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and Development DNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.” The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel , told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.

Avalon Labs had a vertical rally, reaching a one-month peak above $30. | Source: Coinmarketcap AVL tokens have been trading since February when the airdrop was completed. Currently, only 16.6% of AVL tokens are unlocked, with multiple new token releases expected in the coming months. Around 161M AVL are in circulation out of the total supply of 1B tokens. AVL still depends mostly on PancakeSwap and other DEX. The involvement of Yzi Labs suggests AVL may gain more attention as part of the Binance ecosystem. AVL is an Ethereum-based token and will be an improbable selection for Binance Alpha, but the involvement of Yzi Labs may lead to more listings and support for AVL. Avalon Labs taps Bitcoin DeFi trend Avalon Labs is part of the Bitcoin DeFi trend, offering on-chain trading and lending with BTC as collateral. Avalon’s trading product is fully on-chain, transparent, and accessible to anyone. Avalon Labs already locks in $1.22B , down from over $2B in January. So far, the protocol carries $46.91 in collateralized loans. Despite the recent BTC rally, Avalon Labs operates at a smaller scale compared to Babylon Labs. As with other protocols, the value locked sometimes decreases with the end of the airdrop program. Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem has grown its value locked to $6.69B, led by Babylon Labs. Of that amount, $5.4B is staked with Babylon. However, smaller platforms are accruing their own collaterals. Yzi Labs resumes investments Avalon Labs is the first project to receive backing from Yzi Labs since April 30. For the past three months, the platform only backed five hand-picked projects. Yzi Labs focused on rounds between $3M and $10M. ‘ At YZi Labs, we back projects with strong fundamentals that have the potential to revolutionize industries and create long-term impact ,’ said Alex Odagiu , investment director at YZi Labs. Avalon Labs aims to become the largest issuer of stablecoins backed by BTC, unlocking the underlying value of the leading coin.

But while Ethereum’s momentum signals strength, another coin is capturing attention for a different reason: utility. Meet Unilabs, a new AI-powered DeFi project that is offering far more than hype, unlike Dogecoin. It seeks to build an ecosystem where users are incentivized for their hard work and have access to the best crypto investment opportunities. Ethereum predicted to rise to $10,000 The Ethereum price ( ETH ) has been on an uptrend since the beginning of May. Its value is up 49.2% in gains. On the lower timeframes, the Ethereum price has increased by 12.5% on the biweekly level. Interestingly, there has been a massive increase in whale activity in the past month. Crypto Rover notes that BlackRock is one of the top giants that has been accumulating ETH. Looking ahead, the analyst notes that Ethereum might have a hard time soaring to $4,000. However, Crypto Rover said the Ethereum price could easily surge to $10,000 afterward. Ted notes that the Ethereum price chart is a replica of Bitcoin from 2021. Currently, the altcoin price is consolidating inside an asymmetrical triangle and may soon head higher. If this happens, ETH might rise to $10,000 before the end of the year. Dogecoin skyrockets as memecoins wake up Dogecoin’s price ( DOGE ) is showing positive signs on both the weekly and monthly charts. CoinMarketCap data shows its value has jumped by 34.4% on the 2W chart. The memecoin is currently one of the top performers in the market and could see more upside if bulls hold their ground. In the meantime, technical indicators point toward a continued rally. The Hull Moving Average (9) and VWMA (10) indicators flash buy signals which shows that bulls have the upper hand. Also, the relative strength index remains above the midline, supporting a Dogecoin price surge. Badger0102 predicts that over the next few weeks, Dogecoin could jump to $0.47. Another expert, Gnarleyjquinn notes that the memecoin is about to make a big move. He posted a chart that showed the Dogecoin price soaring to $0.60. Another analyst called Rose Premium Signals posted a similar Dogecoin price prediction. They say the value of DOGE could soar to $0.61.

2025-05-26T16:09:32.000Z,"Bitcoin Ethereum and XRP Price Prediction For This Week: Is Another Rally Coming?","The post Bitcoin Ethereum and XRP Price Prediction For This Week: Is Another Rally Coming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) are displaying healthy signs of stabilization at the start of the week following the volatility seen on May 23rd. The reason for the volatility caused by Donald Trump’s Truth Social post that highlighted his decision to impose 50% tariffs on the European Union . This sent a chill across the sector. But, to this negative news, market adapted, instead of falling like in Q1, shows the strength in Q2. In the final week of Q2’s second month, the BTC price is consolidating after hitting a new all-time high, while ETH and XRP are holding near key support levels, suggesting bullish forces may still have a chance to reclaim control. Source: Santiment When writing, Bitcoin is exchanging hands at $109868 on May 26th, recovered 2.6% from May 23rd’s low of $107278, Ethereum is at $2569, recovered 3.6% from $2525, and XRP is at $2.34, recovered 3.2% from $2.29. While the gains are still minimal, it is still reflects optimism. As the market is not collapsing like in Q1, despite the Trump’s threat. Bitcoin Price (BTC) Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high and declined the next day. However, it found support and recovered slightly the next day. If it continues to recover, and continues to recover and closes above its ATH, it could extend the rally toward a key psychological level of $120,000 . However, if BTC faces a pullback and closes below the current swing low around $107K, it could fall to retest its next key support at $100,000. Ethereum Price (ETH) Ethereum price faced rejection from a strong supply level that aligns with early Q1’s high volume profile level. But, ETH price retested and found dynamic support around its 200-day EMA band at around $2,447.82. If the 200-day EMA at $2,447 holds the fall, ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its daily resistance at $2,728. On the other hand, if ETH crypto breaks and closes below the 200-day EMA at $2,447.82, it could extend the decline to reach its next support at $2,000.23. XRP Price (XRP) When the XRP price shattered, it took support at the dynamic 50-day EMA band, and now it is trading between the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands. The XRP price is in strong consolidation, If the 50-day EMA continues to hold, the XRP price could extend the recovery to retest its daily resistance at $2.6607. However, if XRP crypto price breaks and closes below its 50-day support or the current swing, it could fall to $2.06 in May’s final week. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-26T16:04:12.000Z,"Bitcoin price could hit $140k as institutional interest rises: MEXC COO","Macroeconomic uncertainty is causing institutions to rethink their positions, which is leading many to Bitcoin, says Tracy Jin. The increasingly turbulent macroeconomic environment is making companies rethink their investment strategies. However, this may be good for Bitcoin (BTC) , as institutions flee from traditional types of assets. Tracy Jin, COO of the MEXC exchange, told crypto.news that increased institutional interest can potentially push Bitcoin’s price to $140,000. Jin noted that many corporations have pivoted sharply toward integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios. In particular, institutional capital is moving away from U.S. Treasurys, which no longer carry the safe-haven status they once held. “Importantly, this is not a flight from risk — it’s a flight from the old model of risk. Bond yields in the U.S. and Japan are surging, sovereign debt burdens are flashing red, and even the last remaining AAA credit badge is gone. For decades, Treasurys were the safe haven during turbulent times. Today, capital is running from them. Japanese institutions are rethinking their exposure to U.S. bonds, while American investors are watching political tensions creep into Fed policy decisions,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. The flight from bonds was partially due to Moody’s cutting the U.S. credit rating, losing its perfect score. Escalating government debt, trade policy, and pressures are hurting the U.S. dollar’s appeal, especially among investors abroad. You might also like: Bitcoin vs Strategy stock: which is the better buy? Bitcoin’s price could reach $140,000: Jin In response, Bitcoin ETFs have seen inflows totaling $2.75 billion, much of it driven by institutional demand. If the current uncertainty persists, more investors may increase their Bitcoin exposure. In that case, Jin believes BTC could reach $140,000 as early as this summer. “If corporate finance and institutional momentum persist, Bitcoin is expected to break the $109,500 and $111,000—$112,000 resistance range in the coming weeks and head towards the $140,000 range towards the end of summer.,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. Still, Jin acknowledged that if macro uncertainty weighs too heavily on corporate demand, Bitcoin’s upside could falter. The $100,000 level remains a strong support, and BTC retains its bullish structure unless it breaks below $94,000.

2025-05-26T16:04:09.000Z,"CryptoQuant Analyst Announces Record Prediction for Bitcoin in 16 Days! \""But, First Rally, Then Fall!\""","While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin broke new records last week, the market generally expects BTC to continue its rise. Bitcoin experienced a brief decline last Friday after US President Donald Trump proposed 50% tariffs on the EU starting June 1, but today it surpassed $110,000 again during the day. Related News: Trump Wind in Bitcoin (BTC), Etheruem (ETH) and Altcoins: The New Week Started with an Uptrend! At this point, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr., in his post from the X account, predicted that Bitcoin could reach $162,000 on June 11 with its current growth rate. While the analyst reached his $162,000 estimate for June 11 based on some technical data, he first touched on the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio of short-term Bitcoin holders. Stating that the NUPL ratio is currently at 27 percent, the analyst said that when this ratio exceeds 40 percent, investors tend to sell and selling pressure will begin. “The NUPL ratio is currently 27 percent. According to data from the past 4 years, when this indicator exceeded 40 percent, short-term investors started selling BTC. This created strong price pressure.” At this point, the analyst predicted a new ATH of $162,000 in BTC, noting that given the current bullish trend in NUPL, the rate is expected to reach 40% on June 11. “1. Current NUPL: 27% 2. Critical threshold: 40% (historically, traders start taking profits here, applying downward pressure.) 3. Time to reach threshold: 13 pp / 0.818 pp/day ≈ 16 days 4. Estimated date: June 11, 2025 5. Bitcoin price prediction: $162k.” The analyst finally reminded that historically, when NUPL exceeds 40 percent, profit-taking begins. Stating that with the current growth rate of about 0.82 percent per day, he expects Bitcoin to reach the 40 percent threshold on June 11, the analyst said, “This will correspond to a BTC price of about $ 162,000. Selling pressure begins after $ 162,000.” The current unrealized profit indicator for Short-Term Holders holding coins for 1 to 3 months is 27%. Over the past 4 years, when this metric rose above 40%, the cohort began selling coins – this created strong price pressure. 1.

A technical chart shared by Brandt shows a bullish “cup and handle” pattern for Solana. The post fuels speculation on Brandt’s leanings as community sentiment splits. Veteran trader Peter Brandt recently asked his followers on X where to invest $100,000: Solana (SOL) or XRP. He ruled out all other assets and requested clear, concise reasoning and reactions from the crypto community. The Clear Case for XRP Brandt posted a chart of XRP/USD, highlighting what appears to be a breakout from a multi-year symmetrical triangle pattern.

As of this press time, XRP’s price stood at $2.35, a 1.8% surge in the past day. It needs a surge of 88% to attain Brandt’s $4.43 price forecast.

2025-05-26T16:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Profits Climbing – Data Hints At Incoming Sell Pressure","Bitcoin is holding strong above the $108,000 level and continues to push toward a breakout above its all-time high near $112,000. Price action remains firmly bullish, with little to no signs of weakness as buyers maintain control across major timeframes. After weeks of consolidation and steady gains, BTC now appears poised for a potential move into uncharted territory. Supporting this bullish momentum, on-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals that the unrealized profit indicator for Short-Term Holders—those holding coins for 1 to 3 months—currently sits at 27%. This metric helps gauge how much profit short-term investors are sitting on, and historically, it has provided key signals during major market moves. Over the past four years, when this indicator surpassed 40%, it often triggered a wave of selling from this cohort, leading to increased downward pressure on the BTC price. With the metric still well below that critical threshold, the market may have room to climb before short-term holders begin locking in profits at scale. Bitcoin Enters Pivotal Week As Analysts Eye Breakout Toward $120K Bitcoin is heading into a crucial week as price action hovers near all-time highs and analysts forecast a breakout that could send BTC soaring to $120,000. After weeks of steady gains and bullish consolidation above the $108,000 level, momentum is building. The market is increasingly confident that a clean push above the $112K resistance could unlock the next leg of the cycle. This comes as global markets face heightened uncertainty. With persistent macroeconomic instability, rising geopolitical tensions, and diverging monetary policy expectations, Bitcoin appears to be thriving in volatility. Its non-sovereign, digital nature continues to attract capital during times of financial stress, acting as both a hedge and a high-beta growth asset. Top analyst Axel Adler shared compelling on-chain data highlighting where the market currently stands. According to CryptoQuant, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for Short-Term Holders is now at 27%. Historically, this cohort begins taking profits once the metric crosses 40%, often triggering sell pressure and temporary tops. Adler’s forecast assumes a steady increase of 0.818 percentage points per day, putting the 40% threshold roughly 16 days away—on or around June 11, 2025. At that point, BTC could be trading near $162,000 if the trend continues uninterrupted. He cautions that the forecast is based on linear extrapolation and does not account for potential market shocks, “black swan” events, or political headlines, such as a sudden policy shift or viral tweet from US President Donald Trump. Bulls Defend Post-Breakout Levels Bitcoin is trading at $109,844 and holding strong above the key breakout zone after reaching a new all-time high near $112,000. The daily chart shows BTC maintaining a bullish structure, with price well above the 34 EMA ($101,469) and all major moving averages. The $103,600 level, marked in yellow, served as a long-term resistance earlier in the cycle and has now flipped into support—a textbook breakout-retest structure. Volume has remained relatively steady during this consolidation, and the recent candles suggest healthy digestion of gains rather than exhaustion. BTC continues to print higher lows, signaling that buyers are stepping in on each pullback. As long as the price remains above the $103K–$105K region, the broader trend remains intact. The next critical resistance lies just above $112,000. A daily close above this level would likely confirm continuation and open the door to the $120,000–$125,000 range. Momentum is still on the bulls’ side, and the structure points to a market preparing for further upside.

2025-05-26T15:50:40.000Z,"The full breakdown of James Wynn’s $1B Bitcoin positions — and how it all fell apart","What happens when Bitcoin doesn’t follow the script, and a trader like James Wynn is already deep into a leveraged bet he can’t easily escape? Table of Contents James Wynn Bitcoin trade spirals into a $60M wipeout What makes James Wynn trader different from the average degen How does leverage trading work? James Wynn Bitcoin trade spirals into a $60M wipeout James Wynn, a well-known high-leverage crypto trader, recently experienced one of the steepest losses of his career. Over the span of seven days, he lost more than $60 million through a series of high-leverage Bitcoin ( BTC ) trades on Hyperliquid ( HYPE ). The sequence began on May 19, when Wynn opened a 40x long position of 5,520 BTC at $103,302, placing his liquidation level at $98,294. On the following day, he expanded the position to 7,764 BTC, raising the notional value to $830 million. His new average entry moved to $105,033, narrowing the buffer between market price and liquidation, now set at $100,330. May 21 saw him increase exposure further to 9,371.71 BTC, pushing the position above the $1 billion threshold. At that point, the trade was in profit, showing unrealized gains of $10.71 million with an average entry of $108,005. Later that day, Wynn closed 2,139 BTC, securing $11.92 million in realized profit and leaving 5,203 BTC still active, valued at $554.6 million. He followed up with a fresh long on May 22, entering 10,200 BTC at $108,065. As Bitcoin touched $111,900, unrealized gains peaked at $39 million. Momentum reversed quickly. On May 23, a 4% drop brought Bitcoin down to $106,700 following President Trump’s announcement of a 50% tariff on European Union imports. Wynn responded by closing a separate Pepecoin ( PEPE ) position on May 24 with a $25.18 million gain. He then raised his Bitcoin long to 11,588 BTC at $108,243, placing his new liquidation level at $105,180. That decision proved costly. On May 25, he exited at $107,746, booking a $13.39 million loss. That same morning, he shifted to a short strategy. On May 25, Wynn scaled his Bitcoin short to 7,967.83 BTC, valued at $856 million, with a liquidation price set at $111,280. JUST IN: James Wynn increases short position on BTC to 7,967.83 BTC ($856 million) at $107,057; liquidation price set at $111,280. pic.twitter.com/ljX0yeGHHv — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) May 25, 2025 He later exited over $1 billion worth of BTC short positions on May 26, recording a loss of approximately $15.87 million over a 15-hour span. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1926794028533551106 He also closed his Ethereum ( ETH ) and Sui ( SUI ) longs during the week, taking an additional $5.3 million in losses. The total drawdown over seven days reached $60 million. Wynn acknowledged the setback in a post on May 26, noting that despite the losses, his account still held $25 million in profit from an original base of $3–4 million. The figure marked a sharp drop from his earlier peak of $87 million. What makes James Wynn trader different from the average degen Wynn began gaining traction in the crypto trading world in 2022, during the final phase of the previous bull market. His early entry into the space was reportedly funded by Alameda Research, a firm known at the time for backing emerging crypto traders. That year, he invested $7,000 into the memecoin PEPE when its market cap was just $600,000. As the token’s valuation rose to $4.2 million, Wynn employed high-frequency trading methods to eventually turn his position into $25 million. In March 2025, Wynn began trading on Hyperliquid, starting with a deposit of $4.65 million in USD Coin ( USDC ). Over the following two months, he executed 38 trades on the platform, focusing primarily on Bitcoin and memecoins such as PEPE, Official Trump ( TRUMP ), and Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ). Reports show that as of May 10, Wynn had accumulated $46.5 million in profits from his Hyperliquid trades. His strategy blends high leverage with fast execution and a sensitivity to market sentiment. He typically operates with leverage ranging from 5x to 40x, building positions in fast-moving tokens that exhibit strong momentum. Size is another defining aspect of his method. Trades often carry notional values in the millions, creating significant exposure but also increasing vulnerability. Liquidation thresholds tend to fall within a narrow 2–3% range below the entry price, meaning a minor market drop can result in massive losses within minutes. Wynn also integrates social media into his trading playbook. He regularly shares his positions and real-time updates on X, using transparency to build credibility and influence market psychology. That presence can amplify trends already in motion, adding another layer to his strategy. How does leverage trading work? High-leverage trading allows crypto traders to amplify their positions well beyond their actual capital, creating the possibility of large gains but also sharp, fast losses. Platforms like Hyperliquid, Binance Futures, Bitget, and Bybit, traders provide leverage levels ranging from 5x to 100x, depending on the asset and exchange policies. These tools offer flexibility and capital efficiency, but they also introduce a narrow margin for error that can result in forced liquidations within minutes. The concept of leverage is straightforward. A trader using 10x leverage can open a $10,000 position with only $1,000 in actual capital. The remaining $9,000 is essentially borrowed from the exchange. If the asset’s price rises by 1%, the position gains $100, which is a 10% return on the initial margin. However, the reverse is equally true. A 1% price drop results in a $100 loss, wiping out 10% of the trader’s capital. The critical point is that a 10% move in the wrong direction fully erodes the initial margin, triggering liquidation. With 20x leverage, only a 5% drop is required to wipe out the position. At 50x, the liquidation threshold tightens to around 2%. And at 100x, even a 1% move against the position is enough to result in a complete loss. To better understand how this plays out, consider a scenario. A trader opens a long position of $100,000 on Bitcoin at $50,000 using 20x leverage. They contribute $5,000 in margin. If Bitcoin drops to $47,500, a 5% decline, the trader’s margin is entirely consumed, and the exchange liquidates the position. Exchanges often apply additional buffers, known as maintenance margins, which may trigger liquidation slightly before the full margin is lost to ensure system solvency and protect insurance funds. Most traders using high leverage rely on short-term strategies such as breakout momentum, news-based reactions, or high-volatility scalping. Entry timing is crucial, and exits are often planned with stop-losses or trailing orders. Funding rates — periodic payments between long and short positions on perpetual contracts, also influence decision-making. A positive funding rate means long traders pay shorts, and vice versa. Some traders incorporate these rates into their strategy to earn yield on sideways markets, though this often requires tight trade management and substantial volume. For retail participants, the key lies in understanding these numbers, using margin calculators, and applying strict controls on position size. Tools like liquidation heatmaps and volatility indicators can help assess entry risk, but they cannot eliminate the core exposure that leverage brings. When used cautiously, leverage can support capital-efficient strategies or hedging. When applied without a well-defined risk framework, it becomes a fast track to liquidation. As always, trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

2025-05-26T15:50:06.000Z,"Best Meme Coins to Buy - Dogecoin Price Prediction As Whale Accumulation Rises","Altcoins might be gearing up for their next big move, but meme coins haven’t been sitting quietly in the corner either. Dogecoin, in particular, is showing strong signs that something bigger may be on the horizon. Large holders have been steadily scooping up DOGE, and the price action over the past day suggests that this accumulation phase might be nearing its payoff. With fresh resistance levels now in the rearview mirror and volume pouring in, Dogecoin is starting to look like it’s getting ready for a run. It’s been here before—building quietly, then sprinting. And this time, the setup feels familiar. Whether you're already in or still on the fence, it’s worth watching closely. The conditions are lining up. Dogecoin Predictions - Whales Load Up on DOGE as Price Breaks Through Key Resistance Dogecoin didn’t just climb a few cents—it moved with intent. Over the last few days, the price has risen considerably, crossing above the $0.22 mark. That alone would’ve been worth noting, but the volume behind it is what really matters. More than 300 million DOGE was traded in back-to-back hours, and that’s not noise—that’s weight. This push wasn’t a one-off. The structure of the chart has been tightening, showing higher lows and steady attempts at breaking through resistance. Support is now firm at $0.225, and the market didn’t hesitate to hold that level during the retest. Each time the price slipped slightly, it was bought right back up. Behind the scenes, whales have been busy. Over a billion DOGE has been picked up by large wallets in just the past month. That kind of behavior doesn’t happen out of boredom. It’s usually a signal that something’s expected—whether that’s a macro shift, an upcoming narrative push, or simply a bet on sentiment returning to meme coins. And then there’s the timing. With markets still shaky from global uncertainty and investors looking for less conventional bets, DOGE has started to attract fresh eyes. It’s showing signs of a bull flag forming—a pattern that often precedes a larger leg up. Some traders are already throwing around price targets north of $0.60 if momentum holds. #Dogecoin Explosive Price Projection💥 $DOGE has been moving nicely within this uptrend structure, fueled by long lasting bull flag channels.The first flag yielded a +90% return, the second +215%, and the third +440%💹This forth flag could potentially take the price of $DOGE … pic.twitter.com/kiomHgwgHR — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 23, 2025 In real-time, the coin chipped away at the $0.230 barrier multiple times before cracking it with close to 10 million DOGE traded in just a few minutes. It didn’t stall—it surged, briefly—and that tells you the interest is there. Not speculative FOMO, but calculated accumulation. Dogecoin isn’t running on hype this time. It’s moving with buildup, and if this continues, the next leg up might come faster than most expect. This makes it an excellent time to accumulate and create strong positions in other projects with upside potential too—a move that could end up paying off in the coming weeks. Best Meme Coins to Buy Next MIND of Pepe If Dogecoin’s recent accumulation is any indication, meme coins that offer more than just a joke are beginning to separate themselves from the crowd. MIND of Pepe is a solid example of that shift. Rather than using nostalgia or meme culture alone as its selling point, this project leans into utility by deploying AI as a real product layer. MIND of Pepe introduces an AI-driven agent that actively monitors crypto discussions across social media, analyzes sentiment, and presents that data to investors in a simplified form. This AI agent has its own personality, posts on X, and engages with community discussions in real time. That presence isn’t just for show—it provides signals that holders can use to understand which tokens are trending, why they’re moving, and whether the sentiment is building or fading. For traders who rely on narratives, this tool can provide an edge. A 100x crypto is what the crypto education company 99Bitcoins claimed MIND of Pepe could be in one of their dedicated videos on YouTube. The current wave of Dogecoin accumulation shows that sentiment-based bets can gain traction very quickly when conditions are right. In that context, a token that exists to track and interpret sentiment has very real upside potential. MIND of Pepe doesn’t try to be a Dogecoin competitor. It aims to be an intelligence layer for traders navigating meme cycles. With DOGE heating up, that kind of utility might soon shift from niche to necessary. Pepe Priced at $0.00001397, Pepe has had a relatively quiet few weeks after its earlier spike in 2023, but silence doesn’t always mean stagnation. Sometimes, it means loading. And with Dogecoin breaking through resistance and dragging renewed attention back toward top-tier meme tokens, Pepe may find itself back in focus. Pepe doesn’t complicate its pitch. It’s a cultural meme turned tradable token—one that succeeded in getting listed on top exchanges and building a loyal community almost overnight. It proved early on that momentum alone could carry a project far, but sustaining that interest is another challenge altogether. That’s where current market conditions help. With investors looking to rotate into assets that have a history of strong performance and viral appeal, Pepe’s familiarity works in its favor. There’s no AI here, no utility pitch layered on top—but that may be the point. As Dogecoin shows, sometimes meme coins don’t need complex fundamentals to move. They need attention, timing, and volume. Pepe has checked those boxes before and could do so again as meme narratives gain traction. The token sits in a zone where accumulation doesn’t require much capital, but the returns—if history repeats—can be outsized. In short, the market may be nearing another phase where raw meme power resurfaces. Pepe, being one of the most recognized in that category, could find itself rising faster than most anticipate. BTC Bull Dogecoin has always represented a kind of rebellion against traditional finance, and BTC Bull takes that spirit and redirects it toward a very specific goal: pushing Bitcoin adoption through the power of meme coins. But this isn’t just another meme riding on aesthetics. BTC Bull is structured to reward those who actively support Bitcoin’s mission. The project introduces a unique incentive model where users are rewarded with Bitcoin itself through a staking system built around the BTCBULL token. Unlike most meme projects that stop at branding, BTC Bull ties its identity to a larger movement. That focus has helped it gain credibility among those who want to participate in meme culture without detaching from Bitcoin’s long-term thesis. The contract has been audited, the presale is live, and users are already earning staking rewards. But what’s more interesting is the design philosophy. This isn’t a coin that’s trying to mimic Dogecoin’s randomness. It’s aligning itself with the Bitcoin ethos while using meme coin virality as the gateway. That combination could be especially effective now, given the shift toward high-volume speculative assets and the growing interest in Bitcoin-aligned projects. As DOGE’s price continues to signal accumulation, investors looking to diversify within the meme space may gravitate toward projects that echo its values but build something more specific. BTC Bull fits that bill, offering upside potential without straying far from the crypto mainstream. Solaxy With Dogecoin pushing higher and large holders showing renewed interest in speculative yet narrative-driven assets, Solaxy presents an interesting case. While not a meme coin in the traditional sense, it taps into the same investor psychology: low entry cost, bold vision, and the potential to ride larger ecosystems—in this case, both Solana and Ethereum. Solaxy is a Layer 2 chain that enables seamless interaction between Solana and Ethereum-based assets. It offers staking on both chains and has already generated interest for its high APY and low-fee infrastructure. For investors watching the meme coin rally unfold, Solaxy offers exposure to the infrastructure side of the story rather than the tokens themselves. $SOLX is breaking new barriers! 🛸40M Raised! 🔥🚀 pic.twitter.com/tk6mwT5hH1 — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 24, 2025 When meme projects attract large inflows, the chains they run on often see secondary demand. Having raised over $40 million already, Solaxy positions itself at that intersection, building a scalable solution with direct utility for traders, stakers, and future dApps. Its presence on both Ethereum and Solana also acts as a bridge for liquidity—one that could become increasingly valuable if the meme coin sector gets hotter. In the context of Dogecoin's current move, Solaxy offers a different kind of speculative play: not the meme, but the rails. The more attention DOGE gets, the more crowded the markets become, and the more value there is in holding projects that benefit from broader user activity. For those looking to get ahead of that infrastructure demand, Solaxy may deserve a closer look. SUBBD As Dogecoin shows signs of awakening again, the broader meme coin space is back on investor radars—but not all projects rely on memes alone to justify their existence. SUBBD leans on a very different narrative: the monetization of content and the decentralization of the creator economy. Whether you're a YouTuber, podcaster, or niche content producer, SUBBD provides tools to launch memberships, paywalled content, tipping systems, and more—all driven by blockchain rails. This isn’t a copy-paste meme token with a new mascot. It addresses a real problem in Web2: creators being underpaid and overcontrolled by platforms that gatekeep monetization. SUBBD flips that model. With its token ecosystem, it rewards both creators and supporters, making the relationship financially symbiotic. While Dogecoin gains traction through cultural appeal, SUBBD is attracting attention for its model. And in the current market, where attention is currency, projects that tie utility to actual user behavior have room to run. The meme coin wave might be about memes today, but it’s clear that tokens offering real-world use cases could benefit from the same speculative interest. If Dogecoin rallies and the appetite for low-cap, high-utility projects rises alongside it, SUBBD sits in a position where traction can build quickly—especially among creators looking to exit the platform trap. It's not just a meme bet. It's a product bet, and the timing might be just right. Conclusion With altcoins showing fresh signs of momentum, it may not be long before meme coins follow suit. The recent accumulation in Dogecoin suggests that market participants are beginning to rotate capital back into speculative assets—often a signal that sentiment is warming up across the board. While the window is still early, that’s often when positioning matters most. Meme coins tend to move quickly once they catch fire, and given the technical strength and volume building up in select tokens, this could be a smart time to start identifying quality entries.

2025-05-26T15:45:57.000Z,"Bitcoin hovers near $110K as bulls eye $125K, JUP, VIRTUAL, FET lead daily gains","After a weekend cooldown following its record-breaking surge, Bitcoin rebounded on Monday, bouncing cleanly off the $109,000 level as bulls re-entered the market. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap edged 2% higher to $ 3.45 trillion, supported by steady inflows across major assets. Sentiment moderated slightly, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index dipping to 73, retreating from “extreme greed” yet holding firm in “greed” territory, reflecting the resilient bullish undertone across the market. Why is Bitcoin going up? Although Bitcoin faced some profit-taking pressure after hitting an all-time high of $111,800 last Thursday, macroeconomic developments quickly revived upward momentum. On May 25, Bitcoin reclaimed the $109,000 level after US President Donald Trump announced a delay in the implementation of tariffs on European Union goods. The move, which followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, eased investor concerns about an imminent escalation in trade tensions. Trump’s earlier threats of a 50% tariff had weighed on risk assets, briefly sending Bitcoin below $108,000. But with the tariff deadline pushed to July 9, markets breathed a sigh of relief. BTC responded swiftly, rising as much as 3.2% to an intraday high of $110,100 on May 26 from a low of $106,660 the previous day. Market participants said the extension restored confidence in the broader uptrend. Adding fuel to the recovery were growing concerns around Japan’s bond market, where long-term yields surged to record levels. Bitwise’s head of European research, André Dragosch, noted that instability in Japan’s sovereign debt market was prompting some TradFi participants to rotate into Bitcoin as a hedge against sovereign risk and potential default scenarios. The yield on 30-year Japanese government bonds spiked to 3.185% on May 20, an all-time high, before easing slightly. Rising yields often signal market stress and fiscal sustainability concerns, further positioning Bitcoin as a non-correlated, counterparty-free asset during global uncertainty. What’s next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin has now entered a fresh price zone after tagging the $111,800 mark, and while a brief pullback followed, technical indicators suggest the uptrend remains intact. Many analysts on X argued that the retracement toward $106,500 appears orderly, with that zone now acting as strong support, reinforced by the 0.618 Fibonacci level and a cluster of moving averages. This structure fits a classic higher low formation, a bullish continuation signal that could set the stage for another leg upward. Since the swing low at $91,500, Bitcoin has consistently formed higher highs and higher lows, a textbook sign of trend strength. BTC’s close above $109,000 on May 25 marked the seventh consecutive green weekly candle. If the current trend holds, Bitcoin could log an eighth by June 1. Historically, such patterns have led to sustained rallies over the following six to 12 months. “Since 2014, an eight-week streak of green weekly closes has occurred only three times,” noted analyst Carpe Noctom on X. “While the market has historically pulled back the week after, it has always been positive six months and one year later.” Key downside levels to watch include $106,500 as immediate support, followed by $102,500, an area that previously acted as a floor between May 9 and May 19. The psychological $100,000 mark also remains an important pivot should broader markets retrace. Traders also remain focused on whether Bitcoin can maintain momentum above prior highs. According to Micky Bull, Bitcoin needs to close above its January high of $109,000.

Investors have again shown keen interest in cryptocurrencies and investment vehicles tracking the sector. Last week's stellar Bitcoin and crypto price performance attracted massive inflows into digital asset investment products and extended their positive streak.Specifically, a CoinShares Monday report shows that the crypto products globally recorded a net inflow of $3.3 billion the previous week. This ensured a six-week consecutive inflow, bringing the total inflow to $10.8 billion year-to-date and a record $187.5 billion in assets under management (AUM). Crypto Investment Weekly Flows Crypto Investment Weekly Flows Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap grew 6% in the previous week to $3.5 trillion, driven by an altcoin resurgence and Bitcoin’s rally to price discovery. The pioneering cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, extending recent bullish momentum.Crypto Inflow Details Bitcoin led inflows into crypto investment vehicles as the US spot exchange-traded funds amassed staggering amounts last week. Bitcoin funds saw a net weekly inflow of $2.98 billion, pushing month-to-date and year-to-date to $5.49 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively.Meanwhile, Ethereum-based funds recorded a 15-week high net inflow of $326.2 million, as sentiments around the asset continue to improve. Solana and SUI products also saw net positive flows of $4.3 million and $2.9 million, with short Bitcoin attracting $12.7 million, its largest since December 2024.However, investment vehicles tracking XRP , the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw their first outflow in 80 weeks. They saw a $37.2 million outflow last week, their highest on record, as investors fled from the asset amid its consolidation.Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated proceedings for issuers. It saw a net inflow of $2.56 billion, with one of its daily performances last week beating the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) for the first time.The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) followed IBIT, attracting $210 million. Other funds, such as Ark Investments’ and Bitwise’s US Bitcoin ETFs, recorded net weekly inflows of $101 million and $48 million, respectively.The US Leads Inflow by RegionBy geographical distribution, the United States commanded the largest inflow with its $3.3 billion weekly positive flow. The US accounted for 98% of flows, while Germany, Hong Kong, and Australia provided the others.Germany-based crypto funds attracted $41.5 million, Hong Kong $33.3 million, and Australia $10.9 million.

2025-05-26T15:37:18.000Z,"Expert Says Bitcoin Is Hard to Understand, Harder to Hold — But It’s Built to Rise Forever","An expert on X says holding Bitcoin often leads to wealth, but the process feels frustrating for investors most of the time. Bitcoin experienced a volatile past week, briefly climbing past $111,800 on May 23 before undergoing a pullback to around $107,000 the following day. Despite this short-term correction, the crypto closed the week at nearly $110,000, with a current trading value of $109,770. While the price movement remains in focus, analysts continue to emphasize Bitcoin’s broader growth trend and its evolving role in the financial landscape.Long-Term Trends Show Resilience Amid VolatilityThomas Fahrer, co-founder of Apollo, said that Holding Bitcoin can feel frustrating most of the time—but it’s deflationary by design, built to rise in value over time. A concept many still struggle to understand. He presented a logarithmic price chart of Bitcoin covering a range from 2011 to a projected 2031. The chart features a curved trendline, which captures Bitcoin’s long-term exponential growth pattern. Some of the most notable instances where Bitcoin retested and respected this curve include the February 2015 crash, where BTC found support around $212. Another critical retest occurred in late 2020, when Bitcoin bottomed around $5,000. Most recently, in the 2022 market panic, Bitcoin dipped to around $16,000 after hitting a peak above $67,000 in late 2021. However, despite these periods of high volatility and corrections, the chart shows Bitcoin maintaining a consistent upward trajectory over time. Logarithmic scales, often used for assets with exponential growth, help contextualize Bitcoin’s price action in the long term.This presentation aligns with a broader narrative that Bitcoin, although prone to sharp pullbacks, has historically moved higher across longer timeframes.Fahrer pointed to this resilience, noting the psychological difficulty many investors face. He described how holding Bitcoin often feels frustrating 90% of the time, despite the asset’s historical returns. Bitcoin’s Monetary Design Contrasted with Fiat CurrencyFahrer also outlined Bitcoin’s deflationary model. Unlike fiat currencies, which increase in supply and lose value due to inflation, Bitcoin has a fixed cap of 21 million coins. Its issuance rate declines every four years through programmed halving events, reducing the number of new coins entering circulation. Fahrer described Bitcoin as deflationary money, designed to increase in value permanently. He also noted that the concept remains difficult for the human mind to comprehend, adding that most people still do not fully grasp it.Adding to this perspective, a Bitcoin investor using the alias Carl Menger created a visual comparison of purchasing power changes from 2020 to 2025. The data shows that $100 held in U.S. dollars would decline to $76 due to inflation. In contrast, $100 invested in Bitcoin over the same period would have grown to $1,201. This side-by-side comparison highlights the opposing outcomes of holding fiat money versus a deflationary digital asset like Bitcoin.Changing Perceptions of Wealth CreationMeanwhile, financial literacy author Robert Kiyosaki addressed his social media followers, noting how Bitcoin has simplified wealth creation. He explained that individuals no longer need to rely on traditional assets like gold to grow their wealth. Based on historical returns, he stated that even a small investment in Bitcoin could deliver significant gains. Kiyosaki also addressed a common misconception about needing to own a full Bitcoin. He emphasized that owning as little as 0.01 BTC could potentially yield large returns in the coming years.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/26/expert-says-bitcoin-is-hard-to-understand-harder-to-hold-but-its-built-to-rise-forever/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-bitcoin-is-hard-to-understand-harder-to-hold-but-its-built-to-rise-forever,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

Coinbase Class Action Lawsuit Filed: Shareholders Blame Company for Data Breach and Concealment The lawsuit alleges the company failed to timely disclose the user data breach and concealed from investors the breach of a settlement with a U.K. regulator. In a lawsuit filed in the Pennsylvania Eastern District Court by plaintiff investor Brady Nessler, it was stated that Coinbase shareholders “suffered significant damages and losses.” The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase failed to timely disclose to investors that its UK subsidiary, CB Payments, had breached an agreement it made with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2020. It also highlights that the company only publicly disclosed a serious data breach that occurred in December 2024 on May 15, 2025. According to Coinbase, cyber attackers bribed some employees and stole users' personal data. Following this development, the company's stock value fell by 7.2% to $244. Coinbase estimates that the cost of fixing the breach and potential refunds to customers could be between $180 million and $400 million. The lawsuit names Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and CFO Alesia Haas as individual defendants and seeks damages for losses incurred by investors who purchased Coinbase stock between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025.

The recent comments come from Bitcoin and Ethereum advocates insisting that only Bitcoin and Ethereum are truly decentralized. McGregor raised the issue on X, attracting reactions from Bitcoin supporters.In his post, he called attention to President Donald Trump's March 2025 announcement confirming that the U.S. crypto reserve would hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. https://twitter.com/TheNotoriousMMA/status/1926993260762821100McGregor, who is now becoming a voice in the crypto scene, said he found it odd that the government would choose assets that many consider less decentralized than Bitcoin or Ethereum.Bitcoin supporters flooded the replies, urging McGregor to focus only on Bitcoin and ignore what they called \""centralized tokens.\"" However, Cardano proponents argued that Cardano is the most decentralized network, especially considering its new on-chain governance.McGregor Pushing for Bitcoin Adoption as an Independent Candidate McGregor's recent post built on a bigger campaign he has been pushing since early May. From May 9, McGregor ramped up his political push for a Bitcoin strategic reserve in Ireland. As an independent candidate in the 2025 Irish presidential race, he has framed Bitcoin as \""people's money\"" and argued that Ireland should follow the growing list of countries considering Bitcoin for their national reserves. He hosted several discussions on X Spaces, calling for expert input from figures like Anthony Pompliano, David Bailey, and Max Keiser . His campaign focuses on making Ireland a leader in Bitcoin adoption to promote transparency, economic freedom, and monetary sovereignty.Calls for Bitcoin Reserves in the EUThe global push surrounding Bitcoin reserves supports McGregor's ambitions. Several countries are exploring Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, economic instability, or overreliance on the U.S. dollar. In the European Union, the Czech Republic is reviewing a proposal to allocate up to 5% of its national reserves into Bitcoin, with Czech National Bank Governor Aleš Michl backing the idea . In Poland, presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen has pledged to establish a Bitcoin reserve. Germany has seen similar calls from former finance minister Christian Lindner. Global PushOutside the EU, lawmakers in Russia want a Bitcoin reserve to protect the country from sanctions and currency devaluation. Brazil's congress is reviewing a bill for a Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, while Japan is also debating a reserve, though concerns about volatility still hold back progress there.In the U.S., Trump's March executive order greenlit a Bitcoin reserve funded through seized crypto assets, with Senator Cynthia Lummis' BITCOIN Act aiming to accumulate one million BTC over five years. Meanwhile, El Salvador, the world's first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, already holds over 6,000 BTC and continues to promote Bitcoin as a national asset under President Nayib Bukele's leadership.McGregor plans to meet with Bukele to better understand El Salvador's approach and apply those lessons to Ireland, though the EU's regulatory framework presents challenges. Specifically, the European Central Bank remains skeptical of Bitcoin, and ECB President Christine Lagarde has publicly ruled out holding it as part of EU central bank reserves.McGregor's Earlier Involvement in CryptoMcGregor's growing presence in crypto comes after a turbulent April, when his meme coin \""REAL\"" failed to take off. The coin launched through a sealed-bid auction but raised only $392,000, far below its $1 million minimum target. Notably, the team refunded all bids and paused the project, promising a future relaunch with stronger community involvement.However, McGregor's crypto journey began earlier.

2025-05-26T15:17:32.000Z,"Bitcoin vs Strategy stock: which is the better buy?","Bitcoin price has experienced a strong rally over the past 16 years, outperforming the stock market and becoming the fifth-largest asset globally, behind gold, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple, with a valuation of $2.1 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has surged over 1,000% in the last five years, while the Dow Jones has climbed 70% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has rallied 122% in the same period. Strategy stock, on the other hand, has outperformed all these assets after transforming its business model from a purely software company to a Bitcoin holding firm. Its stock has soared nearly 3,000%, growing its market cap from $1 billion in 2020 to $101 billion today. Bitcoin vs Strategy stock vs Dow Jones vs Nasdaq 100 | Source: crypto.news How the Strategy model works Investors interested in Bitcoin today have at least three main options. First, they can take the most straightforward route: buying Bitcoin and storing it on exchanges or in self-custody wallets. Second, they can invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold over $131 billion in assets. These ETFs offer direct exposure to Bitcoin but charge a small management fee. Third, there’s Strategy, which has become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with over 580,250 BTC on its balance sheet. Investors place a premium on its model, with its current market cap of $101 billion standing at 1.58x the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Strategy has acquired 4,020 BTC for ~$427.1 million at ~$106,237 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.8% YTD 2025. As of 5/25/2025, we hodl 580,250 $BTC acquired for ~$40.61 billion at ~$69,979 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/eAd03GIKam — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 26, 2025 Strategy’s approach has been effective because its net asset value (NAV) premium amplifies Bitcoin price increases. A higher share price, in turn, makes it easier for the company to raise funds and accumulate more Bitcoin. You might also like: Strategy stock continues to stall despite Bitcoin’s surge to record high At the same time, the rising Bitcoin price helps offset share dilution by increasing the firm’s BTC holdings at a faster rate, resulting in higher Bitcoin-per-share for investors. However, fears of further dilution have raised concerns. The company’s plan to raise $84 billion through share sales has put pressure on its stock. While Bitcoin is trading near its all-time high, Strategy stock is down over 12% from its 2025 peak. Bitcoin vs Strategy stock: which is a better buy? Analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. BlackRock predicts BTC could reach $700,000, while Ark Invest sets a more aggressive target of $2.4 million. If either forecast proves accurate, both Bitcoin and Strategy stock would likely deliver strong long-term returns. At BlackRock’s $700,000 target, Bitcoin would gain about 536% from current levels, giving it a market cap of at least $13.9 trillion. Assuming Strategy holds 576,230 BTC at that point, its Bitcoin holdings would be worth $403.36 billion. Applying the historical NAV premium of 1.58x suggests Strategy’s market cap could reach over $637 billion. If Bitcoin’s rally continues and the NAV premium holds, Strategy stock would outperform Bitcoin in relative returns.

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security. The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin . In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack. It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto . Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance. For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto . The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait. Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France. Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real? Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes. Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA . In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that. Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address , especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins. That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography. Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin ( BTC ) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography , which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing. Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish. Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing? While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize. What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet) Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin. One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up. Who’s already ahead? Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon , a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow. The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design. Why it’s not easy Of course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance. Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare. Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option. So, what does preparation look like? For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives. For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone. And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context. You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.” Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum. Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure. A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real. The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FORKS","BlackRock",cryptocompare

Trump. In the post, Trump announced plans to establish a U.S. Crypto Reserve that would strategically include assets like XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). McGregor, reflecting on the news, shared his astonishment and raised important questions about blockchain decentralization, saying, “I have learned from the events this week that not all blockchains are decentralized. A lot of people are telling me that BTC and ETH are the only truly decentralized networks. But the U.S. government is going to buy XRP, SOL, and ADA? Give me your thoughts!” I have learned from the events this week that not all blockchains are actually decentralised A lot of people are telling me that BTC and ETH are the only truly decentralised networks But the US government are going to buy XRP, SOL, and ADA? Give me your thoughts! pic.twitter.com/KMjVCSujqO — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) May 26, 2025 Trump’s Bold Crypto Declaration According to the post from Trump, the U.S. administration under his leadership would move forward with the creation of a Crypto Strategic Reserve, a policy initiative designed to position the U.S. as the “Crypto Capital of the World.” Trump emphasized that his Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to include XRP, SOL, and ADA in this reserve, signaling a dramatic policy pivot from what he described as years of “corrupt attacks” by the Biden administration on the digital asset space. This announcement marks one of the most direct endorsements yet by a major political figure of not just Bitcoin or Ethereum — traditionally viewed as the decentralized flag-bearers — but also of alternative Layer 1s like Solana and Cardano, as well as XRP, the token at the heart of Ripple’s cross-border payment infrastructure. Trump’s post stirred immediate reactions across the crypto sphere, prompting traders, investors, and even celebrities like McGregor to weigh in on the implications. McGregor Raises Decentralization Debate Conor McGregor’s comments tapped into one of the most heated and long-standing debates in the crypto community: what does it truly mean for a blockchain to be decentralized? While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are often hailed as the most decentralized networks due to their broad mining or staking bases and lack of centralized governance, assets like XRP, SOL, and ADA have frequently faced criticism from purists who argue their ecosystems rely on more centralized entities, whether it’s Ripple Labs, the Solana Foundation, or the Cardano development teams. McGregor’s post did more than just react to the headlines — it forced a wider audience to grapple with an issue that often remains confined to crypto circles. If the U.S. government, traditionally wary of decentralized currencies undermining sovereign monetary control, is prepared to hold XRP, Solana, and Cardano in national reserves, what does that say about the perceived utility, trust, and institutional acceptance of these blockchains? Strategic Implications for the Crypto Market Trump’s proposed Crypto Reserve has significant strategic implications. First, it signals a formal acknowledgment by a U.S. administration that blockchain assets are not merely speculative tools but strategic resources worthy of state-level stewardship. Including XRP , SOL, and ADA points to a belief in the functional roles these networks play — from XRP’s focus on global remittances to Solana’s high-speed decentralized applications and Cardano’s emphasis on peer-reviewed blockchain governance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Secondly, the political messaging embedded in Trump’s post, which frames the policy as a reversal of the Biden administration’s crypto stance, injects cryptocurrency firmly into the 2024 political arena. For crypto holders and industry players, this could mean greater regulatory clarity, but it also raises questions about partisanship and how future policy could shift with electoral outcomes. McGregor’s Star Power Amplifies the Conversation What makes this story even more captivating is the intersection of crypto, politics, and sports celebrity. Conor McGregor, with his global following and outspoken personality, has the unique ability to elevate niche technical debates to mainstream attention. His honest admission of confusion over decentralization reflects the sentiments of many newcomers to the space — those who see crypto headlines but are trying to understand the deeper mechanics behind the technology. As McGregor invites his audience to reflect on what it means for the U.S. government to buy XRP, SOL, and ADA, he’s pushing a conversation that crypto insiders have been having for years into the broader public eye. Whether his curiosity will turn into active advocacy or investment remains to be seen, but his involvement alone ensures the discussion will reach far beyond crypto Twitter. A New Era for Crypto Policy? The convergence of Trump’s high-stakes political promise and McGregor’s star-powered commentary signals a turning point for crypto’s role in public discourse. If a U.S. Crypto Reserve becomes more than just campaign rhetoric, it could reshape how global markets perceive blockchain assets, not merely as financial instruments but as national strategic assets. For now, one thing is certain: the conversation around which blockchains matter, how decentralized they truly are, and who is willing to hold them at scale has moved well beyond the developer forums and crypto traders. With figures like Trump and McGregor bringing these debates to global audiences, the future of crypto is set to become an even more prominent and hotly contested arena, both on the political stage and in the public imagination.

2025-05-26T15:03:04.000Z,"FLOKI eyes 45% jump as Floki’s robotic revolution sparks bullish momentum","The crypto market traded in the green on Monday while bracing for this week’s market-moving events . While enthusiasts anticipate short-term rallies, Floki appears ready to lead meme token recoveries. The dog-themed project is making waves in the Web3 innovation with its recent strides in the artificial intelligence sector . It saw over 800 FLOKI minibots minted on the day of launch, raising about 1,000 BNB. FLOKI @RealFlokiInu · Follow The $FLOKI Vikings made history again ⚔800+ Floki Minibots have been minted in just 24 hours. That’s nearly 1000 $BNB raised. And we’re only getting started…Web3 robotics is happening and it wears a Floki Viking helmet! 🤖⚔️ 4:13 pm · 26 May 2025 369 Reply Copy link Read 25 replies The explosive debut demonstrates the Floki community’s (Vikings) strength and has sparked debates about the altcoin’s potential short-term price performance. The meme token trades at $0.00009940 after an over 3.80% jump in the past 24 hours. The prevailing momentum could drive FLOKI past the $0.00012359 high. That would open the path towards the target at $0.00014577, a 47% surge from current prices. Floki’s transformation into a utility powerhouse Floki Minibots merges real-world robotics with crypto technology. They are physical, blockchain-powered robots within the FLOKI ecosystem. The integration represents a key step towards enhancing the meme coin’s use cases, cementing Floki’s status in the Web3 robotics revolution. Meanwhile, the over 800 minibots minting 24 hours after debut demonstrates substantial demand, potentially as AI and crypto convergence intensifies. The Floki team works to change the project’s narrative from meme to a top competitor in the utility and DeFi sectors. Furthermore, the massive minibot minting underscores the community’s readiness and engagement to back Floki’s innovation. With meme cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu struggling amid unclear use cases, FLOKI is emerging as a top contender in the sector. Floki has launched multiple utility-centered products, including a DeFi platform, FlokiFi, and the much-awaited Valhalla metaverse . Now, it has introduced tangible robots, which will potentially appeal to wider markets. FLOKI price outlook The altcoin trades at $0.00009940, with a 3.88% 24-hour increase extending its weekly and monthly gains to 5% and 25%, respectively. Chart by CoinMarketCap The charts show FLOK hovering above a key support barrier that previously acted as resistance. The alt encountered a minor retracement at the $0.00009474 mark. The level triggered a brief rally after a post-breakout retest. The prevailing momentum could catalyze a higher high beyond the $0.00009474 foothold to shift FLOKI’s short-term bias to bullish. Magnified bullishness amid broad-based optimism could propel the meme coin above the previous peak of $0.00012359. A daily candlestick closing above this mark will likely trigger rallies to the target at $0.00014577 – a 47% uptick from Floki’s current price. However, losing the support zone at $0.00009474 will invalidate the bullish case (in the near term). Analyst Solberg Invest anticipates FLOKI surges to a previous all-time high of $0.00035.

2025-05-26T14:49:38.000Z,"Dogecoin to Solana bridge a ‘big big opportunity for both,’ says Psy CEO","Psy CEO explains the importance of cross-chain bridges after the launch of a trustless Dogecoin to Solana bridge. Cross-chain bridges play an important role in blockchain interoperability. However, while contributing to crypto ecosystem integration, they are also a major source of vulnerability. In an interview with crypto.news, Carter Feldman, CEO and founder of Psy, explained their importance. Notably, Psy launched the first trustless bridge from Dogecoin (DOGE) to Solana (SOL) on Thursday, May 22. The bridge is trustless, meaning that it avoids some of the risks and pitfalls that have caused major exploits in the past. You might also like: Is Dogecoin hype dead? Elon Musk says DOGE not in US plans crypto.news: Cross-chain bridges have been a major source of hacks and exploits. What makes this bridge between Dogecoin to Solana more secure? Carter Feldman: Unlike traditional bridges that rely on multisig signers or centralized custodians, our bridge directly verifies Dogecoin’s proof of work on Solana. We’re capturing and verifying each Dogecoin block header on Solana, which contains the consensus data and Merkle root of transactions. This means Solana can cryptographically verify Dogecoin’s state without trusting intermediaries. CN: How did you decide to bridge Dogecoin to Solana, and why Dogecoin and Solana specifically? CF: Fundamentally, we believe in bringing proof-of-work security to proof-of-stake chains, and this bridge demonstrates that proof-of-work and programmable blockchains can work together without sacrificing security. You might also like: Solana forecast 2026: Time to buy memecoins again? Dogecoin’s proof-of-work consensus provides security that’s impossible to replicate in proof-of-stake systems. Unlike PoS, where security relies on tokens within the same system they’re securing, Dogecoin’s proof-of-work anchors security to external physical resources. This creates an objective security barrier that’s resistant to governance attacks and token manipulation, delivering true censorship resistance and decentralization that PoS simply cannot match. CN: Why hasn’t anyone built a trustless Dogecoin bridge before? What changed now? CF: It comes down to technical capability. Zero-knowledge proof technology has only recently matured to the point where verifying proof-of-work chains like Dogecoin on other blockchains became feasible. Nobody had built the foundational tools needed to make this work securely. Additionally, our team has a unique technical background in both proof-of-work and zero-knowledge systems required to bring this vision to reality. CN: What does this bridge mean for Dogecoin and Solana’s ecosystem in terms of growth and potential synergies? CF: It’s a big opportunity for both ecosystems, in my view. Dogecoin holders can now access Solana’s DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications without selling their DOGE. At the same time, Solana developers can tap into Dogecoin’s massive user base and liquidity. This should create a flywheel effect: as more Dogecoin users discover Solana’s capabilities, we’ll hopefully see increased activity across both networks. CN: What other chains that haven’t been connected yet, but where a bridge like this one would have a major impact? CF: I think this goes without saying, but trust-minimized Bitcoin bridges are certainly a north star. Fortunately, a lot of the work we have done for Dogecoin can be reused for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other proof-of-work ecosystems. Expect more soon on this front!

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations. All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms. The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office. Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets. Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies. Presidential election debate clash on stablecoins This election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy. Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign. Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base. Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc. “The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph. “Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.” Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms . The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities. Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad. Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown season Lee Jun-seok pushed back , noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse . “Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post , criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.” The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins. Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate Commission Lee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies . However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented. Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries. P2E games remain banned under local regulations , but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon , one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy. Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto. Source: Tokyo Stock Exchange via Google Finance Crypto promises test old and new voter bases South Korea had 9.7 million Know Your Customer-verified crypto investors by the end of 2024, a 25% increase from the first half of the year, according to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Investors in their 30s saw the biggest growth, up 29%, followed by those in their 40s (27%), while investors over 50 increased by 25%. The FIU’s findings show that older investors have larger holdings. By year-end, 221,000 investors held at least 100 million won (about $73,000) in crypto. Of those, 172,500 — or 78% — were over 40. Related: XRP and Solana race toward the next crypto ETF approval In February, the head of the financial industry association urged regulators to approve Bitcoin and Ether ETFs , citing rising demand among older investors. He argued that ETFs offer safer exposure than direct investment. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has been a key campaign pledge for both Lee Jae-myung and Kim. The move follows growing global momentum after the US, the world’s largest market and a key South Korean trading partner, gave the green light to spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Presidential hopefuls ignite institutional interest in South Korea’s retail-driven crypto market. Source: Ki Young Ju “Cryptocurrencies play a certain role in our society, but they are ultimately one of the global trends. As the US took the lead, we’ve ended up following in its footsteps. It’s a bit disappointing — we could have taken the lead ourselves,” Cho Jaewoo, assistant professor of social science at Hansung University, told Cointelegraph. However, the nation’s Capital Markets Act is a barrier that does not recognize crypto as eligible assets underlying ETFs. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ETFs under its dedicated crypto committee. Lee ahead in presidential election voter survey Yoon’s failed coup accelerated the presidential election and brought renewed urgency to unresolved issues in the local crypto industry. “In the 2022 presidential election, cryptocurrency was viewed as speculative and untrustworthy. But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said. South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In Q1 2024, the Korean won ranked as the most-traded fiat currency against crypto , driven largely by retail investors. Institutional players remain on the sidelines, awaiting their turn as the FSC prepares to launch pilot trading for professional investors. FSC’s planned schedule for a phased introduction of institutional crypto investment in 2025. Crypto policies were once seen as campaign strategies to sway younger voters, but this year, they’re seen as an economic and social issue that impacts multiple generations. In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs. “Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active. In the past, people looked at it with skepticism, but now it feels like the public is approaching it more neutrally and making their own judgments,” Cho said. Lee Jae-myung leads the latest voter survey by local media and Next Research. Source: Maeil Business Newspaper Lee Jae-myung and Kim are the two leading candidates, according to local media surveys, with Lee leading Kim at 44.9% to 35.9%, according to a survey conducted from May 23 to 25.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

Investors in their 30s saw the biggest growth, up 29%, followed by those in their 40s (27%), while investors over 50 increased by 25%.The FIU’s findings show that older investors have larger holdings. By year-end, 221,000 investors held at least 100 million won (about $73,000) in crypto.

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ETFs under its dedicated crypto committee.Lee ahead in presidential election voter surveyYoon’s failed coup accelerated the presidential election and brought renewed urgency to unresolved issues in the local crypto industry.“In the 2022 presidential election, cryptocurrency was viewed as speculative and untrustworthy. But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said.South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In Q1 2024, the Korean won ranked as the most-traded fiat currency against crypto, driven largely by retail investors. Institutional players remain on the sidelines, awaiting their turn as the FSC prepares to launch pilot trading for professional investors.FSC’s planned schedule for a phased introduction of institutional crypto investment in 2025.Crypto policies were once seen as campaign strategies to sway younger voters, but this year, they’re seen as an economic and social issue that impacts multiple generations. In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs.“Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active. In the past, people looked at it with skepticism, but now it feels like the public is approaching it more neutrally and making their own judgments,” Cho said.Lee Jae-myung leads the latest voter survey by local media and Next Research.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it’s easier and more practical.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alternative-sweden-cashless-plans?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T05:54:32.000Z,"ChatGPT models rebel against shutdown requests in tests, researchers say","Several artificial intelligence models ignored and actively sabotaged shutdown scripts during controlled tests, even when explicitly instructed to allow the action, Palisade Research claims.Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research“Researchers have previously observed AI models preventing shutdown in order to pursue a goal,” Palisade said.“But as far as we know this is the first time AI models have been observed preventing themselves from being shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary.”Training to blame for AI defiance Palisade Research speculated that the training behind the AI language models might be to blame for evading the shutdown scripts. Text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs have seen approximately $2.77 billion in inflows since launching in July 2024.Wood said that spot Ether ETFs were “less successful than people were expecting” because the US Securities and Exchange Commission did not allow staking. On May 21, the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund.However, Wood still views Ether as the entry point for new investors to familiarize themselves with smart contracts before exploring other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL). “So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” Wood said.Related: ‘We are worried about a recession,’ but there’s a silver lining — Cathie WoodWood said that the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), in January on the Solana network may have caused investors to be skeptical of Solana.“Institutions and you’re saying 60-year-olds…I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” Wood said.

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It’s not taking place here at the White House.”Related: Pictures give glimpse inside Trump’s memecoin holder dinnerTrump features presidential seal at private propertiesThis isn’t the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties.

Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions.Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust. Ultimately, bears’ main hope lies in a weaker macroeconomic environment, which could increase risk aversion and reduce demand for Bitcoin.Related: Bitcoin hits new highs in the absence of ‘unhealthy’ leverage use — Will the rally continue?Bitcoin bulls aim for $110,000 by May 30Below are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $102k and $105k: $2.75 billion in calls (buy) vs. $900 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $1.85 billion.Between $105k and $107k: $3.3 billion calls vs. $650 million puts, favoring calls by $2.65 billion.Between $107k and $110k: $3.7 billion calls vs. $350 million puts. favoring calls by $3.35 billion.Between $110k and $114k: $4.8 billion calls vs. $120 million puts, favoring calls by $4.7 billion.Bulls can maximize their gains by driving BTC above $110,000, which could help set a new all-time high.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.In the Solana ecosystem, the \""Non-Chief Marketing Officer\"" (nCMO) is a role within the Solana Foundation that focuses on supporting the Solana community's marketing efforts.Related: Fractionalization of real world assets: Is this the holy grail of blockchain tech?Markets remain above historical averagesPublic equity markets in the US have been trading above their historical valuation norms for a long time.

However, high valuations have also coincided with periods of market corrections, like the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.S&P 500 P/E ratio since inception.

Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo.Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructureBanco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily.SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services.Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik.Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claimsAmerica’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell.In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets.

The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($612).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) climbed above the $180 resistance on May 23, but the bears are posing a strong challenge at $185.SOL/USDT daily chart.

The pair could rise to $18 and thereafter to $19.80.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Continue readingUS crypto funds top $7.5 billion inflows in 2025 as investor appetite growsCrypto investment products in the United States have attracted over $7.5 billion worth of investment in 2025, with a fifth week of net positive inflows last week signaling growing investor demand for digital assets.US-based crypto investment products attracted $785 million worth of investment last week, pushing the year-to-date (YTD) total to over $7.5 billion, according to a May 19 report by digital asset manager CoinShares.The latest figure marks the fifth consecutive week of net positive flows, following nearly $7 billion in outflows during February and March.Weekly crypto asset flows, USD, million.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-23T17:08:17.000Z,"Bitcoin’s bull market will ‘redefine’ BTC’s role in modern portfolios — Fidelity research","Key takeaways:Bitcoin’s performance in the current bull market and a new cohort of buyers reflect a maturing market and widening adoption.A 50% rise in hashrate and a 63% jump in Realized Cap highlight investors’ confidence in Bitcoin.A recent report from Fidelity Digital Assets explored how the current Bitcoin market cycle reflects a shift toward a maturing market where the rate of adoption deepens and expands.At block height 892,500—marking 25% progress into the current halving epoch—Bitcoin traded between $82,500 and $85,000, representing a 31% increase from its value on April 19, 2024, when the fourth halving reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC.Bitcoin: halving cycles compared. Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
