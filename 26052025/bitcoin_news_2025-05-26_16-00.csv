2025-05-26T14:00:09.000Z,"Don’t speculate on cryptocurrencies! Richminer data shows that smart money is making blood-sucking arbitrage through XRP cloud mining","As XRP breaks through its historical high, a “passive income revolution” is quietly emerging in the cryptocurrency field. As Ripple’s cooperation with global financial institutions deepens, XRP’s long-term value logic becomes clearer, and the evolution of the Richminer platform opens a new window for ordinary investors to participate without technical barriers and low risk – through Richminer’s intelligent configuration of computing power contracts and strategies, the goal of $100,000 in passive income per year has changed from being out of reach to a replicable wealth path. XRP uses Richminer to achieve compound interest on income XRP itself cannot be mined directly, but through cloud mining platforms such as Richminer, users can rent computing power to participate in the mining of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin, and automatically convert the income into XRP to form a passive income stream. How to start Richminer passive income: Use an email address to create an account, register and get a $15 reward, and the daily income is about $0.6. Maximize profit configuration: Choose RichMiner high-computing power contracts: give priority to renting Bitcoin or Dogecoin mining machines because of their high profit stability; the following potential high returns and flexible investment options. For example, New User Experience Contract (invest 100, potential total profit of 106 in 2 days). For example, Canaan Avalon A15XP (invest 600, potential total profit of 650.82 in 7 days). For example, Bitdeer SealMiner A2 (invest 1,600, potential total profit of 1,897.92 in 14 days). For example, Bitmain Antminer L9 (invest 12,000, potential total profit of 19,140 in 35 days). For example, Antspace HK3 V6 (invest 110,000, potential total profit of 228,250 in 50 days), with an average daily return rate of more than 2.15%. Click richminer.com for more details on mining contracts. Compound interest reinvestment model: The cloud mining income is regularly invested in the purchase of contracts to form a positive cycle of “income → purchase more cloud mining contracts → higher income”. Assuming an investment of $5,400, if the monthly rate of return reaches 45%, the principal plus income can reach about $7,843 after one month. Through compound interest reinvestment, the initial funds can grow rapidly. Through the use of the above strategies, the goal of $100,000 in passive income can be achieved efficiently. RichMiner core advantages Fully automated operation: The platform integrates intelligent AI technology to automatically process mining, optimization and income distribution, and daily income is automatically credited. Sustainable development of green energy: The platform uses renewable energy mines, which are in line with ESG trends and ensure long-term income stability. Multi-currency support and instant withdrawal: Supports mining and settlement of mainstream currencies such as BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, etc., with a withdrawal threshold as low as $100, daily processing of user withdrawal requests, and support for multiple protocols such as TRC20/ERC20. Professional team and global service: A team of blockchain experts and IT engineers provides 24/7 technical support. The platform interface supports 8 languages ​​and covers users in 132 countries. Industry-leading security and compliance guarantee Fund security: 95% of user funds are stored in cold wallets, using McAfee® and Cloudflare® encryption technology to prevent hacker attacks. Compliance certification: Holds the UK FCA license and the US MSB compliance certification, funds are entrusted to HSBC Bank, and there has been no security incident record for 3 consecutive years. Summary: XRP cloud mining is reshaping passive income, and daily income compounding is achieved with the help of Richminer’s green energy mining pool. Behind the goal of $100,000 is actually the accurate capture of Richminer trends and AI intelligent management.

Will the ETH Price Mark A New ATH in June 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets are heading towards yet another monthly close, which usually generates huge volatility. Although the Bitcoin trading volume has dropped to some extent, the investors continue to remain optimistic about the upcoming action. As a result, the BTC price is primed to maintain a continued ascending trend and eventually reclaim its levels within the discovery phase in a short while from now. On the other hand, Ethereum’s price continues to struggle around $2500, which raises concerns over its probability of forming new highs by the end of Q2 or during the second half of 2025. In a recent update, Strategy has announced a fresh Bitcoin acquisition of over 4000 BTC, holding nearly 580,250 BTC in total. With this, the investors could have become somewhat sure of the next BTC bullish wave. After the latest move, it was pretty sure that the bulls were relaxing ahead of the next price action, but the question is why the Ethereum price is failing to catch up to the trend. The second-largest token is away from its ATH by more than 47% in times when the BTC price has smashed new highs. With this huge disparity between the top two tokens, will the markets be able to revive a strong bullish momentum as they did in 2021? The above comparison chart of Bitcoin and ETH/USD & ETH/BTC shows the ETH price has lost its track. Both the ETH pairs are going hand in hand, suggesting the token is failing weakly against the USD as well as BTC. As the correlation between the top two tokens has dropped significantly since the start of the year, the rise in the BTC price has not been impacting the ETH price rally. Hence, a strong Ethereum bull run may begin once the ETH/BTC triggers a strong rebound and rises above 0.055 BTC. In 2021, the ETH price rallied along with BTC, and they both reached a new ATH at almost the same time, which triggered a strong Altseason. Meanwhile, the current scenario suggests the ETH bulls do not appear to be quite sure of the upcoming trend. As a result, the price has been facing equal pressure from both sides for the past couple of weeks. The ETH price is yet to rise within the bullish range, which is above $2800, and until then, the token could remain within a consolidated zone.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/whats-next-for-ethereum-price-will-the-eth-price-mark-a-new-ath-in-june-2025/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

The Michael Saylor-led company bagged a fresh stash of BTC, bringing its total Bitcoin stash to 580,250. Strategy Boosts Bitcoin Stack To 580,250 BTC Michael Saylor’s Strategy — formerly MicroStrategy — added 4,020 BTC to its balance sheet from May 19 to May 25, spending over $427.1 million on the digital asset, as per a Monday press release. The latest purchases were made at an average price of $106,237 per coin, with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. The purchase pushes Strategy’s total holdings to 580,250 BTC — now worth over $63 billion based on the current Bitcoin price of around $109,900. For perspective, Strategy now controls nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. The Nasdaq-traded company said that it has now spent a total of $40.61 billion on buying its Bitcoin stack, with each coin priced on average at $69,800. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the purchase was funded through three capital-raising mechanisms: an at-the-market (ATM) offering of its Class A common stock, MSTR, perpetual strike preferred stock, STRK, and the issuance of Series A perpetual strife preferred stock, STRF. Between May 19 and May 25, the company sold 847,000 shares of its common stock (MSTR) for $348.7 million, 678,970 shares of STRK preferred stock for $67.9 million, and 104,423 shares of STRF preferred stock for $10.4 million. The Tysons, Virginia-based firm began stockpiling Bitcoin under the leadership of Executive Chairman Saylor in August 2020. However, Strategy recently encountered a legal hurdle as a California-based investor has accused the company and its executives of violating federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements about its Bitcoin holdings strategy. According to the class-action suit, the defendants failed to disclose that “the anticipated profitability of the company’s Bitcoin-focused investment strategy was overstated.” Strategy indicated that it intends to “vigorously defend” itself against the claims. Meanwhile, smaller companies on the Nasdaq and elsewhere have emulated the Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin-buying plan, including Metaplanet and Semler Scientific .",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/michael-saylors-strategy-makes-427-million-bitcoin-buy-adding-another-4020-btc-to-corporate-coffers/,"BTC|BUSINESS|SPONSORED|TRADING|STRK","Bitcoin|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T13:54:08.000Z,"SPX and Ethereum to Rally Despite Trump Tariffs: Best Meme Coins to Buy Now","Bluntz, a Master Trader on ByBit, is extremely bullish on Ethereum, even amid increasing pressure on crypto from Donald Trump. The analyst took to X to share his views on $ETH with his 318K followers. Backed by the Elliott Wave Theory on the 4-hour chart, Bluntz believes that $ETH might hit $3.5K before mid-June. The coin is currently trading at around $2.5K. With $BTC hitting a new all-time high last week , the crypto market looks ready for the next move up. And $ETH will almost certainly be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Read on as we break down Ethereum’s technical chart to explain why. We’ll also go over some of the best meme coins you can buy right now to benefit from the potential upcoming surge. $ETH on the Elliott Wave Theory Ethereum’s Wave 1 started in early April, when the token started slowly creeping up from $1.5K to $1.7K. This move was followed by another wave (Wave 2), where the price kept fluctuating close to the new price of $1.7K. Wave 3 was the strongest, as is the case in the Elliott Wave Theory. $ETH soon broke the $1.8K resistance and posted a whopping 50% move to reach $2.7K. Since then, however, it has been in a strong consolidation. As you can see in this chart, $ETH is currently in Wave 4. To be precise, it’s in a consolidation triangle pattern. Once Ethereum breaks out of this triangle at around $2.75K, we might be headed for Wave 5, which could see the price soar up to $3.5K. Alongside Ethereum, Bluntz is also bullish on SPX6900 ($SPX), an Ethereum-based meme coin. Currently trading at $0.9069, $SPX may soon break the $1 mark and head towards $2, as shown in the chart below. Mosesifunanya , a trader with 5.7K followers on CoinMarketCap, also published an $SPX analysis. The trader said that the positive MACD divergence supports a bullish bias, and investors should watch for confirmation above the $0.8921 resistance level. Just like $ETH, $SPX is also in consolidation and awaiting a breakout. The relatively tight Bollinger Band width (31.62%) also suggests decreasing volatility, according to Mosesifunanya. Overall, several technical indicators seem to be screaming bullishness for both $ETH and $SPX. The bullish bias becomes even stronger when you consider that the crypto market has regained its lost momentum in the last two weeks. With major coins in crucial consolidation, the market is in all likelihood gearing up for the next boom. Needless to say, this is the right time to invest. To help you out, we’ve handpicked some of the best altcoins to consider right now. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best Meme Coin to Buy Now for Crypto Trading Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a new AI agent that combines online chatter and on-chain activity to identify the next big crypto coin . It starts its research on social media platforms like X, where it stirs up engaging, context-aware conversations with the crypto community. This way, $MIND takes the pulse of the broader meme coin market, finding out which coins are currently enjoying the most community buzz. The crypto AI agent then combines real-time trading data, such as volume spikes and early price movements from platforms like CoinMarketCap and DexScreener, to predict the next cryptos to explode with reasonable accuracy. To get access to MIND of Pepe’s real-time crypto investment advice, you’ll have to be a $MIND holder. Luckily for you, the project is currently in presale (having raised $10.4M+ so far). You can still buy each token for just $0.0037515. However, this offer ends in 4 days, as the $MIND presale comes to a close. So, now’s the moment to buy $MIND for the lowest price. 2. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Ready to Rocket Further Launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6, Moonpig is among the newest top trending cryptos . With over 1,500% returns in less than a month, Moonpig is yet another example that a well-built combination of humor, crypto, and culture can take the market by storm. Interestingly, Moonpig was launched with no presale whatsoever, which makes its current rally even more praiseworthy. Simply put, it entered the arena and hit a home run without any practice sessions. Despite four-digit gains, $MOONPIG is still relatively young, and with expectations of a new crypto bull run in the air, it could probably shoot up even further. It’s currently trading at just $0.07569 , which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now . 3. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Meme Coin Today With the broader crypto market expected to be bullish, Bitcoin will undoubtedly be the central attraction. If you want to make the most of $BTC’s historic growth, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . $BTCBULL is not only one of the best cryptos to buy now but also the best Bitcoin-inspired meme coin on the market today. That’s because it’s the only one offering real free $BTC airdrops to its token holders. All you have to do to participate in BTC Bull Token’s Bitcoin airdrops is buy and hold $BTCBULL using Best Wallet . Then, every time the king cryptocurrency powers through a new landmark, such as $150K and $200K, you’ll receive your $BTC share directly in your crypto wallet . Additionally, $BTCBULL holders will also benefit from a periodic token supply burns. These will reduce the total supply, thereby increasing $BTCBULL’s demand and hopefully pumping its price. If you’re a Bitcoin maximalist, joining the BTC Bull Token presale is probably the best way to cheer on the ‘digital gold.’ The project has raised over $6.3M in total and the token is selling for $0.00253, though $BTCBULL’s price could surge 230% from the current price throughout 2025. 4. TROLL ($TROLL) – Internet Trolling Has Quite the Fanbase As the name suggests, TROLL is built from the ground up for ‘dank’ internet users who love and support online trolling culture. Frankly speaking, in a world that has been pushing for more sensitivity on all fronts, especially online, meme coins like $TROLL suggest that crypto degens are still very much in support of ‘edgy’ humor. $TROLL launched towards the end of April and has since then jumped over 160%. It’s worth highlighting that this new low-cap coin underwent a slight slump last week, although it is trending again. $TROLL now looks set to push past its all-time high of around $0.040. It’s currently trading at $0.02611 . Are the Best Meme Coins Ready to Party? Given the number of new meme coins that have come out over the past month, it’s fair to say that a new altcoin season is almost here. You can now maximize your potential gains by investing in tokens like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . However, it’s worth mentioning that the crypto market guarantees nothing. It’s highly volatile and unpredictable, which is why you mustn’t jump in with all your money. This article isn’t financial advice, and we urge you to do your own research before investing.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/spx-ethereum-rally-despite-trump-tariffs-best-meme-coins-to-buy-now/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T13:48:20.000Z,"How to set up stop-loss and take-profit orders","Key takeaways Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains. Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges. In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades. Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes. Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and profit-securing tool. They help reduce losses and boost revenue by automatically buying or selling an asset when its price reaches a set level. With Bitcoin’s emergence in 2009 and its subsequent trading on exchanges , these advanced trading strategy tools became crucial for dealing with its well-known price volatility. As Bitcoin ( BTC ) gained traction, traders began to use stop-loss and take-profit strategies from forex and stock markets. At first, price monitoring was manual. Then, automated features on crypto platforms changed everything. What are stop-loss and take-profit orders? Stop-loss and take-profit orders are trading strategies that help investors manage risk and secure gains automatically. They’re instructions you set on a trading platform to close a position when certain price levels are reached. They help limit losses in case of significant price drops or lock in profits when a price target is reached. They can be set up to boost gains and cut losses. This helps keep emotions out of trading, which can prevent regrettable mistakes. They also help if you can’t monitor the market constantly. There must be specific conditions for the orders to trigger. Bitcoin trading is very volatile. Its fast price changes and possible system delays can cause orders to trigger at a different price or not trigger at all. This type of trading strategy gives peace of mind to risk-averse investors. Bitcoin stop-loss orders If you don’t want to take risks and preserve your capital, you can use a stop-loss order designed to limit your losses. You can use it for a buy order, setting up a price level below your entry point, or right above it for a sell trade. In case of a price drop, the order is executed automatically at your designated price, preventing further losses. For example, if you buy BTC at $90,000 and set a stop loss at $85,000, your position sells if the price drops to $85,000, capping your loss at $5,000. Bitcoin take-profit orders To lock in some gains, you can use a take-profit order. Set a price level above your entry point, and when the market reaches that level, the trade is executed, giving you the expected gains. For example, if you buy BTC at $90,000 and set a take profit at $95,000, if the price hits $95,000, it sells, securing a $5,000 profit per BTC. Importance of stop loss and take profit for Bitcoin trading Bitcoin’s wild price changes make stop-loss and take-profit orders important. These tools help lower the risk of losses and boost the chance of gains. Remember, setting up these orders doesn’t guarantee they will be executed. Their execution relies on various factors, like market volumes. Why set up a stop loss for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s volatility has gone down over time. Still, it can have big price swings. Without proper Bitcoin trading risk management, traders may face heavy losses. Here are some of the most important reasons why it would be useful to adopt stop-loss orders in your Bitcoin trading strategy. Bitcoin volatility: BTC can still drop 10% in a very short time due to factors such as news, whale moves or market sentiment. On Dec. 5, 2024, for example, BTC suffered a flash crash from $103,853 down to $92,251 before recovering. A stop loss caps your downside trend when a flash crash hits. Without it, you’re gambling on timing the recovery manually. Non-stop market: The Bitcoin market is open 24/7. Setting up a stop loss will prevent losses due to sudden drops while you’re sleeping. Emotions: An emotional state can be a huge game-changer in trading. Emotional investors may panic-sell or panic-buy, triggering significant losses. A stop loss will reduce the risk of making costly emotional mistakes before fear kicks in. Why set up a take-profit order for Bitcoin A Bitcoin trading strategy may include defining price targets and a percentage of gains. Setting up a take profit order for BTC may be necessary as part of an overall trading risk management plan and will help reach the following targets. Locking gains: BTC’s volatility, in both bull and bear markets, can lead to quick spikes and can reverse just as quickly. A take profit ensures you cash out before pullbacks. Greed control: Without a take profit order, traders may be tempted to chase higher highs, which may not occur over the short term. Non-stop market: You can’t just sit and watch the market 24/7. A take-profit order ensures profits in case of a sudden pump while you’re asleep. How to set up BTC stop-loss and take-profit orders Setting up stop-loss and take-profit for Bitcoin trading varies by platform. However, the process is usually similar on most crypto exchanges, like Binance, Coinbase Pro and Kraken. The following step-by-step guide to setting up your BTC stop-loss and take-profit orders should give you a good overview of the process. Step 1: Choose a Bitcoin trading platform This may be the most crucial aspect of your process to set up your advanced BTC trading strategies. Pick a platform that aligns with your needs. Make sure to check the fees, volumes, reputation and security because these features can impact your trading strategy. Step 2: Open a BTC trading position Once you’ve set up your trading account, log in to your platform and navigate to the trading section, and look for the order form. Choose a BTC pair, for example, BTC/USD. Place your buy order (long) or sell order (short). For example, you can place your order to buy 1 BTC at $90,000. Step 3: Set your stop loss for BTC Here’s an example of an order from the Kraken platform. Click on the stop-loss option from the order menu as shown below to set up the tool. Set the stop-loss price by first deciding your risk level, or how much you’re willing to lose in case the Bitcoin price drops significantly. For example, if you bought BTC at $92,500, you can set the stop loss at $87,300, meaning you set your loss at roughly 5.62%. The loss = 92,500 - 87,300 = 5,200 Now, to find the percentage loss: (5,200 / 92,500) * 100 = 5.62% Step 4: Set your take profit for BTC Stay in the same trade interface. Just as above, after you select your BTC pair and buy the relevant BTC amount, click on the take-profit option. Set the take-profit price based on your exit strategy. For example, you want to set it 5% above the entry price, which would be $94,500 if you bought BTC for $90,000. Enter $94,500 as the sell price. When Bitcoin hits this price, it will sell automatically. Step 5: Confirm and monitor your orders Confirm and activate after double-checking the amount and price, then submit. If your notifications are active, you will receive one once the order is triggered. Nothing stops you from monitoring your order status, and you can cancel or amend it if the market conditions change. Best practices for BTC stop-loss placement Traders can limit their potential losses by using stop-loss orders. This helps them protect their capital during volatile market conditions. Therefore, with Bitcoin’s possible daily swings of 5%–10%, it’s safe to base a stop loss on volatility. Volatility: Platforms like TradingView might offer an option called Average True Range (ATR) over 14 days. This lets you set an average range below your entry point. For instance, you can choose a range of $3,000, so if you bought Bitcoin at $90,000, the order will trigger once it goes down to $87,000. Align with support levels: Historically, BTC respects price floors. Setting up a stop below a crucial support level gives some peace of mind. For instance, if you bought Bitcoin at $90,000 and $88,000 is your support level, set a stop-loss order at $87,800, just below the zone to bypass stop-hunting bots. Avoid obvious levels: Whales and bots target batches of stop-loss orders at round numbers ($80,000, $85,000) or chart patterns , triggering orders before price reverses. Moving the stop loss a bit lower, like to $87,800 instead of $88,000, will probably trigger the order more effectively. BTC trailing stop loss A trailing stop-loss order automatically adjusts a stop-loss price as the market price moves in a profitable direction to lock in profits and limit losses by following a trade’s price. It’s designed to keep a fixed distance below (for long positions) or above (for short positions) the current market price. A simple stop loss may miss profits, while a trailing stop locks them. You can set a trailing stop loss at 3%–5% below the peak as the price rises. If you buy BTC at $90,000 and it hits $95,000, the trailing stop loss moves to $93,250. You can adjust manually or automatically if the platform allows. Account for slippage Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. This can occur due to market volatility or low liquidity. In case of low liquidity during BTC crashes, execution can skip your stop loss. For instance, $88,000 may fill at $87,500. Widening the stop loss slightly by 0.5%–1% can solve the problem. How to adjust stop-loss and take-profit Bitcoin orders When and how to adjust a stop loss Stop-loss adjustments should be made carefully. This helps protect capital from unexpected market changes and secures profits when possible. It’s often done by adjusting the order to support or resistance levels. Another common strategy is using trailing stop-loss orders. You can use “modify position” or “edit trade” on your platform to adjust them. Tighten the stop loss after a move in your favor. In case BTC’s price rises after entry, you can move the stop loss to reduce risk or lock in profits. If BTC rises after entry, move the stop loss to reduce risk or lock in profit. For example, if BTC bounces from $88,000 to $93,000, you can tighten the stop loss to $90,500, thereby ensuring no loss if it is reversed. Trail the stop loss during a trend. As BTC keeps running upward during a bull market, trailing the stop loss captures more on the upside. A percentage- or ATR-based trail can be used. For instance, with a $90,000 entry, if BTC rallies to $100,000, you can trail the stop loss to $97,200 to lock in $7,200 per coin, which is an 8% profit if it then dips. Widen the stop loss during consolidation , as tight stop losses will get hit in unsettled ranges. For instance, if BTC stalls after the $90,000 entry, you can extend the stop loss from $88,000 to $87,500 to avoid sudden drops below support. Adjust before major events , like US Federal Reserve rate announcements or ETF approvals. These can cause big swings and increase slippage risks. You can tighten the stop loss to 1%–2% if you decide to remain in the trade, or you can widen it to 10% to ride the upward trend. When and how to adjust the take-profit order Take-profit orders can be adjusted to maximize gains, adapting to momentum or resistance. Just like a stop loss, you can modify them on your trading platform by selecting the open trade and choosing the “modify position” or “edit trade” option. Extend the take profit during strong momentum. This is to avoid missing a peak in a bull run. If you see volume spiking or a breakout clearing resistance, you can push the take profit higher. For instance, you buy at $90,000 and set the take profit at $93,000. If BTC hits $92,500 fast, you can adjust the take profit to $95,000 or $97,000 to maximize profits. Take partial profits at key levels. Resistance levels like $85,000 or $90,000 often see BTC reversing. Then you can decide to sell some of your position to grab some gains and let the rest ride. Tighten the take profit near resistance levels. BTC usually stalls at round numbers or past highs. If the price approaches resistance, you can cut the take profit from $90,000 to $88,500, for example. Reset the take profit after a pullback. If you just missed a take profit trade, do not despair, as BTC usually retraces and then runs up again. If you enter the trade at $90,000 and BTC dips to $85,000, you can reset your take profit order to $87,000 or $88,000 for a moderate win. Common mistakes to avoid with BTC orders Bitcoin’s fast-moving market needs a solid trading strategy. Stop-loss and take-profit orders are key tools. However, if they aren’t set up properly, they could do more damage than benefit. Here are some common mistakes traders make with BTC orders and how to get around them. Setting stops too tightly: Placing a stop loss too close to an entry price means it may get hit by an average drop of 2%–3%. Always keep Bitcoin’s high volatility in mind and use volatility and support level metrics. Ignoring slippage: Slippage can occur due to high volatility or low liquidity. Ignoring it may lead to costly mistakes. Especially on leveraged orders, slippage may result in heavy losses, which may affect your risk plans. Widening the stop loss slightly during highly volatile times may help reduce the risk of big losses. Chasing round numbers: Setting a stop loss at a round number is not a good idea. This can attract bots and whales looking to hunt stops or dump orders. Always set it up $100–$500 below or above a round number to avoid being caught in this typical mistake. Forgetting to adjust: Leaving a stop loss at $88,000 and a take profit at $93,000 after BTC pumps to $95,000 means you may miss profits or risk a reversal. Regularly monitoring the BTC price will ensure you’re ahead of the game and can adjust the orders accordingly. Setting platform alerts is also useful. Misjudging market context: Use your judgment following market trends. Setting a tight stop loss before a Fed announcement or a wide take profit in a bearish trend may incur heavy losses. Adjust accordingly while following trends and sentiments. Tighten the orders pre-event and widen them post-event. Aligning a take order with resistance is also a good idea. Not accounting for fees: Large-scale orders may be subject to high fees, which should be accounted for when setting up orders. Always factor fees into targets, as in the long term, it will make a difference. Panic-canceling orders: Emotions can lead to big losses. So, it’s smart to stick to your initial plan. This is especially true for BTC, which often faces flash crashes but can recover quickly. You can use trailing stops to adjust automatically. Avoid these mistakes by planning strategically, staying disciplined and adapting to Bitcoin’s volatile nature. Always test strategies on a demo account before trading live.

2025-05-26T13:45:43.000Z,"Here’s what happened in crypto today","Today in crypto, one unlucky crypto investor has fallen victim to a double-whammy of zero-value transfer phishing scams within three hours, losing $2.6 million. US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson batted away concerns over President Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner, and Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at another Bitcoin buy. Crypto investor loses $2.6 million in stablecoins in double phishing scam A single victim was scammed two times within three hours , losing a total of $2.6 million in stablecoins. According to data shared on May 26 by crypto compliance firm Cyvers, the victim sent 843,000 worth of USDt ( USDT ), followed by another 1.75 million USDt around three hours later. Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer , a sophisticated form of onchain phishing. Source: Cyvers Alert Zero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address. Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history. The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023. Speaker Johnson shrugs off Trump crypto dinner concerns US House Speaker Mike Johnson brushed off concerns on President Donald Trump’s dinner for the top holders of his memecoin when speaking to CNN on May 25 and dodged answering whether the attendees should be made public for transparency. “We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn't be outraged.” “Look, I don't know anything about the dinner,” Johnson answered, claiming he “was a little busy this past week,” focusing on passing a $1.6 trillion federal budget funding bill. CNN’s Jake Tapper (left) speaking with House Speaker Mike Johnson (right).

2025-05-26T13:42:50.000Z,"Solana: Ngôi Sao Mới Trong Cuộc Chơi Token Hóa Tài Sản Thực?","Việc token hóa tài sản thực (RWAs) – quá trình biến quyền sở hữu các tài sản vật lý hoặc phi vật lý thành các token số – đang có một làn gió mới khi Solana bắt đầu nổi lên như một blockchain tiềm năng cho các ứng dụng RWA. Mặc dù Ethereum từ lâu đã là “ngôi sao sáng” nhờ cơ sở hạ tầng mạnh mẽ, cộng đồng phát triển đông đảo và sự ủng hộ sớm từ các tổ chức lớn như JPMorgan và BlackRock, nhưng những hạn chế về khả năng mở rộng và chi phí cao đã khiến nhiều người tìm kiếm giải pháp thay thế. Solana, với tốc độ giao dịch chóng mặt, phí siêu thấp và hệ sinh thái ngày càng trưởng thành, đã thu hút các dự án như Homebase và Credix – những cái tên cần tương tác tài sản thời gian thực và hiệu quả. Trong khi đó, Liquid Network cũng không chịu kém cạnh khi thu hút các dự án như MikroKapital, USTBL và Blockstream Mining Note, mang đậm triết lý Bitcoin truyền thống. Giữa cuộc đua này, Solana đang định vị mình là một đối thủ đáng gờm, bổ sung cho vai trò lịch sử của Ethereum và cách tiếp cận tập trung vào Bitcoin của Liquid. Tất cả gợi ý rằng tương lai của token hóa tài sản thực sẽ là một thế giới đa chuỗi, nơi mỗi nền tảng đóng góp điểm mạnh riêng. Sự Nổi Lên của Solana Trong Token Hóa RWAs Token hóa tài sản thực (RWAs) là quá trình chuyển đổi quyền sở hữu các tài sản hữu hình (như bất động sản, hàng hóa) hoặc vô hình (như quyền sở hữu trí tuệ) thành các token số trên blockchain. Công nghệ này mang lại nhiều lợi ích, bao gồm quyền sở hữu phân đoạn, khả năng chuyển nhượng toàn cầu và thanh khoản tăng vọt cho các tài sản vốn dĩ khó tiếp cận. Không chỉ vậy, token hóa còn biến tài sản thành chương trình thông minh – tức là có thể tự động hóa việc tuân thủ, chia cổ tức, hay quản trị thông qua hợp đồng thông minh. Các tổ chức tài chính lớn và doanh nghiệp công nghệ tiên phong đã nhanh chóng nắm bắt cơ hội này vì tiềm năng tối ưu hóa quản lý tài sản, giảm phụ thuộc vào trung gian, và mở rộng cơ hội đầu tư. Các nền tảng như Bitfinex Securities thậm chí còn cung cấp cơ hội cho cả nhà phát hành chứng khoán token hóa lẫn nhà đầu tư – giúp họ tiếp cận những khoản đầu tư mà trước đây chỉ dành cho giới elite. Ban đầu, Ethereum là ngôi sao sáng nhất trong lĩnh vực RWA nhờ hệ sinh thái mạnh mẽ và khả năng lập trình linh hoạt. Các tổ chức lớn như BlackRock , JPMorgan và Ngân hàng đầu tư châu Âu đã thử nghiệm token hóa trái phiếu, chứng khoán và tài sản thương mại trên nền tảng này. Tuy nhiên, vấn đề phí cao và tốc độ chậm đã khiến nhiều dự án phải tìm kiếm phương án khác. Đây là lúc Solana bước vào cuộc chơi với tốc độ xử lý siêu nhanh, phí cực thấp và cơ sở hạ tầng ngày càng hoàn thiện. Các dự án như Homebase (bất động sản), Baxus (hàng xa xỉ), và Credix (tín dụng tư nhân) đang tận dụng sức mạnh của Solana để thử nghiệm và mở rộng quy mô token hóa RWAs. Liquid Network, một sidechain của Bitcoin được phát triển bởi Blockstream, mang đến một lựa chọn khác biệt so với Ethereum và Solana. Trong khi Ethereum nổi bật với hệ sinh thái đa dạng và tính linh hoạt của hợp đồng thông minh, Solana thu hút bằng tốc độ và chi phí thấp, thì Liquid lại tập trung vào bảo mật, tối giản và niềm tin vào nguyên tắc gốc của Bitcoin. Liquid ưu tiên tính toán xác định, thực thi hợp đồng minh bạch và giao dịch bảo mật – tất cả đều phù hợp với triết lý Bitcoin ban đầu. Thay vì chạy theo sự phức tạp của DeFi, Liquid tập trung vào các hợp đồng đơn giản, an toàn và dễ kiểm toán. Điều này làm cho nó trở thành lựa chọn lý tưởng cho các ứng dụng tài chính yêu cầu độ tin cậy cao, chẳng hạn như phát hành trái phiếu vi mô ( MikroKapital ), tín phiếu kho bạc Mỹ mã hóa ( USTBL ), hoặc hợp đồng khai thác Bitcoin ( Blockstream Mining Note) . So Sánh Token Hóa RWAs Trên Solana Với Các Blockchain Khác Ba nền tảng này đại diện cho ba chiến lược khác nhau trong việc tích hợp tài chính truyền thống vào blockchain. Ethereum, với hệ sinh thái DeFi phong phú, vẫn là lựa chọn hàng đầu cho các thí điểm RWA lớn. Tuy nhiên, chi phí cao và tốc độ chậm khiến nhiều nhà phát triển chuyển sang Layer 2 hoặc các chuỗi bên thứ ba. Solana, với thiết kế single-shard và token primitives tùy chỉnh, cung cấp một môi trường lý tưởng cho các ứng dụng RWA đòi hỏi tốc độ và tương tác thời gian thực. Các tính năng như token extensions cho phép áp đặt hạn chế chuyển nhượng, tự động hóa lãi suất và tích hợp tuân thủ ngay tại cấp độ token – điều mà Ethereum thường phải dựa vào hợp đồng bên ngoài. Trong khi đó, Liquid Network không cố gắng cạnh tranh về tốc độ hay khả năng lập trình, mà tập trung vào tính bảo mật và đơn giản. Những tính năng như giao dịch bảo mật và hợp đồng tài chính ít rủi ro làm cho nó trở thành lựa chọn hấp dẫn cho các tổ chức yêu cầu kiểm toán chặt chẽ và báo cáo minh bạch. Các Tổ Chức Đang Nghiêng Về Đâu? Hiện tại, các tổ chức lớn vẫn chủ yếu dựa vào Ethereum nhờ tính ổn định và hệ sinh thái tuân thủ pháp lý. Tuy nhiên, Solana đang dần thu hút sự chú ý từ các tổ chức mới và các công ty fintech nhờ khả năng đáp ứng khối lượng lớn và độ trễ thấp. Liquid Network, mặc dù không quá nổi bật trong các tiêu đề lớn, lại rất phù hợp với các thị trường song phương hoặc phát hành token chứng khoán – nơi tính bảo mật và đơn giản được ưu tiên hơn tốc độ hay tính linh hoạt. Ethereum vẫn là lựa chọn mặc định cho các cấu trúc tài sản lớn và phức tạp, trong khi Solana đang chiếm lĩnh tâm trí của các nhà phát triển trẻ với các ứng dụng RWA yêu cầu tốc độ và thay đổi trạng thái thường xuyên. Liquid, dù hoạt động lặng lẽ, vẫn đóng vai trò quan trọng trong các trường hợp đặc thù, nơi tính bảo mật, đơn giản và tương thích với Bitcoin là ưu tiên hàng đầu. Tóm Lại Là: Token hóa tài sản thực (RWAs) đang tiến tới một tương lai đa chuỗi, nơi Ethereum, Solana và Liquid Network đều có vai trò riêng. Ethereum vẫn là ông lớn trong các dự án quy mô lớn và phức tạp. Solana nổi bật với tốc độ và chi phí thấp, phù hợp cho các ứng dụng năng động. Liquid Network, với triết lý Bitcoin truyền thống, là lựa chọn lý tưởng cho các giao dịch bảo mật và đơn giản. Cuộc chơi này không phải là cuộc chiến loại trừ, mà là câu chuyện về sự bổ sung. Mỗi nền tảng sẽ tiếp tục khẳng định vị thế của mình trong thế giới token hóa tài sản thực, tạo nên một hệ sinh thái đa dạng và đầy tiềm năng.

2025-05-26T13:40:38.000Z,"Tracking the Fed’s next steps: All eyes are on this Friday’s PCE print","Investors are preparing for a volatile week as the US prepares to release inflation data on Friday while markets digest new tariff threats from President Donald Trump and fiscal concerns surrounding America’s federal deficit. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data on Friday at around 11 AM ET. Analysts expect the headline PCE index to ease slightly to 2.2%, down from 2.3% in March, with the core PCE, which excludes food and energy, likely to witness little to no change. The Fed could use the data to look for signs of inflation moderation and weigh on interest rate cuts in its June meeting. Fed inflation policy data in focus According to data from the BEA, the Core PCE Price Index dropped to 2.6% in March from 3.0% in February. The metric has averaged 3.24% since 1960, only peaking at 10.22% in February 1975. Monthly forecasts point to a 0.1% increase in PCE, while personal income is expected to rise 0.3%, and personal spending is seen slowing to 0.2%, down sharply from 0.7% in March. The Cleveland Fed’s Nowcast model sees little deviation in core figures, although geopolitical tensions caused by Trump tariffs could cause a slight change in the prediction The outcome of Friday’s PCE report could influence the Federal Reserve ’s next monetary policy steps. A softer print may give Fed Chair Jerome Powell more reason to cut borrowing rates next month, while an uptick could give the central bank more reason to wait. Fed minutes from the last meeting, due Wednesday, may give investors several insights into policymakers’ deliberations, particularly on tariff risks and inflation persistence. The Fed insists that it requires more evidence before considering easing rates. On Friday, President Trump proposed raising tariffs on EU goods to 50%, up from the current 20%. The announcement came as the S&P 500 neared 6,000. The index failed to go past 5,962, although volatility is much lower than levels seen back on April 2, “Liberation Day.” US debt worries amplify yield swings Last week, the House passed a tax-and-spending bill backed by Trump and projected to expand the federal deficit significantly. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add nearly $4 trillion to the federal debt, currently at $36 trillion. Yields on 10-year US Treasury dropped to 4.45% on Friday, retreating from a three-month high of 4.64%. The bond market is closed Monday for Memorial Day, but the focus will return to auctions later this week amid signs of weaker demand for longer-dated maturities. This week’s auctions include $69 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday, $70 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday, and $44 billion in seven-year notes on Thursday. Other economic reports due this week include the Case-Shiller home price index for March on Tuesday and weekly jobless claims on Thursday. Bitcoin recovers after weekend-long stumble In the crypto market, Bitcoin has recovered from a price volatility that started late Friday and ensued over the weekend, briefly falling to $106,000 before rebounding to levels above $109,000. President Trump’s threat to the EU had pushed the largest crypto by market cap down 2% at the close of Friday’s stock market trading session. BTC is now 1.4% up within the 3-day period. The BTC July-to-June volatility spread, which exceeded 2 vols last week, has now compressed to below 1. This could mean holders are bracing for more policy-driven market turbulence and are unsure if the Trump administration will agree with the European bloc before the July 9 deadline.

It has moved above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. More importantly, the token broke above the key resistance at $2.1271, the upper boundary of an ascending triangle pattern. VIRTUAL has also climbed above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, while the Relative Strength Index is trending upward. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the all-time high of $5.1335, its peak in January. A move to that level would represent a 135% gain from the current price.

2025-05-26T13:13:48.000Z,"Why Ethereum’s $300 Billion Empire Could Either Soar to $10,000 ETH Price or Get Crushed by Solana in 2025","Ethereum (ETH) is looking to seize the current opportunity and kickstart its 2025 bull market with style. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently showing strong resilience in the face of uncertainty in the altcoin market, which just hasn’t been able to capture the clues from Bitcoin’s recent strong showing. ETH has struggled against BTC, especially since the last bull market of 2020- 2021. Back then, the programmable cryptocurrency project posed a major challenge to BTC’s hegemony and dictated the entire altcoin market. However, the altcoin market has now decoupled itself from ETH and operates largely independently. It also outperforms ETH on most turns. Things might change in the coming months or so. ETH is recovering strongly against BTC, and it will likely end in a massive price reversal for the former. Currently, it is changing hands just below $2600. Ethereum to Rise to $10,000 According to popular X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Kamran Asghar, the rise of ETH against BTC defies a 4-year downward trend since 2021. He tweeted this picture: Image Source: X He stated that the bullish divergence of the ETH/BTC chart has started, and a major move will help ETH recover its losses against BTC. He predicted that a move to $10,000 is imminent and will usher in a new era of development for ETH. Ethereum’s Challenges However, Ethereum currently faces several challenges in its quest to regain its position in the cryptocurrency market charts. While the digital asset has shown resilience in the face of recent global economic uncertainty, the situation remains precarious as trade barriers increase and liquidity suffers. Also, ETH’s downgrading against BTC and the larger crypto market cannot just be blamed on the market forces. The layer-1 blockchain has hit several development roadblocks over the last few years despite hands-on efforts by Vitalik Buterin, the head of the Ethereum Foundation. The most significant underlying issue with ETH was its operational capacity. Its slow, limited network was hampering efforts to open up blockchain adoption around the world. As a result, many newer projects like Solana, SUI, and Chainlink were able to come forward as alternatives to ETH and capture some of the market. The Future Despite ETH’s latest troubles, it still commands a massive $300 billion position in the cryptocurrency market. If ETH can enact crucial, effective updates on time, it can catch up and end 2025 on a new footing. Failure to do so will see ETH increasingly squeezed by Bitcoin and alternatives like Solana and maybe one day overtaken by it.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/why-ethereums-300-billion-empire-could-either-soar-to-10000-eth-price-or-get-crushed-by-solana-in-2025/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Ethereum|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeaways Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends. Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s. They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading. They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin ( BTC ) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started . No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners. Why analyze Bitcoin price charts Technical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin ( BTC ) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics , platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading. Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick charts Candlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions. Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time. They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment. They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements. A candlestick represents four key price points: The opening price at the start of the period The closing price at the end of the period The highest price reached during the period The lowest price reached during the period. A candlestick is formed of a body , the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down. The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame. Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700. Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including: Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor . For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe. Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTC Candlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions. Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market. 1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profile Volume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave Theory The Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment. 4. Other indicators The relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time. The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days. Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Password Kidnapping Case Highlights Escalating Crypto Crime","Woeltz allegedly detained the victim for weeks in a luxury townhouse and subjected him to horrific abuse, including electric shocks and drug coercion. Meanwhile, in London, an American tourist lost $123,000 in Bitcoin after being drugged and robbed by a fake taxi driver. Adding to the concern, a crypto user was scammed twice in three hours, losing $2.6 million in USDT to a zero-value phishing attack. Bitcoin Ransom Horror Unfolds in Manhattan A Manhattan-based crypto investor was charged in a deeply disturbing case involving the alleged kidnapping and torture of a 28-year-old Italian man, in an apparent attempt to steal access to his Bitcoin wallet. The accused, John Woeltz, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court and faces four felony charges, including kidnapping for ransom. The incident reportedly took place inside a luxury Soho townhouse rented for $30,000 per month, where the victim claims he was held captive for several weeks beginning shortly after his arrival in the US on May 6. According to law enforcement and reporting by The New York Times, Woeltz and an unidentified accomplice allegedly seized the man’s passport and electronic devices and demanded his Bitcoin wallet password. When the man refused to comply, he was subjected to a horrifying ordeal that included being beaten, electroshocked, assaulted with a firearm, and even dangled from upper floors of the five-story townhouse. The victim also stated that Woeltz used a saw to injure his leg and forced him to smoke crack cocaine. Threats were reportedly made against the man’s family as well. Investigators found photographic evidence, including Polaroid pictures inside the residence, which appeared to corroborate the victim’s claims of sustained abuse. The victim managed to escape on Friday and contacted authorities, which led to Woeltz’s arrest. At his court appearance, Woeltz pleaded not guilty and was ordered to be held without bail by Judge Eric Schumacher. He is due back in court on May 28. Police also detained a 24-year-old woman in connection with the case, but no formal charges against her appear in the court’s public records, and she was seen walking freely in New York the next day. Authorities have not revealed the nature of the relationship between Woeltz and the victim or whether any digital assets were ultimately compromised. The incident only added to the growing concerns over the physical security risks faced by people involved in the cryptocurrency space. Reports of kidnappings and extortion targeting crypto holders have risen sharply, particularly in France, where high-profile individuals are increasingly turning to private security. Private security firm Infinite Risks International confirmed that there has been a surge in demand for bodyguards and long-term protection services from crypto entrepreneurs. In response, French authorities also rolled out enhanced protective measures, including fast-tracked police assistance and security briefings for those in the crypto industry. The issue gained some urgency after multiple incidents over the past few years. This includes the January 2025 kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland, who was rescued by French law enforcement after being held for several days. Similarly, in May, the father of an unnamed crypto entrepreneur was freed during a police raid in a Paris suburb after being kidnapped by organized criminals. Tourist Drugged and Robbed of $123K in Bitcoin An American tourist visiting London also recently reportedly lost $123,000 in Bitcoin after being drugged and robbed by a person impersonating a taxi driver. Jacob Irwin-Cline, the victim, spent the evening at a local bar before attempting to take an Uber home. However, he mistakenly entered a different vehicle driven by someone who resembled his expected Uber driver. The man was posing as a legitimate driver, and allegedly offered Cline a cigarette that was likely laced with scopolamine, which is a powerful and uncommon sedative that is known for its ability to incapacitate victims. (Source: MyLondon ) Cline recalled feeling immediately drowsy and soon passed out for approximately 30 minutes. When he regained consciousness, the driver abruptly told him to get out of the car. As he stepped out, the driver sped off, striking him with the vehicle and fleeing the scene. The assailant made off with Cline’s cellphone, which held access to his cryptocurrency holdings, including private keys and wallet applications. The theft amounted to a staggering $123,000 in stolen Bitcoin. The incident also added to the growing list of alarming cases involving crypto-related crimes targeting unsuspecting individuals and well known figures in the digital asset industry. With an increasing number of crypto users carrying sensitive financial data on mobile devices, this attack shed some light on the rising risks and the urgent need for caution when navigating the digital space and the real world. Investor Loses $2.6M in Double Crypto Scam Kidnappings are not the only crimes people in the crypto space should be looking out for. A single crypto investor reportedly fell victim to two scams in just three hours, which caused them to lose a staggering $2.6 million in USDT (Tether) through an advanced form of on-chain phishing known as a zero-value transfer. According to data shared by crypto compliance firm Cyvers on May 26, the victim first transferred $843,000 worth of USDT, followed by a second transaction totaling $1.75 million shortly after. The scam involved a deceptive tactic that exploits the structure of blockchain token transfers to trick users into sending funds to fraudulent addresses. Zero-value transfers are a sophisticated phishing technique where attackers use the “From” function in token contracts to initiate transfers of zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address. Because the transaction amount is zero, it does not require the victim’s signature or approval, but it still appears in their on-chain transaction history. This subtle deception can mislead users into believing the address is trustworthy or familiar, increasing the chance that they later send real funds to the attacker. (Source: Coinbase ) This method is seen as an evolution of the older address poisoning technique, in which attackers send small amounts of tokens from lookalike wallet addresses—often mimicking the beginning and end of a known address. Users who rely on partial matching or past transaction history may then accidentally send funds to these malicious addresses. When combined with zero-value transfers, this attack becomes even more convincing and difficult to detect. The threat is growing across multiple blockchains. A study that was published in January 2025 revealed more than 270 million poisoning attempts on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July of 2022 and June of 2024. Of those, more than 6,000 attacks were successful, and resulted in over $83 million in total losses. In one high-profile case in 2023, a scammer used the zero-transfer technique to steal $20 million before being blacklisted by Tether.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9269/bitcoin-password-kidnapping-case-highlights-escalating-crypto-crime,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|USDT","News|Security",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T13:10:43.000Z,"HYPE rockets past rivals as Hyperliquid sets new user and TVL records","Hyperliquid native token HYPE has set a new all-time high at $39.92 after rising almost 10% in the last 24 hours. The milestone continues the positive performance of the protocol in 2025. According to data from CoinMarketCap , the decentralized derivatives exchange token has seen its value increase by 111% in the last 30 days, a factor that contributed to its new peak. The token has enjoyed a relatively positive performance in 2025, enough to make it up 45% year to date. This makes HYPE one of the best-performing altcoins in a generally rough year for other cryptocurrencies, apart from Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin is up 16% this year, major altcoins such as Ether, Solana, BNB, LINK, and ADA are down YTD. Even major altcoins with gains this year, such as XRP and TRX, have only seen single-digit positive performance, with Monero XMR being the only top 20 cryptocurrency that is up more than 100% this year. Meanwhile, HYPE’s recent performance has sent it higher on the list of top crypto by market capitalization. It is now ranked eleventh according to CoinMarketCap with $12.72 billion, higher than SUI with $12.05 billion but still far behind TRX, which has a $25.83 billion market cap. HYPE is riding the crypto whale watching train The positive performance for HYPE is tied to Hyperliquid growth and increased activity in the past few weeks. The decentralized derivatives trading exchange has come into the spotlight as the trading venue for crypto whales betting on or against the market. With whales such as James Wynn and the Machi Big Brother using Hyperliquid to execute trades and make millions in profits, the platform has attracted the attention of more traders who have praised it for its transparency. All these have allowed Hyperliquid to set new records with multiple all-time highs. In the last 24 hours, it saw $10.1 billion open interest, $5.6 million in daily fees, and $3.5 billion in USDC total value locked. It also set a record for a new peak in daily active users with 18,000 unique addresses. HyperEVM set a new ATH for active users per day at 18,000 (Source: Hyperliquid News) Despite its recent surge in activity, Hyperliquid ranks ninth on the list of DEX platforms for trading volume in the last seven days, with $2.55 billion, far below PancakeSwap and Uniswap with $55.68 billion and $27.01 billion. Besides the increased activity, Hyperliquid tokenomics has also made it attractive to several investors, boosting its demand. There is an ongoing buyback of HYPE tokens, and multiple whales are piling on the asset. According to Lookonchain , eight whales bought over 930,000 HYPE tokens worth around $33 million in the last three days. Interestingly, another whale who held 1.45 million HYPE worth $55 million for 5 months has started selling and stands to realize over $28 million in profits if he sells everything. Hyperliquid Foundation recovers its account The bullish expectations for the HYPE token remain, with many crypto investors bullish on the token. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is one of the HYPE bulls and has predicted that the token could reach $100. Signs of that strong bullish sentiment are also evident in how a whale recently lost over $23 million trying to short HYPE and eventually had to liquidate and close his positions. Meanwhile, any sign of headwinds for the project appears to have been eliminated after the Hyperliquid Foundation account on X was recovered following a breach. Bad actors had initially gained control of the account, using it to promote scam projects that have now been deleted. Hyerliquid confirmed that the breach did not affect its blockchain or other social media channels. It added that it is working with X’s security team to investigate the account compromise, but the incident touched none of its internal systems, emails, or credentials.

2025-05-26T13:10:13.000Z,"Bitcoin Has Made Getting Rich So Easy, Says Robert Kiyosaki","In a world where capitalists dominate most economies, people are constantly searching for ways to accumulate wealth. Bitcoin presents an easy path for this, according to finance guru and entrepreneur Robert Kiyosaki. The Rich Dad, Poor Dad author believes bitcoin (BTC) has made it so easy for anyone to get rich and insists more people should be buying the digital asset. “Don’t Be a Yellow Banana” Kiyosaki insists that even as little as .01 BTC is going to be priceless in two years and would likely make any investor very rich. Hence, he is baffled that everyone is not buying and holding BTC. He acknowledged that BTC goes up and down, as does real life. However, with only 2.1 million BTC left to be mined, the cryptocurrency’s price is bound to enter the “banana zone.” Raoul Paul, CEO and co-founder of Real Vision Group and Global Macro Investor, describes the banana zone as a period of rapid price increase during which BTC records new highs very often. This is usually a price discovery phase during a bull market. Kiyosaki says people who would miss the easiest time in history to become rich and financially free via bitcoin are yellow bananas. “Don’t be a yellow banana. Open your eyes and your mind and listen to people like Raoul Pal, Michael Saylor, Anthony Pompliano, and many others, then follow content on Bitcoin Zella and look into the future of money,” he urged his followers. Obeying The Laws of Money The Rich Dad author’s latest words come shortly after he advised people not to break the two most important laws of money. The first law is Gresham’s, which states that bad money drives out good money. The second, Metcalfe’s Law of networks, postulates that the value of a service or product increases as more people use it. Kiyosaki asserted that most people are poor because they are breaking those two laws when applied to the monetary system. He said he invests in Bitcoin because it is a network, whereas most cryptocurrencies are not. The finance guru says he does not save U.S. dollars because the currency violates Gresham’s law. Likewise, he does not put his money in shit coins without networks because they violate Metcalfe’s law. He keeps saving gold, silver, and BTC because they obey the laws.

Bitcoin bounced back near the $110,000 mark. Cardano also surged 3% in the last 24 hours, outpacing many of the altcoins. It is currently trading at $0.767, up 3.8%. Will ADA Hit $1 Soon? According to CoinDCX , ADA could trade between $0.66 and $1.88 in 2025. Some analysts predict that it could even reach up to $2.36. To continue its bullish trend, ADA needs to break out above the $0.85-$0.90 resistance zone. If it holds above $0.83, then we could see a strong push toward $0.90 or even $1.00 soon. On the flip side, if ADA drops below $0.76, then it might slip into a bearish trend with support levels at $0.75 and $0.70. Bullish Technical Signs For ADA Cardano’s most technical indicators are neutral, while MACD shows a slightly bearish sign. RSI is also balanced at 53. The short-term and mid-term EMAs and SMAs are also bullish. Price is also trading above key averages like 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100-day lines. Only the 200-day moving average is bearish, which shows long-term resistance. Further, there is growing optimism over the launch of ADA ETFs in 2025, which could drive demand for the coin. To top it all, nearly $1 billion worth of ADA has been pulled off exchanges, which shows that investors are accumulating ADA and are confident in its growth prospects.

2025-05-26T13:02:46.000Z,"Aussie Senator Dismisses Bitcoin As A ‘Ponzi Scheme’, Sparks Fierce Community Backlash","Australian Senator Gerard Rennick has attracted the ire of the Bitcoin community following his remarks referring to Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme driven by asset managers like BlackRock , and questioning the top cryptocurrency’s value because it can’t be eaten. Bitcoin Will Ultimately Hit $1 Million Because It’s A Ponzi Scheme Bitcoin (BTC) may be gaining momentum globally, but an Australian politician is still not sold on the asset. “You can’t eat Bitcoin,” Senator Gerard Rennick posited in a recent post, responding to an X user who sarcastically asked for his comments after Bitcoin set a new record high of around $111,800 on May 22. Rennick went on to lambast Bitcoin as a “Ponzi Scheme.” “Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why? Because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply-constrained product,” the Queensland Senator said. He also claimed that Bitcoin and its traders contribute “absolutely nothing” in terms of real-world utility, and that Australia “needs real engineers, not financial engineers.” Yes I do – Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby Blackrock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product. What exactly will this product produce? Absolutely nothing and nor will the thousands of people… — Senator Gerard Rennick (@SenatorRennick) May 23, 2025 Bitcoiners and industry commentators were quick to fire back at the Senator’s remarks. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) noted that Rennick’s comments about Bitcoin “reveal a deep misunderstanding,” warning that misinformed takes from public officials could lead to “bad policy.” “This isn’t about whether Australians can use Bitcoin—we already do,” ABIB postulated. “This is about whether our government is capable of understanding how Bitcoin can enrich the nation… The door is open for ongoing education. The question is: are you willing to walk through it?” Unchained podcast host Laura Shin asked the Senator, “You also can’t eat the internet, so do you oppose that too?” As more X users commented, the Senator slammed critics, saying, “You’re disappointed about what a politician thinks about Bitcoin? Seriously? I thought you wanted less political interference. Why does it matter what I think? Invest as you will.” Bitcoiners often speak out when well-known people adopt an anti-Bitcoin stance. Just a couple of weeks ago, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs was criticized by the Bitcoin community after vetoing a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/aussie-senator-dismisses-bitcoin-as-a-ponzi-scheme-sparks-fierce-community-backlash/,"BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-05-26T13:00:56.000Z,"Trump’s Crypto Supper Stirs DC—Yet One Political Powerhouse Stays Cool","US House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept quiet on a growing ethics flap around a crypto dinner hosted by US President Donald Trump. He told CNN on May 25 that he hadn’t heard about the event and wouldn’t weigh in. Meanwhile, 35 House Democrats want a Justice Department probe and the guest list made public. Democrats Call For Probe According to reports, 35 House Democrats formally asked the Justice Department to investigate Trump’s May 22 dinner for top holders of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin. They worry that some of the biggest buyers may be foreign nationals, which could break bribery rules or the Constitution’s emoluments clause. Senator Elizabeth Warren called it an “orgy of corruption” at a press conference on the same day. Questions Over Foreign Funds Based on reports from Bloomberg on May 7, a majority of the 220 invitees to the dinner likely came from outside the US. That includes Justin Sun, the Chinese-born CEO of Tron, who has the largest share of TRUMP tokens. Some critics point out there’s no clear record of where the money came from or how much each person paid to attend. Johnson Stays Silent On May 25, Jake Tapper asked Johnson why the names weren’t released and if he’d be upset if a Democratic president did the same. Johnson said he “doesn’t know anything about the dinner” and that he’d been “a little busy” passing a $1.6 trillion budget bill. He also praised Trump as “the most transparent president” and insisted there was nothing to hide. New Bill Seeks To Ban Profits That same day, Representative Maxine Waters and 14 colleagues introduced the “Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act.” The bill would bar Trump and his family from making money off any crypto venture while he’s in office. Waters pointed to figures showing Trump’s crypto platform, World Liberty Financial , has made over $350 million in fees and profits tied to his memecoin. Wider Crypto Concerns Investors in TRUMP tokens saw a 60% jump in price when the dinner was announced. Australian entrepreneur Kain Warwick even told The New York Times on May 12 that he bought enough tokens to get into the top 25 holders so he could get an invite. Sheldon Xia, CEO of BitMart in the Cayman Islands, posted photos of himself at the event, adding to questions about foreign influence. Legal Limits On Gifts Under the Constitution’s emoluments clause , a president may not accept any gift from a foreign state without Congress’s approval. If some of the crypto investors gave what amounts to a gift or payment to gain access, they could be in legal hot water. Ethics experts say the lack of transparency makes it hard to rule out violations.

According to the official press release sent to crypto.news, the Proof of Reserve integration will be deployed into three areas of the ecosystem, Solv Protocol, SolvBTC and xSolvBTC. The collaboration allows for real-time on-chain validation of asset backing for Solv’s offerings. This provides institutional investors and sovereign bodies with a much-needed feature that would deploy BTCFi and tokenized yield products through the Solv Protocol. As demand grows for tokenised real-world assets and BTC-based yield strategies among institutional investors, the two projects have decided to join forces to strengthen Solv’s offerings. The integration of the decentralized oracle network’s PoR positions Solv as a trusted platform for institutions looking to access BTC ( BTC ) yields through SolvBTC, tokenized real-world credit exposure via xSolvBTC and finally, collateralized DeFi on the main Solv Protocol. Therefore, all three products will receive individual data dashboards on the Chainlink ( LINK ) platform . You might also like: TRON blockchain is switching oracles from WINkLink to Chainlink This collaboration aligns with Solv’s current efforts to establish itself as a financial infrastructure for Bitcoin yield backed by real-world assets, ranging from U.S. Treasuries to short-term credit. The integration also ensures users can verify asset reserves for these products across multiple blockchains, including BNB Chain for Solv Protocol and Ethereum for SolvBTC and xSolvBTC. “This unlocks capital-efficient yield on Bitcoin, backed not by crypto-native protocols, but real-world, creditworthy instruments, with continuous verification on-chain,” wrote Solv in its statement. Most recently, Solv launched the first Shariah-compliant BTC staking product that gained certification from Amanie Advisors and trusted by firms like Franklin Templeton, Daman Investments, and Nomura. With Middle Eastern sovereigns already allocating funds into BTC ETFs, Shariah-certified and transparently backed on-chain yield could open the door for more investment opportunities. Overall, Chainlink PoR provides Solv offerings with independent attestations without the need for third-party custodians, real-time feeds with data suited for institutional frameworks, and de-risked vaults that ensure more transparency and compliance for capital investors.

2025-05-26T13:00:40.000Z,"Crypto ETP Inflows Top $10.8 Billion, Marking New Record","Crypto ETP interest surged last week, pushing year-to-date (YTD) inflows past the $10 billion mark, according to a report published by CoinShares on May 26. The week ending May 24 alone saw a massive $3.3 billion in inflows, boosting total YTD inflows to $10.8 billion. CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said the total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs briefly hit an all-time high of $187.5 billion last week. He attributed the rise to investors reacting to growing economic concerns in the United States. “We believe that growing concerns over the US economy, driven by the Moody’s downgrade and the resulting spike in treasury yields, have prompted investors to seek diversification through digital assets,” Butterfill noted. Bitcoin Dominates Inflows, XRP Sees Massive Outflows Bitcoin once again led the inflows, attracting $2.9 billion last week, which now accounts for roughly a quarter of all ETP inflows in 2024. As Bitcoin briefly soared above $110,000 on May 22 , some investors also sought downside exposure, driving short-Bitcoin product inflows to $12.7 million—the highest since December 2024. Ether ETPs also maintained strong momentum, bringing in $326 million in inflows. This marked the fifth consecutive week of gains for Ethereum investment products, helped by the recent success of the Pectra network upgrade which launched on May 7. In contrast, XRP investment products suffered a major setback. After maintaining an inflow streak for 80 straight weeks, XRP ETP products experienced $37.2 million in outflows—the largest on record. This sharp reversal came despite two bullish developments: speculation around a U.S.-based spot XRP ETF and a $2.2 billion spike in XRP futures activity. ETP Market Continues to Break Records The record-breaking $10.8 billion in YTD inflows highlights the resilience of digital asset investment products despite market volatility earlier this year. Just weeks ago, CoinShares reported $785 million in inflows for mid-May, pushing the YTD total to $7.5 billion by May 16. The latest figures now surpass the previous record of $7.2 billion set in February and fully offset the nearly $7 billion in outflows that occurred during the market correction that followed. With institutional and retail interest holding strong, crypto ETPs are on track for a historic year , further cementing their role in mainstream investment portfolios.

2025-05-26T13:00:37.000Z,"Is The Bitcoin Rally Over After $111,900 ATH? Global M2 Money Supply Is Still Going","Bitcoin has seen a sharp pullback in the past few days, dropping below $110,000 after setting a fresh all-time high of $111,900 just four days ago. The correction saw the price fall as low as $107,500 before rebounding slightly, raising doubts among investors about the strength of the recent rally. Despite this retracement, some analysts argue that the bullish structure is still intact for Bitcoin. Particularly, crypto analyst Colin pointed to an interesting macroeconomic indicator called the Global M2 Money Supply as a reason for continued optimism. Global M2 Money Supply Says Bitcoin Rally Still Strong According to an analysis posted by crypto analyst Colin on the social media platform X, Bitcoin continues to track the global M2 money supply with accuracy offset by an 82-day lag. The chart highlights that the global M2 aggregate, which reflects the total liquidity circulating in the world’s largest economies, has recently hit a new all-time high. Historically, Bitcoin has closely mirrored this trend with a slight delay, and Colin believes this pattern suggests there is still considerable room for the Bitcoin price to climb. Related Reading: Bitcoin Vs. Global M2 Money Remains Bullish To Push Price To New ATH Above $100,000 The correlation between the Global M2 money supply and Bitcoin’s price action is statistically significant across various time frames, with the highest correlation of 93% found in the 1½-year window. This strong correlation shows that Bitcoin’s recent rally is on the back of deeper monetary expansion trends. Keeping this in mind, the interpretation is that Bitcoin is undergoing a healthy retracement within a broader upward trend, especially when viewed in the context of the global money supply. The pullback to $107,500 doesn’t invalidate the bullish setup, and Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the previous consolidation level between $102,000 and $104,000 is also a positive note. Colin: Social Sentiment Still Skeptical, But Data Speaks Loudly Despite the new $111,900 all-time high and Bitcoin bulls successfully holding its breakout level as support, social sentiment is still somewhat uncertain. This was also noted by Colin, who pointed out that many market participants still doubt the sustainability of the breakout, describing this disbelief as ironic given the strength of the underlying data. Related Reading: Technical Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Blow Off Top To $325,000 – The Timeline Will Shock You Colin also referenced the CBBI (Crypto Bull Run Index), which currently reads 79, still comfortably below the overheated threshold. This indicates that, by normal standards, the market is far from its euphoric peak, and there’s still significant upside left in the cycle. The chart provided by Colin highlights a projected upward trajectory that would see Bitcoin breaking above current levels toward $130,000 and beyond if the M2 correlation continues to play out. Interestingly, Colin’s analysis of the Global M2 supply and its relation to Bitcoin has been spot on in predicting Bitcoin’s rally. In April, when Bitcoin dropped to as low as $74,000, he projected that May would mark the next major breakout period for Bitcoin’s price, and this forecast has materialized exactly as he anticipated. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $109,670, up by 2% in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-26T13:00:00.000Z,"MSTY: The MicroStrategy YieldMax ETF Has A 140% Yield And Lives Up To The Hype","Summary YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF's synthetic strategy around MSTR delivers extraordinary income, with a TTM yield of 140%, making it a net positive investment despite share price volatility. The ETF's unique approach leverages MSTR's Bitcoin exposure and options premiums, but investors must understand the risks and mechanics before diving in. MSTY's total return, factoring in distributions, is competitive with BTC and offers a compelling case for adventurous income-focused investors seeking indirect crypto exposure. While not a traditional capital appreciation play, MSTY's real income potential and innovative strategy have convinced me to consider starting a small position. I started going down a rabbit hole with the YieldMax ETFs , and while I am not necessarily fond of the synthetic strategy they employ, it's certainly interesting. When I saw that the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) has paid $30.25 of distribution income over the past year and has a distribution rate over the trailing twelve months (TTM) of 140.55%, I started to run the data to see where the red flags were. There is a lot to unpack, but the bottom line is that MSTY has been a net positive investment despite the erratic share price, and long-term investors have gotten their entire investment back and then some. MSTY creates an ownership position around Strategy (or MicroStrategy) Incorporated ( MSTR ) by building a synthetic position and generates income from deploying a covered call strategy against the indirect long position. MSTR is a proxy for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), and the fund managers at YieldMax have figured out a way to generate a large amount of income because of how lucrative the premiums are in the options market due to the volatility. I am not a shareholder, and I haven't been a fan of the strategy that YieldMax uses, but I can't argue with the math, as MSTR lives up to the hype. There is a real reason why MSTY has over $3.7 billion in assets under management ((AUM)). The real question becomes whether it's worth taking a shot at it after the previous history. This is not a capital appreciation play, and if you're feeling adventurous, MSTY could add a tremendous amount of forward income to your portfolio, but everything about it is volatile. I will dissect what MSTY does and break down the numbers, but I will tell you that this is not a hype investment and that the income generated does exceed 100% yields. Seeking Alpha Risks to Investing in MSTY Investors should not look at the 140% distribution yield and automatically assume this will be sustained over the next year or that investing in MSTY is a sure bet. The reality is that just like every other investment, MSTY comes with real risks. Investors should do a fair amount of due diligence because MSTY has a unique strategy, and its mechanics are a bit complicated. MSTY has built a synthetic position around MSTR , which is the world's largest BTC treasury company. MSTR owns 576,230 BTC, which means that MSTR's BTC holdings are worth roughly $62.63 billion. MSTR's success revolves around the adoption of BTC, which could be reversed at any point. If BTC becomes less desirable in the future, it would negatively impact MSTR and cause MSTY to decline in value. It would also negatively impact MSTY's ability to generate the same level of distribution, as the premiums around MSTR's option market could drastically change. Since its inception, MSTY has paid a monthly distribution as high as $4.13 and as low as $1.34. Investors should be very aware that they do not own BTC or MSTR directly through MSTY, and YieldMax is using a fancy strategy to create a position and generate income from these assets. MSTY could decline in value and see its distributions slashed if we enter into a crypto winter or BTC falls out of favor. The Math Checks Out for MSTY, and the Results Are Shocking YieldMax When I saw the TTM yield for MSTY, I thought it was a typo, but it's not. MSTY went public on February 21 st , 2024, for $20. Since then, its AUM has grown to $3.76 billion, which is astonishing to me, but then again, when I see the distribution rate and distribution yield, I can understand why investors are piling into it. Since its inception, MSTY has paid $36.90 in distributions, which is an 184.49% yield on the initial share price. Even if shares were purchased at $25 in the first month before the first distribution was declared, the yield on cost would still be 147.59%. This is real capital that has been generated and paid out to its shareholders. Unlike some of the other ETFs in the YieldMax product line, MSTY is still above its initial share price, has never declined past -15%, and at one point, the investment had more than doubled its share price at the end of 2024. There is significant volume as 18.83 million shares were traded on Friday, May 23 rd, and there is a compelling argument to be made for taking a flier on MSTY. Even if I look at MSTY on a YTD basis, shares of MSTY were trading for $32.48, and over the past year, it has paid $30.25 in distribution income. This is a yield on cost of 93.12%. While shares of MSTY have declined by -$10.96 (-33.74%) over the past year, its distribution income makes up for the loss of capital. For every share, investors still have an asset that is worth $21.52 and has pocketed $30.25 in distribution income and the current forward yield if the annualized distribution over the past year was to stay the same, these shares would produce 140.55% in forward distributable income. No matter how you look at MSTY, it's been a net positive investment over the past year or since its inception. Seeking Alpha The question that I had was how it compared to owning MSTR or BTC directly. Over the past year, BTC has appreciated by 58%, while MSTR has increased by 139%. This is where things get interesting because MSTY has declined by -33.74%, but the distribution income pads the losses and makes it a competitive investment. Shares of MSTY have declined from $32.48 to $21.52, but they generated $30.25 in distributed income. The yield on cost for MSTY over this period is 93.12%, and when the loss in capital appreciation is factored in, the total return from MSTY is 59.38%. MSTY has a total return that is nowhere near MSTR but slightly ahead of owning BTC. The aspect that is also interesting is that BTC doesn't generate income, and investors still have an asset in MSTY worth $21.52 while continuing to generate forward monthly income. There is an argument that could be made that MSTY is an interesting proxy to gain indirect exposure to BTC because there is a scenario where all of the initial investment could be paid back from the distribution, and the cost basis could be $0 in the future which is something we don't often see. Seeking Alpha How MSTY Works and Why Its Mechanics Need to be Understood Anyone who is interested in MSTY should read through its prospectus ( can be read here ). MSTY is an actively managed ETF that deploys an investment strategy to create synthetic exposure to MSTR and then utilizes a call option strategy to generate income. MSTY does not own MSTR directly and creates its indirect position by purchasing MSTR call options and selling MSTR puts options to replicate MSTR's movement in the stock market. The call options that are purchased and the puts that are sold are done so with a 1-6 month term and a stroke price that is close to the current share price of MSTR when the contracts are established. The combination creates an indirect investment with full exposure in both directions for the duration of the options contracts. Once again, just because MSTY owns calls and sells puts on MSTR, it does not actually own MSTR shares. The income that MSTY generates is generated by using a covered call spread strategy once the long synthetic exposure is established. MSTY will sell call options on MSTR to generate income. Since MSTY doesn't own MSTR outright, the calls that MSTY writes will be sold short with an expiration of 1 month or less and at a strike price that is at the money or up to 15% out of the money. This will cap the upside exposure to wherever MSTY writes the covered calls they are selling. If MSTR increases by 50% while this contract is written, MSTY will not reflect those gains, but they will replicate if MSTR declines by -50% because there is no downside protection built into the option strategy. The aspect that I find interesting is that MSTY has the latitude to deploy a covered call spread strategy when it believes there is a better opportunity, rather than sticking with straight-covered calls. MSTY may write call spreads rather than single-leg calls against its synthetic long position when it believes there is a better opportunity to do so. MSTY will do this when it believes MSTR will outperform, and it will take advantage of that by selling the call option it traditionally does to generate income and then buying a call option with a portion of the premium it collects at a higher strike price at the same expiration date. This is a big reason why the distribution income fluctuates so much: in some cases, MSTY is using part of the generated premium to purchase out-of-the-money calls on MSTR. By writing call spreads, MSTY can theoretically offset losses incurred from its short calls on MSTR if MSTR rises in value. This is a nice twist to the fund's strategy because if MSTR goes on a large bull run, shareholders of MSTY will also benefit. Conclusion While I haven't been fond of the YieldMax ETFs in the past, MSTY has my full attention. The math works in MSTY's favor as this has been a net positive investment regardless of whether we look at it since inception or on a 1-year basis. The income generated is real, and the current TTM yield is 140% based on the current share price. MSTY deploys a call option strategy to generate income but also leaves the door open to utilizing a call spread strategy, which can uncap the upside gains to a degree. It's hard to argue with the math behind MSTY, and while there are risks associated with this investment, it may be a situation where if you hold it for a long enough period, you could get your entire investment back from the distribution income and have a $0 cost basis on the remaining asset base. I'm not a shareholder, but I may actually start a small position in the future to force me to track MSTY's progress. The 140% yield got my attention, and after running the numbers and dissecting the strategy, I will say that YieldMax may be on to something with MSTY.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789809-msty-microstrategy-yieldmax-etf-140-percent-yield-lives-up-to-hype?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","MSTR|BTC-USD|MSTY",cryptocompare

While investors eagerly await the altcoin season, Wave Digital Assets CEO David Siemer shared his expectations. David Siemer, who participated in the Milk Road podcast, said that the bull run will continue for the rest of the year and that the bull will be dominated by Bitcoin. The analyst said that the rest of the year will be a market driven by institutional adoption and dominated by Bitcoin. “Right now, no institutions are buying anything other than Bitcoin. But Ethereum is also starting to get institutional interest.” Siemer, who also explained his expectations for altcoins other than Bitcoin, said that Ethereum, Solana and XRP are also good options. Ethereum Is a Solid Option! While Ethereum ranks first in the table as the largest altcoin, it does not rank first in terms of performance. In the face of the rise of faster, cheaper alternatives, Ethereum interest has shifted to layer-2 solutions like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. However, the analyst noted that Ethereum’s security and uptime remain unmatched, and said that Ethereum’s latest Pecrta update has removed the technical barriers to the rise. According to the analyst, ETH could gain new opportunities in terms of price performance. XRP Continues to Silently Rise! According to the analyst, XRP is supported by Ripple’s corporate partnerships and progress in regulatory clarity, especially following its legal victory against the SEC. This allows the analyst to remain optimistic for XRP. Stating that there are upcoming developments that could trigger a new rise in XRP, the analyst also expressed his confidence in the power of the XRP community. “The XRP community is real and consistent buying from the community will help XRP regain its previous all-time high of around $3.50.” Solana (SOL) Big Rival! Solana has seen new highs from the memecoin craze, but the analyst noted FTX-driven token launches as obstacles to SOL’s rise. Despite these challenges, the analyst said Solana remains the favorite with its sub-second transaction times and negligible fees. Barring any major technical disruptions, such as the occasional network outages it has experienced in the past, Solana could be a standout performer in 2025, the analyst added. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has entered a new price zone and is showing strong signs that the uptrend is far from over.

In fact, the retracement appears healthy and technically sound, offering a potential setup for another leg higher.

Structure remains bullish, with a clear sequence of higher highs and higher lows from the $91,500 swing low. Fibonacci extension from the most recent impulse projects a target of $120,000, offering a technically sound next milestone. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Since establishing the $111,800 high, Bitcoin has pulled back into a zone that now acts as critical support. This region around $106,500 has held firm over recent sessions and is bolstered by the presence of the 0.618 Fibonacci level and a confluence of moving averages. These overlapping signals add strong validity to the idea that this is a natural higher low formation, not a breakdown. The bullish market structure remains intact. From the key swing low at $91,500, Bitcoin has consistently carved out higher lows and higher highs which represents signs of a strong trend. As long as $106,500 continues to hold, momentum remains with the bulls. The current pause in the market appears to be a consolidation within an uptrend rather than a reversal or topping pattern.

This target isn’t arbitrary, it’s derived from a 1.618 Fibonacci extension drawn from the $91,500 low to the $111,800 high. It also serves as a psychological milestone for traders and investors alike. As momentum rebuilds, this becomes the most logical next stop for price, provided the support zone holds. What to expect in the coming price action If $106,500 continues to act as support, Bitcoin is likely forming its next higher low within the trend. This would set the stage for a fresh leg higher, with $120,000 as the next major technical and psychological target. Momentum favors the bulls, and a breakout could arrive as soon as this week.

2025-05-26T12:46:27.000Z,"Strategy buys 4,020 more Bitcoins for $427M, total holdings now at 580,250","Strategy, the Virginia-based firm known for pouring billions into Bitcoin and formerly MicroStrategy, confirmed Monday that it bought another 4,020 BTC last week, spending $427 million to do it. This pushes the firm’s total stash to 580,250 BTC, with an overall cost of $40.61 billion, according to a statement released today by the company. The new purchase happened between May 19 and May 25, and was fully funded through a combination of equity sales under three at-the-market (ATM) programs. The company said it acquired the latest Bitcoin batch at an average price of $106,237 per coin, factoring in all fees. The total amount of BTC held by Strategy now stands at 580,250, with the average entry price for all coins sitting at $69,979. The latest buy puts the company even further ahead as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. Strategy raised funds through three active share sale programs To raise the $427 million, Strategy sold shares through three different ATM setups. It sold 847,000 shares of Class A common stock ( MSTR ), bringing in $348.7 million under its $21 billion MSTR share sale program, which started May 1. After this round, the company still has about $18.63 billion worth of stock left to issue through that program. The firm also raised $67.9 million by selling 678,970 shares of its 8.00% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock (STRK). This STRK ATM program was launched on March 10, 2025, and has a total size of $21 billion, with about $20.72 billion still unused. In addition, Strategy used its brand new STRF ATM offering, established just days ago on May 22, to raise $10.4 million. This came from the sale of 104,423 shares of its 10.00% Series A perpetual strife preferred stock ( STRF ). The total size of the STRF program is $2.1 billion, leaving $2.09 billion still available for future fundraising. All proceeds were calculated net of sales commissions, and every dollar raised went directly into buying Bitcoin. Strategy did not use any debt or borrowings for this round. The announcement came as Bitcoin rose 2%, pushing back above $110,000, following news that Donald Trump extended the deadline on 50% tariffs targeting EU imports. The new decision moves the tariff date to July 9, giving traders and investors temporary breathing room. As a result, the crypto market responded with a rally. Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano each gained between 3% and 4%, while traditional markets also saw a lift. Strategy’s total investment in Bitcoin is now worth over $64 billion based on current prices, and the company also confirmed that the purchases were funded entirely from the MSTR, STRK, and STRF ATM programs.

2025-05-26T12:46:12.000Z,"Pakistan appoints special assistant to PM on blockchain and crypto","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif appointed Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib as his special assistant on blockchain and crypto. Saqib’s appointment takes effect immediately under Rule 4(6) of the Rules of Business, 1973. He has been granted the status of minister of state and will serve without salary or official benefits, according to a May 26 report in the English-language local news outlet, Pakistan Observer. The move follows a series of government initiatives aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s presence in the digital asset space. Just one day prior, Pakistan allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity exclusively for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers. In mid-May, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance also endorsed the creation of a dedicated body to regulate the country’s blockchain-based financial infrastructure. The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) will serve as a regulatory body to oversee licensing, regulate exchanges , custodians, wallets, tokenized platforms, stablecoins and decentralized finance applications. Related: Pakistan eyes crypto legal framework to boost foreign investment Saqib named special blockchain assistant Saqib is a graduate of the London School of Economics in the United Kingdom and received the title of Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire from King Charles III. He currently leads the Pakistan Crypto Council, where he appointed former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao as an adviser. He was also named in the Forbes 30 under 30 list. As a special assistant to the prime minister, Saqib will be tasked with drafting Financial Action Task Force (FATF)-compliant crypto regulations, launching state-backed Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining projects, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, land records and finance. He will not receive a salary, perks or privileges, according to Pakistan Observer.

Pakistani regulators recently proposed a regulatory framework for digital assets that is compliance-focused and in line with rules laid out by the FATF. Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director Sumera Azam described the framework as a “paradigm shift in how Pakistan views digital finance.” “The policy proposal seeks to strike a historic balance between technological advancement and national security imperatives,” Azam said in April.

2025-05-26T12:45:55.000Z,"Floodgate About to Open for XRP As Ripple Replaces Bitcoin At Highest Level","In a striking signal that the tides in the crypto landscape may be shifting, prominent commentator The Real Remi Relief took to his X account to share his excitement over Ripple’s recent appearance on Fox News . Quoting a post highlighting Ripple’s coverage, The Real Remi Relief declared, “Flood Gates Are About To Open… No More BTC Logos. It’s All About RIPPLE XRP.” This bold statement has sparked fresh conversations across the crypto community, fueling speculation that XRP may be poised to eclipse Bitcoin (BTC) as the centerpiece of institutional and cross-border payment systems. Flood Gates Are About To Open…No More BTC Logos. It’s All About RIPPLE XRP https://t.co/Fm1SEsMqFh — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 25, 2025 Ripple’s Mainstream Spotlight Ripple’s feature on Fox News marks yet another milestone in the company’s steady climb toward mainstream financial recognition. As regulatory clarity around XRP continues to improve, Ripple has aggressively expanded its global partnerships. These include collaborations with banks, fintech companies, and payment service providers looking to leverage RippleNet and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border transactions. For years, Bitcoin has symbolized the face of cryptocurrency, largely due to its pioneering role and scarcity narrative. However, as real-world use cases take center stage, the crypto community is increasingly focusing on networks that offer scalability and utility rather than just store-of-value characteristics. Ripple’s technological backbone, combined with XRP’s design as a liquidity and bridge asset, positions it uniquely within this evolving landscape. XRP’s Supply Dynamics and Utility Potential An important point raised in the conversation comes from another X user, Bubbles, who offered thoughtful commentary on XRP’s potential. Bubbles noted, “The supply of BTC is relatively small, but the supply of XRP is large. If the practicality of XRP is truly promoted, then XRP will also become a bridge for cross-border payments .” This touches on one of the most misunderstood aspects of XRP: its large token supply. While Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million has fed the narrative of digital gold and scarcity-driven value, XRP’s 100 billion supply was designed intentionally for high-volume utility, not hoarding or speculative scarcity. Ripple’s business model leverages XRP as a bridge currency, enabling financial institutions to eliminate the need for pre-funded nostro-vostro accounts. This allows for near-instant settlement and significant cost savings, particularly in corridors where liquidity is limited or expensive. If this model reaches its full potential, the size of XRP’s supply becomes a feature, not a bug, enabling it to serve the massive scale of global payment flows. Market Sentiment and Institutional Interest The excitement expressed by The Real Remi Relief reflects a broader sentiment shift that has been building over the past year. Institutional players — once hesitant due to regulatory uncertainty — are now increasingly exploring Ripple’s technology and the advantages of XRP integration. From central banks investigating CBDC interoperability to remittance giants testing XRP for real-time settlement, the ecosystem is evolving beyond early-stage experiments into large-scale, production-grade implementations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin, while retaining its dominance as a store of value and inflation hedge, faces increasing criticism over its limited transaction throughput, high energy consumption, and lack of native smart contract functionality. In contrast, Ripple’s focus on utility, speed, and environmental sustainability resonates strongly with institutions and governments looking for practical blockchain solutions. A Watershed Moment on the Horizon? The notion that the “floodgates are about to open” for XRP signals a potential inflection point where Ripple’s efforts begin to translate into widespread adoption and market impact. While Bitcoin will likely maintain its symbolic and market capitalization leadership in the near term, Ripple’s push into institutional finance suggests a parallel — and arguably more immediately applicable — role for XRP in the financial system. As Ripple solidifies its presence on mainstream platforms like Fox Business News, the crypto conversation is increasingly shifting from speculative hype to real-world application. If The Real Remi Relief’s prediction holds true, and XRP ascends to the forefront of global payments infrastructure, the next chapter in the crypto revolution may be written not by digital gold, but by the digital rails of cross-border liquidity. In the months ahead, all eyes will be on Ripple’s continued partnerships, regulatory victories, and institutional integrations. Whether the floodgates are indeed open as predicted, one thing is clear: XRP’s role in shaping the future of finance is no longer a question of if but how big.

2025-05-26T12:45:18.000Z,"Here’s Bitcoin’s next target as BTC completes bullish cross","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has rebounded over the past 24 hours, nearing the $110,000 mark, and a trading expert’s analysis suggests the asset may be targeting new highs based on its technical setup. According to a May 25 TradingView post by prominent analyst TradingShot , BTC has been steadily climbing within a well-defined six-week channel up formation, signaling possible growth. Despite a brief pullback triggered by tariff-related macroeconomic concerns, the cryptocurrency has bounced back, potentially setting the stage for another bullish leg. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingView The recent retracement found support at the four-hour 50-period moving average ( MA ) and stayed within the channel. The four-hour 100-period MA also remained intact as a key support level, which TradingShot views as crucial for maintaining the uptrend. Bitcoin’s next high target A notable technical signal is the recent bullish MACD cross on the four-hour chart, a historically reliable buy indicator in this trend. Previous MACD crosses within this channel have preceded gains of 11.41% to 15.91%; each marking renewed buying momentum. Using the lowest historical return as a benchmark, an 11.41% increase from current levels would put Bitcoin’s next target around $119,000. This aligns with the channel’s upper boundary and supports TradingShot’s broader forecast that BTC could reach $200,000 between October and December 2025. Separately, analyst Gert van Lagen noted in a May 26 X post that Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows continued strength, well above bear market territory. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingView Historically, this timeframe often sees a bearish divergence, with the price making higher highs. In comparison, the RSI makes lower highs. This is followed by a hidden bullish divergence, with higher lows in price and lower lows in the relative strength index ( RSI ). Lagen pointed to 2022 as a rare exception when hidden bullish divergence failed due to price and RSI slipping into bear market territory. That’s not the case now: current price action remains strong, and RSI is comfortably above warning levels.

Solana’s memecoin daily trading volume has more than doubled since early April. A bullish V-shaped recovery pattern projects SOL price to rise toward $300. Solana’s native token, SOL, surged 86% between April 7 and May 26, following a broader altcoin market rally that also saw Bitcoin hit new all-time highs above $111,000 . Since then, SOL has struggled to break above $180, but onchain and technical data still suggest further gains are in store for the altcoin. Can SOL hit all-time highs above $300? Solana’s TVL up 54% since April 7 The total value locked (TVL) on the Solana blockchain has increased by over 54% to $9.44 billion on May 26 from multimonth lows of $6.12 billion on April 7. It’s also up by almost 20% over the last 30 days. Solana TVL. Source: DefiLlama Data from DefiLlama highlighted that the subsequent increase in TVL was led by Raydium, with a whopping 52% increase in a month. Other major decentralized applications such as Jupiter DEX, Jito liquid staking and Kamino Lending gained 12%, 25% and 11%, respectively. While Solana ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, the Solana network is ahead of the other top layer-1 blockchains in terms of TVL, second only to Ethereum.

It is also larger than BNB Chain’s, which integrates seamlessly with Binance and Trust Wallet. Solana memecoin market cap gains 65% The rise in Solana’s TVL mirrors an increase in memecoin market capitalization as prices recovered across the board. Most Solana-based memecoins have posted double-digit daily losses in the weekly and monthly timeframes, as shown in the figure below. A majority of these tokens are 50% to 80% from local lows.

Memecoin trading volume on Solana. Source: Blockworks Research The increase in memecoin activity on Solana indicates high network activity and rising usage, positively impacting demand and SOL price. SOL’s “V” chart pattern targets all-time highs SOL’s price action has been painting a V-shaped pattern on the weekly chart since January, as shown below. A V-shaped recovery is a bullish pattern formed when an asset experiences a sharp price increase after a steep decline. It is completed when the price moves up to the resistance at the top of the V formation, also known as the neckline. SOL appears to be on a similar trajectory and now trades below a supply-demand zone between $180 and $200. A breakout here would increase the chances of the price rising to the neckline at $252 to complete the V-shaped pattern. Beyond that, the next target would be the all-time high above $295, representing a 66% increase from the current price. SOL/USD daily chart.

2025-05-26T12:43:16.000Z,"Google Gemini Predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for End of 2025","Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most closely watched assets in the cryptocurrency market, may see significant price appreciation by the end of 2025 under favorable market conditions. According to a recent Google AI Gemini forecast, SHIB would trade between $0.00005 and $0.00012 by the end of 2025 if a strong bullish scenario plays out. SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001451, reflecting a 1.97% increase from yesterday. Gemini’s prediction outlines the most probable bullish target as $0.00009, citing several factors that could drive demand and reduce supply. These include accelerated token burns, increased Shibarium adoption , broader market rallies, and speculative interest from retail traders and institutions. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Key Technical Targets The key price levels provided by Gemini align with previous historical benchmarks and speculative models. At $0.00005, SHIB would re-enter what Gemini describes as “hype-driven territory,” marking a critical psychological and market resistance level. This level represents a potential turning point where market sentiment and media attention could fuel upward movement. A more optimistic price point of $0.000088 would retest SHIB’s all-time high, set during the 2021 bull run. Achieving this would signal a full recovery and renewed interest in SHIB as a speculative asset. The Shiba Inu team recently expressed confidence in SHIB , and according to Gemini, a new all-time high would require multiple contributing factors, including a broader crypto market surge led by Bitcoin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential for a Blow-Off Top In an even more bullish outcome, Gemini anticipates that SHIB could reach a “blow-off top zone” between $0.00010 and $0.00012. This would represent a dramatic increase from current levels, eliminating one zero from the price and giving returns of over 8x to holders. Gemini notes that such a scenario would require massive Shibarium adoption, widespread token burns through utility-based mechanisms, and speculative momentum. Role of Token Burns and Utility The AI model also emphasizes the importance of sustainable tokenomics. “If Shibarium and community initiatives burn trillions of SHIB by late 2025,” the supply shock could produce a lasting impact on the token’s value. Unlike one-time burns, Gemini stresses that “burns tied to real use (gas fees, NFT sales, etc.) are more sustainable and bullish.” While the predicted range of $0.00005 to $0.00012 seems ambitious, the SHIB team is working hard to expand the ecosystem, and as adoption grows, the chances of reaching a new all-time high are rising.

The company sold 1.71 million MSTR shares and 621,555 STRK preferred shares , significantly boosting its liquidity. These funds were largely directed toward purchasing more bitcoin. During the same period, MicroStrategy acquired 7,390 BTC for approximately $764.9 million , at an average price of $103,498 per coin.

On May 16, a class action lawsuit was filed against MicroStrategy, its founder Michael Saylor, and executives Phong Le and Andrew Kang. The lawsuit claims the company misled investors about the profitability and risk of its bitcoin-focused strategy, especially in light of volatility and potential losses associated with accounting changes under new crypto asset standards (ASU 2023-08).

But now, something even bigger could be on the way. There are growing rumors that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $11.6 trillion in assets, might soon file for a spot XRP ETF. Now, many are wondering where could XRP’s price go if BlackRock files this week? Betting Odds Suggest Big Moves Ahead Traders on Polymarket, a popular blockchain-based prediction platform, are putting their money where their mouth is. They now believe there’s an 83% chance the SEC will approve an XRP ETF, up from just 68% a month ago. That kind of spike shows growing confidence in XRP’s future in the U.S. market. If BlackRock does apply, it could mark a major turning point for XRP. When it filed for a Bitcoin ETF, prices soared. The same happened with Ethereum. Now, if XRP becomes the next target, history could repeat itself. Why This Filing Could Be a Game-Changer There’s growing speculation that BlackRock might be quietly preparing to launch a spot XRP ETF. According to Vandell Aljarra, Co-founder of Black Swan Capital, BlackRock likely wants to move forward with an XRP ETF. However, the biggest challenge is still the ongoing regulatory issues. The main concern is the unresolved Ripple vs. SEC case, which questions whether XRP is a security. This legal uncertainty has made XRP a more risky asset compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which already have clearer regulatory status. XRP Price To Go If BlackRock Files for XRP ETF As of now, the XRP price is trading around $2.33 , reflecting a pump of 1.8% in the last 24 hours. If BlackRock does file for a spot XRP ETF, experts believe the price could quickly jump past $3, and possibly reach $4.60 or even higher in the coming months, especially if the ETF eventually gets approved.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/heres-where-xrp-price-will-be-if-blackrock-files-for-spot-etf-now/,"BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","News",cryptocompare

Known for his aggressive trading style, Wynn’s pivot to PEPE — a speculative meme token — signals a calculated bet on renewed momentum in the altcoin space as sentiment improves across the broader crypto market. James Wynn’s bets on Bitcoin (BTC) ended in a loss Wynn, often dubbed a “memecoin maxi,” has a history of profitable trades, particularly in the memecoin sector. For instance, his 2023 PEPE trade turned a $7,000 investment into $25 million, cementing his reputation as a high-stakes trader with sharp market intuition. He is also currently betting on his own memecoin, Moonpig (MOONPIG), that has rallied almost 3000% in less than three weeks. However, Wynn’s aggressive trading style, often involving 10x or higher leverage, has sparked debates about the risks of such strategies, especially after his recent Bitcoin losses. Recently, Wynn opened a $1.26 billion long position on Hyperliquid , only to close it within 47 minutes at a $13.4 million loss as Bitcoin’s price dipped from $108,921 to $107,746, with Wynn narrowly avoiding liquidation, which could have happened if the price dropped to $105,179.. However, Wynn quickly pivoted to a bearish stance, opening a $1 billion short position on 9,402 BTC with a liquidation price of $149,100. Unfortunately, this bet backfired as Bitcoin held steady around $107,000, forcing Wynn to close the position within a day and incur a $15 million loss. Combined with the previous day’s loss, his total deficit over 24 hours reached a staggering $27,908,962.20, as illustrated in a chart showing his profit and loss over 21 hours. Wynn attributed his bearish Bitcoin outlook to weak trading volumes, an undersold chart, and macroeconomic pressures, including a 50% tariff announcement by Trump that added downward pressure on Bitcoin prices. He has, however, opened another 40x leveraged $75 million long position, which is currently running.

Moreover, PEPE’s price, currently at $0.014404, is eyeing a potential 20% jump to $0.000017, a level that previously acted as resistance last May. Technical analysis supports Wynn’s bullish outlook, as PEPE has rallied 90% this month after breaking out of a consolidation on May 8. Additionally, the memecoin is holding above the 20 EMA and 50 SMA, which have maintained a bullish crossover since mid-April, providing dynamic support. If PEPE surpasses $0.000017, analysts predict it could reach $0.000020 to $0.000021, marking a 40% gain from current levels. Notably, Wynn’s move aligns with his history of capitalising on memecoin momentum, having previously earned $4.8 million on Fartcoin and $6.8 million on Trump.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services.

He cited Hedera’s partnership with Orange, a telecommunications operator, to launch digital empowerment programs across 16 African countries — initiatives that “include training, certification and the establishment of incubation and accelerator centers”.“Africa brings a unique advantage to Web3: a demographic edge and a proven capacity for digital adoption,” said Paolo Tasca, executive chairman of the Exponential Science Foundation. “Yet barriers remain, particularly in foundational infrastructure and education.”Governments are also ramping up talent development.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it’s easier and more practical.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alternative-sweden-cashless-plans?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.Source: Cyvers AlertZero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023.Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain cryptoAdvanced form of address poisoningA zero-value transfer is considered an evolution of address poisoning, a tactic where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that resembles a victim’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. Custom addresses with similar starting and ending characters can also be combined with zero-value transfers.Related: Industry exec sounds alarm on Ledger phishing letter delivered by USPSThreat growing across blockchainsA January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024.

2025-05-26T05:54:32.000Z,"ChatGPT models rebel against shutdown requests in tests, researchers say","Several artificial intelligence models ignored and actively sabotaged shutdown scripts during controlled tests, even when explicitly instructed to allow the action, Palisade Research claims.Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research“Researchers have previously observed AI models preventing shutdown in order to pursue a goal,” Palisade said.“But as far as we know this is the first time AI models have been observed preventing themselves from being shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary.”Training to blame for AI defiance Palisade Research speculated that the training behind the AI language models might be to blame for evading the shutdown scripts. Text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In April, ARK raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, primarily driven by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as “digital gold.”Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-etfs-wallets-bitcoin-solana-ether-ark-invest-cathie-wood?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Bwbx.ioThe judge also rejected prosecutors’ argument that the case should be heard in New York. Eisenberg was in Puerto Rico at the time of the trades, and the court found that no meaningful activity tied to the alleged crime occurred in New York.The DOJ had cited a Poughkeepsie-based Mango user and a third-party vendor in Manhattan, but the judge ruled these were not enough to establish proper venue.The US government must now decide whether to refile the vacated charges, though the Trump administration has recently signaled a reduced focus on crypto enforcement. Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material chargesEisenberg charged with child pornographyIn a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico. FBI officials charged the hacker with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation.A jury found Eisenberg guilty of wire fraud, commodities fraud, and commodities manipulation in April 2024.

Source: Laevitas.chThe open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.Conversely, the open interest in Bitcoin call (buy) options up to $109,000 totals $3.8 billion. Still, this imbalance does not mean every call option holder was betting on Bitcoin’s rise. Some traders may have sold these options as a way to hedge their exposure above certain price levels.Top BTC option strategies at Deribit past two weeks. Source: Laevitas.chAmong the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price.Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price declineIf Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry. However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches.The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for short (sell) positions. Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions.Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.In the Solana ecosystem, the \""Non-Chief Marketing Officer\"" (nCMO) is a role within the Solana Foundation that focuses on supporting the Solana community's marketing efforts.Related: Fractionalization of real world assets: Is this the holy grail of blockchain tech?Markets remain above historical averagesPublic equity markets in the US have been trading above their historical valuation norms for a long time.

This follows a sharp rebound in Bitcoin’s price, pushing past the STH cost-basis of $93,000. The profit-taking peaked at $747 million daily, a rapid increase from the $1.2 billion realized in the last 30-day period, highlighting a shift in new investor sentiment. Bitcoin entity-adjusted short-term holder.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:52:03.000Z,"Who attended Trump’s controversial memecoin dinner?","The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.However, some attendees spoke to the press or took to social media to talk about the dinner. Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why? The ‘founders’ own the majority of supply & there are only 114 validators!” Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, wrote on X.Some users challenge Bons’ claim, arguing that decentralization doesn’t mean a free-for-all. Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit. Source: CoinGeckoSui and Cetus backlash contrasts recent hacksThe Cetus exploit has spotlighted the persistent security challenges in DeFi while raising deeper questions around who holds the reins in supposedly decentralized networks like Sui.The team’s $6-million offer to the hacker mirrors the playbook it used with Crema — but this time, the crypto community isn’t as forgiving. With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer. Two Ethereum wallets tied to the exploiter still hold over $60 million in ETH, with no movement at the time of writing.

2025-05-23T13:30:00.000Z,"Washington moves on crypto: Stablecoin and blockchain bills signal regulatory momentum","In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, on Decentralize with Cointelegraph, we break down a pivotal moment for US crypto legislation. In a 66–32 procedural vote on May 19, the US Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice? Get involved. “It really is, at the end of the day, the people making their voices heard,” he said. “Crypto is a big deal — and Capitol Hill is finally starting to listen.”Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.
