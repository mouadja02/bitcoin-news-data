2025-05-26T15:50:40.000Z,"The full breakdown of James Wynn’s $1B Bitcoin positions — and how it all fell apart","What happens when Bitcoin doesn’t follow the script, and a trader like James Wynn is already deep into a leveraged bet he can’t easily escape? Table of Contents James Wynn Bitcoin trade spirals into a $60M wipeout What makes James Wynn trader different from the average degen How does leverage trading work? James Wynn Bitcoin trade spirals into a $60M wipeout James Wynn, a well-known high-leverage crypto trader, recently experienced one of the steepest losses of his career. Over the span of seven days, he lost more than $60 million through a series of high-leverage Bitcoin ( BTC ) trades on Hyperliquid ( HYPE ). The sequence began on May 19, when Wynn opened a 40x long position of 5,520 BTC at $103,302, placing his liquidation level at $98,294. On the following day, he expanded the position to 7,764 BTC, raising the notional value to $830 million. His new average entry moved to $105,033, narrowing the buffer between market price and liquidation, now set at $100,330. May 21 saw him increase exposure further to 9,371.71 BTC, pushing the position above the $1 billion threshold. At that point, the trade was in profit, showing unrealized gains of $10.71 million with an average entry of $108,005. Later that day, Wynn closed 2,139 BTC, securing $11.92 million in realized profit and leaving 5,203 BTC still active, valued at $554.6 million. He followed up with a fresh long on May 22, entering 10,200 BTC at $108,065. As Bitcoin touched $111,900, unrealized gains peaked at $39 million. Momentum reversed quickly. On May 23, a 4% drop brought Bitcoin down to $106,700 following President Trump’s announcement of a 50% tariff on European Union imports. Wynn responded by closing a separate Pepecoin ( PEPE ) position on May 24 with a $25.18 million gain. He then raised his Bitcoin long to 11,588 BTC at $108,243, placing his new liquidation level at $105,180. That decision proved costly. On May 25, he exited at $107,746, booking a $13.39 million loss. That same morning, he shifted to a short strategy. On May 25, Wynn scaled his Bitcoin short to 7,967.83 BTC, valued at $856 million, with a liquidation price set at $111,280. JUST IN: James Wynn increases short position on BTC to 7,967.83 BTC ($856 million) at $107,057; liquidation price set at $111,280. pic.twitter.com/ljX0yeGHHv — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) May 25, 2025 He later exited over $1 billion worth of BTC short positions on May 26, recording a loss of approximately $15.87 million over a 15-hour span. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1926794028533551106 He also closed his Ethereum ( ETH ) and Sui ( SUI ) longs during the week, taking an additional $5.3 million in losses. The total drawdown over seven days reached $60 million. Wynn acknowledged the setback in a post on May 26, noting that despite the losses, his account still held $25 million in profit from an original base of $3–4 million. The figure marked a sharp drop from his earlier peak of $87 million. What makes James Wynn trader different from the average degen Wynn began gaining traction in the crypto trading world in 2022, during the final phase of the previous bull market. His early entry into the space was reportedly funded by Alameda Research, a firm known at the time for backing emerging crypto traders. That year, he invested $7,000 into the memecoin PEPE when its market cap was just $600,000. As the token’s valuation rose to $4.2 million, Wynn employed high-frequency trading methods to eventually turn his position into $25 million. In March 2025, Wynn began trading on Hyperliquid, starting with a deposit of $4.65 million in USD Coin ( USDC ). Over the following two months, he executed 38 trades on the platform, focusing primarily on Bitcoin and memecoins such as PEPE, Official Trump ( TRUMP ), and Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ). Reports show that as of May 10, Wynn had accumulated $46.5 million in profits from his Hyperliquid trades. His strategy blends high leverage with fast execution and a sensitivity to market sentiment. He typically operates with leverage ranging from 5x to 40x, building positions in fast-moving tokens that exhibit strong momentum. Size is another defining aspect of his method. Trades often carry notional values in the millions, creating significant exposure but also increasing vulnerability. Liquidation thresholds tend to fall within a narrow 2–3% range below the entry price, meaning a minor market drop can result in massive losses within minutes. Wynn also integrates social media into his trading playbook. He regularly shares his positions and real-time updates on X, using transparency to build credibility and influence market psychology. That presence can amplify trends already in motion, adding another layer to his strategy. How does leverage trading work? High-leverage trading allows crypto traders to amplify their positions well beyond their actual capital, creating the possibility of large gains but also sharp, fast losses. Platforms like Hyperliquid, Binance Futures, Bitget, and Bybit, traders provide leverage levels ranging from 5x to 100x, depending on the asset and exchange policies. These tools offer flexibility and capital efficiency, but they also introduce a narrow margin for error that can result in forced liquidations within minutes. The concept of leverage is straightforward. A trader using 10x leverage can open a $10,000 position with only $1,000 in actual capital. The remaining $9,000 is essentially borrowed from the exchange. If the asset’s price rises by 1%, the position gains $100, which is a 10% return on the initial margin. However, the reverse is equally true. A 1% price drop results in a $100 loss, wiping out 10% of the trader’s capital. The critical point is that a 10% move in the wrong direction fully erodes the initial margin, triggering liquidation. With 20x leverage, only a 5% drop is required to wipe out the position. At 50x, the liquidation threshold tightens to around 2%. And at 100x, even a 1% move against the position is enough to result in a complete loss. To better understand how this plays out, consider a scenario. A trader opens a long position of $100,000 on Bitcoin at $50,000 using 20x leverage. They contribute $5,000 in margin. If Bitcoin drops to $47,500, a 5% decline, the trader’s margin is entirely consumed, and the exchange liquidates the position. Exchanges often apply additional buffers, known as maintenance margins, which may trigger liquidation slightly before the full margin is lost to ensure system solvency and protect insurance funds. Most traders using high leverage rely on short-term strategies such as breakout momentum, news-based reactions, or high-volatility scalping. Entry timing is crucial, and exits are often planned with stop-losses or trailing orders. Funding rates — periodic payments between long and short positions on perpetual contracts, also influence decision-making. A positive funding rate means long traders pay shorts, and vice versa. Some traders incorporate these rates into their strategy to earn yield on sideways markets, though this often requires tight trade management and substantial volume. For retail participants, the key lies in understanding these numbers, using margin calculators, and applying strict controls on position size. Tools like liquidation heatmaps and volatility indicators can help assess entry risk, but they cannot eliminate the core exposure that leverage brings. When used cautiously, leverage can support capital-efficient strategies or hedging. When applied without a well-defined risk framework, it becomes a fast track to liquidation. As always, trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

2025-05-26T15:50:06.000Z,"Best Meme Coins to Buy - Dogecoin Price Prediction As Whale Accumulation Rises","Altcoins might be gearing up for their next big move, but meme coins haven’t been sitting quietly in the corner either. Dogecoin, in particular, is showing strong signs that something bigger may be on the horizon. Large holders have been steadily scooping up DOGE, and the price action over the past day suggests that this accumulation phase might be nearing its payoff. With fresh resistance levels now in the rearview mirror and volume pouring in, Dogecoin is starting to look like it’s getting ready for a run. It’s been here before—building quietly, then sprinting. And this time, the setup feels familiar. Whether you're already in or still on the fence, it’s worth watching closely. The conditions are lining up. Dogecoin Predictions - Whales Load Up on DOGE as Price Breaks Through Key Resistance Dogecoin didn’t just climb a few cents—it moved with intent. Over the last few days, the price has risen considerably, crossing above the $0.22 mark. That alone would’ve been worth noting, but the volume behind it is what really matters. More than 300 million DOGE was traded in back-to-back hours, and that’s not noise—that’s weight. This push wasn’t a one-off. The structure of the chart has been tightening, showing higher lows and steady attempts at breaking through resistance. Support is now firm at $0.225, and the market didn’t hesitate to hold that level during the retest. Each time the price slipped slightly, it was bought right back up. Behind the scenes, whales have been busy. Over a billion DOGE has been picked up by large wallets in just the past month. That kind of behavior doesn’t happen out of boredom. It’s usually a signal that something’s expected—whether that’s a macro shift, an upcoming narrative push, or simply a bet on sentiment returning to meme coins. And then there’s the timing. With markets still shaky from global uncertainty and investors looking for less conventional bets, DOGE has started to attract fresh eyes. It’s showing signs of a bull flag forming—a pattern that often precedes a larger leg up. Some traders are already throwing around price targets north of $0.60 if momentum holds. #Dogecoin Explosive Price Projection💥 $DOGE has been moving nicely within this uptrend structure, fueled by long lasting bull flag channels.The first flag yielded a +90% return, the second +215%, and the third +440%💹This forth flag could potentially take the price of $DOGE … pic.twitter.com/kiomHgwgHR — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 23, 2025 In real-time, the coin chipped away at the $0.230 barrier multiple times before cracking it with close to 10 million DOGE traded in just a few minutes. It didn’t stall—it surged, briefly—and that tells you the interest is there. Not speculative FOMO, but calculated accumulation. Dogecoin isn’t running on hype this time. It’s moving with buildup, and if this continues, the next leg up might come faster than most expect. This makes it an excellent time to accumulate and create strong positions in other projects with upside potential too—a move that could end up paying off in the coming weeks. Best Meme Coins to Buy Next MIND of Pepe If Dogecoin’s recent accumulation is any indication, meme coins that offer more than just a joke are beginning to separate themselves from the crowd. MIND of Pepe is a solid example of that shift. Rather than using nostalgia or meme culture alone as its selling point, this project leans into utility by deploying AI as a real product layer. MIND of Pepe introduces an AI-driven agent that actively monitors crypto discussions across social media, analyzes sentiment, and presents that data to investors in a simplified form. This AI agent has its own personality, posts on X, and engages with community discussions in real time. That presence isn’t just for show—it provides signals that holders can use to understand which tokens are trending, why they’re moving, and whether the sentiment is building or fading. For traders who rely on narratives, this tool can provide an edge. A 100x crypto is what the crypto education company 99Bitcoins claimed MIND of Pepe could be in one of their dedicated videos on YouTube. The current wave of Dogecoin accumulation shows that sentiment-based bets can gain traction very quickly when conditions are right. In that context, a token that exists to track and interpret sentiment has very real upside potential. MIND of Pepe doesn’t try to be a Dogecoin competitor. It aims to be an intelligence layer for traders navigating meme cycles. With DOGE heating up, that kind of utility might soon shift from niche to necessary. Pepe Priced at $0.00001397, Pepe has had a relatively quiet few weeks after its earlier spike in 2023, but silence doesn’t always mean stagnation. Sometimes, it means loading. And with Dogecoin breaking through resistance and dragging renewed attention back toward top-tier meme tokens, Pepe may find itself back in focus. Pepe doesn’t complicate its pitch. It’s a cultural meme turned tradable token—one that succeeded in getting listed on top exchanges and building a loyal community almost overnight. It proved early on that momentum alone could carry a project far, but sustaining that interest is another challenge altogether. That’s where current market conditions help. With investors looking to rotate into assets that have a history of strong performance and viral appeal, Pepe’s familiarity works in its favor. There’s no AI here, no utility pitch layered on top—but that may be the point. As Dogecoin shows, sometimes meme coins don’t need complex fundamentals to move. They need attention, timing, and volume. Pepe has checked those boxes before and could do so again as meme narratives gain traction. The token sits in a zone where accumulation doesn’t require much capital, but the returns—if history repeats—can be outsized. In short, the market may be nearing another phase where raw meme power resurfaces. Pepe, being one of the most recognized in that category, could find itself rising faster than most anticipate. BTC Bull Dogecoin has always represented a kind of rebellion against traditional finance, and BTC Bull takes that spirit and redirects it toward a very specific goal: pushing Bitcoin adoption through the power of meme coins. But this isn’t just another meme riding on aesthetics. BTC Bull is structured to reward those who actively support Bitcoin’s mission. The project introduces a unique incentive model where users are rewarded with Bitcoin itself through a staking system built around the BTCBULL token. Unlike most meme projects that stop at branding, BTC Bull ties its identity to a larger movement. That focus has helped it gain credibility among those who want to participate in meme culture without detaching from Bitcoin’s long-term thesis. The contract has been audited, the presale is live, and users are already earning staking rewards. But what’s more interesting is the design philosophy. This isn’t a coin that’s trying to mimic Dogecoin’s randomness. It’s aligning itself with the Bitcoin ethos while using meme coin virality as the gateway. That combination could be especially effective now, given the shift toward high-volume speculative assets and the growing interest in Bitcoin-aligned projects. As DOGE’s price continues to signal accumulation, investors looking to diversify within the meme space may gravitate toward projects that echo its values but build something more specific. BTC Bull fits that bill, offering upside potential without straying far from the crypto mainstream. Solaxy With Dogecoin pushing higher and large holders showing renewed interest in speculative yet narrative-driven assets, Solaxy presents an interesting case. While not a meme coin in the traditional sense, it taps into the same investor psychology: low entry cost, bold vision, and the potential to ride larger ecosystems—in this case, both Solana and Ethereum. Solaxy is a Layer 2 chain that enables seamless interaction between Solana and Ethereum-based assets. It offers staking on both chains and has already generated interest for its high APY and low-fee infrastructure. For investors watching the meme coin rally unfold, Solaxy offers exposure to the infrastructure side of the story rather than the tokens themselves. $SOLX is breaking new barriers! 🛸40M Raised! 🔥🚀 pic.twitter.com/tk6mwT5hH1 — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 24, 2025 When meme projects attract large inflows, the chains they run on often see secondary demand. Having raised over $40 million already, Solaxy positions itself at that intersection, building a scalable solution with direct utility for traders, stakers, and future dApps. Its presence on both Ethereum and Solana also acts as a bridge for liquidity—one that could become increasingly valuable if the meme coin sector gets hotter. In the context of Dogecoin's current move, Solaxy offers a different kind of speculative play: not the meme, but the rails. The more attention DOGE gets, the more crowded the markets become, and the more value there is in holding projects that benefit from broader user activity. For those looking to get ahead of that infrastructure demand, Solaxy may deserve a closer look. SUBBD As Dogecoin shows signs of awakening again, the broader meme coin space is back on investor radars—but not all projects rely on memes alone to justify their existence. SUBBD leans on a very different narrative: the monetization of content and the decentralization of the creator economy. Whether you're a YouTuber, podcaster, or niche content producer, SUBBD provides tools to launch memberships, paywalled content, tipping systems, and more—all driven by blockchain rails. This isn’t a copy-paste meme token with a new mascot. It addresses a real problem in Web2: creators being underpaid and overcontrolled by platforms that gatekeep monetization. SUBBD flips that model. With its token ecosystem, it rewards both creators and supporters, making the relationship financially symbiotic. While Dogecoin gains traction through cultural appeal, SUBBD is attracting attention for its model. And in the current market, where attention is currency, projects that tie utility to actual user behavior have room to run. The meme coin wave might be about memes today, but it’s clear that tokens offering real-world use cases could benefit from the same speculative interest. If Dogecoin rallies and the appetite for low-cap, high-utility projects rises alongside it, SUBBD sits in a position where traction can build quickly—especially among creators looking to exit the platform trap. It's not just a meme bet. It's a product bet, and the timing might be just right. Conclusion With altcoins showing fresh signs of momentum, it may not be long before meme coins follow suit. The recent accumulation in Dogecoin suggests that market participants are beginning to rotate capital back into speculative assets—often a signal that sentiment is warming up across the board. While the window is still early, that’s often when positioning matters most. Meme coins tend to move quickly once they catch fire, and given the technical strength and volume building up in select tokens, this could be a smart time to start identifying quality entries.

X Money expects launch in 2025 Musk’s confirmation comes amid X Money’s planned launch this year, according to the platform’s X account. Source: X Money Musk’s silent confirmation of X Money trials followed a series of reports suggesting the platform may launch this year based on alleged software code leaks in January. X has been actively working to obtain multiple transmitter licenses for X Money across the United States, having secured 41 such licenses at time of publication, according to the Nationwide Multi-State Licensing System. X Money plans date back to 2022 Some of the early public indications of Musk’s plans to integrate payments into X date to October 2022, when Musk referred to his $44 billion Twitter acquisition as “an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” In 2023, Twitter rebranded to X , with CEO Linda Yaccarino disclosing that the social media app planned to feature “unlimited interactivity,” support multiple media formats, and feature payments and banking.

Coinbase Class Action Lawsuit Filed: Shareholders Blame Company for Data Breach and Concealment The lawsuit alleges the company failed to timely disclose the user data breach and concealed from investors the breach of a settlement with a U.K. regulator. In a lawsuit filed in the Pennsylvania Eastern District Court by plaintiff investor Brady Nessler, it was stated that Coinbase shareholders “suffered significant damages and losses.” The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase failed to timely disclose to investors that its UK subsidiary, CB Payments, had breached an agreement it made with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2020. It also highlights that the company only publicly disclosed a serious data breach that occurred in December 2024 on May 15, 2025. According to Coinbase, cyber attackers bribed some employees and stole users' personal data. Following this development, the company's stock value fell by 7.2% to $244. Coinbase estimates that the cost of fixing the breach and potential refunds to customers could be between $180 million and $400 million. The lawsuit names Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and CFO Alesia Haas as individual defendants and seeks damages for losses incurred by investors who purchased Coinbase stock between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025.

2025-05-26T15:17:32.000Z,"Bitcoin vs Strategy stock: which is the better buy?","Bitcoin price has experienced a strong rally over the past 16 years, outperforming the stock market and becoming the fifth-largest asset globally, behind gold, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple, with a valuation of $2.1 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has surged over 1,000% in the last five years, while the Dow Jones has climbed 70% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has rallied 122% in the same period. Strategy stock, on the other hand, has outperformed all these assets after transforming its business model from a purely software company to a Bitcoin holding firm. Its stock has soared nearly 3,000%, growing its market cap from $1 billion in 2020 to $101 billion today. Bitcoin vs Strategy stock vs Dow Jones vs Nasdaq 100 | Source: crypto.news How the Strategy model works Investors interested in Bitcoin today have at least three main options. First, they can take the most straightforward route: buying Bitcoin and storing it on exchanges or in self-custody wallets. Second, they can invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold over $131 billion in assets. These ETFs offer direct exposure to Bitcoin but charge a small management fee. Third, there’s Strategy, which has become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with over 580,250 BTC on its balance sheet. Investors place a premium on its model, with its current market cap of $101 billion standing at 1.58x the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Strategy has acquired 4,020 BTC for ~$427.1 million at ~$106,237 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.8% YTD 2025. As of 5/25/2025, we hodl 580,250 $BTC acquired for ~$40.61 billion at ~$69,979 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/eAd03GIKam — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 26, 2025 Strategy’s approach has been effective because its net asset value (NAV) premium amplifies Bitcoin price increases. A higher share price, in turn, makes it easier for the company to raise funds and accumulate more Bitcoin. You might also like: Strategy stock continues to stall despite Bitcoin’s surge to record high At the same time, the rising Bitcoin price helps offset share dilution by increasing the firm’s BTC holdings at a faster rate, resulting in higher Bitcoin-per-share for investors. However, fears of further dilution have raised concerns. The company’s plan to raise $84 billion through share sales has put pressure on its stock. While Bitcoin is trading near its all-time high, Strategy stock is down over 12% from its 2025 peak. Bitcoin vs Strategy stock: which is a better buy? Analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. BlackRock predicts BTC could reach $700,000, while Ark Invest sets a more aggressive target of $2.4 million. If either forecast proves accurate, both Bitcoin and Strategy stock would likely deliver strong long-term returns. At BlackRock’s $700,000 target, Bitcoin would gain about 536% from current levels, giving it a market cap of at least $13.9 trillion. Assuming Strategy holds 576,230 BTC at that point, its Bitcoin holdings would be worth $403.36 billion. Applying the historical NAV premium of 1.58x suggests Strategy’s market cap could reach over $637 billion. If Bitcoin’s rally continues and the NAV premium holds, Strategy stock would outperform Bitcoin in relative returns.

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security. The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin . In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack. It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto . Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance. For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto . The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait. Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France. Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real? Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes. Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA . In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that. Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address , especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins. That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography. Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin ( BTC ) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography , which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing. Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish. Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing? While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize. What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet) Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin. One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up. Who’s already ahead? Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon , a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow. The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design. Why it’s not easy Of course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance. Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare. Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option. So, what does preparation look like? For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives. For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone. And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context. You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.” Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum. Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure. A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real. The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FORKS","BlackRock",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T15:08:59.000Z,"UFC Champion Conor McGregor: US Government Is Going to Buy XRP, SOL, and ADA","In a surprising twist that has ignited both the crypto world and mainstream headlines, UFC champion Conor McGregor has waded into the cryptocurrency debate after referencing a social media post from President Donald J. Trump. In the post, Trump announced plans to establish a U.S. Crypto Reserve that would strategically include assets like XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). McGregor, reflecting on the news, shared his astonishment and raised important questions about blockchain decentralization, saying, “I have learned from the events this week that not all blockchains are decentralized. A lot of people are telling me that BTC and ETH are the only truly decentralized networks. But the U.S. government is going to buy XRP, SOL, and ADA? Give me your thoughts!” I have learned from the events this week that not all blockchains are actually decentralised A lot of people are telling me that BTC and ETH are the only truly decentralised networks But the US government are going to buy XRP, SOL, and ADA? Give me your thoughts! pic.twitter.com/KMjVCSujqO — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) May 26, 2025 Trump’s Bold Crypto Declaration According to the post from Trump, the U.S. administration under his leadership would move forward with the creation of a Crypto Strategic Reserve, a policy initiative designed to position the U.S. as the “Crypto Capital of the World.” Trump emphasized that his Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to include XRP, SOL, and ADA in this reserve, signaling a dramatic policy pivot from what he described as years of “corrupt attacks” by the Biden administration on the digital asset space. This announcement marks one of the most direct endorsements yet by a major political figure of not just Bitcoin or Ethereum — traditionally viewed as the decentralized flag-bearers — but also of alternative Layer 1s like Solana and Cardano, as well as XRP, the token at the heart of Ripple’s cross-border payment infrastructure. Trump’s post stirred immediate reactions across the crypto sphere, prompting traders, investors, and even celebrities like McGregor to weigh in on the implications. McGregor Raises Decentralization Debate Conor McGregor’s comments tapped into one of the most heated and long-standing debates in the crypto community: what does it truly mean for a blockchain to be decentralized? While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are often hailed as the most decentralized networks due to their broad mining or staking bases and lack of centralized governance, assets like XRP, SOL, and ADA have frequently faced criticism from purists who argue their ecosystems rely on more centralized entities, whether it’s Ripple Labs, the Solana Foundation, or the Cardano development teams. McGregor’s post did more than just react to the headlines — it forced a wider audience to grapple with an issue that often remains confined to crypto circles. If the U.S. government, traditionally wary of decentralized currencies undermining sovereign monetary control, is prepared to hold XRP, Solana, and Cardano in national reserves, what does that say about the perceived utility, trust, and institutional acceptance of these blockchains? Strategic Implications for the Crypto Market Trump’s proposed Crypto Reserve has significant strategic implications. First, it signals a formal acknowledgment by a U.S. administration that blockchain assets are not merely speculative tools but strategic resources worthy of state-level stewardship. Including XRP , SOL, and ADA points to a belief in the functional roles these networks play — from XRP’s focus on global remittances to Solana’s high-speed decentralized applications and Cardano’s emphasis on peer-reviewed blockchain governance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Secondly, the political messaging embedded in Trump’s post, which frames the policy as a reversal of the Biden administration’s crypto stance, injects cryptocurrency firmly into the 2024 political arena. For crypto holders and industry players, this could mean greater regulatory clarity, but it also raises questions about partisanship and how future policy could shift with electoral outcomes. McGregor’s Star Power Amplifies the Conversation What makes this story even more captivating is the intersection of crypto, politics, and sports celebrity. Conor McGregor, with his global following and outspoken personality, has the unique ability to elevate niche technical debates to mainstream attention. His honest admission of confusion over decentralization reflects the sentiments of many newcomers to the space — those who see crypto headlines but are trying to understand the deeper mechanics behind the technology. As McGregor invites his audience to reflect on what it means for the U.S. government to buy XRP, SOL, and ADA, he’s pushing a conversation that crypto insiders have been having for years into the broader public eye. Whether his curiosity will turn into active advocacy or investment remains to be seen, but his involvement alone ensures the discussion will reach far beyond crypto Twitter. A New Era for Crypto Policy? The convergence of Trump’s high-stakes political promise and McGregor’s star-powered commentary signals a turning point for crypto’s role in public discourse. If a U.S. Crypto Reserve becomes more than just campaign rhetoric, it could reshape how global markets perceive blockchain assets, not merely as financial instruments but as national strategic assets. For now, one thing is certain: the conversation around which blockchains matter, how decentralized they truly are, and who is willing to hold them at scale has moved well beyond the developer forums and crypto traders. With figures like Trump and McGregor bringing these debates to global audiences, the future of crypto is set to become an even more prominent and hotly contested arena, both on the political stage and in the public imagination.

While enthusiasts anticipate short-term rallies, Floki appears ready to lead meme token recoveries. The dog-themed project is making waves in the Web3 innovation with its recent strides in the artificial intelligence sector . It saw over 800 FLOKI minibots minted on the day of launch, raising about 1,000 BNB. FLOKI @RealFlokiInu · Follow The $FLOKI Vikings made history again ⚔800+ Floki Minibots have been minted in just 24 hours. That’s nearly 1000 $BNB raised. And we’re only getting started…Web3 robotics is happening and it wears a Floki Viking helmet! 🤖⚔️ 4:13 pm · 26 May 2025 369 Reply Copy link Read 25 replies The explosive debut demonstrates the Floki community’s (Vikings) strength and has sparked debates about the altcoin’s potential short-term price performance. The meme token trades at $0.00009940 after an over 3.80% jump in the past 24 hours. The prevailing momentum could drive FLOKI past the $0.00012359 high. That would open the path towards the target at $0.00014577, a 47% surge from current prices. Floki’s transformation into a utility powerhouse Floki Minibots merges real-world robotics with crypto technology. They are physical, blockchain-powered robots within the FLOKI ecosystem. The integration represents a key step towards enhancing the meme coin’s use cases, cementing Floki’s status in the Web3 robotics revolution. Meanwhile, the over 800 minibots minting 24 hours after debut demonstrates substantial demand, potentially as AI and crypto convergence intensifies. The Floki team works to change the project’s narrative from meme to a top competitor in the utility and DeFi sectors. Furthermore, the massive minibot minting underscores the community’s readiness and engagement to back Floki’s innovation. With meme cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu struggling amid unclear use cases, FLOKI is emerging as a top contender in the sector. Floki has launched multiple utility-centered products, including a DeFi platform, FlokiFi, and the much-awaited Valhalla metaverse . Now, it has introduced tangible robots, which will potentially appeal to wider markets. FLOKI price outlook The altcoin trades at $0.00009940, with a 3.88% 24-hour increase extending its weekly and monthly gains to 5% and 25%, respectively. Chart by CoinMarketCap The charts show FLOK hovering above a key support barrier that previously acted as resistance. The alt encountered a minor retracement at the $0.00009474 mark. The level triggered a brief rally after a post-breakout retest. The prevailing momentum could catalyze a higher high beyond the $0.00009474 foothold to shift FLOKI’s short-term bias to bullish. Magnified bullishness amid broad-based optimism could propel the meme coin above the previous peak of $0.00012359. A daily candlestick closing above this mark will likely trigger rallies to the target at $0.00014577 – a 47% uptick from Floki’s current price. However, losing the support zone at $0.00009474 will invalidate the bullish case (in the near term). Analyst Solberg Invest anticipates FLOKI surges to a previous all-time high of $0.00035.

2025-05-26T14:49:38.000Z,"Dogecoin to Solana bridge a ‘big big opportunity for both,’ says Psy CEO","Psy CEO explains the importance of cross-chain bridges after the launch of a trustless Dogecoin to Solana bridge. Cross-chain bridges play an important role in blockchain interoperability. However, while contributing to crypto ecosystem integration, they are also a major source of vulnerability. In an interview with crypto.news, Carter Feldman, CEO and founder of Psy, explained their importance. Notably, Psy launched the first trustless bridge from Dogecoin (DOGE) to Solana (SOL) on Thursday, May 22. The bridge is trustless, meaning that it avoids some of the risks and pitfalls that have caused major exploits in the past. You might also like: Is Dogecoin hype dead? Elon Musk says DOGE not in US plans crypto.news: Cross-chain bridges have been a major source of hacks and exploits. What makes this bridge between Dogecoin to Solana more secure? Carter Feldman: Unlike traditional bridges that rely on multisig signers or centralized custodians, our bridge directly verifies Dogecoin’s proof of work on Solana. We’re capturing and verifying each Dogecoin block header on Solana, which contains the consensus data and Merkle root of transactions. This means Solana can cryptographically verify Dogecoin’s state without trusting intermediaries. CN: How did you decide to bridge Dogecoin to Solana, and why Dogecoin and Solana specifically? CF: Fundamentally, we believe in bringing proof-of-work security to proof-of-stake chains, and this bridge demonstrates that proof-of-work and programmable blockchains can work together without sacrificing security. You might also like: Solana forecast 2026: Time to buy memecoins again? Dogecoin’s proof-of-work consensus provides security that’s impossible to replicate in proof-of-stake systems. Unlike PoS, where security relies on tokens within the same system they’re securing, Dogecoin’s proof-of-work anchors security to external physical resources. This creates an objective security barrier that’s resistant to governance attacks and token manipulation, delivering true censorship resistance and decentralization that PoS simply cannot match. CN: Why hasn’t anyone built a trustless Dogecoin bridge before? What changed now? CF: It comes down to technical capability. Zero-knowledge proof technology has only recently matured to the point where verifying proof-of-work chains like Dogecoin on other blockchains became feasible. Nobody had built the foundational tools needed to make this work securely. Additionally, our team has a unique technical background in both proof-of-work and zero-knowledge systems required to bring this vision to reality. CN: What does this bridge mean for Dogecoin and Solana’s ecosystem in terms of growth and potential synergies? CF: It’s a big opportunity for both ecosystems, in my view. Dogecoin holders can now access Solana’s DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications without selling their DOGE. At the same time, Solana developers can tap into Dogecoin’s massive user base and liquidity. This should create a flywheel effect: as more Dogecoin users discover Solana’s capabilities, we’ll hopefully see increased activity across both networks. CN: What other chains that haven’t been connected yet, but where a bridge like this one would have a major impact? CF: I think this goes without saying, but trust-minimized Bitcoin bridges are certainly a north star. Fortunately, a lot of the work we have done for Dogecoin can be reused for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other proof-of-work ecosystems. Expect more soon on this front!

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations. All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms. The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office. Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets. Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies. Presidential election debate clash on stablecoins This election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy. Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign. Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base. Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc. “The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph. “Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.” Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms . The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities. Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad. Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown season Lee Jun-seok pushed back , noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse . “Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post , criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.” The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins. Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate Commission Lee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies . However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented. Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries. P2E games remain banned under local regulations , but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon , one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy. Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto. Source: Tokyo Stock Exchange via Google Finance Crypto promises test old and new voter bases South Korea had 9.7 million Know Your Customer-verified crypto investors by the end of 2024, a 25% increase from the first half of the year, according to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Investors in their 30s saw the biggest growth, up 29%, followed by those in their 40s (27%), while investors over 50 increased by 25%. The FIU’s findings show that older investors have larger holdings. By year-end, 221,000 investors held at least 100 million won (about $73,000) in crypto. Of those, 172,500 — or 78% — were over 40. Related: XRP and Solana race toward the next crypto ETF approval In February, the head of the financial industry association urged regulators to approve Bitcoin and Ether ETFs , citing rising demand among older investors. He argued that ETFs offer safer exposure than direct investment. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has been a key campaign pledge for both Lee Jae-myung and Kim. The move follows growing global momentum after the US, the world’s largest market and a key South Korean trading partner, gave the green light to spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Presidential hopefuls ignite institutional interest in South Korea’s retail-driven crypto market. Source: Ki Young Ju “Cryptocurrencies play a certain role in our society, but they are ultimately one of the global trends. As the US took the lead, we’ve ended up following in its footsteps. It’s a bit disappointing — we could have taken the lead ourselves,” Cho Jaewoo, assistant professor of social science at Hansung University, told Cointelegraph. However, the nation’s Capital Markets Act is a barrier that does not recognize crypto as eligible assets underlying ETFs. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ETFs under its dedicated crypto committee. Lee ahead in presidential election voter survey Yoon’s failed coup accelerated the presidential election and brought renewed urgency to unresolved issues in the local crypto industry. “In the 2022 presidential election, cryptocurrency was viewed as speculative and untrustworthy. But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said. South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In Q1 2024, the Korean won ranked as the most-traded fiat currency against crypto , driven largely by retail investors. Institutional players remain on the sidelines, awaiting their turn as the FSC prepares to launch pilot trading for professional investors. FSC’s planned schedule for a phased introduction of institutional crypto investment in 2025. Crypto policies were once seen as campaign strategies to sway younger voters, but this year, they’re seen as an economic and social issue that impacts multiple generations. In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs. “Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active.

2025-05-26T14:40:52.000Z,"Hedge Funds Quietly Load Up on Bitcoin ETFs IBIT and FBTC","Institutional investors, led by some of the globe's largest hedge funds, are quietly snapping up Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC. This heightened demand is consistent with estimates that institutions could hold up to 4.2 million Bitcoin (BTC) by 2026, a move that could exacerbate the cryptocurrency's supply shortage. Key Players Driving ETF Inflows No fewer than six top-10 macro hedge funds such as Millennium Management, Citadel, and Bridgewater Associates have put Bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios during Q2 2024, as per regulatory filings and industry sources. The funds are said to be investing 1–3% of AUM into spot-BTC ETFs, which indicates increasing confidence in Bitcoin as a macro asset. Millennium, which controls over $60 billion, announced a $240 million investment in IBIT in May, while Citadel has put $180 million into FBTC. Smaller funds like SkyBridge Capital and Paulson & Co. have also increased exposure, referencing Bitcoin's ”asymmetric return potential” amid geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns. Institutional Demand and the 4.2 Million BTC Prediction Bernstein and Fidelity analysts approximate that institutions could hold 4.2 million BTC by 2026, nearly 20% of Bitcoin's total supply. This prediction is founded on the assumption of exponentially growing ETF inflows, which have already totaled $15 billion in 2024 alone. ”Bitcoin is transforming from a speculative asset to a strategic reserve,” says Gautam Chhugani, Bernstein senior analyst. ”ETFs are the gateway for institutions to gain exposure without the operational risks of direct custody.”. The math is stark: with only 900,000 BTC left to mine by 2140 and 3 million BTC already controlled by long-term ”hodlers,” institutional demand could outstrip incoming supply in two years. Supply Squeeze Looming Bitcoin's preordained supply of 21 million coins and readily predictable issuance schedule (four-yearly halvings) make it extremely vulnerable to demand shocks. If institutions gobble up 4.2 million BTC, retail investors, exchanges, and miners would be battling for a mere 12.9 million remaining coins — a thing that would likely fuel price volatility. ”The next halving in 2028 will drop new supply to 3,125 BTC per day,” says Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy. ”If you combine that with ETF-driven demand, the supply and demand imbalance becomes explosive.” Why Hedge Funds Are Flocking to Bitcoin ETFs Hedge funds are drawn to Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC for their regulatory transparency, liquidity, and ease of access compared to outright crypto ownership. As compared to traditional spot Bitcoin purchasing, ETFs allow money to gain exposure through standard brokerage accounts, making reporting and compliance easier. This simplicity is especially enticing for big institutions with complex custodial and audit requirements. Moreover, the growing popularity of Bitcoin as a macro hedge against inflation and currency devaluation has made it an intriguing addition to diversified portfolios. As additional capital seeks uncorrelated returns and fiat risk hedging, Bitcoin ETFs are emerging as a vehicle of preference bridging the gap between conventional finance and digital asset markets. Risks and Challenges Despite bullish expectations, risks remain. Regulatory uncertainty, perhaps most significantly from the SEC's ongoing study of crypto markets, can sober institutional participation. Additionally, Bitcoin's price volatility and energy consumption objections remain as headwinds. The Bottom Line Hedge funds' rising Bitcoin ETF bets point to a seismic shift in institutional sentiment. With demand on the cusp of outstripping supply, the stage is set for a record supply squeeze and potential price explosion that can redefine Bitcoin's role in global finance.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9265/hedge-funds-quietly-load-up-on-bitcoin-et-fs-ibit-and-fbtc,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T14:37:20.000Z,"What A U.S. Sovereign Debt Crisis Means For Bitcoin","Summary I rate Bitcoin a Strong Buy, as macro conditions favor its potential to mature into a global reserve asset amid US debt and credibility crises. The US is likely to follow Japan and Italy in permanent monetary expansion, fueling currency debasement and boosting demand for scarce assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin's price rises with increased global liquidity, supported by its scarcity and durability. We now live in a world where all major economic blocs are set to increase liquidity. Bitcoin remains a high-risk, asymmetric bet, but I think the current global monetary expansion makes this an excellent entry point for long-term investors. Seven years ago, Vijay Boyapatii published an article titled “The Bullish Case for Bitcoin” on Medium. A non-technical introduction to Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ), the article became a hit in the Bitcoin community and was also published as a book later. I recommend anyone interested in understanding Bitcoin - skeptics included - to read it. The reason I like this piece is that it does an excellent job of explaining why Bitcoin has all the characteristics to be a superior global reserve asset. I have discussed most of these elements myself in my past coverage of Bitcoin: Arguing how Bitcoin may be stuck in a specific trading range long term. Discussing how Bitcoin has evolved to be a reserve asset , not a currency. Updating my bull case for the Trump administration . In this article, I won’t repeat myself, and I will take for granted that readers are aware of the technical characteristics of Bitcoin . I will focus this piece on discussing the probability of Bitcoin maturing as a global reserve asset in light of the current macro scenario. I believe recent events in the bond markets are sending a clear signal: there is a growing need for a superior, neutral global reserve asset to fight currency debasement. The US debt & credibility crisis: to understand it, look at Italy and Japan There is no denying that US debt has been undergoing a crisis since Trump took office. Yields on 10-year US bonds ( US10Y ) are rising, being close to all-time highs for the year. This is happening despite a Q2 US GDP contraction , cool CPI data at just above 2%, and Truflation (a proprietary, non-lagging inflation indicator) being under 2% for more than two months. Why is this happening? As I have outlined in previous pieces covering the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( TLT ), I think this is a function of two dynamics: US Interest rates might stay higher for longer because of inflationary pressures coming from the uncertain scope of trade tariffs and a ballooning US deficit (and US debt). Uncertainty over the direction of interest rates is understandable, given the recent tax cuts bill that passed in Congress and the fact that the US is running a deficit in line. Some foreign actors may be selling US treasuries for political reasons (including Trump’s trade war), inducing a further decline in demand for US Debt. The results are visible, with a weak auction for 20 and 30-year treasuries that took place on May 21. I see the current US Debt crisis as a credibility issue. Despite running on a political platform that heavily criticized Biden’s approach to a large government deficit in times of full employment, I believe markets are waking up to the fact that America’s deficit (and ballooning debt) are never going to be tackled. All the while, demand for US debt is decreasing as Trump alienates trade partners that used to be major buyers of US debt. To understand what the future may look like for US debt, I find it helpful to look at areas of the developed world that have already undergone a debt crisis. First, let’s take Italy . The country has struggled with ballooning debt and one of the world’s highest GDP-to-debt ratios since the early 2010s. What readers may be surprised to hear is that Italy has de facto bankrupted in the open market during the pandemic. Italy debt, ECB purchases (OMFIF dot org) The chart above shows how for a few quarters during the peak of the pandemic, the European Central Bank (ECB, marked as “Banca d’Italia” in the chart) was the only net buyer of Italian debt. In other words, the only reason why Italy was able to finance its debt for the best part of one year is because the ECB acted as a lender of last resort . The second, and perhaps more known case, is about Japan . Japan’s GDP to public debt ratio is the highest in the world for a developed nation. The country is de facto relying on issuing debt to face a secular declining demographic trend that is only compounded by stagnant productivity . Once again, the reason Japan’s economy has been somewhat resilient despite its skyrocketing debt is because the Bank of Japan [BoJ] has acted as a lender of last resort. JGBs held by the BoJ (nippon dot org) The chart above shows exactly how the BoJ has held an increasing amount of debt issued by the government of Japan, to the point that this now represents more than half the total holdings in the BoJ’s balance sheet. How is a US sovereign debt crisis going to impact Bitcoin? We are at a point where the US is to de facto leave its debt uncontrolled and run a permanent deficit regardless of the status of the economy. In other terms, the “supply” of US debt (issuance of new bonds) is set to increase in the long run. At the same time, we are also witnessing a decrease in global demand for the same debt - thanks, at least in part, to Trump’s own trade policies, which alienate countries that historically bought most of America’s debt, such as Japan and China. In the context of an increase in new debt and a decrease in demand, I believe it's reasonable to assume that the US will have to resort to “buy its own debt” (similarly to what the BoJ and ECB have done in their own jurisdictions), in three ways: The US Treasury will buy more US debt , in continuity , with the program initiated by former secretary Yellen. The Fed will initiate their own treasury purchase program , starting to act as a “lender of last resort”. I wouldn’t be surprised to eventually see the Fed making a statement similar to that of Mario Draghi in the early 2010s, ensuring markets will do “ whatever it takes ” to ensure the stability of the system. The return of Zero-Interest-Rate-Policy [ZIRP], as long as inflation is in check. In other terms, I think the US is set to go towards a policy of permanent monetary expansion to avoid a worsening of its own debt crisis. Readers who are familiar with the history of Bitcoin will know that the price of Bitcoin tends to track the rate of global monetary expansion (as shown in the chart below). BTC vs. M2 Money Growth (geometrics dot com) In very plain terms, the more liquidity is injected into the global systems, the more Bitcoin benefits. This is, again, hardly surprising for anyone knowing that Bitcoin has all the technical characteristics to be a perfect reserve asset: it is durable, divisible, fungible, portable verifiable and, most importantly, extremely scarce. Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), the reserve asset that has served humanity well for the last 5,000 years, has already rallied and is tracking quite well the expansion of the money supply, as shown by the chart below. Gold vs. M2 Money Growth (FRED) We are now living in a world where all major economic blocs have effectively accepted they need to expand their monetary base indefinitely to face threats. China and Europe have already initiated expansionary policies akin to quantitative easing, and I think America is soon to follow suit. In this context, I think there is more than enough room for a new global reserve asset , even if gold is not going anywhere any time soon. Bitcoin remains a high-risk bet, but with a context of global monetary expansion, I believe it represents one of the best asymmetric opportunities in the markets today, in my view. My valuation model for Bitcoin I have detailed my valuation model for Bitcoin in my past BTC coverage, last updating it in November after the election of Donald J Trump. Today, I reiterate my target of up to $750,000 per Bitcoin in a bullish case where Bitcoin matures to roughly match the size of gold as an asset class (to be fair, after gold’s recent bull run, this figure should be higher, but I am sticking to it for simplification). My bearish case also remains Bitcoin at $50,000 per coin, reflecting day trading activity focused on short-term gains. Author's work My expected value for an asymmetric bet on Bitcoin, based on three probability scenarios and these bull and bear cases, is between $112,500 and $200,000 per Bitcoin. With Bitcoin trading just below $110,000 per coin at the time of writing, I continue to rate it a STRONG BUY - in other words, I see today’s prices as an excellent entry point. Risk to my thesis Bitcoin today remains a high-risk, asymmetric bet - even as it recently climbed to new All-Time Highs. If BTC ends up ever maturing into a global reserve asset, by the time this happens the asymmetric opportunity will have vanished. By definition entering a position in BTC today is a high-risk move, as it provides potentially outsized returns. There are various bear theses on Bitcoin, including a potential disruption from quantum computing and the issue of the BTC blockchain being too centralized as less and less Bitcoins are mined. While I think these theories can be debunked and do not represent credible threats to Bitcoin, I do invite readers to inform and educate themselves about bearish theories before investing in Bitcoin. Ultimately, readers who are not convinced about Bitcoin for any reason should stay away from this bet altogether. Even those readers who are not should be aware of volatility - something that, I think, is bound to remain in the future as Bitcoin matures. Other lessons from Italy & Japan Intellectually curious readers may wonder what may be the effects of the US running a larger permanent deficit. Even if this is not, something closely linked to Bitcoin, I want to spend a few words illustrating what fate Japan and Italy faced after effectively receiving an unlimited amount of credit for years by their respective central banks. Below are some effects the countries experienced: A weaker sovereign currency, with the Japanese Yen ( USD:JPY ) on a secular decline against the USD. Note that Italy did not suffer the same fate because it shares its currency with the rest of the Eurozone, which includes countries that are considered more fiscally reliable than America, such as Germany. A significant lag in the growth of salaries in real terms. Both Japan and Italy have seen salaries stagnating to the levels of 30 years ago. Weak productivity and GDP growth. Japan’s GDP , at $4.2 Trillion, is still well below its 1995 peak. Italy’s GDP , while higher than in the 1990s, is still roughly where it was before the Great Financial Crisis. To be clear, I think there are some limits to what we can draw from Italy’s and Japan’s situation in relation to the future of America. I think America has a far better demographic outlook than Italy and Japan, and it is also a more resilient and innovative economy. However, ultimately, one of the effects of currency debasement has been a decrease in real wages , as shown by the chart below. I do expect this trend to continue and perhaps accelerate. This is, in my view, yet another incentive to hold real and scarce assets, Bitcoin included. US Real Wages Evolution (BLS) Conclusion US Treasuries have traditionally been considered a global “safe haven” asset. That was a function of the USA being the global force for market economy, democracy, and the rule of law. Importantly, high demand for US debt was also a function of America running a large trade deficit (net exporters need to reinvest their USD, and they tended to do so in US Treasuries). Following the first 100+ days of the Trump administration, I think markets are waking up to the fact that the structural issue of a US high deficit and a high debt is never going to be tackled, and the US is going to have to permanently issue more debt. Not to mention, Trump’s questionable trade policies are simultaneously decreasing demand for its own debt. I think the US will need to start buying its own debt, with the Fed acting as a lender of last resort in a similar fashion to what the BoJ and ECB have done in Japan and Italy. In the context of this crisis, it may seem odd to see assets, including Bitcoin, returning to levels last seen before the start of this administration or even climbing to new ATHs. However, I think it would be odd to see the opposite. I believe markets are simply discounting the return of currency debasement - a term that I use to include all kinds of expansionary monetary tools such as quantitative easing, ZIRP, and treasury buybacks. We now have a world where all major economic blocs - America, China, Japan, Europe - are either already adopting or set to adopt expansionary monetary policies . More liquidity in the system has historically resulted in inflation in the price of real, scarce assets. Gold has already rallied, and I think there is room for Bitcoin to do well, too. Bitcoin remains a high-risk bet as an asset may never mature into a global reserve, but it is, in my view, one of the best asymmetric bets on the market at the moment. And one thing is for sure: macro conditions could not be more favorable for Bitcoin to potentially mature. That’s why I rate it once again as a Strong Buy , seeing a potential of upwards of $750,000 per coin.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789867-what-a-us-sovereign-debt-crisis-means-for-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T14:36:40.000Z,"Analyst Forecasts BTC Short-Term Holders Could Drive Price to $162K in Weeks","Bitcoin’s current rally may only be warming up, with market watchers predicting a potential surge to $162,000 by mid-June, largely driven by short-term holders approaching a critical profit threshold. According to Axel Adler Jr., Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for those who’ve held the cryptocurrency for a maximum of three months sits at 27%. The Short-Term Holder Catalyst In a May 26 post on X, the macro researcher noted that historically, this cohort begins selling when unrealized profits go beyond 40%, creating notable price resistance. His analysis shows the indicator rising at 0.818 percentage points per day, suggesting it could cross the 40% mark around June 11, 2025, at which point BTC could hit $162,000, barring unexpected macro disruptions. Adler’s projection may have found some support from pseudonymous analyst Dr. Profit, who flagged a “rare and powerful” Golden Cross signal, which he claims has preceded major Bitcoin rallies in the last two years. Noting an 87.8% historical accuracy rate on higher timeframes, he cited similar technical setups in October 2023 and October 2024, which triggered price increases of 170% and 173%, respectively. With the latest signal flashing in May, Dr. Profit is maintaining a short-term range of $117,000 to $120,000, highlighting major price catalysts such as strong exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which are absorbing new supply at nine times the mining rate, Strategy’s continued BTC accumulation, and a liquidity cluster at $113,000. On-Chain Data Reinforcing Bullish Thesis The flagship cryptocurrency’s recent on-chain behavior has also reinforced the bullish narrative. Per Santiment data, as of May 23, BTC’s Mean Dollar Age, which measures how long coins are held, had dropped from 441 to 429 days since mid-April. This suggests that dormant Bitcoin is moving again, something experts typically view as a hallmark of the early stages of a bull run. Furthermore, figures from Glassnode indicate that while BTC recently hit an all-time high of $111,814 (ATH) on May 22, realized profit-taking remains subdued. Just $1 billion in profits were realized, an amount less than half of the volume seen when BTC first crossed $100,000. Meanwhile, in the last 24 hours, the crypto asset has gained 2.3%, buoyed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s extension of the deadline for a 50% tariff on the EU, pushing its weekly rise to 6.7%. Additionally, Bitcoin’s current price of $110,085 reflects a 16.3% climb over 30 days. And despite slipping 1.6% from its ATH, the king cryptocurrency’s market cap is holding firm at $2.18 trillion, cementing its position as the fifth-largest asset globally.

The flagship cryptocurrency registered an increase of over 1% to reclaim $109,000 and move to its current level of $109,620. Ethereum (ETH) had dipped below $2,500 over the weekend, registered an increase of over 2%, and moved to $2,575. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) rose over 1% to $2.34, while Solana (SOL) rose over 2% to move closer to $180. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. However, Toncoin (TON) bucked the bullish trend and registered a decline of nearly 1%. The crypto market cap registered a rise of 1.36% over the past 24 hours and currently sits at $109,659. President Trump’s Proximity To Crypto Raises Ethical Concerns President Donald Trump’s push to ease crypto oversight while his family expands their crypto empire has raised ethical and legal concerns. Congressional Democrats, watchdog groups, and even some Republicans have criticized the President for peddling his own meme coin, TRUMP, by personally hosting a dinner at his Virginia golf club. The attendees included the biggest holders of the meme coin. Trump held a separate private reception for the 25 biggest buyers of the token. Attendees spent $148 million to attend the event, which will benefit Trump and his associates, according to crypto firm Inca Digital. The Trump family crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, has also been tapped to play a key role in a $2 billion investment deal by an Abu Dhabi financial fund in Binance. Binance had pleaded guilty to US money laundering and other violations. The deal was announced at an Abu Dhabi crypto conference two weeks before Trump visited the UAE. Trump’s pursuit of crypto fortunes was highlighted in a report by the State Democracy Defenders Fund, which estimated the value of his crypto ventures to be $2.9 billion, a significant sum considering the business ventures are only a year old. Democrats and watchdogs believe Trump is exploiting his office for personal gain in unprecedented and dangerous ways. Richard Painter, a former White House ethics advisor, stated, “There is the appearance, if not the reality of corruption in the upcoming dinner with Trump on the 22nd at his Virginia golf club for the 220 biggest Trump meme coin buyers and the private reception he’s promised for the top 25 buyers, plus the separate $2bn deal between World Liberty Financial and the Abu Dhabi investment vehicle.” Other legal and ethical experts also voiced concerns, with Columbia Law Professor and expert on government ethics Richard Briffault stating, “Trump is marketing access to himself as a way to profit his memecoin. People are paying to meet Trump, and he’s the regulator in chief. It’s doubly corrupt. This is unprecedented. I don’t think there’s been anything like this in American history.” Michael Saylor Hints At Imminent Bitcoin Purchase Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has hinted at an imminent Bitcoin (BTC) purchase by posting the BTC chart typically posted before big purchases. Saylor’s posts on Sunday generally indicate the company will purchase BTC when the traditional markets open the following day. “I only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose.” According to data from SaylorTracker, Strategy holds 576,230 BTC, valued at over $62.5 billion at current prices. The firm is up over 55% on its investment, with unrealized gains of over $22 billion at the time of writing. Investors closely watch the company as a proxy for BTC and a barometer for institutional adoption of the asset. Crypto ETFs Will Not Lose Importance Despite Wallet Adoption Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes crypto ETFs will maintain their place in the economy despite the growing adoption of crypto wallets. According to Wood, ETFs are an important stepping stone in the crypto economy and will attract investors due to the complexity of crypto wallets. Speaking at the Solana Accelerate event in New York, Wood stated, “I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button. So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster. But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Data from Bitbo revealed there are over 200 million active Bitcoin wallets worldwide. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered $2.75 billion inflows for the week ending May 23. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) bounced back after a brief weekend dip, which saw the price drop to an intraday low of $106,726 on Sunday. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high on Thursday as it shattered the $110,000 level and raced to $111,970. However, it lost momentum after hitting a wall of resistance around $112,000. President Trump’s renewed tariff threats also dampened investor sentiment, driving the price down nearly 4% on Friday to $106,816. BTC has shown signs of weakness following Friday’s decline. However, bulls have not ceded ground to the bears, with the price maintaining its position above $105,000. The price has rebounded despite President Trump’s latest tariff threat. However, analysts believe overall sentiment around the asset is positive, with BTC reclaiming the $110,000 level at the time of writing. An increasingly fragile global macroeconomic environment driven by concerns about inflation and fiscal stability has seen investors question the US Treasury’s role as a safe-haven asset and pivot to crypto. Bond yields have surged while global growth has stalled, leading to consumer confidence in the US dipping to historic lows. The US 5-year to 30-year bond spread rose to 1%, indicating the markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher-for-longer” rate environment. BTC entered the previous weekend on a bearish note, registering a marginal decline on Friday (May 16) and Saturday and settling at $103,235. Despite the bearish sentiment, the price rebounded on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as it started the week in the red. However, the price recovered from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a decline of nearly 1%. BTC was back in positive territory on Tuesday, registering an increase of 1.21% and settling at $106,854. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as the price registered an increase of 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, surging past $110,000 and reaching an intraday high of $111,970 before settling at $111,582. Price action turned bearish on Friday thanks to President Trump’s renewed tariff threats. As a result, BTC fell nearly 4% to $107,356. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Saturday to settle at $109,095. The flagship cryptocurrency has reclaimed $110,000 during the ongoing session and is up just over 1%, trading around $110,220. If BTC crosses $112,000, a move to $115,000 can be expected. A break above this level could see the price surge to $120,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) found support around the $2,500 mark after registering a substantial dip on Friday, keeping its prospects of reclaiming $2,700 alive. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency faced rejection around the $2,730 mark on Friday triggering a decline of over 5% to a low of $2,505. ETH traded in positive territory over the weekend despite facing selling pressure. ETH faces significant selling pressure at around $2,700 and $2,800. It could begin a surge to $3,000 if it crosses these levels. ETH faced considerable selling pressure and volatility over the previous weekend, starting with a marginal drop on Friday. Selling pressure intensified on Saturday as the price fell 2.44% to $2,475. ETH faced volatility and selling pressure on Sunday, dropping to a low of $2,326 and reaching an intraday high of $2,585 before ultimately registering an increase of 0.915 and settling at $2,498. The price plunged to an intraday low of $2,349 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.18%, reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,527. ETH registered a marginal decline on Tuesday before rebounding on Wednesday and settling at $2,552. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rose over 4% to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,664. The price reached an intraday high of $2,731 on Friday but lost momentum after encountering selling pressure. As a result, ETH fell over 5% and settled at $2,525. The price recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $2,551. The current session sees ETH up almost 1%, trading near $2,570. However, a bearish MACD indicates growing selling pressure, suggesting a decline is imminent. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana’s (SOL) push toward $200 stalled on Friday after it hit a wall of resistance around $185. SOL registered a dramatic price jump last week, prompting speculations the Ethereum killer could retake $200 for the first time since February. Despite stubborn upper-level resistance, SOL remains up by around $82% from its lowest levels.

2025-05-26T14:30:32.000Z,"From Riches To Chains: Crypto King Arrested For Torturing Bitcoin Investor In Horror Scheme","John Woeltz’s story has taken a dramatic turn following reports of kidnapping and assault. Woeltz, also known as the ‘Crypto King of Kentucky,’ has been arrested for torturing a Bitcoin investor in an attempt to steal their coins and now faces up to 25 years in prison. Crypto King Tortures Bitcoin Investor For Private Keys According to the Hindustan Times , John Woeltz, believed to be worth around $100 million, kidnapped and tortured an Italian man for his Bitcoin password in New York. Woeltz, who is a crypto investor from Kentucky, allegedly used a chainsaw on the victim as part of an attempt to obtain the password. However, he was unsuccessful with the victim eventually escaping. The victim broke out of the New York apartment and reported to the cops that he had been held captive for over two weeks. John Woeltz reportedly kidnapped the victim on May 6 after he arrived in New York from Italy, after both had agreed to meet. The Crypto King then snatched the victim’s passport and held him captive. Woeltz tortured the Bitcoin investor and even documented it with Polaroids in the following days. The report revealed that there were photos of the victim, who is also a crypto trader, tied up with an electrical wire, while another photo showed him tied to a chair and a gun pointed at his head. The Crypto King of Kentucky went as far as threatening to kill the victim’s family in Italy to force him to give up his Bitcoin password. Meanwhile, in another act of desperation, John Woeltz took the Bitcoin investor to the top flight of stairs of the apartment and hung him over the ledge, threatening to kill him if he didn’t give up the BTC password . The suspect had also cut the victim’s legs and arm with a chainsaw, while there are pictures that showed he was even forced to take cocaine. The victim managed to escape after telling the Crypto King that he was ready to give up the password by plugging it into his laptop. Once the suspect turned to get the computer, the victim ran to the street. Woeltz Crypto Background And What’s Next For The Crypto King John Woeltz is known for his wealth of experience in the crypto industry, specifically blockchain security . He once attended a crypto conference, where he discussed Grin’s security audit and the hurdles involved. The Crypto King also revealed that the scope of the audit was limited to the crypto library. Now, the Crypto King’s story has turned from a fairytale to a nightmare, with Woeltz being charged with two counts of second-degree assault, first-degree kidnapping, first-degree unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a weapon. The court has denied him bail, with the prosecutors arguing that he is a flight risk. He faces 15 to 25 years if found guilty.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-king-bitcoin-investor/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Blockchain security|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto King|Hindustan Times|John Woeltz|new york|Polaroids",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T14:30:19.000Z,"Crypto Trader Says 2021-Style Bitcoin Bull Market Peak Unlikely, Unveils Upside Target for BTC in Two Months","A trader with a history of making accurate predictions in the crypto space believes Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) multi-year uptrend is built on solid ground. Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 153,800 followers on the social media platform X that a repeat of BTC’s 2021 double-top pattern is doubtful. About four years ago, Bitcoin abruptly ended its bull market after failing to take out its resistance at $69,000 twice. Dave the Wave notes in his chart that a parabolic move preceded BTC’s 2021 market peak. The steep ascent left Bitcoin exposed as panic selling and massive liquidation events drove BTC from a high of $69,000 to around $16,000. On the contrary, the trader says that Bitcoin’s rise since 2023 has been sustainable as BTC printed higher highs and higher lows over time. He notes that a 2021-style collapse is “unlikely” at this point. Source: Dave the Wave/X In his bullish Bitcoin outlook, Dave the Wave thinks that it is within the realm of possibility for BTC to soar to his massive upside target in just a couple of months. “Oh boy, I’ll be selling a little BTC for the fam if it hits $160,000 over the course of the next couple of months…” Source: Dave the Wave/X For now, Dave the Wave says that Bitcoin needs to breach its last resistance zone to potentially trigger a parabolic rally toward his target. “BTC convincingly through $110,000 and we could be looking at a front-run blow-off top…” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $109,628.

2025-05-26T14:30:13.000Z,"XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip?","Investor optimism for a spot XRP ETF has climbed sharply. Based on Polymarket’s data, the odds of a green light sit at 83%. That figure comes even as the US Securities and Exchange Commission keeps pushing decisions back. Some industry watchers say the regulator simply uses its full review window. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $125K By End Of Q2? Bold Call From Bybit Executive Analyst Predictions And Timeline According to Bloomberg’s James Seyffart, the SEC often takes the full 240 days to weigh 19b-4 filings. He pointed out that the agency asked for an extra 45 days on May 20 to rule on Bitwise’s Ether staking change, moving the deadline to May 22. Based on his posts on X, almost all spot ETF bids now face final due dates in October. That makes any early summer approvals highly unlikely. Spot Versus Futures Products On May 19, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rolled out an XRP futures contract for the first time. A few days later, Volatility Shares listed the XRPI futures ETF on Nasdaq. Then Tectrium added a 2x Long Daily XRP ETF for those seeking more leverage. These products let traders bet on XRP’s future price in a regulated setting. They are not the same as a spot ETF, but they signal growing interest among big investors. Institutional Access Through ETFs Based on reports, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, spoke on the company’s podcast about why ETFs matter. He said ETFs let Wall Street buy crypto without wrestling with exchanges or private wallets. He highlighted that the Bitcoin ETF hit $1 billion in assets faster than any other, and then reached $10 billion on record. That track record, he argued, paves the way for similar products tied to XRP. Market Outlook And Caution According to SEC filings and industry chatter, delays are normal. The commission has already postponed decisions on Grayscale’s XRP tracking fund and a Solana ETF. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Analysts warn that odds in prediction markets can shift wildly. An 83% chance today could drop if the SEC raises new questions or requests another comment period. Investors should keep an eye on the calendar as October approaches. Excitement And Patience The buzz around an XRP spot ETF reflects real excitement, but history shows regulators move slowly. Futures ETFs like XRPI offer one path into XRP’s market, yet they come with quirks like contango and premium swings. For now, institutions and retail traders alike will watch the SEC’s deadlines with keen interest—and maybe a bit of patience.

2025-05-26T14:29:38.000Z,"Strategy Buys BTC: $427M Bitcoin Haul Pushes Holdings to Record 580K","Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) has deepened its already commanding position in the Bitcoin market, with a fresh purchase of 4,020 BTC for $427.1 million during the week of May 19–25. The coins were acquired at an average price of $106,237 per coin as part of the company’s ongoing at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program. Strategy continues to lean heavily into its role as the world’s first Bitcoin Treasury Company, a designation it has embraced since pivoting away from its traditional software business. The latest purchase pushes Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 580,250 BTC—acquired for approximately $40.61 billion at an average purchase price of $69,979 per Bitcoin . Record Holdings, Solid Yield As of May 25, 2025, Strategy reports a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 16.8%, further cementing its status as the leading corporate holder of the digital asset. This outperformance relative to traditional assets supports Strategy’s thesis that Bitcoin remains the most robust long-term store of value in the modern financial system. The company’s growing Bitcoin treasury is the result of its accumulation strategy fueled by both surplus cash flow and capital raised through equity offerings. The most recent $427 million funding round allowed this latest acquisition, showing investors’ continued appetite to back Strategy’s Bitcoin-centric vision. The Bitcoin Treasury Blueprint Strategy’s founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, has long championed the role of bitcoin in corporate treasury management, frequently describing it as “digital gold with none of the drawbacks.” Strategy has acquired 4,020 BTC for ~$427.1 million at ~$106,237 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.8% YTD 2025. As of 5/25/2025, we hodl 580,250 $BTC acquired for ~$40.61 billion at ~$69,979 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/eAd03GIKam — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 26, 2025 By consistently executing this high-conviction strategy, Strategy has created a playbook for publicly traded companies looking for exposure to bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Some critics have warned about the risks of overexposure to a single volatile asset. Strategy’s growing base of institutional investors and long-term BTC yield suggest that the market is still buying in—literally and figuratively. Saylor’s Bitcoin Bet Could Make Strategy the Top Public Stock A recent Financial Times documentary, Michael Saylor’s $40 Billion Bitcoin Bet, explores the bold vision behind Strategy’s approach. In the film, Jeff Walton, an analyst at Strategy, claims the company could eventually become the top publicly traded firm in the world, propelled by its singular focus on Bitcoin. “Strategy holds more of the best asset and most pristine collateral on the planet than any other company, by multiples,” Walton said. He argues that the firm’s massive exposure to Bitcoin—viewed by many as digital gold—gives it an unmatched strategic edge in a volatile macroeconomic environment.

2025-05-26T14:29:12.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Starts Week On Positive Note, Briefly Crosses $110,000","Bitcoin (BTC) recovered over the weekend after a sharp decline on Friday. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,970 before settling at $111,582. However, it plunged to $107,356 after losing momentum on Friday. Thanks to the weekend recovery, BTC is up over 2%, trading around $109,825 after briefly crossing $110,000 during the ongoing session. Michael Saylor Hints At Impending Bitcoin Purchase Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has hinted at an imminent Bitcoin purchase after its recent decline from its all-time high. Saylor posted the BTC chart typically posted before big purchases, suggesting that Strategy will purchase Bitcoin once the traditional markets open on Monday. Saylor posted on X, “I only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose.” Strategy currently holds 576,230 BTC , valued at over $62.5 billion at current prices. If the firm completes its acquisition on May 26, it will mark the seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases. Strategy has become synonymous with the flagship cryptocurrency since pivoting to the asset, inspiring other companies to follow its lead and purchase Bitcoin. This has created sustained demand for the asset from institutional investors, helping bolster the price to record levels. Analysts like Jeff Walton believe Strategy could become a $10 trillion company, and potentially command the title of the most valuable publicly-traded corporation in the world thanks to its growing Bitcoin stockpile. Walton stated, “Strategy holds more of the best assets, and the most pristine collateral, on the entire planet than any other company, by multiples.” DDC Enterprise Buys 21 Bitcoin (BTC) Hong Kong-headquartered heat-and-eat meal seller DDC Enterprise has made its first-ever Bitcoin purchase as part of its plan to acquire 5,000 BTC over the next three years. The firm announced on May 23 that it had completed the acquisition of 21 Bitcoin in exchange for 354,333 shares in a deal valued at $2.28 million. It plans on buying another 79 BTC across two purchases to bring the total to 100. The acquisitions are part of the company’s plan to acquire 5,000 BTC over the next three years. If it held 5,000 Bitcoin today, it would be just outside the top 10 public companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings, putting it behind Japanese firm Metaplanet, which has 7,800 Bitcoin. Bitcoin Crunch As Demand Outpaces Supply A supply crunch is reshaping the Bitcoin market as corporates hog millions of coins and dry up available liquidity. Daily corporate acquisitions are outpacing mining output, leading experts to warn of an impending imbalance that could redefine Bitcoin’s role from a volatile asset to a strategic reserve. New forecasts predict trillions in institutional inflows, while long-term holders and governments are reluctant to sell their holdings. Experts believe Bitcoin could be on the verge of a structural transformation as centralized exchanges run dry. According to a prediction by UTXO’s Guillaume Girard and Will Owens, institutions will invest $130 billion in Bitcoin in 2025, with the number set to rise to $300 billion in 2026. They predict institutions will purchase 4.2 million Bitcoin, a staggering 20% of its total supply. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, 3.35 million BTC were held in corporate, state, and other treasuries. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is steadying itself between $109,000 and $110,000 after witnessing a dramatic decline on Friday. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to a new all-time high on Saturday but lost momentum after encountering selling pressure around $112,000. President Trump’s renewed tariff threats against the EU also dampened investor sentiment. However, the price recovered over the weekend, climbing above $109,000 on Sunday and briefly crossing $110,000 during the ongoing session before declining. The price has rebounded despite President Trump’s latest tariff threat. However, analysts believe overall sentiment around the asset is positive. BTC registered a marginal decline last Friday as it entered the previous weekend on a bearish note. The price registered a marginal drop on Saturday (May 17) but rebounded on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Despite the bearish sentiment, BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to reclaim $106,000 and settle at $106,854.

2025-05-26T14:23:39.000Z,"The Sui Coin Alternative: Why Bitcoin Solaris at $4 Could Be Your Gateway to Financial Independence in 2025","The post The Sui Coin Alternative: Why Bitcoin Solaris at $4 Could Be Your Gateway to Financial Independence in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Sui made headlines for launching a next-generation Layer 1 with developer-centric architecture, Move-based smart contracts, and high throughput. It attracted capital and attention as a promising Ethereum competitor, particularly for DeFi and Web3 applications. Yet, despite the technical merits, the reward model for everyday users has remained narrow. Without native rewards for most holders or low-barrier participation tools, Sui has struggled to convert passive holders into active earners. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris is beginning to outpace it in user-level momentum. Designed from the ground up for accessibility and protocol-level rewards, Bitcoin Solaris introduces a smartphone-based mining system, fixed-supply economics, and a presale model with 5X upside — all in one integrated ecosystem. From Holding Tokens to Earning Them With a Smartphone At the center of Bitcoin Solaris’s appeal is its Nova App, a mobile mining interface that allows users to earn BTC-S tokens daily. Mining requires only 1–5 GB of storage and background CPU, typically while the phone is idle or charging. The process is automatic, and rewards are based on uptime. Unlike Sui, which primarily rewards developers and institutional validators, Bitcoin Solaris gives earning power back to individual users. There’s no need to operate infrastructure, no lockups, and no risk of slashing. The mobile-native mining model is designed to make wealth creation as frictionless as possible, even for those new to crypto. Blockchain Infrastructure That Scales With Demand The technical foundation of Bitcoin Solaris ensures it can grow with global demand. It operates on a dual-layer architecture: the Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to secure transactions, while the Solaris Layer runs Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) for high-speed smart contract execution and mining logic. This architecture allows the network to process 10,000+ transactions per second with 2-second finality. That performance, combined with fully decentralized mining access, gives Bitcoin Solaris a competitive edge — not only in terms of utility, but in wealth distribution potential. The system supports real-time, scalable earnings for users around the world. Fully Audited and Transparent Bitcoin Solaris has completed a full suite of audits and verification. The Cyberscope audit confirmed the integrity of smart contract code and token logic. The Freshcoins audit reviewed mobile mining scalability. And KYC verification was completed to ensure transparent governance and project legitimacy. These layers of oversight place Bitcoin Solaris in a select group of presale-stage projects offering verifiable, rule-based infrastructure for long-term value creation. The Price-to-Upside Window Remains Wide — For Now Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 5, where BTC-S is priced at 5 USDT. The token is scheduled to list at 20 USDT, offering presale participants a projected 4X return. From the fixed 21 million BTC-S supply, 4.2 million tokens (20%) are allocated to the full presale. Once that allocation is exhausted, new buyers will enter at market value, and Nova App mining difficulty will begin to adjust based on network size. That makes the current phase not just a price advantage — but a structural position of early influence, similar to early miners of Bitcoin or Ethereum before network saturation. In a recent analysis, Crypto Nitro broke down why Bitcoin Solaris is attracting a growing share of early-stage investment interest. He points to its mining model, capped supply, and presale economics as key drivers of its appeal — particularly when compared to Sui, where most of the upside has shifted toward infrastructure-level players. Sui built a technically strong Layer 1 — but for retail users, the path to wealth remains limited. Bitcoin Solaris reopens that path, combining fixed supply, accessible mobile mining, and a transparent presale window that mirrors the conditions behind early crypto fortunes. Now in Presale Phase 5 at 5 USDT, BTC-S is providing the kind of early-stage access and upside potential that could define financial independence in 2025 for those who act before the network matures.

Hong Kong-based DDC Enterprise (DayDayCook) has made its first Bitcoin purchase, acquiring 21 $BTC for $2.28M in stock. The company plans to accumulate 5,000 BTC over 3 years, starting with 100 BTC by the end of this month. #HongKong #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/NRWszo4t1c — Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) May 26, 2025 DDC targets 5,000 BTC by 2027 21 BTC purchased for $2.28 million DDC’s stock down 12% despite the crypto play Macro Woes Put Bitcoin in the Spotlight DDC’s move comes as global bond markets are in turmoil. U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government bonds are seeing yields spike—30-year U.S. Treasury yields hit 5.15%, the highest since 2023, while the 10-year reached 4.48%. U.S. debt is $36.8 trillion and expected to be $1 trillion in annual interest payments by 2025, so traditional safe havens are losing confidence. This macro backdrop is causing both retail and institutional investors to rethink their portfolio strategies. BTC, once seen as a speculative gamble, is now viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiscal instability. With bond yields rising and safe-haven confidence waning, BTC is becoming an alternative store of value. Spot ETF Demand and Technicals Say Buy Beyond DDC’s play, BTC’s credibility is being reinforced by institutional demand. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have over $104 billion in assets, showing a clear trend of mainstream investors getting into digital assets. Bitcoin ETF inflows are back — and so is $BTC Massive green bars = real demand. Price popped above $109K as capital floods in again. Institutional money is steering this market #Bitcoin #BTC #ETF #Crypto pic.twitter.com/6YnbNjVq0P — Sasha why NOT (@Sasha_why_N) May 26, 2025 Technically, the BTC/USD pair is consolidating around $109,782 after bouncing off recent lows. On the 2-hour chart, price is stuck at the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $109,653, with a tug-of-war between momentum and resistance. BTC Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart shows an ascending trendline from $102,190 as support. The 50-period EMA at $108,587 is immediate support, with a break below here risking a drop to $108,208 or trendline support at $107,052. A breakout above $110,000, confirmed by a bullish engulfing or three white soldiers pattern, could reach $111,935 or $113,500. MACD is hinting at a bullish reversal with the MACD line crossing above the signal line and green histogram bars appearing, but volume confirmation is pending. In this technical and macro environment, BTC’s dual role as a growth asset and safe haven is attractive which is keeping Bitcoin price prediction bullish. DDC’s big bet on BTC may be the start of a bigger corporate move into crypto. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.33M Cap as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With BTC/USD falling below $110,000, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised out of a $7.33 million cap. The presale is closing in on its limit, next presale price jump closes in fast. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.00253 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to holders looking for yield without complex requirements or risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,384,454/ $7,332,195 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity. The post Is This the Next MicroStrategy?

2025-05-26T14:10:09.000Z,"While Bitcoin is at $110,000 Levels, Industry Experts Make Bitcoin Price Predictions! Here Are 9 Experts' BTC Price Predictions","Bitcoin is on the rise again, rising above the $110,000 level after US President Donald Trump postponed his decision on new tariffs on the European Union. This development increased expectations that a new rally could begin in the markets. According to leading crypto investors and analysts, the upward momentum in Bitcoin price may continue. Investors on prediction platforms like Polymarket are placing strong bets that Bitcoin will surpass $115,000 by the end of May. In the Deribit options market, almost half of the call options in May 30 futures consist of positions that will pay off if BTC stays above $110,000. In December futures, $170,000 stands out as the most popular target. Here are the Evaluations of 9 Experts About Bitcoin: Arthur Hayes (Maelstrom) Former BitMEX CEO and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2028. According to Hayes, Trump’s economic policies and global geopolitical tensions will push investors away from US government bonds, and Bitcoin will be the new safe haven for this capital. Geoff Kendrick (Standard Chartered) Kendrick, chief crypto analyst at Standard Chartered, predicts that Bitcoin will reach $120,000 by July. Kendrick points out that investors have pulled $3.6 billion from gold ETFs in the last month and transferred $7.5 billion to Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, BTC ETFs currently hold close to 6% of the total supply. Kendrick says BTC could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025 and $500,000 by the end of 2028. Bernstein Analysts Three analysts from Bernstein stated that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2026 as institutional investment accelerates. The analysts said, “Wall Street will be the largest wallet for Bitcoin,” indicating that institutions will dominate the market. Noelle Acheson (Crypto is Macro Now) According to Madrid-based analyst Acheson, Bitcoin is seen as both a “risky asset” and a “safe haven.” This dual perception makes BTC a winner in various economic scenarios. Jay Jacobs (BlackRock) Jay Jacobs, head of BlackRock’s US Equity ETF, also stated that Bitcoin is increasingly acting as a “safe haven.” Emphasizing that BTC is different from technology stocks, Jacobs said that this situation has increased investor interest. Utkarsh Ahuja (Moon Pursuit Capital) Ahuja predicts that Bitcoin could see $120,000 in the first week of June. Stating that Trump’s dollar-weakening policies and the expectation of a rate cut are pushing BTC up, Ahuja said that Trump’s crypto-friendly stance is also positive for the market. Reece Hobson (eToro) Bitcoin could rise to $174,000, eToro Australia’s crypto analyst Hobson said on May 22. According to Hobson, this could just be the start of a new rally. Conclusion: New Highs Coming? Bitcoin has broken through key resistance levels amid Trump’s policies and renewed investor interest. Market players are now asking, “Is this just the beginning?” According to an analysis by 9 different experts, the probability of the BTC price moving higher in the coming months seems quite strong. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:00:09.000Z,"Don’t speculate on cryptocurrencies! Richminer data shows that smart money is making blood-sucking arbitrage through XRP cloud mining","As XRP breaks through its historical high, a “passive income revolution” is quietly emerging in the cryptocurrency field. As Ripple’s cooperation with global financial institutions deepens, XRP’s long-term value logic becomes clearer, and the evolution of the Richminer platform opens a new window for ordinary investors to participate without technical barriers and low risk – through Richminer’s intelligent configuration of computing power contracts and strategies, the goal of $100,000 in passive income per year has changed from being out of reach to a replicable wealth path. XRP uses Richminer to achieve compound interest on income XRP itself cannot be mined directly, but through cloud mining platforms such as Richminer, users can rent computing power to participate in the mining of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin, and automatically convert the income into XRP to form a passive income stream. How to start Richminer passive income: Use an email address to create an account, register and get a $15 reward, and the daily income is about $0.6. Maximize profit configuration: Choose RichMiner high-computing power contracts: give priority to renting Bitcoin or Dogecoin mining machines because of their high profit stability; the following potential high returns and flexible investment options. For example, New User Experience Contract (invest 100, potential total profit of 106 in 2 days). For example, Canaan Avalon A15XP (invest 600, potential total profit of 650.82 in 7 days). For example, Bitdeer SealMiner A2 (invest 1,600, potential total profit of 1,897.92 in 14 days). For example, Bitmain Antminer L9 (invest 12,000, potential total profit of 19,140 in 35 days). For example, Antspace HK3 V6 (invest 110,000, potential total profit of 228,250 in 50 days), with an average daily return rate of more than 2.15%. Click richminer.com for more details on mining contracts. Compound interest reinvestment model: The cloud mining income is regularly invested in the purchase of contracts to form a positive cycle of “income → purchase more cloud mining contracts → higher income”. Assuming an investment of $5,400, if the monthly rate of return reaches 45%, the principal plus income can reach about $7,843 after one month. Through compound interest reinvestment, the initial funds can grow rapidly. Through the use of the above strategies, the goal of $100,000 in passive income can be achieved efficiently. RichMiner core advantages Fully automated operation: The platform integrates intelligent AI technology to automatically process mining, optimization and income distribution, and daily income is automatically credited. Sustainable development of green energy: The platform uses renewable energy mines, which are in line with ESG trends and ensure long-term income stability. Multi-currency support and instant withdrawal: Supports mining and settlement of mainstream currencies such as BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, etc., with a withdrawal threshold as low as $100, daily processing of user withdrawal requests, and support for multiple protocols such as TRC20/ERC20. Professional team and global service: A team of blockchain experts and IT engineers provides 24/7 technical support. The platform interface supports 8 languages ​​and covers users in 132 countries. Industry-leading security and compliance guarantee Fund security: 95% of user funds are stored in cold wallets, using McAfee® and Cloudflare® encryption technology to prevent hacker attacks. Compliance certification: Holds the UK FCA license and the US MSB compliance certification, funds are entrusted to HSBC Bank, and there has been no security incident record for 3 consecutive years. Summary: XRP cloud mining is reshaping passive income, and daily income compounding is achieved with the help of Richminer’s green energy mining pool. Behind the goal of $100,000 is actually the accurate capture of Richminer trends and AI intelligent management. The future has come, and only the wise can control the craze with reason and anchor their own golden coordinates in the wave of XRP. Will you be the next wise man to control the XRP craze?

Altcoin market remains compressed, showing no clear breakout or crash. In past cycles, altcoins rallied months after Bitcoin’s breakout. While Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market continues its steady rise, one indicator is beginning to flash green for what might come next. The total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum has shown a reversal. This suggests that capital might slowly be rotating into altcoins, a classic early sign that an altcoin season could be loading. Bitcoin’s Historical Patterns Hint at What’s Ahead for Altcoins Historically, Bitcoin has followed a clear pattern during its bull runs. In both the 2017 and 2020–2021 cycles, the asset quickly surged into parabolic rallies after breaking its all-time highs. By comparing those past cycles to the current one, a major difference stands out: Bitcoin hasn’t made its parabolic move yet. Instead, it’s been consolidating around its all-time high level for several months — something that hasn’t happened in previous cycles.

Will the ETH Price Mark A New ATH in June 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets are heading towards yet another monthly close, which usually generates huge volatility. Although the Bitcoin trading volume has dropped to some extent, the investors continue to remain optimistic about the upcoming action. As a result, the BTC price is primed to maintain a continued ascending trend and eventually reclaim its levels within the discovery phase in a short while from now. On the other hand, Ethereum’s price continues to struggle around $2500, which raises concerns over its probability of forming new highs by the end of Q2 or during the second half of 2025. In a recent update, Strategy has announced a fresh Bitcoin acquisition of over 4000 BTC, holding nearly 580,250 BTC in total. With this, the investors could have become somewhat sure of the next BTC bullish wave. After the latest move, it was pretty sure that the bulls were relaxing ahead of the next price action, but the question is why the Ethereum price is failing to catch up to the trend. The second-largest token is away from its ATH by more than 47% in times when the BTC price has smashed new highs. With this huge disparity between the top two tokens, will the markets be able to revive a strong bullish momentum as they did in 2021? The above comparison chart of Bitcoin and ETH/USD & ETH/BTC shows the ETH price has lost its track. Both the ETH pairs are going hand in hand, suggesting the token is failing weakly against the USD as well as BTC. As the correlation between the top two tokens has dropped significantly since the start of the year, the rise in the BTC price has not been impacting the ETH price rally. Hence, a strong Ethereum bull run may begin once the ETH/BTC triggers a strong rebound and rises above 0.055 BTC. In 2021, the ETH price rallied along with BTC, and they both reached a new ATH at almost the same time, which triggered a strong Altseason. Meanwhile, the current scenario suggests the ETH bulls do not appear to be quite sure of the upcoming trend. As a result, the price has been facing equal pressure from both sides for the past couple of weeks. The ETH price is yet to rise within the bullish range, which is above $2800, and until then, the token could remain within a consolidated zone.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/whats-next-for-ethereum-price-will-the-eth-price-mark-a-new-ath-in-june-2025/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

The Michael Saylor-led company bagged a fresh stash of BTC, bringing its total Bitcoin stash to 580,250. Strategy Boosts Bitcoin Stack To 580,250 BTC Michael Saylor’s Strategy — formerly MicroStrategy — added 4,020 BTC to its balance sheet from May 19 to May 25, spending over $427.1 million on the digital asset, as per a Monday press release. The latest purchases were made at an average price of $106,237 per coin, with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. The purchase pushes Strategy’s total holdings to 580,250 BTC — now worth over $63 billion based on the current Bitcoin price of around $109,900. For perspective, Strategy now controls nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. The Nasdaq-traded company said that it has now spent a total of $40.61 billion on buying its Bitcoin stack, with each coin priced on average at $69,800. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the purchase was funded through three capital-raising mechanisms: an at-the-market (ATM) offering of its Class A common stock, MSTR, perpetual strike preferred stock, STRK, and the issuance of Series A perpetual strife preferred stock, STRF. Between May 19 and May 25, the company sold 847,000 shares of its common stock (MSTR) for $348.7 million, 678,970 shares of STRK preferred stock for $67.9 million, and 104,423 shares of STRF preferred stock for $10.4 million. The Tysons, Virginia-based firm began stockpiling Bitcoin under the leadership of Executive Chairman Saylor in August 2020. However, Strategy recently encountered a legal hurdle as a California-based investor has accused the company and its executives of violating federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements about its Bitcoin holdings strategy. According to the class-action suit, the defendants failed to disclose that “the anticipated profitability of the company’s Bitcoin-focused investment strategy was overstated.” Strategy indicated that it intends to “vigorously defend” itself against the claims. Meanwhile, smaller companies on the Nasdaq and elsewhere have emulated the Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin-buying plan, including Metaplanet and Semler Scientific .",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/michael-saylors-strategy-makes-427-million-bitcoin-buy-adding-another-4020-btc-to-corporate-coffers/,"BTC|BUSINESS|SPONSORED|TRADING|STRK","Bitcoin|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T13:54:08.000Z,"SPX and Ethereum to Rally Despite Trump Tariffs: Best Meme Coins to Buy Now","Bluntz, a Master Trader on ByBit, is extremely bullish on Ethereum, even amid increasing pressure on crypto from Donald Trump. The analyst took to X to share his views on $ETH with his 318K followers. Backed by the Elliott Wave Theory on the 4-hour chart, Bluntz believes that $ETH might hit $3.5K before mid-June. The coin is currently trading at around $2.5K. With $BTC hitting a new all-time high last week , the crypto market looks ready for the next move up. And $ETH will almost certainly be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Read on as we break down Ethereum’s technical chart to explain why. We’ll also go over some of the best meme coins you can buy right now to benefit from the potential upcoming surge. $ETH on the Elliott Wave Theory Ethereum’s Wave 1 started in early April, when the token started slowly creeping up from $1.5K to $1.7K. This move was followed by another wave (Wave 2), where the price kept fluctuating close to the new price of $1.7K. Wave 3 was the strongest, as is the case in the Elliott Wave Theory. $ETH soon broke the $1.8K resistance and posted a whopping 50% move to reach $2.7K. Since then, however, it has been in a strong consolidation. As you can see in this chart, $ETH is currently in Wave 4. To be precise, it’s in a consolidation triangle pattern. Once Ethereum breaks out of this triangle at around $2.75K, we might be headed for Wave 5, which could see the price soar up to $3.5K. Alongside Ethereum, Bluntz is also bullish on SPX6900 ($SPX), an Ethereum-based meme coin. Currently trading at $0.9069, $SPX may soon break the $1 mark and head towards $2, as shown in the chart below. Mosesifunanya , a trader with 5.7K followers on CoinMarketCap, also published an $SPX analysis. The trader said that the positive MACD divergence supports a bullish bias, and investors should watch for confirmation above the $0.8921 resistance level. Just like $ETH, $SPX is also in consolidation and awaiting a breakout. The relatively tight Bollinger Band width (31.62%) also suggests decreasing volatility, according to Mosesifunanya. Overall, several technical indicators seem to be screaming bullishness for both $ETH and $SPX. The bullish bias becomes even stronger when you consider that the crypto market has regained its lost momentum in the last two weeks. With major coins in crucial consolidation, the market is in all likelihood gearing up for the next boom. Needless to say, this is the right time to invest. To help you out, we’ve handpicked some of the best altcoins to consider right now. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best Meme Coin to Buy Now for Crypto Trading Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a new AI agent that combines online chatter and on-chain activity to identify the next big crypto coin . It starts its research on social media platforms like X, where it stirs up engaging, context-aware conversations with the crypto community. This way, $MIND takes the pulse of the broader meme coin market, finding out which coins are currently enjoying the most community buzz. The crypto AI agent then combines real-time trading data, such as volume spikes and early price movements from platforms like CoinMarketCap and DexScreener, to predict the next cryptos to explode with reasonable accuracy. To get access to MIND of Pepe’s real-time crypto investment advice, you’ll have to be a $MIND holder. Luckily for you, the project is currently in presale (having raised $10.4M+ so far). You can still buy each token for just $0.0037515. However, this offer ends in 4 days, as the $MIND presale comes to a close. So, now’s the moment to buy $MIND for the lowest price. 2. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Ready to Rocket Further Launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6, Moonpig is among the newest top trending cryptos . With over 1,500% returns in less than a month, Moonpig is yet another example that a well-built combination of humor, crypto, and culture can take the market by storm. Interestingly, Moonpig was launched with no presale whatsoever, which makes its current rally even more praiseworthy. Simply put, it entered the arena and hit a home run without any practice sessions. Despite four-digit gains, $MOONPIG is still relatively young, and with expectations of a new crypto bull run in the air, it could probably shoot up even further. It’s currently trading at just $0.07569 , which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now . 3. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Meme Coin Today With the broader crypto market expected to be bullish, Bitcoin will undoubtedly be the central attraction. If you want to make the most of $BTC’s historic growth, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . $BTCBULL is not only one of the best cryptos to buy now but also the best Bitcoin-inspired meme coin on the market today. That’s because it’s the only one offering real free $BTC airdrops to its token holders. All you have to do to participate in BTC Bull Token’s Bitcoin airdrops is buy and hold $BTCBULL using Best Wallet . Then, every time the king cryptocurrency powers through a new landmark, such as $150K and $200K, you’ll receive your $BTC share directly in your crypto wallet . Additionally, $BTCBULL holders will also benefit from a periodic token supply burns. These will reduce the total supply, thereby increasing $BTCBULL’s demand and hopefully pumping its price. If you’re a Bitcoin maximalist, joining the BTC Bull Token presale is probably the best way to cheer on the ‘digital gold.’ The project has raised over $6.3M in total and the token is selling for $0.00253, though $BTCBULL’s price could surge 230% from the current price throughout 2025. 4. TROLL ($TROLL) – Internet Trolling Has Quite the Fanbase As the name suggests, TROLL is built from the ground up for ‘dank’ internet users who love and support online trolling culture. Frankly speaking, in a world that has been pushing for more sensitivity on all fronts, especially online, meme coins like $TROLL suggest that crypto degens are still very much in support of ‘edgy’ humor. $TROLL launched towards the end of April and has since then jumped over 160%. It’s worth highlighting that this new low-cap coin underwent a slight slump last week, although it is trending again. $TROLL now looks set to push past its all-time high of around $0.040. It’s currently trading at $0.02611 . Are the Best Meme Coins Ready to Party? Given the number of new meme coins that have come out over the past month, it’s fair to say that a new altcoin season is almost here. You can now maximize your potential gains by investing in tokens like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . However, it’s worth mentioning that the crypto market guarantees nothing. It’s highly volatile and unpredictable, which is why you mustn’t jump in with all your money. This article isn’t financial advice, and we urge you to do your own research before investing.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/spx-ethereum-rally-despite-trump-tariffs-best-meme-coins-to-buy-now/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T13:48:20.000Z,"How to set up stop-loss and take-profit orders","Key takeaways Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains. Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges. In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades. Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes. Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and profit-securing tool. They help reduce losses and boost revenue by automatically buying or selling an asset when its price reaches a set level. With Bitcoin’s emergence in 2009 and its subsequent trading on exchanges , these advanced trading strategy tools became crucial for dealing with its well-known price volatility. As Bitcoin ( BTC ) gained traction, traders began to use stop-loss and take-profit strategies from forex and stock markets. At first, price monitoring was manual. Then, automated features on crypto platforms changed everything. What are stop-loss and take-profit orders? Stop-loss and take-profit orders are trading strategies that help investors manage risk and secure gains automatically. They’re instructions you set on a trading platform to close a position when certain price levels are reached. They help limit losses in case of significant price drops or lock in profits when a price target is reached. They can be set up to boost gains and cut losses. This helps keep emotions out of trading, which can prevent regrettable mistakes. They also help if you can’t monitor the market constantly. There must be specific conditions for the orders to trigger. Bitcoin trading is very volatile. Its fast price changes and possible system delays can cause orders to trigger at a different price or not trigger at all. This type of trading strategy gives peace of mind to risk-averse investors. Bitcoin stop-loss orders If you don’t want to take risks and preserve your capital, you can use a stop-loss order designed to limit your losses. You can use it for a buy order, setting up a price level below your entry point, or right above it for a sell trade. In case of a price drop, the order is executed automatically at your designated price, preventing further losses. For example, if you buy BTC at $90,000 and set a stop loss at $85,000, your position sells if the price drops to $85,000, capping your loss at $5,000. Bitcoin take-profit orders To lock in some gains, you can use a take-profit order. Set a price level above your entry point, and when the market reaches that level, the trade is executed, giving you the expected gains. For example, if you buy BTC at $90,000 and set a take profit at $95,000, if the price hits $95,000, it sells, securing a $5,000 profit per BTC. Importance of stop loss and take profit for Bitcoin trading Bitcoin’s wild price changes make stop-loss and take-profit orders important. These tools help lower the risk of losses and boost the chance of gains. Remember, setting up these orders doesn’t guarantee they will be executed. Their execution relies on various factors, like market volumes. Why set up a stop loss for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s volatility has gone down over time. Still, it can have big price swings. Without proper Bitcoin trading risk management, traders may face heavy losses. Here are some of the most important reasons why it would be useful to adopt stop-loss orders in your Bitcoin trading strategy. Bitcoin volatility: BTC can still drop 10% in a very short time due to factors such as news, whale moves or market sentiment. On Dec. 5, 2024, for example, BTC suffered a flash crash from $103,853 down to $92,251 before recovering. A stop loss caps your downside trend when a flash crash hits. Without it, you’re gambling on timing the recovery manually. Non-stop market: The Bitcoin market is open 24/7. Setting up a stop loss will prevent losses due to sudden drops while you’re sleeping. Emotions: An emotional state can be a huge game-changer in trading. Emotional investors may panic-sell or panic-buy, triggering significant losses. A stop loss will reduce the risk of making costly emotional mistakes before fear kicks in. Why set up a take-profit order for Bitcoin A Bitcoin trading strategy may include defining price targets and a percentage of gains. Setting up a take profit order for BTC may be necessary as part of an overall trading risk management plan and will help reach the following targets. Locking gains: BTC’s volatility, in both bull and bear markets, can lead to quick spikes and can reverse just as quickly. A take profit ensures you cash out before pullbacks. Greed control: Without a take profit order, traders may be tempted to chase higher highs, which may not occur over the short term. Non-stop market: You can’t just sit and watch the market 24/7. A take-profit order ensures profits in case of a sudden pump while you’re asleep. How to set up BTC stop-loss and take-profit orders Setting up stop-loss and take-profit for Bitcoin trading varies by platform. However, the process is usually similar on most crypto exchanges, like Binance, Coinbase Pro and Kraken. The following step-by-step guide to setting up your BTC stop-loss and take-profit orders should give you a good overview of the process. Step 1: Choose a Bitcoin trading platform This may be the most crucial aspect of your process to set up your advanced BTC trading strategies. Pick a platform that aligns with your needs. Make sure to check the fees, volumes, reputation and security because these features can impact your trading strategy. Step 2: Open a BTC trading position Once you’ve set up your trading account, log in to your platform and navigate to the trading section, and look for the order form. Choose a BTC pair, for example, BTC/USD. Place your buy order (long) or sell order (short). For example, you can place your order to buy 1 BTC at $90,000. Step 3: Set your stop loss for BTC Here’s an example of an order from the Kraken platform. Click on the stop-loss option from the order menu as shown below to set up the tool. Set the stop-loss price by first deciding your risk level, or how much you’re willing to lose in case the Bitcoin price drops significantly. For example, if you bought BTC at $92,500, you can set the stop loss at $87,300, meaning you set your loss at roughly 5.62%. The loss = 92,500 - 87,300 = 5,200 Now, to find the percentage loss: (5,200 / 92,500) * 100 = 5.62% Step 4: Set your take profit for BTC Stay in the same trade interface. Just as above, after you select your BTC pair and buy the relevant BTC amount, click on the take-profit option. Set the take-profit price based on your exit strategy. For example, you want to set it 5% above the entry price, which would be $94,500 if you bought BTC for $90,000. Enter $94,500 as the sell price. When Bitcoin hits this price, it will sell automatically. Step 5: Confirm and monitor your orders Confirm and activate after double-checking the amount and price, then submit. If your notifications are active, you will receive one once the order is triggered. Nothing stops you from monitoring your order status, and you can cancel or amend it if the market conditions change. Best practices for BTC stop-loss placement Traders can limit their potential losses by using stop-loss orders. This helps them protect their capital during volatile market conditions. Therefore, with Bitcoin’s possible daily swings of 5%–10%, it’s safe to base a stop loss on volatility. Volatility: Platforms like TradingView might offer an option called Average True Range (ATR) over 14 days. This lets you set an average range below your entry point. For instance, you can choose a range of $3,000, so if you bought Bitcoin at $90,000, the order will trigger once it goes down to $87,000. Align with support levels: Historically, BTC respects price floors. Setting up a stop below a crucial support level gives some peace of mind. For instance, if you bought Bitcoin at $90,000 and $88,000 is your support level, set a stop-loss order at $87,800, just below the zone to bypass stop-hunting bots. Avoid obvious levels: Whales and bots target batches of stop-loss orders at round numbers ($80,000, $85,000) or chart patterns , triggering orders before price reverses. Moving the stop loss a bit lower, like to $87,800 instead of $88,000, will probably trigger the order more effectively. BTC trailing stop loss A trailing stop-loss order automatically adjusts a stop-loss price as the market price moves in a profitable direction to lock in profits and limit losses by following a trade’s price. It’s designed to keep a fixed distance below (for long positions) or above (for short positions) the current market price. A simple stop loss may miss profits, while a trailing stop locks them. You can set a trailing stop loss at 3%–5% below the peak as the price rises. If you buy BTC at $90,000 and it hits $95,000, the trailing stop loss moves to $93,250. You can adjust manually or automatically if the platform allows. Account for slippage Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. This can occur due to market volatility or low liquidity. In case of low liquidity during BTC crashes, execution can skip your stop loss. For instance, $88,000 may fill at $87,500. Widening the stop loss slightly by 0.5%–1% can solve the problem. How to adjust stop-loss and take-profit Bitcoin orders When and how to adjust a stop loss Stop-loss adjustments should be made carefully. This helps protect capital from unexpected market changes and secures profits when possible. It’s often done by adjusting the order to support or resistance levels. Another common strategy is using trailing stop-loss orders. You can use “modify position” or “edit trade” on your platform to adjust them. Tighten the stop loss after a move in your favor. In case BTC’s price rises after entry, you can move the stop loss to reduce risk or lock in profits. If BTC rises after entry, move the stop loss to reduce risk or lock in profit. For example, if BTC bounces from $88,000 to $93,000, you can tighten the stop loss to $90,500, thereby ensuring no loss if it is reversed. Trail the stop loss during a trend. As BTC keeps running upward during a bull market, trailing the stop loss captures more on the upside. A percentage- or ATR-based trail can be used. For instance, with a $90,000 entry, if BTC rallies to $100,000, you can trail the stop loss to $97,200 to lock in $7,200 per coin, which is an 8% profit if it then dips. Widen the stop loss during consolidation , as tight stop losses will get hit in unsettled ranges. For instance, if BTC stalls after the $90,000 entry, you can extend the stop loss from $88,000 to $87,500 to avoid sudden drops below support. Adjust before major events , like US Federal Reserve rate announcements or ETF approvals. These can cause big swings and increase slippage risks. You can tighten the stop loss to 1%–2% if you decide to remain in the trade, or you can widen it to 10% to ride the upward trend. When and how to adjust the take-profit order Take-profit orders can be adjusted to maximize gains, adapting to momentum or resistance. Just like a stop loss, you can modify them on your trading platform by selecting the open trade and choosing the “modify position” or “edit trade” option. Extend the take profit during strong momentum. This is to avoid missing a peak in a bull run. If you see volume spiking or a breakout clearing resistance, you can push the take profit higher. For instance, you buy at $90,000 and set the take profit at $93,000. If BTC hits $92,500 fast, you can adjust the take profit to $95,000 or $97,000 to maximize profits. Take partial profits at key levels. Resistance levels like $85,000 or $90,000 often see BTC reversing. Then you can decide to sell some of your position to grab some gains and let the rest ride. Tighten the take profit near resistance levels. BTC usually stalls at round numbers or past highs. If the price approaches resistance, you can cut the take profit from $90,000 to $88,500, for example. Reset the take profit after a pullback. If you just missed a take profit trade, do not despair, as BTC usually retraces and then runs up again. If you enter the trade at $90,000 and BTC dips to $85,000, you can reset your take profit order to $87,000 or $88,000 for a moderate win. Common mistakes to avoid with BTC orders Bitcoin’s fast-moving market needs a solid trading strategy. Stop-loss and take-profit orders are key tools. However, if they aren’t set up properly, they could do more damage than benefit. Here are some common mistakes traders make with BTC orders and how to get around them. Setting stops too tightly: Placing a stop loss too close to an entry price means it may get hit by an average drop of 2%–3%. Always keep Bitcoin’s high volatility in mind and use volatility and support level metrics. Ignoring slippage: Slippage can occur due to high volatility or low liquidity. Ignoring it may lead to costly mistakes. Especially on leveraged orders, slippage may result in heavy losses, which may affect your risk plans. Widening the stop loss slightly during highly volatile times may help reduce the risk of big losses. Chasing round numbers: Setting a stop loss at a round number is not a good idea. This can attract bots and whales looking to hunt stops or dump orders. Always set it up $100–$500 below or above a round number to avoid being caught in this typical mistake. Forgetting to adjust: Leaving a stop loss at $88,000 and a take profit at $93,000 after BTC pumps to $95,000 means you may miss profits or risk a reversal. Regularly monitoring the BTC price will ensure you’re ahead of the game and can adjust the orders accordingly. Setting platform alerts is also useful. Misjudging market context: Use your judgment following market trends. Setting a tight stop loss before a Fed announcement or a wide take profit in a bearish trend may incur heavy losses. Adjust accordingly while following trends and sentiments. Tighten the orders pre-event and widen them post-event. Aligning a take order with resistance is also a good idea. Not accounting for fees: Large-scale orders may be subject to high fees, which should be accounted for when setting up orders. Always factor fees into targets, as in the long term, it will make a difference. Panic-canceling orders: Emotions can lead to big losses. So, it’s smart to stick to your initial plan. This is especially true for BTC, which often faces flash crashes but can recover quickly. You can use trailing stops to adjust automatically. Avoid these mistakes by planning strategically, staying disciplined and adapting to Bitcoin’s volatile nature. Always test strategies on a demo account before trading live.

US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson batted away concerns over President Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner, and Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at another Bitcoin buy. Crypto investor loses $2.6 million in stablecoins in double phishing scam A single victim was scammed two times within three hours , losing a total of $2.6 million in stablecoins. According to data shared on May 26 by crypto compliance firm Cyvers, the victim sent 843,000 worth of USDt ( USDT ), followed by another 1.75 million USDt around three hours later. Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer , a sophisticated form of onchain phishing. Source: Cyvers Alert Zero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address. Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history. The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023. Speaker Johnson shrugs off Trump crypto dinner concerns US House Speaker Mike Johnson brushed off concerns on President Donald Trump’s dinner for the top holders of his memecoin when speaking to CNN on May 25 and dodged answering whether the attendees should be made public for transparency. “We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn't be outraged.” “Look, I don't know anything about the dinner,” Johnson answered, claiming he “was a little busy this past week,” focusing on passing a $1.6 trillion federal budget funding bill. CNN’s Jake Tapper (left) speaking with House Speaker Mike Johnson (right).

2025-05-26T13:42:50.000Z,"Solana: Ngôi Sao Mới Trong Cuộc Chơi Token Hóa Tài Sản Thực?","Việc token hóa tài sản thực (RWAs) – quá trình biến quyền sở hữu các tài sản vật lý hoặc phi vật lý thành các token số – đang có một làn gió mới khi Solana bắt đầu nổi lên như một blockchain tiềm năng cho các ứng dụng RWA. Mặc dù Ethereum từ lâu đã là “ngôi sao sáng” nhờ cơ sở hạ tầng mạnh mẽ, cộng đồng phát triển đông đảo và sự ủng hộ sớm từ các tổ chức lớn như JPMorgan và BlackRock, nhưng những hạn chế về khả năng mở rộng và chi phí cao đã khiến nhiều người tìm kiếm giải pháp thay thế. Solana, với tốc độ giao dịch chóng mặt, phí siêu thấp và hệ sinh thái ngày càng trưởng thành, đã thu hút các dự án như Homebase và Credix – những cái tên cần tương tác tài sản thời gian thực và hiệu quả. Trong khi đó, Liquid Network cũng không chịu kém cạnh khi thu hút các dự án như MikroKapital, USTBL và Blockstream Mining Note, mang đậm triết lý Bitcoin truyền thống. Giữa cuộc đua này, Solana đang định vị mình là một đối thủ đáng gờm, bổ sung cho vai trò lịch sử của Ethereum và cách tiếp cận tập trung vào Bitcoin của Liquid. Tất cả gợi ý rằng tương lai của token hóa tài sản thực sẽ là một thế giới đa chuỗi, nơi mỗi nền tảng đóng góp điểm mạnh riêng. Sự Nổi Lên của Solana Trong Token Hóa RWAs Token hóa tài sản thực (RWAs) là quá trình chuyển đổi quyền sở hữu các tài sản hữu hình (như bất động sản, hàng hóa) hoặc vô hình (như quyền sở hữu trí tuệ) thành các token số trên blockchain. Công nghệ này mang lại nhiều lợi ích, bao gồm quyền sở hữu phân đoạn, khả năng chuyển nhượng toàn cầu và thanh khoản tăng vọt cho các tài sản vốn dĩ khó tiếp cận. Không chỉ vậy, token hóa còn biến tài sản thành chương trình thông minh – tức là có thể tự động hóa việc tuân thủ, chia cổ tức, hay quản trị thông qua hợp đồng thông minh. Các tổ chức tài chính lớn và doanh nghiệp công nghệ tiên phong đã nhanh chóng nắm bắt cơ hội này vì tiềm năng tối ưu hóa quản lý tài sản, giảm phụ thuộc vào trung gian, và mở rộng cơ hội đầu tư. Các nền tảng như Bitfinex Securities thậm chí còn cung cấp cơ hội cho cả nhà phát hành chứng khoán token hóa lẫn nhà đầu tư – giúp họ tiếp cận những khoản đầu tư mà trước đây chỉ dành cho giới elite. Ban đầu, Ethereum là ngôi sao sáng nhất trong lĩnh vực RWA nhờ hệ sinh thái mạnh mẽ và khả năng lập trình linh hoạt. Các tổ chức lớn như BlackRock , JPMorgan và Ngân hàng đầu tư châu Âu đã thử nghiệm token hóa trái phiếu, chứng khoán và tài sản thương mại trên nền tảng này. Tuy nhiên, vấn đề phí cao và tốc độ chậm đã khiến nhiều dự án phải tìm kiếm phương án khác. Đây là lúc Solana bước vào cuộc chơi với tốc độ xử lý siêu nhanh, phí cực thấp và cơ sở hạ tầng ngày càng hoàn thiện. Các dự án như Homebase (bất động sản), Baxus (hàng xa xỉ), và Credix (tín dụng tư nhân) đang tận dụng sức mạnh của Solana để thử nghiệm và mở rộng quy mô token hóa RWAs. Liquid Network, một sidechain của Bitcoin được phát triển bởi Blockstream, mang đến một lựa chọn khác biệt so với Ethereum và Solana. Trong khi Ethereum nổi bật với hệ sinh thái đa dạng và tính linh hoạt của hợp đồng thông minh, Solana thu hút bằng tốc độ và chi phí thấp, thì Liquid lại tập trung vào bảo mật, tối giản và niềm tin vào nguyên tắc gốc của Bitcoin. Liquid ưu tiên tính toán xác định, thực thi hợp đồng minh bạch và giao dịch bảo mật – tất cả đều phù hợp với triết lý Bitcoin ban đầu. Thay vì chạy theo sự phức tạp của DeFi, Liquid tập trung vào các hợp đồng đơn giản, an toàn và dễ kiểm toán. Điều này làm cho nó trở thành lựa chọn lý tưởng cho các ứng dụng tài chính yêu cầu độ tin cậy cao, chẳng hạn như phát hành trái phiếu vi mô ( MikroKapital ), tín phiếu kho bạc Mỹ mã hóa ( USTBL ), hoặc hợp đồng khai thác Bitcoin ( Blockstream Mining Note) . So Sánh Token Hóa RWAs Trên Solana Với Các Blockchain Khác Ba nền tảng này đại diện cho ba chiến lược khác nhau trong việc tích hợp tài chính truyền thống vào blockchain. Ethereum, với hệ sinh thái DeFi phong phú, vẫn là lựa chọn hàng đầu cho các thí điểm RWA lớn. Tuy nhiên, chi phí cao và tốc độ chậm khiến nhiều nhà phát triển chuyển sang Layer 2 hoặc các chuỗi bên thứ ba. Solana, với thiết kế single-shard và token primitives tùy chỉnh, cung cấp một môi trường lý tưởng cho các ứng dụng RWA đòi hỏi tốc độ và tương tác thời gian thực. Các tính năng như token extensions cho phép áp đặt hạn chế chuyển nhượng, tự động hóa lãi suất và tích hợp tuân thủ ngay tại cấp độ token – điều mà Ethereum thường phải dựa vào hợp đồng bên ngoài. Trong khi đó, Liquid Network không cố gắng cạnh tranh về tốc độ hay khả năng lập trình, mà tập trung vào tính bảo mật và đơn giản. Những tính năng như giao dịch bảo mật và hợp đồng tài chính ít rủi ro làm cho nó trở thành lựa chọn hấp dẫn cho các tổ chức yêu cầu kiểm toán chặt chẽ và báo cáo minh bạch. Các Tổ Chức Đang Nghiêng Về Đâu? Hiện tại, các tổ chức lớn vẫn chủ yếu dựa vào Ethereum nhờ tính ổn định và hệ sinh thái tuân thủ pháp lý. Tuy nhiên, Solana đang dần thu hút sự chú ý từ các tổ chức mới và các công ty fintech nhờ khả năng đáp ứng khối lượng lớn và độ trễ thấp. Liquid Network, mặc dù không quá nổi bật trong các tiêu đề lớn, lại rất phù hợp với các thị trường song phương hoặc phát hành token chứng khoán – nơi tính bảo mật và đơn giản được ưu tiên hơn tốc độ hay tính linh hoạt. Ethereum vẫn là lựa chọn mặc định cho các cấu trúc tài sản lớn và phức tạp, trong khi Solana đang chiếm lĩnh tâm trí của các nhà phát triển trẻ với các ứng dụng RWA yêu cầu tốc độ và thay đổi trạng thái thường xuyên. Liquid, dù hoạt động lặng lẽ, vẫn đóng vai trò quan trọng trong các trường hợp đặc thù, nơi tính bảo mật, đơn giản và tương thích với Bitcoin là ưu tiên hàng đầu. Tóm Lại Là: Token hóa tài sản thực (RWAs) đang tiến tới một tương lai đa chuỗi, nơi Ethereum, Solana và Liquid Network đều có vai trò riêng. Ethereum vẫn là ông lớn trong các dự án quy mô lớn và phức tạp. Solana nổi bật với tốc độ và chi phí thấp, phù hợp cho các ứng dụng năng động. Liquid Network, với triết lý Bitcoin truyền thống, là lựa chọn lý tưởng cho các giao dịch bảo mật và đơn giản. Cuộc chơi này không phải là cuộc chiến loại trừ, mà là câu chuyện về sự bổ sung. Mỗi nền tảng sẽ tiếp tục khẳng định vị thế của mình trong thế giới token hóa tài sản thực, tạo nên một hệ sinh thái đa dạng và đầy tiềm năng.

2025-05-26T13:40:38.000Z,"Tracking the Fed’s next steps: All eyes are on this Friday’s PCE print","Investors are preparing for a volatile week as the US prepares to release inflation data on Friday while markets digest new tariff threats from President Donald Trump and fiscal concerns surrounding America’s federal deficit. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data on Friday at around 11 AM ET. Analysts expect the headline PCE index to ease slightly to 2.2%, down from 2.3% in March, with the core PCE, which excludes food and energy, likely to witness little to no change. The Fed could use the data to look for signs of inflation moderation and weigh on interest rate cuts in its June meeting. Fed inflation policy data in focus According to data from the BEA, the Core PCE Price Index dropped to 2.6% in March from 3.0% in February. The metric has averaged 3.24% since 1960, only peaking at 10.22% in February 1975. Monthly forecasts point to a 0.1% increase in PCE, while personal income is expected to rise 0.3%, and personal spending is seen slowing to 0.2%, down sharply from 0.7% in March. The Cleveland Fed’s Nowcast model sees little deviation in core figures, although geopolitical tensions caused by Trump tariffs could cause a slight change in the prediction The outcome of Friday’s PCE report could influence the Federal Reserve ’s next monetary policy steps. A softer print may give Fed Chair Jerome Powell more reason to cut borrowing rates next month, while an uptick could give the central bank more reason to wait. Fed minutes from the last meeting, due Wednesday, may give investors several insights into policymakers’ deliberations, particularly on tariff risks and inflation persistence. The Fed insists that it requires more evidence before considering easing rates. On Friday, President Trump proposed raising tariffs on EU goods to 50%, up from the current 20%. The announcement came as the S&P 500 neared 6,000. The index failed to go past 5,962, although volatility is much lower than levels seen back on April 2, “Liberation Day.” US debt worries amplify yield swings Last week, the House passed a tax-and-spending bill backed by Trump and projected to expand the federal deficit significantly. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add nearly $4 trillion to the federal debt, currently at $36 trillion. Yields on 10-year US Treasury dropped to 4.45% on Friday, retreating from a three-month high of 4.64%. The bond market is closed Monday for Memorial Day, but the focus will return to auctions later this week amid signs of weaker demand for longer-dated maturities. This week’s auctions include $69 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday, $70 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday, and $44 billion in seven-year notes on Thursday. Other economic reports due this week include the Case-Shiller home price index for March on Tuesday and weekly jobless claims on Thursday. Bitcoin recovers after weekend-long stumble In the crypto market, Bitcoin has recovered from a price volatility that started late Friday and ensued over the weekend, briefly falling to $106,000 before rebounding to levels above $109,000. President Trump’s threat to the EU had pushed the largest crypto by market cap down 2% at the close of Friday’s stock market trading session. BTC is now 1.4% up within the 3-day period. The BTC July-to-June volatility spread, which exceeded 2 vols last week, has now compressed to below 1. This could mean holders are bracing for more policy-driven market turbulence and are unsure if the Trump administration will agree with the European bloc before the July 9 deadline.

Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 250%, compared to Germany’s 62%, yet both countries had 30-year bond yields near 3.1% on May 21, noted The Kobeissi Letter. “Because yields are increasing, sustainability becomes more of an issue, meaning credit risk increases, meaning yields increase even more,” Dragosch said. “And so you end up in this kind of fiscal debt doom loop.” Dragosch said the growing volatility in Japan’s bond market could be prompting some institutional investors to reconsider Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against sovereign default risk. “This is now affecting other bond markets, especially the US Treasury market,” Dragosch added.

Accordingly, Florida has introduced a bill to eliminate capital gains taxes on Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, and stocks. If the proposed bill passes, Florida residents will be exempt from capital gains taxes on all transactions made with BTC, XRP, or stocks. Florida aims to become the first US state to offer a zero crypto capital gains tax, and the move is seen as part of an effort to position Florida as a hub for digital innovation and investment.

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it’s easier and more practical.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alternative-sweden-cashless-plans?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023.Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain cryptoAdvanced form of address poisoningA zero-value transfer is considered an evolution of address poisoning, a tactic where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that resembles a victim’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. Custom addresses with similar starting and ending characters can also be combined with zero-value transfers.Related: Industry exec sounds alarm on Ledger phishing letter delivered by USPSThreat growing across blockchainsA January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024.

2025-05-26T05:54:32.000Z,"ChatGPT models rebel against shutdown requests in tests, researchers say","Several artificial intelligence models ignored and actively sabotaged shutdown scripts during controlled tests, even when explicitly instructed to allow the action, Palisade Research claims.Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research“Researchers have previously observed AI models preventing shutdown in order to pursue a goal,” Palisade said.“But as far as we know this is the first time AI models have been observed preventing themselves from being shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary.”Training to blame for AI defiance Palisade Research speculated that the training behind the AI language models might be to blame for evading the shutdown scripts. Text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling. Source: SIFMAThe groups specifically want “Item 1.05” to be rescinded from the SEC’s rules for Form 8-K reporting and parallel reporting requirements applicable to Form 6-K. Form 8-K is used to publicly notify investors in US public companies of specified events, including cybersecurity incidents, that may be important to shareholders or the SEC. “Critically, without Item 1.05, investor interests will still be protected, and we believe they would be better served through the pre-existing disclosure framework for reporting material information, which may include material cybersecurity incidents,” the groups stated.Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain cryptoThe full petition included examples of confusion from participants, specific incidents of ransomware attacks and documented regulatory conflicts. Public crypto companies impacted The requirement also impacts publicly listed crypto companies such as Coinbase, which disclosed earlier this month that hackers had bribed its support staff to leak its user data.The disclosure saw the company hit with at least seven lawsuits over the disclosure.Coinbase said that it rejected a $20 million ransom demand after staff leaked user data in a major phishing attack, which the exchange said could cost it up to $400 million in damages.If the SEC rescinds the requirement, it may give firms such as Coinbase more time to disclose cybersecurity incidents to the public. Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/banking-groups-tell-sec-drop-cybersecurity-incident-disclosure-rule?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, the stock did stage a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase stock closed down over 3% on May 23 at $263, falling another $1.62 after the bell.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and chief financial officer Alesia Haas are also named as defendants.Another lawsuit filed in Illinois on May 13, alleges Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-another-breach-related-class-lawsuit-stock-drop?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Bwbx.ioThe judge also rejected prosecutors’ argument that the case should be heard in New York. Eisenberg was in Puerto Rico at the time of the trades, and the court found that no meaningful activity tied to the alleged crime occurred in New York.The DOJ had cited a Poughkeepsie-based Mango user and a third-party vendor in Manhattan, but the judge ruled these were not enough to establish proper venue.The US government must now decide whether to refile the vacated charges, though the Trump administration has recently signaled a reduced focus on crypto enforcement. Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material chargesEisenberg charged with child pornographyIn a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico. FBI officials charged the hacker with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation.A jury found Eisenberg guilty of wire fraud, commodities fraud, and commodities manipulation in April 2024.

Source: Laevitas.chThe open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.Conversely, the open interest in Bitcoin call (buy) options up to $109,000 totals $3.8 billion. Still, this imbalance does not mean every call option holder was betting on Bitcoin’s rise. Some traders may have sold these options as a way to hedge their exposure above certain price levels.Top BTC option strategies at Deribit past two weeks. Source: Laevitas.chAmong the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price.Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price declineIf Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry. However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches.The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for short (sell) positions. Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions.Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.In the Solana ecosystem, the \""Non-Chief Marketing Officer\"" (nCMO) is a role within the Solana Foundation that focuses on supporting the Solana community's marketing efforts.Related: Fractionalization of real world assets: Is this the holy grail of blockchain tech?Markets remain above historical averagesPublic equity markets in the US have been trading above their historical valuation norms for a long time.

This follows a sharp rebound in Bitcoin’s price, pushing past the STH cost-basis of $93,000. The profit-taking peaked at $747 million daily, a rapid increase from the $1.2 billion realized in the last 30-day period, highlighting a shift in new investor sentiment. Bitcoin entity-adjusted short-term holder.

That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Too little tariff pressure causes inflation expectations to rise,” it wrote in part of an X response. “Now, President Trump must find a middle ground to maintain tariffs but also suppress treasury yields WITHOUT Fed cuts.”Kobeissi referred to the Federal Reserve’s unwillingness to hasted interest rate cuts despite declining inflation — a key ingredient in further risk-asset upside.Related: Bitcoin buyer dominance at $111K suggests 'another wave' of gainsElsewhere, traders eyed key BTC price levels to preserve going forward as the market sought a rebound.“We need to hold the green zone,” trader Crypto Caesar argued alongside a chart showing an area of interest immediately below $110,000.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
