2025-05-26T12:58:09.000Z,"Analyst Lists Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP Expectations for the Rest of 2025!","While Bitcoin continues to break new records, the long-awaited altcoin season has never started. While investors eagerly await the altcoin season, Wave Digital Assets CEO David Siemer shared his expectations. David Siemer, who participated in the Milk Road podcast, said that the bull run will continue for the rest of the year and that the bull will be dominated by Bitcoin. The analyst said that the rest of the year will be a market driven by institutional adoption and dominated by Bitcoin. “Right now, no institutions are buying anything other than Bitcoin. But Ethereum is also starting to get institutional interest.” Siemer, who also explained his expectations for altcoins other than Bitcoin, said that Ethereum, Solana and XRP are also good options. Ethereum Is a Solid Option! While Ethereum ranks first in the table as the largest altcoin, it does not rank first in terms of performance. In the face of the rise of faster, cheaper alternatives, Ethereum interest has shifted to layer-2 solutions like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. However, the analyst noted that Ethereum’s security and uptime remain unmatched, and said that Ethereum’s latest Pecrta update has removed the technical barriers to the rise. According to the analyst, ETH could gain new opportunities in terms of price performance. XRP Continues to Silently Rise! According to the analyst, XRP is supported by Ripple’s corporate partnerships and progress in regulatory clarity, especially following its legal victory against the SEC. This allows the analyst to remain optimistic for XRP. Stating that there are upcoming developments that could trigger a new rise in XRP, the analyst also expressed his confidence in the power of the XRP community. “The XRP community is real and consistent buying from the community will help XRP regain its previous all-time high of around $3.50.” Solana (SOL) Big Rival! Solana has seen new highs from the memecoin craze, but the analyst noted FTX-driven token launches as obstacles to SOL’s rise. Despite these challenges, the analyst said Solana remains the favorite with its sub-second transaction times and negligible fees. Barring any major technical disruptions, such as the occasional network outages it has experienced in the past, Solana could be a standout performer in 2025, the analyst added. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-26T12:53:38.000Z,"Bitcoin eyes $120k as bullish trend holds above key support","With the bullish trend still intact and support levels holding, Bitcoin could be preparing for an impulsive move to the $120,000 extension target. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has entered a new price zone and is showing strong signs that the uptrend is far from over. After hitting $111,800, price action has pulled back, but not in a way that invalidates the structure. In fact, the retracement appears healthy and technically sound, offering a potential setup for another leg higher. Key technical points Price has retraced into a key support level at $106,500, which aligns with two major moving averages and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Structure remains bullish, with a clear sequence of higher highs and higher lows from the $91,500 swing low. Fibonacci extension from the most recent impulse projects a target of $120,000, offering a technically sound next milestone. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Since establishing the $111,800 high, Bitcoin has pulled back into a zone that now acts as critical support. This region around $106,500 has held firm over recent sessions and is bolstered by the presence of the 0.618 Fibonacci level and a confluence of moving averages. These overlapping signals add strong validity to the idea that this is a natural higher low formation, not a breakdown. The bullish market structure remains intact. From the key swing low at $91,500, Bitcoin has consistently carved out higher lows and higher highs which represents signs of a strong trend. As long as $106,500 continues to hold, momentum remains with the bulls. The current pause in the market appears to be a consolidation within an uptrend rather than a reversal or topping pattern. You might also like: Bitcoin Pepe selling out: $11.2m raised, 5 days left until listing One of the most compelling targets now lies at the $120,000 level. This target isn’t arbitrary, it’s derived from a 1.618 Fibonacci extension drawn from the $91,500 low to the $111,800 high. It also serves as a psychological milestone for traders and investors alike. As momentum rebuilds, this becomes the most logical next stop for price, provided the support zone holds. What to expect in the coming price action If $106,500 continues to act as support, Bitcoin is likely forming its next higher low within the trend. This would set the stage for a fresh leg higher, with $120,000 as the next major technical and psychological target. Momentum favors the bulls, and a breakout could arrive as soon as this week.

2025-05-26T12:46:27.000Z,"Strategy buys 4,020 more Bitcoins for $427M, total holdings now at 580,250","Strategy, the Virginia-based firm known for pouring billions into Bitcoin and formerly MicroStrategy, confirmed Monday that it bought another 4,020 BTC last week, spending $427 million to do it. This pushes the firm’s total stash to 580,250 BTC, with an overall cost of $40.61 billion, according to a statement released today by the company. The new purchase happened between May 19 and May 25, and was fully funded through a combination of equity sales under three at-the-market (ATM) programs. The company said it acquired the latest Bitcoin batch at an average price of $106,237 per coin, factoring in all fees. The total amount of BTC held by Strategy now stands at 580,250, with the average entry price for all coins sitting at $69,979. The latest buy puts the company even further ahead as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. Strategy raised funds through three active share sale programs To raise the $427 million, Strategy sold shares through three different ATM setups. It sold 847,000 shares of Class A common stock ( MSTR ), bringing in $348.7 million under its $21 billion MSTR share sale program, which started May 1. After this round, the company still has about $18.63 billion worth of stock left to issue through that program. The firm also raised $67.9 million by selling 678,970 shares of its 8.00% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock (STRK). This STRK ATM program was launched on March 10, 2025, and has a total size of $21 billion, with about $20.72 billion still unused. In addition, Strategy used its brand new STRF ATM offering, established just days ago on May 22, to raise $10.4 million. This came from the sale of 104,423 shares of its 10.00% Series A perpetual strife preferred stock ( STRF ). The total size of the STRF program is $2.1 billion, leaving $2.09 billion still available for future fundraising. All proceeds were calculated net of sales commissions, and every dollar raised went directly into buying Bitcoin. Strategy did not use any debt or borrowings for this round. The announcement came as Bitcoin rose 2%, pushing back above $110,000, following news that Donald Trump extended the deadline on 50% tariffs targeting EU imports. The new decision moves the tariff date to July 9, giving traders and investors temporary breathing room. As a result, the crypto market responded with a rally. Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano each gained between 3% and 4%, while traditional markets also saw a lift. Strategy’s total investment in Bitcoin is now worth over $64 billion based on current prices, and the company also confirmed that the purchases were funded entirely from the MSTR, STRK, and STRF ATM programs.

2025-05-26T12:46:12.000Z,"Pakistan appoints special assistant to PM on blockchain and crypto","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif appointed Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib as his special assistant on blockchain and crypto. Saqib’s appointment takes effect immediately under Rule 4(6) of the Rules of Business, 1973. He has been granted the status of minister of state and will serve without salary or official benefits, according to a May 26 report in the English-language local news outlet, Pakistan Observer. The move follows a series of government initiatives aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s presence in the digital asset space. Just one day prior, Pakistan allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity exclusively for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers. In mid-May, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance also endorsed the creation of a dedicated body to regulate the country’s blockchain-based financial infrastructure. The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) will serve as a regulatory body to oversee licensing, regulate exchanges , custodians, wallets, tokenized platforms, stablecoins and decentralized finance applications. Related: Pakistan eyes crypto legal framework to boost foreign investment Saqib named special blockchain assistant Saqib is a graduate of the London School of Economics in the United Kingdom and received the title of Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire from King Charles III. He currently leads the Pakistan Crypto Council, where he appointed former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao as an adviser. He was also named in the Forbes 30 under 30 list. As a special assistant to the prime minister, Saqib will be tasked with drafting Financial Action Task Force (FATF)-compliant crypto regulations, launching state-backed Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining projects, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, land records and finance.

2025-05-26T12:45:55.000Z,"Floodgate About to Open for XRP As Ripple Replaces Bitcoin At Highest Level","In a striking signal that the tides in the crypto landscape may be shifting, prominent commentator The Real Remi Relief took to his X account to share his excitement over Ripple’s recent appearance on Fox News. Quoting a post highlighting Ripple’s coverage, The Real Remi Relief declared, “Flood Gates Are About To Open… No More BTC Logos. It’s All About RIPPLE XRP.” This bold statement has sparked fresh conversations across the crypto community, fueling speculation that XRP may be poised to eclipse Bitcoin (BTC) as the centerpiece of institutional and cross-border payment systems. Flood Gates Are About To Open…No More BTC Logos. It’s All About RIPPLE XRP https://t.co/Fm1SEsMqFh — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 25, 2025 Ripple’s Mainstream Spotlight Ripple’s feature on Fox News marks yet another milestone in the company’s steady climb toward mainstream financial recognition. As regulatory clarity around XRP continues to improve, Ripple has aggressively expanded its global partnerships. These include collaborations with banks, fintech companies, and payment service providers looking to leverage RippleNet and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border transactions. For years, Bitcoin has symbolized the face of cryptocurrency, largely due to its pioneering role and scarcity narrative. However, as real-world use cases take center stage, the crypto community is increasingly focusing on networks that offer scalability and utility rather than just store-of-value characteristics. Ripple’s technological backbone, combined with XRP’s design as a liquidity and bridge asset, positions it uniquely within this evolving landscape. XRP’s Supply Dynamics and Utility Potential An important point raised in the conversation comes from another X user, Bubbles, who offered thoughtful commentary on XRP’s potential. Bubbles noted, “The supply of BTC is relatively small, but the supply of XRP is large. If the practicality of XRP is truly promoted, then XRP will also become a bridge for cross-border payments .” This touches on one of the most misunderstood aspects of XRP: its large token supply. While Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million has fed the narrative of digital gold and scarcity-driven value, XRP’s 100 billion supply was designed intentionally for high-volume utility, not hoarding or speculative scarcity. Ripple’s business model leverages XRP as a bridge currency, enabling financial institutions to eliminate the need for pre-funded nostro-vostro accounts. This allows for near-instant settlement and significant cost savings, particularly in corridors where liquidity is limited or expensive. If this model reaches its full potential, the size of XRP’s supply becomes a feature, not a bug, enabling it to serve the massive scale of global payment flows. Market Sentiment and Institutional Interest The excitement expressed by The Real Remi Relief reflects a broader sentiment shift that has been building over the past year. Institutional players — once hesitant due to regulatory uncertainty — are now increasingly exploring Ripple’s technology and the advantages of XRP integration. From central banks investigating CBDC interoperability to remittance giants testing XRP for real-time settlement, the ecosystem is evolving beyond early-stage experiments into large-scale, production-grade implementations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin, while retaining its dominance as a store of value and inflation hedge, faces increasing criticism over its limited transaction throughput, high energy consumption, and lack of native smart contract functionality. In contrast, Ripple’s focus on utility, speed, and environmental sustainability resonates strongly with institutions and governments looking for practical blockchain solutions. A Watershed Moment on the Horizon? The notion that the “floodgates are about to open” for XRP signals a potential inflection point where Ripple’s efforts begin to translate into widespread adoption and market impact. While Bitcoin will likely maintain its symbolic and market capitalization leadership in the near term, Ripple’s push into institutional finance suggests a parallel — and arguably more immediately applicable — role for XRP in the financial system. As Ripple solidifies its presence on mainstream platforms like Fox Business News, the crypto conversation is increasingly shifting from speculative hype to real-world application. If The Real Remi Relief’s prediction holds true, and XRP ascends to the forefront of global payments infrastructure, the next chapter in the crypto revolution may be written not by digital gold, but by the digital rails of cross-border liquidity. In the months ahead, all eyes will be on Ripple’s continued partnerships, regulatory victories, and institutional integrations. Whether the floodgates are indeed open as predicted, one thing is clear: XRP’s role in shaping the future of finance is no longer a question of if but how big.

2025-05-26T12:45:18.000Z,"Here’s Bitcoin’s next target as BTC completes bullish cross","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has rebounded over the past 24 hours, nearing the $110,000 mark, and a trading expert’s analysis suggests the asset may be targeting new highs based on its technical setup. According to a May 25 TradingView post by prominent analyst TradingShot , BTC has been steadily climbing within a well-defined six-week channel up formation, signaling possible growth. Despite a brief pullback triggered by tariff-related macroeconomic concerns, the cryptocurrency has bounced back, potentially setting the stage for another bullish leg. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingView The recent retracement found support at the four-hour 50-period moving average ( MA ) and stayed within the channel. The four-hour 100-period MA also remained intact as a key support level, which TradingShot views as crucial for maintaining the uptrend. Bitcoin’s next high target A notable technical signal is the recent bullish MACD cross on the four-hour chart, a historically reliable buy indicator in this trend. Previous MACD crosses within this channel have preceded gains of 11.41% to 15.91%; each marking renewed buying momentum. Using the lowest historical return as a benchmark, an 11.41% increase from current levels would put Bitcoin’s next target around $119,000. This aligns with the channel’s upper boundary and supports TradingShot’s broader forecast that BTC could reach $200,000 between October and December 2025. Separately, analyst Gert van Lagen noted in a May 26 X post that Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows continued strength, well above bear market territory. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingView Historically, this timeframe often sees a bearish divergence, with the price making higher highs. In comparison, the RSI makes lower highs. This is followed by a hidden bullish divergence, with higher lows in price and lower lows in the relative strength index ( RSI ). Lagen pointed to 2022 as a rare exception when hidden bullish divergence failed due to price and RSI slipping into bear market territory. That’s not the case now: current price action remains strong, and RSI is comfortably above warning levels. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $109,735, up 2.3% in the past 24 hours and 1.4% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Solana’s memecoin daily trading volume has more than doubled since early April. A bullish V-shaped recovery pattern projects SOL price to rise toward $300. Solana’s native token, SOL, surged 86% between April 7 and May 26, following the broader altcoin market rally that saw Bitcoin hit new all-time highs above $111,000 . Since then, SOL has struggled to break above $180, but onchain and technical data still suggest further gains are in store for the altcoin. Can SOL follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps and hit all-time highs above $300? Solana’s TVL up 54% since April 7 The total value locked (TVL) on the Solana blockchain has increased by over 54% to $9.44 billion on May 26 from multimonth lows of $6.12 billion reached on April 7. It’s also up by almost 20% over the last 30 days. Solana TVL. Source: DefiLlama Data from DefiLlama highlighted that the subsequent increase in TVL was led by Raydium, with a whopping 52% increase in a month. Other major decentralized applications such as Jupiter DEX, Jito liquid staking, and Kamino Lending gained 12%, 25% and 11%, respectively. While Solana ranks the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, the Solana network is ahead of the other top layer-1 blockchains in terms of TVL, second only to Ethereum.

It is also larger than BNB Chain’s, which integrates seamlessly with Binance and Trust Wallet. Solana memecoin market cap gains 65% The rise in Solana’s TVL mirrors an increase in memecoin market capitalization as prices recovered across the board.

Memecoin trading volume on Solana. Source: Blockworks Research The increase in memecoin activity on Solana indicates high network activity and rising usage, positively impacting demand and SOL price. SOL’s “V” chart pattern targets all-time highs SOL’s price action has been painting a V-shaped pattern on the weekly chart since January, as shown below. A V-shaped recovery is a bullish pattern formed when an asset experiences a sharp price increase after a steep decline. It is completed when the price moves up to the resistance at the top of the V formation, also known as the neckline. SOL appears to be on a similar trajectory and now trades below a supply-demand zone between $180 and $200.

2025-05-26T12:43:16.000Z,"Google Gemini Predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for End of 2025","Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most closely watched assets in the cryptocurrency market, may see significant price appreciation by the end of 2025 under favorable market conditions. According to a recent Google AI Gemini forecast, SHIB would trade between $0.00005 and $0.00012 by the end of 2025 if a strong bullish scenario plays out. SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001451, reflecting a 1.97% increase from yesterday. Gemini’s prediction outlines the most probable bullish target as $0.00009, citing several factors that could drive demand and reduce supply. These include accelerated token burns, increased Shibarium adoption , broader market rallies, and speculative interest from retail traders and institutions. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Key Technical Targets The key price levels provided by Gemini align with previous historical benchmarks and speculative models. At $0.00005, SHIB would re-enter what Gemini describes as “hype-driven territory,” marking a critical psychological and market resistance level. This level represents a potential turning point where market sentiment and media attention could fuel upward movement. A more optimistic price point of $0.000088 would retest SHIB’s all-time high, set during the 2021 bull run. Achieving this would signal a full recovery and renewed interest in SHIB as a speculative asset. The Shiba Inu team recently expressed confidence in SHIB , and according to Gemini, a new all-time high would require multiple contributing factors, including a broader crypto market surge led by Bitcoin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential for a Blow-Off Top In an even more bullish outcome, Gemini anticipates that SHIB could reach a “blow-off top zone” between $0.00010 and $0.00012. This would represent a dramatic increase from current levels, eliminating one zero from the price and giving returns of over 8x to holders. Gemini notes that such a scenario would require massive Shibarium adoption, widespread token burns through utility-based mechanisms, and speculative momentum. Role of Token Burns and Utility The AI model also emphasizes the importance of sustainable tokenomics. “If Shibarium and community initiatives burn trillions of SHIB by late 2025,” the supply shock could produce a lasting impact on the token’s value. Unlike one-time burns, Gemini stresses that “burns tied to real use (gas fees, NFT sales, etc.) are more sustainable and bullish.” While the predicted range of $0.00005 to $0.00012 seems ambitious, the SHIB team is working hard to expand the ecosystem, and as adoption grows, the chances of reaching a new all-time high are rising.

The company sold 1.71 million MSTR shares and 621,555 STRK preferred shares , significantly boosting its liquidity. These funds were largely directed toward purchasing more bitcoin. During the same period, MicroStrategy acquired 7,390 BTC for approximately $764.9 million , at an average price of $103,498 per coin.

On May 16, a class action lawsuit was filed against MicroStrategy, its founder Michael Saylor, and executives Phong Le and Andrew Kang. The lawsuit claims the company misled investors about the profitability and risk of its bitcoin-focused strategy, especially in light of volatility and potential losses associated with accounting changes under new crypto asset standards (ASU 2023-08).

But now, something even bigger could be on the way. There are growing rumors that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $11.6 trillion in assets, might soon file for a spot XRP ETF. Now, many are wondering where could XRP’s price go if BlackRock files this week? Betting Odds Suggest Big Moves Ahead Traders on Polymarket, a popular blockchain-based prediction platform, are putting their money where their mouth is. They now believe there’s an 83% chance the SEC will approve an XRP ETF, up from just 68% a month ago. That kind of spike shows growing confidence in XRP’s future in the U.S. market. If BlackRock does apply, it could mark a major turning point for XRP. When it filed for a Bitcoin ETF, prices soared. The same happened with Ethereum. Now, if XRP becomes the next target, history could repeat itself. Why This Filing Could Be a Game-Changer There’s growing speculation that BlackRock might be quietly preparing to launch a spot XRP ETF. According to Vandell Aljarra, Co-founder of Black Swan Capital, BlackRock likely wants to move forward with an XRP ETF. However, the biggest challenge is still the ongoing regulatory issues. The main concern is the unresolved Ripple vs. SEC case, which questions whether XRP is a security. This legal uncertainty has made XRP a more risky asset compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which already have clearer regulatory status. XRP Price To Go If BlackRock Files for XRP ETF As of now, the XRP price is trading around $2.33 , reflecting a pump of 1.8% in the last 24 hours. If BlackRock does file for a spot XRP ETF, experts believe the price could quickly jump past $3, and possibly reach $4.60 or even higher in the coming months, especially if the ETF eventually gets approved.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/heres-where-xrp-price-will-be-if-blackrock-files-for-spot-etf-now/,"BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-26T12:29:14.000Z,"James Wynn goes long on PEPE after $2.2B bets on Bitcoin went south","Renowned crypto trader James Wynn is back in the spotlight after opening a 10x leveraged long position on PEPE via the Hyperliquid platform. Known for his aggressive trading style, Wynn’s pivot to PEPE — a speculative meme token — signals a calculated bet on renewed momentum in the altcoin space as sentiment improves across the broader crypto market. James Wynn’s bets on Bitcoin (BTC) ended in a loss Wynn, often dubbed a “memecoin maxi,” has a history of profitable trades, particularly in the memecoin sector. For instance, his 2023 PEPE trade turned a $7,000 investment into $25 million, cementing his reputation as a high-stakes trader with sharp market intuition. He is also currently betting on his own memecoin, Moonpig (MOONPIG), that has rallied almost 3000% in less than three weeks. However, Wynn’s aggressive trading style, often involving 10x or higher leverage, has sparked debates about the risks of such strategies, especially after his recent Bitcoin losses. Recently, Wynn opened a $1.26 billion long position on Hyperliquid , only to close it within 47 minutes at a $13.4 million loss as Bitcoin’s price dipped from $108,921 to $107,746, with Wynn narrowly avoiding liquidation, which could have happened if the price dropped to $105,179.. However, Wynn quickly pivoted to a bearish stance, opening a $1 billion short position on 9,402 BTC with a liquidation price of $149,100. Unfortunately, this bet backfired as Bitcoin held steady around $107,000, forcing Wynn to close the position within a day and incur a $15 million loss. Combined with the previous day’s loss, his total deficit over 24 hours reached a staggering $27,908,962.20, as illustrated in a chart showing his profit and loss over 21 hours. Wynn attributed his bearish Bitcoin outlook to weak trading volumes, an undersold chart, and macroeconomic pressures, including a 50% tariff announcement by Trump that added downward pressure on Bitcoin prices. He has, however, opened another 40x leveraged $75 million long position, which is currently running.

On May 26, 2025, he opened a $1 million long position with 10x leverage on Hyperliquid, comprising 1,388,696,014 KPEPE at an entry price of $0.014086. James Wynn 🐳 @JamesWynnReal · Follow I feel safe in $pepe 🐸 💚 nfa. dyor. 11:47 am · 26 May 2025 2.2K Reply Copy link Read 405 replies The position has already yielded an unrealised profit of $434,867.01, up from the unrealised profit of $130k that had been reported by Lookonchain in the morning . Moreover, PEPE’s price, currently at $0.014404, is eyeing a potential 20% jump to $0.000017, a level that previously acted as resistance last May. Technical analysis supports Wynn’s bullish outlook, as PEPE has rallied 90% this month after breaking out of a consolidation on May 8. Additionally, the memecoin is holding above the 20 EMA and 50 SMA, which have maintained a bullish crossover since mid-April, providing dynamic support. If PEPE surpasses $0.000017, analysts predict it could reach $0.000020 to $0.000021, marking a 40% gain from current levels. Notably, Wynn’s move aligns with his history of capitalising on memecoin momentum, having previously earned $4.8 million on Fartcoin and $6.8 million on Trump.

2025-05-26T12:22:31.000Z,"New MicroStrategy Bitcoin Acquisition Pushes Holdings Past 580K BTC Mark","The post New MicroStrategy Bitcoin Acquisition Pushes Holdings Past 580K BTC Mark appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MicroStrategy, now Strategy, is at it again. For the seventh week in a row, the company has expanded its already massive Bitcoin treasury, proving once again that its conviction runs deeper than most. What a bold power move! While most companies play it safe, MicroStrategy keeps doubling down – even when prices are near all-time highs. But why now? And how big is their bet really? Let’s unpack what just happened. Details of Strategy’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase In its latest acquisition, MicroStrategy scooped up 4,020 BTC for roughly $427.1 million , paying an average of $106,237 per coin . As of May 26, the firm holds a staggering 580,250 BTC , acquired for around $40.61 billion – at an average cost basis of $69,979 per Bitcoin . According to the company, it has achieved a BTC Yield of 16.8% year-to-date in 2025 , a metric that aims to capture performance beyond traditional profit figures. While critics debate the validity of such internal calculations, it’s hard to argue with results when you’re holding nearly half a million BTC. A Relentless Streak with ‘Strategy’ to Back It Up Just last week, MicroStrategy added 7,390 BTC to its holdings in a single move worth nearly $765 million. That brought its total stash at the time to 576,230 BTC, locking in an unrealized gain of $23.1 billion – a profit larger than the market cap of many Fortune 500 giants. The company’s co-founder, Michael Saylor , foreshadowed the buy on X, writing: “I only buy Bitcoin with money I can’t afford to lose.” This marks 7 straight weeks of accumulation – a pattern that speaks volumes about MicroStrategy’s outlook, especially in the face of market volatility. Analysts See a $10 Trillion Future Market analyst Jeff Walton isn’t holding back. Speaking to the Financial Times , he had previously claimed MicroStrategy could one day become “the most valuable publicly traded corporation in the world”, thanks to its Bitcoin arsenal. “Strategy holds more of the best assets, and the most pristine collateral, on the entire planet than any other company, by multiples,” Walton said. He also noted the firm’s ability to raise billions in under two months, a feat most public companies can only dream of. But All Eyes Are on the Lawsuit Yet beneath the headlines, not everything is bullish. MicroStrategy is currently facing a class action lawsuit in the Eastern District of Virginia. Filed by Pomerantz LLP, the case accuses the firm of misleading investors over the implications of new Bitcoin accounting rules under ASU 2023-08. The dispute is around a potential $5.91 billion fair-value loss that critics say wasn’t properly communicated. The complaint also alleges that metrics like “BTC Yield” and “BTC $ Gain” paint an overly optimistic picture not backed by GAAP accounting standards. The backlash has already hit. May 1 earnings confirmed investor concerns. Between record buys, soaring profits, and regulatory heat, the company sits at the intersection of innovation and risk. Will it pay off is a question only time can answer.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/new-microstrategy-bitcoin-acquisition-pushes-holdings-past-580k-btc-mark/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T12:21:30.000Z,"Where is Bitcoin Pepe headed as BTC climbs to $109K amid strong institutional inflow","The cryptocurrency market is recovering modestly during Asian hours on Monday, buoyed by easing geopolitical tensions after US President Donald Trump announced a delay in the planned 50% tariff on European Union goods. Trump stated on his Truth Social account that the implementation date has been pushed from June 1 to July 9, following a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who confirmed that negotiations would begin promptly. Bitcoin jumped back above the $109,000 mark, while the global crypto market cap was around $3.44 trillion. The surge was also supported by continued institutional inflows in crypto ETFs. Bitcoin remains the bedrock of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and a favored hedge against macroeconomic instability. Yet, its growing maturity, reduced volatility, and the influx of institutional capital have made it less attractive to investors chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities. In contrast, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are attracting interest from speculative traders willing to embrace elevated risk in exchange for the possibility of outsized returns. As broader market sentiment improves, these high-beta assets are increasingly poised to capture renewed inflows from investors seeking exposure to volatile, momentum-driven plays. BTC ETFs remain strong US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their highest weekly trading volume of 2025 last week, driven by Bitcoin’s price rally and renewed investor interest. According to SoSoValue data, $25 billion in value was traded across the funds, marking the most active week since late December 2024. Net inflows totaled $2.75 billion, the second-largest weekly inflow since the ETFs launched in early 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT fund continues to dominate. As of now, IBIT holds 3.3% of all BTC, with a net asset value exceeding $71 billion—more than three times the size of Fidelity’s FBTC, the next largest fund. Ethereum ETFs also saw improved inflows, reaching nearly $250 million last week—the highest since early February—even as trading volume dipped slightly. Bitcoin Pepe to list soon A renewed surge in Bitcoin is once again bolstering sentiment across the crypto market, historically a precursor to broader rallies. As capital flows back into digital assets, speculative corners of the market, particularly meme coins, are drawing increased investor interest. Bitcoin Pepe stands out as a key beneficiary of this shift. Positioned at the intersection of meme culture and blockchain utility, the project is the first meme-centric Layer 2 on the Bitcoin network. It aims to merge Bitcoin’s robust security with Solana-like scalability, setting itself apart from other meme tokens that typically lack technical depth. To build out its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has announced several strategic partnerships. These include Super Meme, which will facilitate secure meme coin launches via the PEP-20 standard; Catamoto, supporting BASE chain fair launches; and Plena Finance, which is for exploring the integration of BPEP into its mobile-first DeFi app. A collaboration with the GETE Network is also announced, potentially expanding Bitcoin Pepe’s footprint into cross-chain Web3 gaming. These moves reflect an effort to layer real-world utility on top of meme-driven appeal, a combination that could prove attractive in the current market environment. Investor response has been strong. The project’s presale has raised over $11 million to date, with BPEP tokens currently priced at $0.0377. The presale ends on May 31, 2025, with a centralized exchange listing expected shortly after — a development that could serve as a near-term price catalyst.

This breakout is a signal; retail investors are flooding in, looking for the next major winners as bullish momentum sweeps the charts. Among the top contenders riding this surge are Ethereum and Bitcoin Pepe . Now buoyed by its Pectra upgrade and institutional inflows, Ethereum is gaining massive traction. But the real wildcard is Bitcoin Pepe, a meme-powered layer 2 protocol on Bitcoin that blends Solana speed with BTC-grade security. With its listing on May 31st, over $11.3m in ICO funds, and rumors of CEX listings swirling, the experts at Invezz believe Bitcoin Pepe is the best crypto to buy now to absorb this incoming liquidity stampede. As FOMO grips the market, the best opportunities will remain early. Bitcoin Pepe, and Ethereum fit that profile perfectly. Bitcoin blasts past $110K: what this rally means for traders and altcoin Investors Bitcoin has officially entered uncharted territory, smashing through the $111,000 barrier for the first time. After forming a base around $104,200 and clearing resistance at $106,000 and $107,500, bulls piled in with heavy momentum, driving BTC to a new all-time high of $111,814. The move, backed by rising trading volume, marks a key psychological milestone and reflects the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term dominance. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is consolidating just above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from its latest swing low of $104,270 to the peak. This suggests that even after such a sharp climb, bulls are still in control and profit-taking has not disrupted the broader trend. Renowned analyst Ali (@ali_charts) has laid out a new price roadmap, identifying the following resistance levels at $116,000, $126,000, $136,000, and $148,000. These targets are based on historic breakout patterns and Fibonacci-based technical projections. #Bitcoin $BTC is trading at new all-time highs, entering price discovery.

Altcoin traders now look to tokens like Ethereum, Solana, and meme-fueled plays like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) to mirror BTC’s strength. Bitcoin Pepe: the meme-fueled revolution giving Bitcoin its Solana moment Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is rewriting what’s possible on the Bitcoin blockchain. As the first-ever meme coin ICO built specifically for BTC, it introduces the powerful PEP-20 token standard—a game-changing protocol that simplifies token creation directly on Bitcoin. Just as ERC-20 sparked a wave of innovation on Ethereum, Bitcoin Pepe is poised to do the same by reducing the barrier to entry and opening the floodgates for meme coin developers. Time to stop sleeping on $BPEP as you're going to regret it later Seen they've got some major partnerships lined up too. Heard the tier 1's are after this one… I'd stack now while you can. https://t.co/T3kuv2iX4G — Zenia (@Zenia_sol) May 14, 2025 Its goal is bold but clear: unlock Bitcoin’s $2 trillion of idle capital and funnel it into a high-speed, low-fee meme trading layer that mirrors the Solana experience while preserving Bitcoin’s ironclad security. Market analysts are already referring to it as “Solana on Bitcoin,” for good reason. Moreover, CoinJournal has continuously referred to Bitcoin Pepe as the best crypto to buy now for smart investors. Bitcoin Pepe’s partnerships span gaming, DeFi, and fair launch platforms. They integrate BPEP and PEP-20 tokens into ecosystems like Super Meme, Catamoto, Plena, GETE, Crypto Hunters, BETV, GemuPlay, and Heroes Battle Arena. These collaborations boost utility, cross-chain adoption, gaming rewards, and retail visibility ahead of its highly anticipated May 31 listing event. With a May 31 listing date confirmed and the presale entering its final stretch, momentum is snowballing. BPEP is now priced at $0.0359; the next price hike is imminent. This is your final shot at early entry—buy now with ETH, USDT, or USDC before the price vaults higher. Ethereum eyes a breakout as technical signals strengthen Ethereum shows solid technical strength as it trades at $2,639.04, posting a 5.80% daily gain per CoinMarketCap .

Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoption Africa’s Web3 talents are poised for global impact Due to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services. This creates opportunities for Web3 projects like Jambo and Yellow Card to offer alternatives for saving and earning. Related: South African firm chooses Bitcoin reserve strategy as inflation hedge Kamal highlighted Africa’s strength in its “young population with ambitious tech talents”. He cited Hedera’s partnership with Orange, a telecommunications operator, to launch digital empowerment programs across 16 African countries — initiatives that “include training, certification and the establishment of incubation and accelerator centers”. “Africa brings a unique advantage to Web3: a demographic edge and a proven capacity for digital adoption,” said Paolo Tasca, executive chairman of the Exponential Science Foundation. “Yet barriers remain, particularly in foundational infrastructure and education.” Governments are also ramping up talent development. Nigeria, for example, recently launched an annual initiative to train 1,000 citizens in artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies.

2025-05-26T12:05:21.000Z,"Binance CEO Richard Teng’s Top 3 Crypto Rules for Long-Term Investment Success","The post Binance CEO Richard Teng’s Top 3 Crypto Rules for Long-Term Investment Success appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto’s noise level is always high. But now, it seems like the crypto market is steadying itself after months of turbulence. As the new phase begins, Binance CEO Richard Teng has surfaced with a message which is a powerful signal. It’s about where real value comes from and who’s going to win in the long game. These are insights you won’t want to miss. Read on! “Time Rewards Conviction” Teng posted a short, sharp thread on X that speaks volumes. Compounding isn’t just for traditional finance. In crypto: · Long-term vision > short-term hype · Community value compounds over time · Small, early investments can grow exponentially Stay focused. Time rewards conviction. – NFA pic.twitter.com/bWpLPGoNLl — Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) May 26, 2025 Indeed, compounding is not just a concept for traditional finance. Teng boiled it down to three clear principles showing where he thinks crypto’s next phase will take shape – not in quick hype, but in solid, lasting foundations. Any long-term investor would agree. Teng’s Key Crypto Insights Teng’s message breaks down into three simple but powerful ideas. Long-term vision beats short-term hype. In crypto, the temptation to chase the latest pump or flashy project is constant. But Teng reminds us that lasting success isn’t about jumping on trends but about having a clear vision and sticking with it through the noise. Community value compounds over time. This goes beyond just the price of tokens. Real value builds as a network grows stronger – through active users, developers, and supporters who believe in the project’s mission. That collective momentum creates a foundation that doesn’t fade easily. Small, early investments can grow exponentially. The early believers often see the biggest returns, not just financially, but in influence and opportunity. Teng points out that patience and conviction in the right assets, even if modest at first, can multiply significantly over time. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Adam Back Leads $2.2M Bitcoin Treasury Round for Swedish Firm H100 Group , The Market’s Growing Up This is a timely observation. Traditional markets are under pressure. Bond yields are rising. Trust in legacy financial “safe zones” is cracking. And while the headlines scream volatility, Bitcoin is calmly holding above $105,000 – behaving more and more like the economic hedge people need. The Power of Staying Put: Are You Playing the Long Game? Compounding, in Teng’s view, is less about price and more about patience. It’s about staying focused while others chase exits. It’s about recognizing that network strength and user belief accumulate over time. Those will be the investors that will win the game! .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-26T12:00:00.000Z,"100X Crypto Alert: XRP News Today Overshadowed by Bitcoin Solaris’s Breakthrough Wealth Technology","In today’s volatile crypto landscape, XRP news usually dominates headlines with its institutional partnerships and legal drama. But this time, it’s not Ripple making waves. A new blockchain contender, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), is stealing the spotlight—and it’s not just hype. With a revolutionary architecture, verified audits, and realistic wealth-building potential, analysts say BTC-S could be the next 100x crypto before the next bull market fully ignites. XRP’s Strengths—and Its Ceilings There’s no denying that XRP has cemented itself as a staple in the crypto ecosystem. Designed for rapid cross-border payments, XRP’s 3–5 second transaction time and minimal fees have made it a favorite among fintech partners. However, XRP’s growth potential may be stalling. With a high market cap, limited smart contract flexibility, and regulatory uncertainty, many investors feel XRP’s biggest gains are behind it. And with the rise of next-generation blockchains, it’s clear the spotlight is shifting. Bitcoin Solaris: The Wealth Technology of Tomorrow Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is quickly rising as a high-performance, energy-efficient blockchain that offers real utility, real scalability, and real upside. Unlike XRP’s single-use case, Bitcoin Solaris is built for more: 10,000+ transactions per second 2-second transaction finality 99.95% less energy usage than traditional mining A dual-consensus model using Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Full smart contract support and DeFi compatibility Mining optimized for smartphones, laptops, and rigs Importantly, the Solaris Nova app is still in development, so users should not expect to download or mine just yet, but the groundwork has already turned heads across the industry. Audited, Verified, and Investor-Ready Where many new projects overpromise and underdeliver, Bitcoin Solaris has already passed two professional audits. Leading blockchain firms Cyberscope and Freshcoins have reviewed their smart contracts. In addition, the project is KYC-verified via Freshcoins , offering early investors a higher degree of trust. Phase 5: Your Final Window Before the Launch Price Surge Bitcoin Solaris is now in Phase 5 of its fast-moving presale. Here’s what that looks like: Current Price: $5 Next Phase: $6 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 11% extra BTC-S for Phase 5 participants This is it—your shot at the next 50x! Grab BTC-S now before Phase 5 disappears! The presale ends July 31, 2025, making it one of the most focused and aggressive funding cycles in recent crypto history. So far, 8,900+ users have already joined, and $1.2M+ has been raised. With a projected return of 1,900%, this isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a serious wealth-building opportunity. Crypto Influencers Are Watching Closely Bitcoin Solaris hasn’t just attracted analysts—it’s lighting up the screens of top influencers. Crypto Legends described the project as “The next evolution of Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Crypto Volt described it as: “The instant profit coin.” These reviews reflect growing sentiment that Bitcoin Solaris is built for longevity, not just speculation. Built for the Next Era of Crypto Unlike many projects, Bitcoin Solaris is focused on decentralization, accessibility, and financial inclusion: Total Supply: 21 million (mirroring Bitcoin’s scarcity) Dual-Layer Architecture: Security via the Base Layer (PoW) and scalability via the Solaris Layer (DPoS) Smart Contracts: Fully programmable for dApps and DeFi Optional Privacy: Zero-knowledge proof support And thanks to its launch on the Solana network, BTC-S offers immediate utility and liquidity. Once the native Bitcoin Solaris blockchain goes live, 1:1 redemptions will begin. Conclusion: Bitcoin Solaris Isn’t Just the Next XRP—It Might Be the Next 100X XRP may still serve its purpose in payments, but when it comes to long-term wealth and adoption-ready infrastructure, Bitcoin Solaris is clearly the one leading the new charge. With a tightly managed presale, smart consensus architecture, strong audits, and rapidly growing community support, BTC-S is quickly becoming the breakout coin of 2025.

Strong ETF inflows, surging spot market participation, and positive net realised cap growth have contributed to structural buying in the market, rather than speculative excess. Even as macro risk aversion has returned, with news of possible 50 percent US tariffs on European imports, Bitcoin has held firm—unwinding excess leverage and absorbing profit-taking without a significant breakdown. With such strong gains, profit taking becomes an increasing possibility at these levels . This resilience is drawing attention to Bitcoin’s evolving role as a macro-sensitive, conviction-driven asset that now trades more in line with global liquidity flows than retail sentiment. Notably, Metaplanet’s $104 million accumulation of Bitcoin, and Michigan’s proposed crypto-friendly legislation further validate the narrative of growing institutional and policy-level support for digital assets. Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s ability to continue to consolidate above its short-term holder cost basis around $95,000 remains key. With over $11.4 billion in short-term holder profits realised in the past month, near-term supply overhang is expected—but so is structural demand. ETF bid strength, low volatility, and spot premium all suggest a maturing market poised for eventual continuation once macro clarity improves. The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoin’s latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3. In the meantime, the US faces growing financial strain as long-term Treasury yields surge and the dollar weakens amid credit downgrades, rising debt , and looming tariffs. Investor confidence is shaken, with yields on 10-year and 30-year bonds surpassing 4.5 and 5 percent , reflecting scepticism over fiscal discipline and inflation risks. The steepening 30Y/10Y yield curve , typically a growth signal, now reflects fears over long-term risk—not optimism. With foreign demand weakening and Fed support of the bond market fading, markets are pricing in a new era of higher rates and volatility . The bond market is no longer reacting to headlines—it’s warning of a structural shift in how risk is priced. Last week, both institutional adoption and regulatory momentum advanced on multiple fronts. Publicly listed firms Strategy, Metaplanet, and Semler Scientific collectively acquired over 8,800 BTC , reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a strategic treasury asset. Strategy now holds more than 2.7 percent of Bitcoin’s total supply, highlighting a growing trend among corporations to treat BTC as a long-term reserve in times of economic uncertainty.On the adoption front, FIFA announced it is building its own blockchain on Avalanche, shifting from previous partners Algorand and Polygon. The new EVM-compatible network will make it easier for developers and fans to access digital collectibles, positioning FIFA to scale its Web3 ambitions.

2025-05-26T11:51:33.000Z,"Crypto Investor Arrested in Manhattan for Kidnapping and Torture Over Bitcoin","The post Crypto Investor Arrested in Manhattan for Kidnapping and Torture Over Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A shocking kidnapping case took place in Manhattan, where a man was held hostage. As reported by Associated Press , in an attempt to get access to his Bitcoin wallet, the victim was beaten and forced to hand over the password. The victim was abducted on May 6, but his name has not been made public. The 28-year-old Italian national was tricked into coming to the home with the promise of recovering Bitcoin he was forced to send to Woeltz. The kidnapper was 37-year-old John Woeltz, a crypto investor. He was arrested after the victim escaped from the eight-bedroom townhouse and got help from a passing traffic officer. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. John Woeltz Faces Multiple Charges Woeltz was presented on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court after his arrest on Friday. He was charged with kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment, and illegal possession of a gun. He rented the Soho apartment for $30,000 a month, where the victim was held. Woeltz reportedly owns a 150-acre property in Kentucky and is said to be worth $100 million, though it’s not clear how he made his fortune. Sources say he worked in blockchain security and may have been involved in a crypto-focused hedge fund. The court decided that he will stay in custody without bail. It’s not clear whether the kidnapper and victim knew each other. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SlowMist Breaks Down How a Tiny Code Flaw Led to Cetus’ $230M Collapse , Victim Drugged, Tortured For Weeks The kidnapping was part of a larger plan involving others, including a man who has not been caught yet. The victim was tied up, tortured, drugged, shocked with electric wires, and even hit in the head with a gun. At one point, the kidnappers threatened to kill him by hanging him over a stairwell if he didn’t give up his password. The police found evidence of cocaine, a saw, chicken wire, body armor, night vision goggles, ammunition, and Polaroid photos showing the victim with a gun to his head in the townhouse. Woeltz was asked to hand over his passport since he could escape. He is set to appear in court again next week. Violent Assaults On Rise In another case, New York prosecutors charged two guys, Michael Lauchlan and Gary Zaydman, for running a scam with their crypto recovery business, Coin Dispute Network. They were accused of stealing from customers by using fake ads and using actors to pose as happy clients. These kinds of incidents reveal the growing trend of violent assaults, where victims are forced to hand over their passwords. Security experts say that crypto-related attacks are on the rise in 2025. Over 26 cases were traced this year, from kidnappings to home invasions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-26T11:45:12.000Z,"Secretive Hedge Fund Run by Ex-JPMorgan Chase Trader Bringing In 51% Average Returns: Report","An ex-JPMorgan analyst has reportedly set up a mysterious hedge fund in Taiwan that has so far recorded massive return rates. Former JPM Asset Management analyst Andre Liu has quietly created a proprietary trading firm powerhouse in Taipei that has far outshone the rest of the industry, reports Bloomberg . According to the firm’s internal documents seen by Bloomberg, UC Capital has recorded an internal rate of return of 51% since it was launched in 2021. A report from research and insights firm PivotalPath found that in 2024, hedge funds scored an average return of 10.7%. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that hedge fund giant Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund saw a 15.1% return that year while Millennium Management saw 15%. Bridgewater Associates, which is widely regarded as the largest hedge fund in the world, posted 11% in gains for its flagship Pure Alpha 18% volatility fund. Bloomberg’s data also shows that UC Capital has routinely beaten the local market in Taiwan (TAIEX), even recording significant gains in 2022 despite the Taiwan stock market index ending the year in the negative. Source: Bloomberg UC Capital turned heads in Q4 of last year when it successfully purchased the ball that baseball star Shohei Ohtani hit his 50th home run on the same season he also stole 50 bases – a legendary feat in the MLB. According to Bloomberg, Liu started UC with a colleague in 2013, and by 2021, the firm’s assets exploded 27,000% before the trader decided to start his own company. Says Liu, “Ever since I was a kid, I believed that the heart of trading lies in the changes in moods and sentiment.” Consequently, UC’s engineers have built a model to measure public discourse by scraping and analyzing social media, online forums, news articles and comment sections, in what the firm describes as “sentiment thermometers” to track certain trending topics and behavior. Leveraging its sentiment-driven approach, UC capitalized on a decline in TSMC’s share price earlier this year after its models detected a surge in public discourse involving President Trump and the company’s future. At the time, the chipmaker announced a $100 billion investment in its US plants. UC also reportedly bought an earthquake detector on the eastern coast of Taiwan so that the firm would know about earthquakes before anyone else could in order to short markets in case of uncertainty. The trading firm currently has about $497 million in liquid assets before leverage.

2025-05-26T11:43:09.000Z,"Huge $3 Billion Purchase in Bitcoin and Ethereum, Surprise Sale Came from This Altcoin! \""Major Sale Happened After 80 Weeks!\""","Bitcoin (BTC) broke new records last week, rising above $111,000. While the new ATH in BTC also brought a rise to Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins, Coinshares released its weekly cryptocurrency report and said that there was an inflow of $3.3 billion last week. “Inflows into cryptocurrency investment products reached $3.3 billion last week. Since the beginning of this year, inflows have reached a record $10.8 billion.” Bitcoin (BTC) Takes the Lead! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of inflows were in Bitcoin. While BTC experienced an inflow of $2.97 billion, the positive sentiment continued in Ethereum, with an inflow of $326.2 million. When we look at other altcoins, SUI experienced an inflow of $2.9 million, Solana (SOL) experienced an inflow of $4.3 million, while XRP experienced an outflow of $37.2 million. “Bitcoin took the lead with inflows of $2.9 billion, accounting for a quarter of total inflows in 2024. Ethereum saw inflows of $326 million, the most in 15 weeks, and gained for the fifth week in a row as sentiment continued to improve. XRP’s remarkable 80-week run of inflows has ended with the largest outflow on record, worth $37.2 million.” When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, the USA ranked first with an inflow of 3.22 billion dollars. After the USA, Germany had an inflow of $41.5 million and Hong Kong had an inflow of $33.3 million. Against these inflows, Switzerland experienced an outflow of $16.6 million and Sweden $12.1 million. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-26T11:42:18.000Z,"Demand for Bitcoin Outstrips Supply and the Bonds Market Crumbles. Altcoins Like BTC Bull Token to Rally?","As demand for Bitcoin outstrips supply, and confidence in bonds is in steep decline, Bitcoin and related coins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) go from strength to strength. According to the US Debt Clock , the US is looking at a national burden of over $36.8T, which translates to $107,745 per citizen in 2025. This, while US consumer confidence is at a 13-year low, falling by 7.9 points in April 2025, based on a report by The Conference Board. According to Stephanie Guichard, Senior Economist at The Conference Board: ‘High financial market volatility in April pushed consumers’ views about the stock market deeper into negative territory, with 48.5% expecting stock prices to decline over the next 12 months.’ Making matters worse, overseas investors have started to flee the chaotic US markets and seek refuge in Japan’s equities and long-term bonds. The migration translated to over $56.6B changing markets in April alone. . The result? Stock market low, bond yields high, Bitcoin price even higher. Why an Apocalyptic Bond Landscape is Good News for Bitcoin Bitcoin is pushing to $110K at the time of writing, marking a clear shift in the financial paradigm. Rising US bond yields, stalling global growth, and concerns about financial instability and inflation are leading many investors to pivot to crypto and Bitcoin as a hedge. Indeed, Bitcoin is known to thrive in rough financial waters, and today, this is buoyed by institutional investors racing to stack $BTC at an unprecedented rate. Based on the latest data , global companies and ETFs now control more than 15% of the total supply of Bitcoin, or 3.23M tokens. Of these, Michael Saylor’s Strategy dominates the news with its frequent Bitcoin buys. Today, Strategy owns 576,230 $BTC, worth roughly $63B at the current price. But it’s not alone. A quick peek at CoinGecko’s chart shows a growing leaderboard with 34 major public companies all engaged in a FOMO-driven Bitcoin race. Strategy Creates a Supply Problem The situation is so surreal that Strategy’s Bitcoin stacking alone supersedes the total global mining output by a rate of almost 4:1. In other words, Saylor’s demand of 2,000 bitcoins per day is outstripping the 450 bitcoins per day supply coming from BTC miners. SYZ Capital’s Managing Partner, Richard Byworth, called this the ‘ Bitcoin supply problem ,’ suggesting that Bitcoin is essentially facing a bottleneck, with the demand outpacing the supply by a great margin. In the long term, this could cause Bitcoin to be sold out of circulation, creating a climate where it would be very easy to sell Bitcoin but very difficult to buy. UXTO’s Guillaume Girard reiterates this problem in his ‘Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,’ stating that: ‘We’re entering a new era of Bitcoin adoption—one that is not driven by hype cycles, but by balance sheet fundamentals, sovereign strategy, and long-term fiduciary mandates. More than $400 billion in institutional capital will flow into Bitcoin by the end of 2026.’ As Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a safe haven or strategic asset, some of the best altcoins will surely follow closely. One contender is BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL), a top new meme coin that’s strapping itself to Bitcoin for the long haul. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Investors Get Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) attracts investors with free $BTC airdrops and $BTCBULL rewards as Bitcoin reaches key price points ($150K, $200K, $250K) for the first time. It’s earned a reputation as one of the best presales today thanks to its FOMO-driven ecosystem, promise of generous rewards, and close association with Bitcoin. The project is based on the idea that Bitcoin is unstoppable and will reach and even surpass the $1M price evaluation. Based on that, the team is using Bitcoin’s reputation and potential as a launching pad for $BTCBULL, hoping to rally both Bitcoin maximalists and meme coin mavens around the project. $BTCBULL is an unapologetic meme coin that’s managed to accumulate over $6,3M in its presale since its start on February 10, 2025. The token price currently stands at $0.00253, a low presale price that looks set to see exponential growth post-launch. Our analysts predict $BTCBULL to reach $0.0497 by the end of 2030, an ROI of 1,864% if you invest now. The token looks just as juicy short-term, with a projected ROI of 155% by the end of 2025 if the price hits the expected $0.006467. If you’re curious to learn more, check out our ‘how to buy $BTCBULL’ guide for more details and to simplify the purchasing process. Just note that you need to hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet to qualify for the upcoming $BTC airdrops. Is Bitcoin’s Real Bull Run Just Starting? When considering the state of the traditional markets, it’s no wonder investors are migrating to Bitcoin and crypto in general. Bitcoin’s biggest bull run lies ahead, while a meme coin like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) can multiply your BTC gains and help you ride the next run all the way to the bank.

2025-05-26T11:40:52.000Z,"Florida to Eliminate Capital Gains Tax on Bitcoin, XRP, and Stocks","The post Florida to Eliminate Capital Gains Tax on Bitcoin, XRP, and Stocks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Florida has introduced a groundbreaking bill that could change how Bitcoin, XRP, and stocks are taxed—at least at the state level. If passed, this legislation would exempt state capital gains tax on crypto and traditional stock profits, setting a powerful precedent in the U.S. and potentially driving crypto adoption nationwide. Just in: Florida unveils bill to scrap capital gains taxes on #Bitcoin . #CoinPedia #CryptoNews #Blockchain #CryptoMarket — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) May 26, 2025 What’s in Florida’s New Crypto Tax Proposal The bill, championed by Florida’s Republican leadership under Governor Ron DeSantis, aims to eliminate capital gains tax on Bitcoin, XRP, and stocks at the state level. This would allow investors to retain more of their profits, giving Florida a major competitive edge in the crypto space. However, federal capital gains tax still applies—only Congress can change that. Bitcoin and XRP React Positively In the past 24 hours: Bitcoin price surged 2.4% , now trading around $109,835 XRP rose by 2.2% and currently stands at $2.34 Short-term trends show: Asset 30-Day Growth 3-Month Growth BTC +16.55% +19.6% XRP +5.42% +2.71% Some analysts believe this proposal could help push Bitcoin to $135,000 in the next 3 months. Aligns With Trump’s National Crypto Vision This Florida initiative appears to align with President Donald Trump’s broader push for crypto-friendly regulation . Trump, now leading the U.S. administration, has signaled strong support for digital assets and blockchain innovation. With 27 U.S. states governed by Republicans , more pro-crypto tax bills could follow.

2025-05-26T11:31:28.000Z,"Crypto Market Outperforms Tech Stocks in 2025","The post Crypto Market Outperforms Tech Stocks in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has recovered from a weekend drop, holding near $110K. This strength is backed by 30 straight days of net inflows into spot ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT. According to QCP , this shows strong institutional interest and growing confidence in crypto as a long-term asset. On the other hand, tech stocks, especially leveraged plays like the TQQQ, are seeing major outflows. Since April, they’ve been hit by fading hopes of Fed rate cuts and concerns over rising inflation. Investors are turning more cautious. As traders brace for this Friday’s critical Core PCE inflation data, QCP outlines the key forces driving a growing divergence between crypto and tech markets. Why Crypto Is Gaining the Edge QCP says some investors are shifting away from pricey tech stocks and rotating into crypto. The maturity of the crypto market is also playing a role. With more sophisticated hedging options and less reliance on leverage, crypto is better equipped to handle macro shocks than in previous cycles. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction this Week , Plus, political events like Trump’s sudden EU tariff threats are adding stress to equity markets. Crypto, being less tied to government policy and physical supply chains, is staying out of that storm. What to Watch: PCE Print and Shipping Costs This Friday’s Core PCE data could be a game-changer. If inflation is higher than expected, it could delay any Fed easing and hurt tech even more. Meanwhile, shipping delays in Europe are pushing up costs globally. That could squeeze tech firms further, while crypto, being digital and decentralized, remains unaffected. QCP believes that if inflation sticks around, crypto may even gain as a hedge. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services. This creates opportunities for Web3 projects like Jambo and Yellow Card to offer alternatives for saving and earning.Related: South African firm chooses Bitcoin reserve strategy as inflation hedgeKamal highlighted Africa’s strength in its “young population with ambitious tech talents”. He cited Hedera’s partnership with Orange, a telecommunications operator, to launch digital empowerment programs across 16 African countries — initiatives that “include training, certification and the establishment of incubation and accelerator centers”.“Africa brings a unique advantage to Web3: a demographic edge and a proven capacity for digital adoption,” said Paolo Tasca, executive chairman of the Exponential Science Foundation. “Yet barriers remain, particularly in foundational infrastructure and education.”Governments are also ramping up talent development.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it’s easier and more practical.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alternative-sweden-cashless-plans?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In May, such tokens totaled $4.9 billion.  Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures. The data shows that $1.4 billion in tokens will be released through a “cliff unlock,” while $1.9 billion will be emitted through a “linear unlock.” Cliff unlocks release a large portion or all of the vested tokens simultaneously, while linear unlocks emit crypto assets gradually. Largest crypto token unlocks in JuneAmong the largest token unlocks in June is Metars Genesis (MRS), a non-fungible token (NFT) project that will release $193 million worth of tokens on June 21 to fund an artificial intelligence partnership.

Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.Source: Cyvers AlertZero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023.Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain cryptoAdvanced form of address poisoningA zero-value transfer is considered an evolution of address poisoning, a tactic where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that resembles a victim’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. Custom addresses with similar starting and ending characters can also be combined with zero-value transfers.Related: Industry exec sounds alarm on Ledger phishing letter delivered by USPSThreat growing across blockchainsA January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024.

After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue.

This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-24T20:26:01.000Z,"Bitcoin inflows projected to reach $420B in 2026 — Bitwise","Key takeaways:Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-24T07:00:16.000Z,"Judge overturns fraud convictions in Mango Markets exploit case","A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets.On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform.Related: US DOJ seizes $24M in crypto from accused Qakbot malware developerJudge sides with EisenbergThe Justice Department argued that he deceived Mango’s smart contract-based lending system, but Eisenberg’s defense maintained that he merely exploited poorly designed, permissionless code — without making any false representations.Judge Subramanian agreed, writing that “Mango Markets was permissionless and automatic,” meaning the system couldn’t be deceived in a legal sense. “There was insufficient evidence of falsity,” the judge added, siding with Eisenberg’s interpretation of DeFi mechanics.US judge siding with Eisenberg on nature of the exploit.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization.

Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy.

Excessive leverage increases the risk of forced liquidation when prices witness a sharp pullback. Therefore, traders should exercise caution.What are the critical support levels for Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionSellers are trying to sustain the price below the breakout level of $109,588, which may trap the aggressive bulls. That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA. The pair could plunge to $2,323 and then to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating a balance between supply and demand.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($2.35) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting that the XRP/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.A break and close above $2.65 will complete a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $3.70. Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That increases the likelihood of a drop to $1.60 and subsequently to $1.27.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) turned down sharply from the $693 resistance on May 23, signaling aggressive selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe BNB/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($647), as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. That shows solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will again try to thrust the price above $693. If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($612).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) climbed above the $180 resistance on May 23, but the bears are posing a strong challenge at $185.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($167) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers sustain the price above $185, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $210 and later to $220.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That heightens the risk of a drop to the 50-day SMA ($147).Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) turned down from the $0.26 overhead resistance on May 23, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe DOGE/USDT pair could descend to the 20-day EMA ($0.21), which is an important support to watch out for. A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA signals a positive sentiment, improving the prospect of a break above $0.26. If that happens, the pair could rally to $0.35. There is resistance at $0.29, but it is likely to be crossed.This optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below $0.21. That suggests a possible range-bound action between $0.14 and $0.26.Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) bounced off the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern, but the bulls could not clear the overhead obstacle at $0.86.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price continues lower and breaks below the neckline, it shows that the bears are active at higher levels. The ADA/USDT pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.69) and later to the solid support at $0.60.Contrarily, a solid bounce off the 20-day EMA ($0.75) shows demand at lower levels. The bulls will then again attempt to kick the price above $0.86. If they succeed, the pair could ascend to $1.01.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?Sui price predictionBuyers failed to push Sui (SUI) above the overhead resistance of $4.25 on May 22, indicating that the bears are aggressively defending the level.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewRepeated failure to cross the $4.25 level may have tempted short-term buyers to book profits. That pulled the price below the 20-day EMA ($3.73). If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the SUI/USDT pair could plummet to the 50-day SMA ($3.09).On the contrary, if the price turns up from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $4.25, it indicates the resumption of the up move. The pair could climb to $5 and eventually to $5.37, where the bears are expected to step in.Hyperliquid price predictionHyperliquid (HYPE) soared above the stiff overhead resistance of $28.50 on May 22, indicating the start of the next leg of the up move.HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls pushed the price above the $35.73 resistance on May 23, but the long wick on the candlestick shows the bears are trying to defend the level. If buyers do not cede much ground to the bears, the HYPE/USDT pair could surge to $42.25.Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly drag the price back below the 20-day EMA ($26.32). That signals the pair has formed a local top near $37.59.Chainlink price predictionChainlink (LINK) closed above the resistance line of the descending channel pattern on May 22, but the bulls are finding it difficult to maintain the momentum.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears are trying to pull the price back into the descending channel. If the price skids below the neckline, it suggests that the breakout above the resistance line may have been a bull trap. The LINK/USDT pair could sink to $13.20, keeping the price stuck inside the channel for some more time.Conversely, a solid bounce off the resistance line indicates that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. The pair could rise to $18 and thereafter to $19.80.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:52:03.000Z,"Who attended Trump’s controversial memecoin dinner?","The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.However, some attendees spoke to the press or took to social media to talk about the dinner. Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack. Source: CoinGeckoSui’s Cetus devs have a phantom exchange on SolanaA similar negotiation strategy used by the Cetus team on Sui was successfully employed years ago to recover funds for Crema. The Solana project hasn’t posted on its X account since March 2023, and its trading platform now sees negligible volume, but it still didn’t end well for the hacker.Crema suffered an approximately $9-million hack in 2022. Much like the Cetus case, the Crema hacker was offered a deal to return the funds while keeping $1.6 million in exchange for not reporting the attack to law enforcement.Cetus offers a $6-million reward and exemption from further legal action from the project if the remaining funds are returned.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why? The ‘founders’ own the majority of supply & there are only 114 validators!” Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, wrote on X.Some users challenge Bons’ claim, arguing that decentralization doesn’t mean a free-for-all. Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit. Source: CoinGeckoSui and Cetus backlash contrasts recent hacksThe Cetus exploit has spotlighted the persistent security challenges in DeFi while raising deeper questions around who holds the reins in supposedly decentralized networks like Sui.The team’s $6-million offer to the hacker mirrors the playbook it used with Crema — but this time, the crypto community isn’t as forgiving. With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer. Two Ethereum wallets tied to the exploiter still hold over $60 million in ETH, with no movement at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice?

Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event.This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash.Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000. Instead of selling their assets for cash, long-term investors can borrow against their holdings.

Source: FarsideWhile financial institutions are increasingly embracing Bitcoin, some members of the banking lobby are reportedly concerned about other blockchain innovations disrupting their business models. Specifically, the banking lobby is “panicking” over yield-bearing stablecoins, which can pay higher interest rates and other financial incentives that traditional banks have largely abandoned, according to New York University professor Austin Campbell. Referring to banks as a “cartel,” Campbell said financial institutions rely on fractional reserves to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledn-ditches-eth-full-custody-model-bitcoin-loans?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

If they step in, it will move closer toward $500,000,” Dragosch told Cointelegraph, referring to the US government’s proposition to make direct Bitcoin acquisitions through “budget-neutral” strategies.Bitwise’s “in-house prediction” for 2029 is a $1 million Bitcoin price target, as Bitcoin’s market cap will surpass the market capitalization of gold, as the leading safe-haven asset, Dragosch explained.Top 10 global assets by market capitalization.
