2025-06-03T20:57:07,"Why Isn’t the Anticipated Altcoin Season Here Yet? Analysts Explain the Real Reason","Evaluating the latest developments in the cryptocurrency markets, 10x Research revealed the main reasons why the altcoin season has not started in its published analysis. According to the report, despite Bitcoin trading at record levels and increasing institutional fund inflows, there is no significant movement in the altcoin market. According to analysts, this situation is caused by the lack of new trends in the market and the selling pressure caused by the unlocking of many tokens. Related News: How Will June Unfold for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies? Calm or High Volatility Expected? According to 10x Research, the low liquidity environment makes it difficult to sustain the rise in altcoin prices. “The old scenario that once worked with hype and leverage is ineffective against the 4.5% US Treasury yield today,” the analysis said, noting that even Ethereum has quietly entered a period of 'staking for modest returns'. The analysis also stated that there is no need for huge capital to push the prices of altcoins up, and that a few large purchase orders can easily move the low liquidity market. However, it was stated that in order to sustain this rise, large-scale individual investor participation is required, and this is where the real problem begins. *This is not investment advice.

Brandon Gill Under Fire for Bitcoin Disclosures According to the article , Gill made two different purchases of Bitcoin between $100,001 and $250,000 on January 29 and February 27. The report alleges that Gill failed to appropriately divulge both transactions until after a 45-day disclosure deadline required by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (STOCK), based on a periodic transaction report signed by the freshman politician on May 30. BREAKING: A US politician has disclosed large buys in bitcoin BEFORE the US announced its creation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Representative Brandon Gill bought up to $850,000 of Bitcoin on 01/29/2025, 02/27/2025, 05/13/2025, and 05/18/2025.

Gill’s first Bitcoin purchase this year was made less than one week after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order establishing a working group on cryptocurrency in a bid “to establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology.” On March 6, Trump announced the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and digital asset stockpile in hopes of “positioning the United States as a leader among nations in government digital asset strategy.” Will Donald Trump’s Face Be on the $100 Bill? Gill has long touted his support for Trump, most recently introducing the Golden Age Act of 2025 in order to put Trump’s face on the $100 bill. “President Trump could be enjoying his golden years golfing and spending time with his family,” Gill said in a March 2025 statement. “Instead, he took a bullet for this country and is now working overtime to secure our border, fix our uneven trade relationship with the rest of the world, make America energy independent again, and put America first by ending useless foreign aid.” “There has been no one who has done more to bring America into the golden age than President Trump,” he added. “Featuring him on the $100 bill is a small way to honor all he will accomplish these next four years.” The post Texas Congressman Slammed for Delayed Bitcoin Disclosure of $500K Purchases appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/texas-congressman-faces-scrutiny-over-delayed-bitcoin-disclosure/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Blockchain News|News|Bitcoin|Texas|Trump",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T20:12:31,"Donald Trump Jr. says his family isn’t behind the new ""Trump Wallet""","Donald Trump is the name behind a new crypto wallet, but Donald Trump Jr. says his family has nothing to do with it. The project, branded as the Official $TRUMP Wallet, was promoted Tuesday in a public post by Magic Eden, in partnership with GetTrumpMemes.com. The site urges people to join a waitlist, claiming it’s the only wallet officially tied to the $TRUMP token, created by the team behind the president’s memecoin. The wallet website says: “Yes! This is The Official $TRUMP Wallet by President Trump. Magic Eden partnered with GetTrumpMemes.com to create the first and only $TRUMP Wallet. Have Fun!” That came just days after Trump hosted a private dinner for the biggest holders of his meme token — an event that raised eyebrows from critics accusing him of turning his presidency into a crypto marketing scheme. Don Jr. denies link to the wallet and focuses on stablecoin Less than an hour after the announcement, Donald Trump Jr. posted on X, writing: “The Trump Organization has zero involvement with this wallet product. Eric Trump and I know nothing about it. Stay tuned—World Liberty Financial, which we have been working tirelessly on, will be launching our official wallet soon.” In an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box before the post, Don also made it clear: “I wasn’t involved in the meme coin. I’m more focused on the stablecoin, the bitcoin mining.” The $TRUMP token, which was launched three days before the Inauguration, has been the main coin tied to the Trump name in crypto. 80% of the supply is held by the Trump Organization and its affiliates, making it the financial center of Trump’s current crypto ventures. At its highest point, the token hit a market cap of $15 billion, but most of those gains are now gone. Even though the coin’s value dropped, its creators are still earning. Every transaction made using the $TRUMP token automatically sends a cut to the developers’ wallets. Between January and April, over $324 million in trading fees landed in wallets connected to the token’s team, according to data tracked by Chainalysis. Trump family says crypto move was driven by being ‘debanked’ Don Jr. said the move into crypto wasn’t some gimmick. He explained that the family had to look for alternatives after being shut out by banks following Trump’s entry into politics. “I could call any single banker in New York City,” he said. “They’d pick up the phone, I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing. We were debanked.” That’s what led to their push into crypto, and now to their focus on a stablecoin called USD1, issued by World Liberty Financial. The token is fully backed by US Treasurys, and Donald Jr. says it could help boost America’s financial dominance. “They’re literally some of the biggest buyers of US Treasurys in the world, replacing a lot of the countries that would have been traditionally doing that,” he said , pointing to Tether, which holds nearly 70% of the global stablecoin market. Tether’s own holdings include about $120 billion in US government debt, which places it above countries like Germany and the UAE as a top Treasury holder. Don Jr. added, “Stablecoins could be the savior of US currency.” The Trump family’s growing involvement in crypto, though, has drawn heat. Critics say a sitting president with financial interests in tokens creates space for corruption and foreign money to enter US politics. Donald Jr. pushed back by highlighting crypto’s anonymity. “You don’t know who’s actually doing any of these things,” he said. “It’s hard to influence if you don’t actually know where this stuff’s coming from.” That hasn’t stopped big names from getting involved. Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, increased his stake in WLFI tokens — tied to the Trump family’s stablecoin initiative — to $75 million in January. A court filing the next month revealed he and the Securities and Exchange Commission were working on settling a fraud case. Sun also bought a big chunk of the $TRUMP token, becoming one of the top holders, and bringing his total investment in Trump-tied coins to at least $97 million.

Toomey says in a new interview with CNBC that equities are still likely “range-bound,” suggesting that the S&P 500 may correct after rallying close to 6,000 points. “I think the concern we’ve got is that while we’ve taken the worst-case scenario with regards to the Liberation Day, we’re in a situation where I think the market’s right now probably pricing in the best-case scenario. I think everyone’s talking about the fact that there are probably going to be 10% tariffs across the board, 30% for China. I think that’s kind of baked in.” Toomey also warns of the potential for stagflation, an unfavorable economic environment which is dominated by stagnant economic growth, high inflation and high unemployment. The Morgan Stanley executive notes that companies with connectivity to China aren’t doing as well due to the tariffs. “You can see that in the Magnificent 7, and you can see that in the rest of the overall S&P 500. So in our minds, that’s going to be a stagflation issue. If we do see GDP growth coming down, that might give us the opportunity for the Fed to step in next year and start cutting rates.” As of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,935 points.

2025-06-03T20:00:00,"Live Coin Watch Trending: Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Revolution Creating Overnight Wealth Opportunities","In every market cycle, there’s one altcoin that flips the script—one project that doesn’t just ride the wave but rewrites the rules entirely. This season, that breakout isn’t just another meme coin or recycled Ethereum fork. It’s Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a radically different wealth-generation engine powered by innovation, efficiency, and most importantly, mobile mining. But this isn’t just about clever branding. It’s about making serious money, without needing to buy expensive rigs or be a technical genius. And as it dominates trending lists on platforms like Live Coin Watch, one thing is clear: early believers in Bitcoin Solaris are already seeing the first signs of overnight success. Beyond the Buzz: Why “Trending” Doesn’t Always Mean “Sustainable” Live Coin Watch tracks countless tokens that trend for a day and vanish the next. Many spike on hype and crumble on fundamentals. But Bitcoin Solaris is climbing for a different reason—it’s combining trending status with a backbone of technology that actually delivers. Where other coins struggle to balance scale, cost, and decentralization, BTC-S sets a new standard. It doesn’t just look good on a chart; it works. The Power of Mobile Mining: Wealth in Your Pocket At the center of Bitcoin Solaris’s momentum is its mobile-first approach to mining. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, users will be able to mine BTC-S straight from their phones, a disruptive model that opens the door to millions worldwide. This isn’t just a gimmick. BTC-S has reimagined mining by: Eliminating the barrier of expensive hardware Spreading access globally through mobile, desktop, and browser platforms Driving consistent demand by requiring holders to own BTC-S in order to mine more With this frictionless approach, the dream of passive income from crypto is no longer reserved for whales. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Behind the Speed: A Dual-Layer Engine Built for the Future What makes this all work under the hood is Bitcoin Solaris’s dual-layer architecture. The Base Layer runs on a hybrid of Proof of Work and Proof of Contribution, maximizing security and fairness in validator rewards. The Solaris Layer delivers blazing speed and scalability with its Delegated Proof of Stake model, finalizing transactions in just two seconds. Combined, they push the network to support over 10,000 transactions per second, making BTC-S not just fast but enterprise-grade scalable. And security? Bitcoin Solaris has been fully audited by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , giving investors peace of mind. Community and Trust: How It’s Growing—Fast The attention isn’t limited to retail users. The buzz has caught the eye of major influencers too. A detailed review by Crypto Legends breaks down the momentum, and why many believe BTC-S could be the defining altcoin of the year. Add to that a fully KYC-verified team via Freshcoins KYC , and the foundation for long-term confidence is clear. And with over 11,000 unique users already joined, this isn’t a slow trickle—it’s a stampede. Presale Momentum: This Train Is Moving Fast This isn’t the start of the presale. It’s Phase 6. With the price currently at $6, and just a short window before it jumps to $7, momentum is building at an explosive pace. Launch price? $20. Bonus? 10%. Return potential? 1,900%. Time left? Only around 8 weeks. It’s already raised over $1.8M, making it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. The door is closing fast—and those getting in now could be looking at one of the biggest multipliers this year. Roadmap: Built for the Long Haul Beyond the headlines and hype, Bitcoin Solaris is structured for years of innovation. Its roadmap includes: Launch of the Solaris Nova app in Phase 4 Mining Power Marketplace and DApp Accelerator in Phase 5 Layer-2 scaling and a new DEX by Phase 6 Fortune 500 partnerships and enterprise tools by Phase 7 Government collaborations and global education by 2028+ This isn’t a pump-and-dump. It’s a long-term digital economy in motion. Conclusion: The Opportunity to Mine, Earn, and Hold the Future While other altcoins chase the spotlight, Bitcoin Solaris is building something much bigger—a truly decentralized, scalable, and accessible wealth-generation platform. Its mobile-first mining model and dual-consensus framework make it more than just a trending token. It’s a blueprint for financial empowerment. And in a world where attention shifts quickly, Bitcoin Solaris is proving that sustainable innovation can trend—and keep trending—for all the right reasons.

In a new interview with CNBC, Donald J. Trump Jr., son of U.S. President Donald J. Trump, says the family got into crypto after being “ debanked ” in New York City for political reasons. “The reason we got into crypto and we’re all in on crypto and we’re doing American Bitcoin and we have World Liberty Finance and USD1 was because there was a time… where I could call any single banker in New York City, they’d pick up the phone [and] I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden, they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing. We were debanked. And what I realized, and my brother realized because we were the recipients of every subpoena imaginable, was that, you know what? We were just the top of this sort of pyramid scheme that we didn’t realize we were a part of, that the financial system was totally undemocratized because we had a certain balance sheet…” After experiencing what the family believes was a political persecution, he says that the Trumps decided to turn to crypto as a way to avoid being “turned off” in the future. “The regular guy was messed up. Now we were all of a sudden in the shoes of the regular guy that wouldn’t be able to take advantage of the markets. And we said, what’s the solution for that? The answer is crypto. These decentralized platforms where you’re not beholden to this, where you create efficiencies. As a guy that did real estate, [I asked] why am I paying points in and out for title insurance? That could be done on the blockchain. So we got into crypto not because it was like, ‘hey, this is the next cool thing.’ We got into it out of necessity. We got into it because we understood just how quickly we could be turned off.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-03T19:48:07,"Is the Altcoin Season Upon Us? Analysis Firm Responds with Two Metrics","Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has suggested that the altcoin market could enter a strong bullish wave in the near future. The company highlighted two key indicators to assess this possibility: Altcoin Dominance Excluding Stablecoins and Altcoin Dominance Excluding Stablecoins with Ethereum. According to Alphractal’s analysis, altcoin dominance, excluding stablecoins, has historically found strong support at the 25% level. This rate usually indicates periods when altcoins lose significant value during periods when Bitcoin and stablecoins dominate the market. However, analysts believe that periods when this dominance rate fluctuates between 24% and 25.3% are followed by altcoin seasons, which usually last for a few weeks. Related News: South Korea, a Country Influencing the Crypto Sector, Has Announced the Winner of Its Presidential Election - Here Are His Cryptocurrency Opinions When Ethereum is excluded, the picture changes slightly. Noting that Ethereum plays a critical role in altcoin dominance, Alphractal states that the historical support level of this metric is around 18%. The fact that it has fallen below this level only a few times in the past coincides with periods when Bitcoin was rapidly losing market share to altcoins. The company also acknowledges that these support levels alone do not guarantee an upcoming altcoin season. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is the Altcoin Season Upon Us?

2025-06-03T19:35:07,"Convert Your Bitcoin, Ethereum Into XRP, Pundit Says Time Is Running Out. Here’s Why","In a striking commentary that has sparked renewed debate in the crypto space, market observer Amonyx has urged investors to convert their Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins, dismissively referred to as “shitcoins” into XRP , warning that time is running out. Amonyx made this assertion while referencing a viral post by analyst Jacob King, who alleges that a shadowy $4 billion Bitcoin transfer by Tether to Jack Mallers’ newly launched firm, Twenty One Capital, may be the latest red flag in what he calls a fabricated market ecosystem. Tether’s Dubious Bitcoin Transfer Sparks Alarm At the center of the controversy is a massive transaction involving 37,229 BTC, worth nearly $4 billion, moved by Tether to Twenty One Capital just a day after the company launched. According to King, the timing and scale of this transfer raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of the demand for Bitcoin. “Nobody was buying,” King stated bluntly, implying that without Tether’s interference, organic interest in Bitcoin is virtually nonexistent. REMINDER: Time is running out to convert your $ETH , $BTC , and all other shitcoins into $XRP . https://t.co/1FWn7qyvG4 — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 3, 2025 This sudden liquidity injection is seen by critics not as an investment decision, but rather as an attempt to simulate demand and support artificially high prices. King argues that the Bitcoin market is being propped up by a single centralized entity, likening it to a house of cards destined to collapse once the illusion of liquidity is exposed. Jack Mallers’ Risky Venture Draws Comparisons to Collapsed Schemes What further intensifies the scrutiny is Mallers’ announcement of a new lending service under Twenty One Capital, a move that critics argue echoes the playbooks of defunct platforms like Celsius and Bitconnect. These notorious projects lured investors with promises of high returns through lending models, only to implode under the weight of insolvency and mismanagement. For Amonyx and others raising the alarm, Mallers’ pivot into lending, so soon after receiving billions in BTC from Tether, is a glaring red flag. “Avoid at all cost,” King warned, suggesting that the scheme will inevitably go bust. The parallels with past crypto collapses are unsettling, with King calling this episode “the most elaborate financial fraud in history” and predicting its unraveling will be “nothing short of spectacular.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP as a Safer Alternative Amid Systemic Risks Against this backdrop of escalating skepticism surrounding Bitcoin and Ethereum, Amonyx is championing XRP as a superior and more transparent alternative. The digital asset, developed by Ripple Labs, has long positioned itself as a bridge currency for cross-border payments and has recently gained renewed institutional interest following partial legal clarity in the U.S. courts. XRP’s resilience amid regulatory uncertainty and its focus on real-world utility make it, according to Amonyx, a safer bet as the rest of the market faces increasing scrutiny and potential collapse. While BTC and ETH are criticized for their speculative bubbles and lack of clear use cases, XRP’s alignment with global financial infrastructure continues to gain traction, especially with growing partnerships across Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. A Turning Point for the Crypto Market? The warning from Amonyx is not isolated. It reflects a growing disillusionment within parts of the crypto community who are questioning the sustainability of the existing market structure. The latest revelations only intensify the demand for greater transparency and decentralized accountability. As trust in some of the market’s most dominant assets begins to erode, XRP appears to be emerging as a potential beneficiary of the shift. Whether or not investors will heed the call to convert their holdings before what Amonyx calls the impending collapse remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the market is approaching a critical juncture, and the decisions made in this moment may shape the future of crypto for years to come.

Social media giant Meta (META) on Tuesday inked a 20-year deal with a nuclear power plant to buy 1.1 gigawatts of electrical output for AI purposes — yet another signal that tech giants are serious about investing into the necessary infrastructure to power their data centers. Bitcoin miners, a number of which have begun diversifying their operations for AI purposes, could be benefiting from the news. MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), Hut 8 (HUT), Core Scientific (CORZ) and CleanSpark (CLSK) are among those sporting sizable gains, each ahead 7%-8% with less than an hour to go before the close of U.S. trade. CoreWeave (CRWV), one of the hottest players in the AI sphere, is up 23% on the day to a new record and higher by more than 270% since it went public in March. Cryptocurrencies themselves are modestly in the green, with bitcoin up 1.8% in the last 24 hours at $106,200.

2025-06-03T19:09:07,"Where is Bitcoin Headed Next? Here Are the Levels to Watch for a Potential Rally","Cryptocurrency analysis platform MakroVision has published a remarkable assessment of Bitcoin's recent price movements. The analysis noted that Bitcoin reached a new all-time high by rising to $112,000, and then entered a technically healthy correction process. MakroVision emphasized that the 61.8% Fibonacci resistance at $111,260 initially turned the price back, but this pullback is currently limited to around 5%. There are no signs of a sharp decline in the downward movement at the moment. Experts note that Bitcoin has found strong support at the following technical levels: $103,200: The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level is currently holding successfully. $102,000: This level, which previously acted as resistance, is now a potential support area. $97,700: Coinciding with the 38.2% Fibonacci level, this area forms a strong support cluster along with $98,600. Related News: BREAKING: After Remaining Silent for a Long Time, Trump Makes His Move in Cryptocurrencies! And He's Not Stopping There—He's Partnering with a Surprise Altcoin According to MakroVision’s analysis, Bitcoin retesting $112,000 would reaffirm the market’s strength, with $121,100 the next target if this level is breached.

2025-06-03T19:00:09,"Crypto ATMs Under Fire: Australia Cracks Down Amid Scam Surge","Australia’s financial watchdog and federal police are warning that scams using crypto ATMs are draining wallets across the country. Between January 2024 and January 2025, 150 people filed unique reports with ReportCyber about crypto ATM scams , and those losses topped A$3.1 million (about US$2 million). Many older Australians are being targeted, and regulators are scrambling to put safer rules in place. Operators Face New Transaction Caps According to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), a new rule now limits cash deposits and withdrawals at crypto ATMs to A$5,000 (around US$3,250). Operators must also put up clear scam warning signs, keep a closer eye on every transaction, and step up checks on customers. These measures began on June 3. Right now, they only apply to ATM providers, but AUSTRAC says crypto exchanges should think about doing the same if they let people use cash to buy crypto . AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas mentioned that these conditions will be watched closely and could change if they aren’t working as planned. Seniors At Higher Risk Based on reports from AUSTRAC’s task force, most people who use cash to buy crypto at ATMs are over 50, and about 72% of all transaction value comes from this older age group. It’s a big worry because many in their 60s and 70s end up as victims of scams. Scammers often tell them to send money to a crypto ATM to “prove” an investment or to recover stolen funds. Many victims don’t even realize they’ve been scammed until it’s too late. That’s partly why AUSTRAC wants stronger “know your customer” checks right at the kiosk. Public Reporting Remains Low AFP Commander Graeme Marshall says that a lot of people who lose money don’t report it. Sometimes they feel too embarrassed. Other times, they just don’t know how to get help. Marshall encouraged anyone who has been scammed to tell their family and friends about it. People need to share what happened so others won’t fall into the same trap. Right now, with 150 reports logged over 12 months, the Australian Federal Police (AFP ) thinks those numbers are just scratching the surface. They believe many more scams are happening without being recorded. Rising Number Of ATMs Australia used to have very few crypto ATMs—just 67 in August 2022. But by June 2025, that number had exploded to nearly 1,820. That makes Australia the third-largest market for these machines in the world. In a single year, almost 150,000 cash-based transactions went through, moving roughly A$275 million (about US$178 million) into Bitcoin, Ether, and various stablecoins. Private firms like Localcoin (753 machines), Coinflip (700), and Bitcoin Depot (182) lead the pack. With more ATMs popping up, there’s more chance for scammers to trick people, especially if operators aren’t watching closely.

The Shelbyville Police Department says the scam texts have been circulating through the local community. “Several citizens have reported receiving messages claiming to be from local banks, urging them to click a suspicious link. DO NOT click any links or provide personal information. These texts are not legitimate and are designed to steal your sensitive information. Below is an example of the text. If you receive one of these messages, delete it immediately and contact your bank directly if you have concerns.” Source: Shelbyville Police Department/Facebook In a similar vein, Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine warned last month that a crew of con artists had been calling seniors on Long Island and pretending to be their banks. The fraudsters tell the seniors that their bank accounts are under attack and that their credit and debit cards have malfunctioned. The scammers subsequently offer to pick the cards up from the victims and attempt to lure them to reveal their PINs, Romaine explained. “And guess what? Then they go to the ATM machine and steal their money.

In a new interview with CNBC, Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager for Morgan Stanley’s Investment Management division, says he’s not expecting the S&P 500 to be “substantially above” the 6,000 mark any time soon. Says Slimmon, “My base case for the year has been [that] it’s a pause year. We’ve had two great years in a row and the market needs kind of a timeout, or a breather. If I work backwards from the end of the year, it’s tough to see the markets substantially above 6,000 and 5,900 that’s not a lot of upside, and I’ve learned that the market doesn’t just creep along slowly, it deviates around that central norm so somewhere along the way another drawdown and suspect it’ll be later in the summer. I will tell you this. I’m always very intrigued when the actual data diverges significantly from what is projected by the supposed experts to come. And the actual data, earnings came in strong in the first quarter, they beat by $3.50 versus consensus, but the whole-year number is down $10 because ‘the bad is yet to come.’ And this does kind of remind me of Covid which analysts ended up being way too negative on earnings for 2020-2021. I suspect that will be the same case, so I do think we’ll get a rally into the end of the year as analysts are forced to raise their numbers, but in the meantime, I wouldn’t be surprised if not much happens to the market between now and the fourth quarter.” At time of writing, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,975, about a 2.8% move away from all-time highs.

2025-06-03T18:30:34,"Is $250K Bitcoin Possible This Year? This Research Chief Thinks So","Tom Lee, Fundstrat’s head of research, says Bitcoin could climb to $250,000 by the end of 2025. According to an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box today, Lee pointed out that Bitcoin recently dipped from its all-time high of $111,970 down to about $104,000. He still thinks that the market is holding up around that level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Max Keiser Isn’t Buying The Hype Around New Crypto Holding Companies Lee’s Short-Term Outlook Lee told Squawk Box’s host Joe Kernen that 95% of all Bitcoin—about 19.80 million coins—has already been mined out of a maximum of 21 million. That leaves roughly 1.13 million coins waiting to be produced. He sees that as a tight supply setup. He also noted that while nearly all Bitcoin exists, 95% of the global population does not own any. Based on reports, that gap between supply and potential buyers could push prices higher in the months ahead. To reach $250,000 from around $104,000 now, Bitcoin would need to jump about 140%. Lee still believes it can hit $150,000 by December and could even stretch toward $200,000 to $250,000 if demand heats up. Supply And Demand Gap Lee highlighted the fact that most people in the world have not bought any Bitcoin. He said this creates an imbalance. On one side you have a nearly fixed supply. On the other, there may be millions of new buyers in the next 10 years. He explained that if even a fraction of those people decide to buy Bitcoin, the price could move a lot higher. Right now, only about 5% of all coins remain to be mined. That means new supply is slowing down fast. At the same time, more wallets, apps, and easy ways to buy could bring in fresh money. Lee thinks this mismatch is a big part of why Bitcoin could keep climbing. Long-Term Valuation Targets When asked about Bitcoin’s terminal value—meaning its price when all coins are mined by 2140—Lee said he expects it to match gold’s roughly $23 trillion market cap. That works out to at least $1.15 million per Bitcoin if there are 20 million coins in circulation. He chose 20 million instead of 21 million because assumed losses (lost keys, forgotten wallets) mean not every coin will ever be spent. Lee went further, saying he sees room for Bitcoin to hit $2 million or $3 million per coin. That would put his average “bull case” at $2.5 million, which is roughly a 2,300% rise from today’s levels. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Other Analyst Projections VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, also has a long-range prediction. Based on what Sigel told investors, VanEck sees Bitcoin hitting $3 million by 2050. That forecast lines up with Lee’s idea of Bitcoin matching or even beating gold over time. Both calls assume steady growth in demand, plus wider use by big institutions like hedge funds or pension plans.

The latest offender, Rep. Brandon Gill, a big fan of President Donald Trump, has reportedly violated a federal financial law by improperly disclosing about half a million dollars in Bitcoin purchases. According to a signed disclosure he submitted to the House of Representatives, Gill bought Bitcoin of between $100,001 and $250,000 on January 29 and February 27. However, he did not reveal both trades until weeks after a 45-day disclosure deadline mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act. BREAKING: We just found more STOCK Act violations. Representative Brandon Gill just filed purchases of up to $850K of Bitcoin. Some of the trades were made over 100 days ago. The reporting deadline is 45 days. Gill sits on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform pic.twitter.com/CI01ct2ozM — Quiver Quantitative (@QuiverQuant) June 2, 2025 Gill made Bitcoin purchases just before Trump’s crypto bills The STOCK Act was put in place to prevent insider trading and conflicts of interest among members of Congress. So when Gill made his January 29 Bitcoin purchase the week after Trump signed an executive order to “establish United States leadership in digital and financial technology,” it raised eyebrows. The lawmaker’s February 27 purchase also falls under similar circumstances, as it came a week before Trump announced the creation of a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile” to make the United States “a leader among nations in government digital asset strategy.” Gill has also disclosed making two additional Bitcoin purchases last month with the first happening on May 13 valued at between $100,001 and $250,000 and another on May 18 valued at between $50,001 and $100,000. In both cases, which Gill disclosed before the 45-day federal deadline, Bitcoin’s value was slightly below its current price. So far, Gill has filed for purchases of up to $850k BTC, and he is not the only Congress member accused of ethically questionable stock trading. Congress are pushing the boundaries of the STOCK Act Gill’s Bitcoin purchases put him in the league of Congress members like Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Dwight Evans (D-Pa.) and Neal Dunn (R-Fla.), who have been fingered in violating the STOCK Act this decade. The $200 penalty for missing the reporting deadline for Congressional trading “tends to be a joke.” Source: @QuiverQuant Others like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), Jefferson Shreve (R-Ind.), Julie Johnson (D-Texas), Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), reportedly made a flurry of stock trades immediately before or after Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements that roiled stock indices. Meanwhile, at least two members of Congress — Rep. George Whitesides (D-Calif.) and Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) — have confirmed they are no longer trading individual stocks in a bid to avoid real or perceived financial conflicts of interest. Now, there is a bipartisan coalition of federal lawmakers — made up of some on the far-right and far-left — who are supporting legislation that would ban members of Congress and their families from trading individual stocks and cryptocurrency outright. Trump also seems to be on the same side as these lawmakers. This year, he even said he would “sign a bill.” Talk of banning Congress members from trading has become a hot topic, especially since the tariff announcement, and the subject has overwhelming public support as well. It remains to be seen if such legislation will pass, as some Congress members see their ability to trade as a perk. However, there is no doubt that the trading embargo is under serious consideration.

2025-06-03T18:12:07,"How Will June Unfold for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies? Calm or High Volatility Expected?","Although activity in the cryptocurrency market continues to be low as the summer months begin, June is not expected to be a quiet month on the US economic policy front, according to digital asset research firm K33. According to a report published today by K33 Research President Vetle Lunde, the 90-day tariff moratorium ends on July 9, while President Donald Trump hopes to get the “One Big Beautiful Bill” through the Senate by July 4. These two developments signal a turbulent period for markets at the end of June. “We had a pleasant period free of discussions about tariffs for most of May. However, Trump disrupted this peace by threatening the EU with a 50% tariff and then postponed the decision on the tariffs until July 9,” said Lunde, adding that Bitcoin retreated from its peak levels after Trump’s statement and has not yet approached those levels. He conveyed that this situation shows how sensitive the market is to discourses about tariffs. Related News: BREAKING: After Remaining Silent for a Long Time, Trump Makes His Move in Cryptocurrencies! And He's Not Stopping There—He's Partnering with a Surprise Altcoin Last week, Wall Street began using a new acronym for Trump: “TACO,” which stands for Trump Always Chickens Out. The term was coined as a reference to the easing of tensions with China following the tariffs and the postponement of those tariffs. But Lunde said such rhetoric and the upcoming tariff deadline could increase pressure on Trump to pursue tougher policies. At the same time, Republicans are said to be working overtime throughout June to pass Trump’s “Magnificent Act” through the Senate and onto the president’s desk. The legislation could add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, with much of that burden coming from corporate and individual tax cuts and other stimulus and spending plans. According to Lunde, the Senate bill debate and possible amendments could create significant market volatility in June. If the bill is approved, these expansionary effects could boost market morale and offset the pressure from the return of tariffs. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T18:05:43,"Under-the-Radar Stock Explodes 150% in One Day After Company Announces Bitcoin Treasury Plans","An under-the-radar stock has skyrocketed 150% in one day after announcing plans to accumulate Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a treasury asset. In a press release, the Norway-based crypto exchange Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) says it has started buying Bitcoin to hold on its balance sheet. “As part of the initial allocation, the company has obtained six Bitcoin and will expand to approximately 10 within June. This will allow for a limited proof of concept.” The company says it will use Bitcoin as collateral to issue USDM , a stablecoin on the Cardano ( ADA ) blockchain, and “generate yield on both the Bitcoin and within the Cardano and USDM ecosystems.” “NBX will not sell this Bitcoin or go short in any form… NBX will also use proceeds to buy additional Bitcoin.” The company also says that “Bitcoin is becoming an important part of the global financial infrastructure” and that launching a Bitcoin treasury will not only help with operational efficiency but also attract investors looking for exposure to the flagship crypto asset. Amid the announcement, NBX shares soared from a low on June 2nd of 0.021 euros ($0.024) to 0.053 euros ($0.060) on June 3rd, an increase of about 150%. Founded in 2018, NBX says the BTC treasury is the latest effort to increase adoption of digital assets, highlighting how it has already issued the first credit card in the world that rewards customers with BTC for each transaction.

2025-06-03T17:52:54,"BTC traders realized $500M an hour during several periods of selling","Traders accelerated their profit-taking in the past few days, realizing $500M an hour in profits. Based on Glassnode data, traders are trying to lock in gains while reassessing the next move for BTC. Traders are profiting from the BTC market, using each recent recovery. As BTC regained $105,000 and showed signs of recovery, traders still sold to lock in recent profits. According to Glassnode data , profit-taking accelerated to $500M an hour, with three major periods of selling for the last 24 hours. Based on holders waves heatmap, wallets holding coins for less than a month and between 3-6 months reduced their balances, while all other cohorts retained or slightly increased their balances. Most of the sellers have realized profits based on the adjusted Spending Output Profit Ratio. Glassnode data showed the average BTC sold in the past few days had a 16% profit. In the past few weeks, coins flowed into addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC , while larger cohorts with over 1,000 and 10,000 BTC sold off their coins. Many large holders (‘whales’) already realized profits during previous peaks, and the current selling is likely from small, speculative wallets offloading BTC on the open market. The recent rounds of selling also met with enough buyers aiming to store physical coins. BTC is showing signs of scarcity on the spot market, and even derivative exchanges see an outflow of reserves. BTC reserves flow out rapidly from spot exchanges, reaching the lowest levels since 2022. Despite profit-taking, the sellers are matched with significant demand from spot buyers. | Source: Cryptoquant Spot exchanges carry 1.023M BTC, the lowest reserves since 2022. The remaining 1.30M are on derivative exchanges, with a steep slide in the past month. As with previous local peaks, BTC traders have shown more rational behavior, aiming to lock in gains. At the same time, spot BTC accumulation continues, driven by the recent trend of growing corporate treasuries . BTC still gets a boost from derivative traders The recent trader behavior follows a pullback of the fear and greed index, down to 64 points from 74 points the previous week. Realizing profits is not unusual even for whale wallets, and selling originated even from the ETF wallets of BlackRock. Despite the selling, BTC still had the energy to rally as high as $106,559. BTC remains range-bound, with potential for volatility in either direction. The recent profit-taking also shows the market remains relatively resilient, and derivative trading continues independent of spot market activities. BTC’s open interest on derivative markets increased by $1.2B in the past day, rising again toward $34B after a series of liquidations. In the past few hours, the trend has been toward shorting the asset, though long positions still dominate over 53% of open interest. An accumulation of short positions may also lead to a rally to liquidate the short sellers. The BTC derivative market is also closely watched for volatility, based on the position of risky trader James Wynn . His position, with a liquidation price of $104,980, is at risk for even a small downward move, especially driven by organized selling.

2025-06-03T17:47:27,"Expert Projects When 10,000 XRP Will Cost You $150,000","A bold prediction about XRP’s future valuation is stirring renewed interest in long-term accumulation. In a recent post on X, crypto influencer X Finance Bull suggested that by 2030, the cost of 10,000 XRP could exceed $150,000, translating to a price of $15 per token or more. Drawing attention to rapid institutional adoption and supportive AI-driven projections from platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and GROK, the analyst argued that the retail window for affordable XRP may be closing fast. This projection, while optimistic, resonates with a growing chorus of voices in the XRP community who believe the token is structurally undervalued. As Ripple expands its global financial partnerships and as utility-driven demand for XRP gains traction, the case for a substantial revaluation is being taken more seriously, especially among long-term holders. 10,000 $XRP sounds cheap now? Just wait By 2030, it could cost $150K… or more AI projections like GROK, ChatGPT and Gemini are screaming one thing: retail is getting priced out. Fast If you don’t stack now, you may never afford it later #XRP accumulation season is ending pic.twitter.com/RJLcY7j2GX — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) June 2, 2025 The $150K Valuation: Ambitious, but Not Baseless The suggestion that 10,000 XRP could be worth $150,000 in less than a decade is grounded in several key assumptions: widespread adoption of Ripple’s blockchain technology, XRP’s growing utility in cross-border payments and tokenized asset flows, and favorable regulatory outcomes. While skeptics may balk at such high projections, it’s worth noting that the crypto market has witnessed similarly dramatic transformations before. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum underwent massive re-pricings within a single cycle, often defying expectations and valuation models. X Finance Bull’s post captures this potential, stressing that current market prices may not reflect the long-term trajectory of XRP’s role in financial infrastructure. With prices still hovering under the $1 mark at press time, the implied valuation of $15 per XRP by 2030 would represent a 15x increase from today’s levels, a scenario that is plausible if Ripple’s technology becomes integral to the back-end of international finance. AI Models Echo Long-Term Optimism Supporting the narrative are forecasts from leading artificial intelligence platforms. While AI models like ChatGPT, GROK, and Gemini do not offer real-time financial advice or investment guarantees, they have shown broad consensus in identifying XRP as one of the few cryptocurrencies with tangible utility, regulatory resilience, and enterprise-grade adoption. These platforms have evaluated XRP within the context of its use cases: real-time settlement, liquidity provisioning, and tokenized asset interoperability. Based on these functions and market trends, they consistently rank XRP among the most likely tokens to benefit from long-term institutional integration. While not a guarantee of price, these AI-driven outlooks reinforce the sentiment that XRP may be entering a phase where scarcity and demand could push valuations significantly higher. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Retail Window May Be Closing One of the most pointed warnings in X Finance Bull’s post is the suggestion that “retail is getting priced out. Fast.” As history has shown with Bitcoin, early accumulation opportunities tend to diminish quickly once institutional demand surges and retail liquidity thins out. XRP’s growing integration into banking corridors via Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution already puts it in a different category from purely speculative tokens. The post also frames the current market as the tail end of the “accumulation season”—a phase where patient investors acquire undervalued assets before the rest of the market recognizes their full potential. If XRP follows the same path as Bitcoin post-2016 or Ethereum in early 2020, the current price range may eventually be seen as a missed opportunity. Looking Ahead to 2030 While no projection is immune to market cycles or external risks, the $150,000 valuation for 10,000 XRP reflects a credible long-term thesis: that utility-driven tokens with institutional backing and a proven track record will eventually see re-pricing to reflect their foundational role in the new financial order. For those still on the sidelines, the message from analysts like X Finance Bull is clear—delaying may come at a cost. If current trends continue, the window to accumulate XRP at sub-$1 levels could be closing, and by 2030, the cost of entry might be out of reach for most retail investors.

2025-06-03T17:45:28,"XRP Ledger Activity Drops After Strong Start to 2025","The XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized blockchain network, has seen its platform’s activity slow down sharply. Recent data has shown fewer transactions and less overall use on the network. This came after XRPL started strong this year. This marks a significant shift in the usual transaction volume on the ledger, which is popularly known for its speed and low-cost transaction fees. XRPL Sees Noticeable Drop in Transactions and Users Since March, payment activity on the XRP Ledger has dropped sharply. Transactions fell to 320,747, the lowest level since October last year. This marks a sharp drop from over 1 million monthly transactions in 2025. Data from XRPScan also shows fewer people are using the network, with active addresses dropping below 10,000, the lowest since October. Notably, these addresses represent individual users making payments or other actions. The amount of XRP burned as transaction fees dropped to just 1,500 XRP, showing fewer overall transactions. Fewer new accounts are being created, too, and each new account usually requires a 1 XRP reserve. This slowdown comes after a strong start to the year. According to Messari, from January to March, transaction activity on XRPL jumped 36%, and active users rose by 142%. This remarkable growth underscores the increasing adoption and utilization of the XRPL network. XRP Struggles While Bitcoin Thrives Market watchers have compared Ripple’s native token XRP to Bitcoin (BTC) market movement. While the flagship crypto recently reached a price peak of over $110,000 in late May, XRP grew by 62%. The token climbed from $1.60 to $2.60, benefiting from the general market recovery. However, XRP has slowed down since then and has not returned to its January peak of $3.40. This shows that XRP is not growing as fast as Bitcoin anymore. Meanwhile, macroeconomics and market uncertainty play a significant role in pressuring crypto’s trajectory. According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP is trading at $2.22 at the time of writing, up 3.25% in the last 24 hours . Ripple’s Moves Strengthen the XRP Ecosystem Ripple, the company behind the XRPL project, has made big moves lately . The fintech company bought Hidden Road in April , becoming the first crypto firm to run a global prime brokerage. This move is expected to improve XRP liquidity and trading services. More recently, Ripple’s new stablecoin RLUSD also got approved by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). This means RLUSD can now be used in Dubai’s leading financial center, opening new doors for Ripple. Looking ahead, Ripple is getting ready to host its XRP Ledger Apex 2025 event in Singapore from June 10 to 12. This event could bring more updates and attract new interest in the XRPL and Ripple’s associated token.

2025-06-03T17:38:24,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Top Analysts Predict A Stronger, Sustained Bull Run","Zoom out on the charts, and the current market trend looks less like a fluke and more like a reset in motion. Bitcoin’s recent dip followed a fresh all-time high, but rather than triggering panic, it’s exposing a deeper shift. This isn’t the top, some say. Analysts tied to major funds continue to allocate, and their tone hasn’t softened either. Skeptics focus on the drop, but those tracking institutional moves are seeing conviction, not hesitation. The old four-year rhythm may be breaking apart. Momentum hasn’t vanished; it’s moving under the surface, quiet and forceful. To those watching closely, the price action feels less like the end of a cycle and more like the middle of something bigger. Quiet Accumulation May Indicate Strong Market Conviction When it comes to BTC accumulation, the company that stands at the forefront right now may be MicroStrategy, and it doesn’t seem to be scaling back. Its most recent purchase adds to an already massive position, reflecting how certain institutions now treat Bitcoin as a long-term reserve embraced by leading investors. A growing number of firms, from asset managers to international funds are slowly building exposure. They're not waiting for clarity. They believe it’s already here. This is why this crypto cycle will be bigger and last longer than most people think.Applications and real world use cases were artificially suppressed by the hostile regulatory environment of 2020-2024. But the infrastructure kept improving, and is now remarkably robust — high… https://t.co/NlKCrG25lS — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) May 29, 2025 Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan suggests this entire cycle may outlast the historical norm. Years of regulatory friction suppressed application growth, but the groundwork kept evolving. With new policies forming and political voices like Trump calling digital assets a national priority, analysts now expect faster deployment of real-world crypto use cases. Hougan describes the current moment as compressed potential. He argues that volatility will remain, but major pullbacks are likely to be shorter and shallower than before. There’s simply more diversity in the investor base, and fewer sellers among them. Funds, governments, and crypto-native firms are holding steady and their models are built on longer timelines. They’re not chasing parabolic moves, but rather on the lookout for staking claims. The market may look uncertain on the surface, but those who’ve studied its depth aren’t backing away. They’re buying quietly while others hesitate, likely sitting on massive profits already given the recent all-time high level it crossed. Best Crypto to Buy Now As the Bull Market Looks Ready to Pump Further SUBBD A few years ago, creators were chasing platform partnerships and algorithm visibility. Now, the most ambitious ones are asking how to leave the platforms entirely. SUBBD was built for that moment. It isn’t some half-formed idea still waiting on use cases. Its token underpins a direct, creator-led economy where artists, writers, streamers, and niche builders can monetize their audiences without losing ownership to middlemen or advertising logic. What separates SUBBD from other attempts is that it isn’t just about tipping or digital collectibles. The token is functional, not decorative. Fans can use it to unlock gated content, vote on creative decisions, stake for early access, and even receive a share of revenue from projects they support. This means activity around the token reflects real creative exchange rather than pure speculation. $SUBBD Presale Hits $500k! Embracing the future of AI Agent content creation... https://t.co/dLCKejpxpp pic.twitter.com/AFeslybq8A — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) May 24, 2025 In the context of a prolonged bull run, this becomes more relevant. As institutions and large investors settle into long-term crypto allocations, the attention turns to projects that carry economic weight beyond charts. SUBBD appeals to that shift. It’s aligned with the decentralization of culture, not just finance. And as creators continue to look for a way out of the algorithm trap, a token that powers a fully self-hosted ecosystem feels like more than a niche experiment. It’s not a coin pretending to be a movement. It’s a protocol designed for a transition that’s already happening. Solaxy Solaxy doesn’t market itself with claims of domination. It isn’t trying to outpace Ethereum or absorb Solana’s traffic. Its purpose is far less dramatic and far more useful: build clean, efficient links between chains that are too often siloed. That goal makes it easy to overlook and easy to underestimate. But it’s precisely this utility-first approach that could carry it through the kind of longer, steadier bull market many now expect. At the technical level, Solaxy serves as a high-throughput Layer 2 capable of routing value between networks that often struggle to communicate directly. In practice, this means fewer bottlenecks, lower costs, and a smoother user experience across ecosystems. For developers, this opens the door to applications that no longer need to bet on one chain’s future. For token holders, it creates staking and liquidity options that are both competitive and flexible. These functions matter more in a market driven by practical adoption than speculative bursts. As major funds and infrastructure players prepare for a multi-year upcycle, they’re gravitating toward tools that solve problems instead of chasing trends. Solaxy has already launched its staking program, issued its native token, and begun expanding support for new dApps. It doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel. It just needs to keep building smoother roads across fragmented territory. In a cycle where institutional interest is growing but still cautious, projects like Solaxy offer something rare: quiet relevance and technical endurance. BTC Bull Plenty of tokens talk about “community,” but BTC Bull hardwires it into the product. Its model is built around a simple but effective mechanism: as Bitcoin crosses certain price levels, token holders receive automatic rewards. Each milestone triggers a distribution event. There’s no guessing, no lotteries, and no passive waiting. It’s a token built to move with Bitcoin, not in its shadow. This gives BTC Bull a very specific kind of utility. It allows users to ride Bitcoin’s strength in real time, turning price milestones into scheduled moments of shared upside. But it doesn’t stop there. Every airdrop is paired with a burn, steadily reducing the total supply. Over time, this dynamic creates an incentive loop that rewards early adoption, long holding periods, and continued engagement. What makes this interesting in the current market is how well it fits with the evolving mood of crypto investors. Institutions may be buying Bitcoin in record quantities, but retail investors are looking for ways to connect with that movement without chasing risky leverage or speculative bets. BTC Bull offers an answer. It’s not trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s giving everyday users a structured way to benefit from its growth. In a market where many projects still rely on narrative momentum, BTC Bull’s structure speaks for itself. It reacts to real price events and rewards real participation. That’s enough to make it relevant and perhaps more resilient as the cycle matures. Snorter At first glance, Snorter looks like another internet joke minted onto a blockchain. It’s named after a pig, branded like a parody, and talks more like a meme than a protocol. But dig a little deeper and it becomes clear why this project has caught the attention of early buyers who aren’t just here for a laugh. Snorter is doing what so many meme tokens fail to even attempt: backing its popularity with actual functionality. The team has introduced utility that stretches far beyond the typical community token playbook. Holders can stake their SNORT tokens for rewards, but the staking model is tied to both participation and engagement. This means that the more active the community, the better the reward dynamics. There’s also a built-in deflationary system designed to gradually reduce supply based on on-chain activity, creating stronger alignment between users and token health over time. What’s interesting is how Snorter positions itself during a market phase where major players are becoming more serious. Popular crypto channels including 99Bitcoins have covered the project as one of the top potential picks to consider this season. It makes sense, as the project uses humor to draw attention, but doesn’t rely on it to survive. Behind the branding is a smart contract system designed to keep the project breathing through multiple market cycles, with mechanisms that adapt to liquidity shifts, user participation, and staking depth. In a cycle that could stretch longer than usual, projects like Snorter stand a better chance than they seem to at first. It's funny on the surface, but what it’s building isn’t a joke. Conclusion When the charts zoom out and the noise clears, it’s rarely the loudest tokens that last. Projects with clear roles, built-in utility, and quiet confidence tend to hold ground while others churn in and out of relevance. If this really is the beginning of a longer, stronger bull market, as many believe, the most worthwhile investment bets may not be the ones making headlines but the ones working on utility and investors-oriented solutions, preparing to survive the years that follow.
