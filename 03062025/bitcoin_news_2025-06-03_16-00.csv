2025-06-03T13:53:49,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: AI-Fueled Energy Crisis Could Trigger $250K BTC Boom","The US session Bitcoin price is accelerating, recently hitting an intraday high of $106,500 before consolidating at $105,336, up 0.83% in the last 24 hours. It’s all about the sentiment shift, as concerns about Bitcoin’s energy consumption are easing in light of the growing energy demands of artificial intelligence (AI). With institutional buying, we might see a run to $250,000. AI’s Energy Appetite Shifts Spotlight From Bitcoin For years, Bitcoin has faced criticism over its energy consumption, which amounts to around 176 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually. However, a recent study in Joule projects that AI could soon overshadow Bitcoin’s impact, with predictions that AI may consume 49% of global data center electricity by 2025, totaling approximately 201 TWh per year. New analysis by Alex de Vries-Gao predicts that by late 2025, AI’s power consumption will approach half of all global data center energy use — meaning AI could soon outpace Bitcoin mining! #AI #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/jIfhjLrktm — YomirGo (@YomirGo) June 3, 2025 Industry experts, such as Alex de Vries-Gao , note that AI’s unchecked growth is driven by big tech firms rapidly expanding their infrastructure without complete transparency on energy usage. Nvidia alone has been absorbing nearly 48% of Taiwan Semiconductor’s chip packaging capacity, underscoring the surge in demand for AI hardware. Elon Musk’s xAI initiative aims to create one of the world’s largest AI superclusters, intensifying concerns about energy demands. This shift in focus from Bitcoin’s energy use to AI’s consumption has improved Bitcoin’s environmental perception among investors, helping it regain momentum. Institutional Confidence Drives Bullish Outlook; Bitcoin Supported? Adding fuel to Bitcoin’s rally is The Blockchain Group’s recent acquisition of 624 BTC worth $68.7 million, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC, valued at over $106 million. The company plans to acquire 260,000 BTC by 2033, reflecting robust institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. JUST IN PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY THE BLOCKCHAIN GROUP BUYS 624 #BITCOIN FOR €60.2 MILLION (~$64.6M). BITCOIN IS UNSTOPPABLE! pic.twitter.com/xiOlPTPa5E — Rishabh Pande (@RishabhPande28) June 3, 2025 Year-to-date BTC yield: 1,097% ALTBG stock performance: +168% (monthly), +873% (YTD) Such strong institutional backing highlights the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a serious long-term investment, with potential as a hedge against economic volatility. Bitcoin Technical Setup Points to $250K Potential Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC has formed a tightening symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart, with dynamic support from the 50-period exponential moving average (EMA) near $105,295. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick patterns, including doji and spinning tops, suggest indecision and potential reversal, while the MACD is turning bullish with an impending crossover. Entry: Buy above $106,571 on confirmation. Target: $108,933, with a potential upside to $250K as catalysts align. Stop-loss: Below $105,215 to manage risk. This unique combination of AI’s energy impact, improved sentiment, and rising institutional interest presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s next significant move toward $250,000. BTC Bull Token Presale Nears $7.8M Cap as 61% APY Staking Attracts Investors With BTC/USD trading near $105K, attention is rapidly shifting to altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . As of today, the presale has raised $6,772,528.93 out of a $7,789,647 cap, with just over $1 million left before the next price hike. BTC-Pegged Rewards and Supply Burns Drive Scarcity BTC Bull Token’s innovative mechanism ties rewards directly to Bitcoin’s price. Here’s how it works: BTC Airdrops: Token holders receive BTC rewards, with presale participants enjoying priority. Supply Reductions: For every $50,000 increase in BTC’s price, a portion of $BTCBULL is burned, reducing overall supply and supporting token value. Current Token Price: $0.002545, poised to rise as the cap nears. This approach blends dynamic rewards with built-in scarcity, aligning $BTCBULL’s value with Bitcoin’s performance. 61% APY Staking Pool Without Lockups BTC Bull Token’s staking pool offers an enticing 61% APY, currently holding 1,731,936,103 $BTCBULL. The key benefits include: No Lockups or Fees: Investors can stake and unstake their tokens freely without incurring penalties. Full Liquidity: Access funds anytime, unlike typical DeFi lockups. Consistent Yields: Passive income for token holders, independent of market conditions. This structure appeals to both seasoned DeFi investors and newcomers seeking yield without complex terms. Momentum Builds Ahead of Presale Cap With less than $1 million left before the presale closes, buyers are moving fast. BTCBULL’s combination of BTC-tied rewards, strategic burns, and high-yield staking is driving participation. The presale offers an opportunity to enter before the subsequent price increase, especially as BTC’s price action intensifies. Key Highlights: USDT Raised: $6,772,528.93 / $7,789,647 Token Price: $0.002545 Total Staking Pool: 1.73 billion $BTCBULL Staking APY: ~61% BTCBULL Token’s innovative model is attracting attention as it nears its hard cap. The presale window is closing quickly, making this the last chance to secure the current price before the subsequent price increase.

2025-06-03T13:52:44,"Altcoin season builds as Ethereum outpaces Bitcoin with ETF inflows: MEXC","Ethereum is leading Bitcoin in ETF flows post-Pectra upgrade, suggesting a coming altcoin season, says Tracy Jin of MEXC. Bitcoin’s (BTC) grip on the crypto market may soon loosen. On Tuesday, June 3, MEXC COO Tracy Jin shared her analysis with crypto.news, highlighting significant signs of an upcoming altcoin season. Notably, Jin explains that Ethereum’s (ETH) performance following the Pectra upgrade is showing strong momentum. “Ethereum is decisively leading the charge for transition and capital rotation into altcoins in this current market cycle, and other coins like XMR, ENA, HYPE, AAVE, and ARB are following suit, posting more than 5% gains in contrast to BTC’s muted 0.6% gain during Tuesday’s recovery rally,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. You might also like: Here’s why we won’t see altcoin season any time soon, according to analysts Jin also emphasized that exchange-traded fund flows have recently tilted decisively in Ethereum’s favor. Specifically, Ethereum ETFs have recorded an 11-day streak of inflows totaling $630 million. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw three consecutive days of outflows, totaling $1.2 billion. According to Jin, this indicates rising institutional interest in Ethereum, especially in the aftermath of the Pectra upgrade. She notes that more institutions are now considering alternatives to Bitcoin ahead of the next market cycle. You might also like: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is a game changer, staking infrastructure firm P2P.org explains We are not in altcoin season yet, Jin suggests Still, Jin clarifies that the altcoin season has not officially begun. For one, only 27 out of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong at 63.1% . That said, Ethereum has posted modest gains, with its dominance increasing by 2% in May. “While recent altcoin performance has been encouraging, history suggests that the true altseason typically begins when Bitcoin’s dominance starts to diminish, and doesn’t take hold until Bitcoin’s dominance starts to decline more meaningfully,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. For a full-fledged altcoin season to emerge, Jin believes Bitcoin’s dominance must drop more sharply. She suggests this is possible as Bitcoin stabilizes at the psychological level of $100,000. In that case, Ethereum could break through the $2,750 resistance and rally toward $3,200.

2025-06-03T13:50:29,"Meta Won’t Add Bitcoin To Balance Sheet As Shareholders Strongly Reject Treasury Proposal","Shareholders of Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have voted against a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet. According to a May 28 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, an eye-popping 4.9 billion votes were cast in opposition while 3.92 million — a mere 0.08% of the total — supported the proposal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls 61% of the company’s voting power, an April regulatory statement reveals, which could mean that he voted down the idea. The proposal, submitted in January by Bitcoin champion Ethan Peck, representing the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), asked Meta to convert a portion of its $72 billion in excess cash and cash equivalents into the apex crypto to better preserve shareholder value. The measure touted Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and strong past performance compared to bonds, as a more reliable long-term store of value. Peck claimed that the tech giant should treat the largest crypto as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to endure monetary policy uncertainty. He also pointed out that Meta’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable. While Meta doesn’t want to hold crypto on its balance sheet, the firm has previously dipped its toes into blockchain. In June 2019, it unveiled Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That project collapsed in 2022 after unwelcome regulatory scrutiny and internal wrangles, rebranding briefly as Diem before shutting down and selling assets to crypto bank Silvergate . Peck also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon on behalf of the conservative think tank NCPPR. Microsoft shareholders voted against the plan in December, while Amazon shareholders are awaiting a vote on whether to put at least 5% of the company’s assets into Bitcoin. Bitcoin Treasury Frenzy Though Bitcoin treasury proposals were rejected by Meta and Microsoft, global publicly listed companies continue accumulating the flagship crypto. Data tracked by Bitcoin Treasuries shows that over 115 public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, with one of the newest entrants being GameStop. Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads all publicly traded firms with 580,955 BTC , worth over $60 billion, while eight others, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Elon Musk’s Tesla, each hold roughly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/meta-wont-add-bitcoin-to-balance-sheet-as-shareholders-strongly-reject-treasury-proposal/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T13:35:02,"XRP court ruling clarifies crypto status, counters claims by Bitcoin advocates","Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) marked a key turning point last year when Judge Analisa Torres issued a decision on XRP’s legal status. The ruling clarified that retail sales of XRP do not constitute investment contracts, effectively placing them outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. This decision has been pivotal in shaping the regulatory understanding of digital assets, despite ongoing debates from Bitcoin advocates who continue to claim XRP lacks clear classification. Ripple lawyer Bill Morgan has now directly addressed these arguments, asserting that legal clarity has been established where it matters most — in court. bill morgan @Belisarius2020 · Follow There is illogical nonsense being spread about the issue of legal clarity and XRP. The proposition is that XRP lacks legal clarity because no court has ‘classified’ what it is. Bitcoin maxis say Bitcoin has been classified as a commodity but XRP has not been so classified so 4:06 PM · Jun 3, 2025 73 Reply Copy link Read 12 replies XRP retail sales not securities, says Torres ruling Morgan, a pro-Ripple legal analyst, outlined that the core issue in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple was never about labelling XRP itself as a security or commodity, but whether the nature of its sale to investors met the criteria of an investment contract under existing securities law. Judge Torres found that institutional sales of XRP did meet that definition, while retail sales did not. This dual outcome provided a nuanced legal framework that separates XRP’s treatment based on how and to whom it was sold. Morgan explained that US courts do not assign labels to digital assets. Instead, they resolve disputes based on the facts of a case. Therefore, the question of whether XRP is a security or commodity misses the point. The clarity comes from how the court interpreted the law in the context of XRP’s distribution — a distinction often overlooked by critics. Bitcoin classification argument lacks legal grounding Bitcoin supporters — often referred to as Bitcoin Maximalists or “Maxis” — have argued that because XRP has not received a classification from regulatory bodies such as the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), it remains in a legal grey area. They contrast this with Bitcoin’s status as a commodity recognised by both agencies, suggesting this places Bitcoin on firmer regulatory footing. Morgan challenged that logic, stating that classification is not absolute and can vary depending on the legal framework of different countries. For instance, Australian authorities treat Bitcoin as property rather than a commodity. He noted that insisting on a single, universal classification is legally flawed and undermines how the court system functions in the US. In his view, the ruling from Judge Torres has already settled the question of XRP’s legal status for retail sales, and that alone constitutes meaningful clarity. Ripple supports regulatory framework for crypto In addition to the courtroom win, Ripple has also welcomed legislative developments aimed at improving the regulatory environment for digital assets. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty endorsed the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act passed in the US last week, which aims to provide clearer rules for the classification and regulation of cryptocurrencies. Morgan echoed the sentiment, adding that clarity should come through legal outcomes rather than political declarations or market assumptions. He maintained that the court ruling on XRP offers a strong precedent for how digital asset transactions should be assessed going forward. Rather than fixating on labels, he said, regulators and industry participants should focus on how assets are used and sold in practice. In a symbolic gesture of reconciliation, Ripple co-founder Brad Garlinghouse donated the “Skull of Satoshi” artwork — often seen as a satirical emblem of crypto culture — to the Bitcoin community. While largely symbolic, the move appeared to aim at diffusing hostilities between supporters of rival blockchain platforms following years of animosity.

Strategy announced STRD, a new perpetual preferred stock, which will be sold to selected investors in an IPO. The new shares will be part of the financing tools for additional BTC acquisitions. BREAKING: Strategy launches $STRD , its third preferred stock this year. Offering a 10% perpetual dividend and 6× Bitcoin backing—via IPO to select investors. pic.twitter.com/kSG6s6Oh52 — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) June 3, 2025 Stride (STRD) is the third offering, happening in what Strategy considers a strong market environment. The new asset will tap the services of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Moelis & Company and TD Securities for its launch and distribution. The IPO happens at a time when all Strategy assets are putting on strong performances, including the MSTR common stock, as well as previous preferred assets STRF and STRK. The decision to add another preferred type of shares follows the outperformance of Strategy compared to other technical stocks. Strategy to offer dividends on STRD Strategy (MSTR, STRF, STRK) announced its plans to sell 2.5M of the new preferred STRD shares. Depending on market conditions and approval, Strategy will sell 10% Series A preferred stock with the STRD ticker. The proceeds from the sale will go toward the company’s regular BTC purchases , as well as general corporate purchases and working capital. The preferred stock sale will give some momentum to the company’s BTC purchases, though in the past weeks, the buying was mostly financed with MSTR sales and smaller placements of STRK. The latest BTC purchase was financed with STRF and STRK proceeds. STRD will carry non-mandatory dividends at a 10% yearly rate, after approval by the board of directors. If the board declares a dividend, STRD will observe payment periods on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year. The first dividend payment period will start on September 30. The STRD dividends will be non-cumulative and will not accrue additional interest or rewards. The dividends will be payable fully in cash. The STRD shares can accrue over 10% in dividends during favorable conditions. Strategy also reserves the right to redeem all STRD shares if the amount of shares outstanding is less than 25% of the total supply. In that case, Strategy has a right to a full redemption, but no partial purchases. The liquidation price of STRD is set at $100, and holders can also demand repurchase in the case of unusual events and unfavorable market conditions. The STRD asset carries a higher risk Compared to STRF and STRK, the new STRD asset is higher-risk. The priority in case of liquidation will be above common stock holders, but below STRK. The new STRD shares will carry no BTC upside. Strategy currently carries 0.00209 BTC per share, though not all investors will have a claim on that reserve in the case of unfavorable market events. The sale is considered a boost in the short term, especially for investors seeking passive income. However, the non-cumulative, non-mandatory dividends are seen as risky, in addition to exposure in the case of a bear market.

2025-06-03T13:27:41,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell: Crypto Needs Regulation, No Rate Cuts Ahead","The post Fed Chair Jerome Powell: Crypto Needs Regulation, No Rate Cuts Ahead appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The financial world is buzzing after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a high-stakes speech that tackled two hot-button issues – crypto regulation and interest rates. His message is that the U.S. needs clear rules for digital assets, and don’t expect rate cuts anytime soon. Speaking at the Fed’s Division of International Finance 75th Anniversary Conference in Washington on Monday, Powell addressed the growing demand for regulatory clarity in crypto and the persistent pressure of inflation. His remarks struck a careful balance between caution and openness, offering key signals for both crypto enthusiasts and market watchers. On June 2, 2025, Chair Powell delivered opening remarks at the @federalreserve ’s International Finance Division 75th Anniversary Conference: https://t.co/c2WNQchiFj pic.twitter.com/j2nd2pobgo — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) June 2, 2025 Crypto Chaos Needs Control, Says Powell Powell spoke plainly: the crypto market, which is shaken by deception and volatility, requires clear regulation. He went for thorough regulations to safeguard investors. As digital assets like stablecoins and decentralized platforms become more mainstream, agencies like the SEC and CFTC continue to battle over regulatory jurisdiction. Powell emphasized that clear rules would help legitimize crypto, drive out bad actors, and restore trust among both institutional and retail investors. His comments come at a pivotal time for the digital asset space, as it sees more adoption. No Rate Cuts on the Horizon Turning to monetary policy , Powell cooled hopes for an imminent interest rate cut. Despite earlier optimism, the Fed is holding firm as inflation remains above its target. Powell made it clear: rate cuts are off the table until there’s real, sustained progress. Adding to that cautious tone, the OECD recently revised its economic outlook, projecting U.S. GDP growth to slow from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. It also flagged potential risks tied to President Trump’s proposed tariffs, warning these could add further strain on economic growth and policy clarity. Bitcoin Bounces, But Risks Linger Markets responded quickly to Powell’s remarks. After slipping below $103,000 over the weekend, Bitcoin bounced back to $105,455 on June 3, up 1.21%. While the Fed Chair’s balanced approach offered short-term relief, crypto traders remain cautious. Global uncertainty – from inflation to geopolitical tensions – continues to weigh heavily on risk assets, including digital currencies. Final Take: Steady Hands in Shaky Times Powell’s speech didn’t deliver surprises, but it did offer direction. His focus on regulatory transparency for crypto and a steady hand on monetary policy provides a roadmap for investors navigating a volatile environment. As the Fed holds its ground on rates and Washington inches toward clearer crypto rules, the next few months could prove decisive. For now, markets remain on edge.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/fed-chair-jerome-powell-crypto-needs-regulation-no-rate-cuts-ahead/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T13:27:08,"Bitcoin Hits New Record Just Two Weeks Ago! So When Will the Big Altcoin Season Begin? Analysis Firm Explains!","While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) was running from record to record, the expected rally in altcoins including Ethereum (ETH) never came. While most altcoins, especially Ethereum, are still far from their previous ATHs, cryptocurrency analysis platform Alphractal said that current data suggests that the altcoin season could soon begin. At this point, according to Alphractal, data suggests that altcoins could soon gain momentum and overtake Bitcoin’s dominance. Altcoin Dominance Signals! Alphractal said that both Bitcoin and altcoin dominance are approaching the critical threshold that could trigger a new altcoin rally. Accordingly, Bitcoin dominance has peaked at over 64% and in the past, when Bitcoin dominance started to fall from its peak, altcoins experienced a massive rally, sometimes as much as 50 times. Alpharactal said the data also showed that altcoin dominance, which excludes stablecoins like USDT and USDC, has fallen to 28.4%, a figure that has historically been a crucial support area and points to a possible rally. At this point, the data generally suggests that when altcoin dominance is around 24% to 25.3%, it’s a sign that altcoins are getting ready to rally again. And now that altcoin dominance is approaching this support level again, altcoins could be poised for another big rally. Alphractal also examined the altcoin dominance excluding Ethereum and stablecoins and said it was also 18.92%. Stating that this figure is very close to 18%, which has been a strong support level for many years, the analysis company said that when this level was reached in the past, Bitcoin dominance often fell and altcoins experienced a new rally. “1-Altcoin Dominance (excluding all Stablecoins) 2-Altcoin Dominance (excluding ETH and all Stablecoins) …..While we cannot claim that these support levels alone confirm the start of an Altcoin Season, they are highly relevant signals that have a strong probability of recurrence and present meaningful opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.” Is a Good Opportunity for Altcoins About to Happen?

2025-06-03T13:06:43,"Circle to Increase Stablecoin IPO to $7.2B: Why Best Wallet Token Could Pump","With plans to list on the NYSE, stablecoin giant Circle has upsized its original IPO to a valuation of $7.2B. This signals significant momentum in the stablecoin market and strong investor appetite for crypto firms. Circle is the issuing company behind $USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin, after Tether. The New York-based fintech launched its IPO on May 27. Aiming to raise $624M and targeting a valuation of up to $6.7B, it initially planned to offer 24M shares of its Class A common stock, with a price range of $24 to $26 per share. How will this reflect on the growing crypto market, and why would altcoins like Best Wallet Token be best positioned to leverage this potential? Let’s discuss that below. What Is Circle Doing? From a target of $624M, Circle has upped the size and price range of its upcoming IPO. It now wants to raise up to $896M by selling 32M shares, each valued at $27 to $28. This pushes Circle’s estimated valuation from $6.71B to $7.2B. This comes after Circle competitor Ripple reportedly made a $4B to $5B acquisition offer, which was declined, according to Bloomberg . The latest move by Circle marks a pivotal moment, particularly as the stablecoin market stands to gain significantly from the upcoming US legislation. The GENIUS Act , which is a bipartisan bill that focuses on stablecoin regulation, continues to gain traction in the US Senate, and is widely expected to be passed into legislation. An amended version of the bill is set to head back to the Senate for final floor debate. However, there are fears that the addition of two unrelated credit card amendments could derail its progress, by dragging the debate into unrelated credit card issues . This has prompted leaders of the Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, DeFi Education Fund, and the Digital Chamber to issue a joint statement . It calls for ‘lawmakers to remain committed to its central goal: providing a targeted and comprehensive approach to stablecoin oversight.’ Are Stablecoins The Future? Stablecoins are indeed gaining traction in traditional finance, having cemented themselves as the foundation of crypto markets. The sector’s total market cap now stands at $252B, with $61B of that held by Circle’s $USDC. A report by Citi projects that the total supply of stablecoins could reach $1.6T by 2030 in a base case (neither bullish nor bearish). Its bull case puts that figure at $3.7B. With that increased adoption comes the need for crypto wallets. And that puts the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) in a very strong position. What Can Stablecoins Do For $BEST? There’s a good chance that the rise of stablecoins will spotlight Best Wallet and its native token, $BEST. The non-custodial hot crypto wallet has plans to dominate the global market by the end of next year, after all. The crypto wallet market, by the way, is on track to be valued at $32.0B by 2030. That’s a CAGR of 23.5%. Best Wallet is free to download and easy to use, which makes it ideal for all types of crypto investors. It’s also backed by Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP technology . And with plans to support over 50+ blockchains and thousands of cryptocurrencies, it’s establishing its place among the best mobile crypto wallets on the market. Reasons To Invest In $BEST Wanting to be the market leader is not the same as actually being one. But that’s where the $BEST comes in. It’s set to power Best Wallet’s already impressive functionality and drive its mission to being number one. Holding $BEST comes with exclusive perks too. These include higher staking rewards courtesy of a staking aggregator and lower transaction fees across the Best Wallet ecosystem. And in a market first, $BEST holders also have exclusive early-bird access to the best presales . The Best Wallet Token is among those top new cryptos on presale. It was launched at the end of last year and strong investor interest has already seen close to $13M being raised. After the presale ends, $BEST will list on DEXs, closely followed by CEXs. Those listings will likely pump the $BEST price. Our $BEST price prediction takes a closer look at this and is worth a read. Add to the equation the rapidly growing adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets, and the Best Wallet Token could pump far into the future. That makes $BEST one of the best altcoins to buy now for potentially explosive gains. $BEST is currently priced at $0.025125 with a dynamic staking rate – for additional rewards – of 110%. Check out our guide to buying $BEST to invest in one of this year’s hottest cryptos. Best Case Scenario The demand for stablecoins is rapidly growing. Circle’s upsized IPO is a case in point. And the ripple effect of that will be a bigger demand for non-custodial crypto wallets. And that puts $BEST in a great position to pump. The crypto market is unpredictable, though.

2025-06-03T13:00:05,"Russian banks mull crypto payments for 50 million tons of grain exports","Russian bank RSHB and the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) are considering accepting cryptocurrency as payment for the country’s massive grain exports expected to approach 50 million tons this season. According to a bank official, cryptocurrencies can serve as an alternative method for settlements in grain trade. Russia is a global leader in this market despite restrictions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine, another major grain exporter. Sanctioned Russian agro bank mulls taking crypto for grain Russian Agricultural Bank, also known as Rosselkhozbank (RSHB), has pitched the idea of accepting crypto payments for Russia’s wheat and other grain exports during a recent industry event held in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi. This year’s edition of the Russian Grain Forum gathered hundreds of participants, from large producers and traders to representatives of Russia’s main commodities exchange and central bank. During a business breakfast, First Deputy Chair of the RSHB Board Irina Zhachkina stated: “We believe that cryptocurrencies can be a convenient alternative instrument, and at the moment, together with the Bank of Russia and all interested parties, we are working on the possibility of using cryptocurrency instruments for settlements in grain trading.” Attendees emphasized the importance of cooperation between entities involved in the export of Russian grain in order to reduce logistics costs, especially in regard to niche crops where volumes are smaller, but margins are growing. The opportunities presented by digital assets were also discussed. Russian companies have been reportedly using cryptocurrencies, stablecoins in particular, to circumvent Western sanctions punishing Moscow for its aggression against Ukraine . While the war has caused disruptions in Ukrainian grain exports, Russia has managed to establish itself as a major producer and exporter despite restrictions that have limited both its trading capabilities and access to global finances. The Russian Federation is expected to sell 49.5 million tonnes of grain abroad in the 2024-2025 agricultural year, according to a forecast presented by the head of the Rusagrotrans analytical center, Igor Pavensky, during a grain forum in Dubai this past February. The total for the period between last June and July, this year, which includes around 42 million tonnes of wheat, may reach 52.6 million tonnes if legumes are added to the mix, the Interfax news agency reported at the time. Rosselkhozbank is fully state-owned, with all of its shares controlled by the Federal Agency for State Property Management. It’s the sixth largest Russian bank, according to the Interfax-100 ranking for the first quarter of 2025. RSHB has been placed under sanctions by both the European Union and the United States since 2022. As a result, the banking institution lost access to the international payment system SWIFT and its assets in the EU were frozen, Russian media reports recalled. The sanctions also affected Russia’s ability to ship grain to foreign markets. As per the Rosselkhozbank’s own numbers, nearly 80 Russian cargo vessels have been banned from entering European ports, even for servicing purposes. Russia drafting plan to launch BRICS grain exchange Meanwhile, a high-ranking government official unveiled that the executive power in Moscow is currently developing a blueprint for the establishment of a grain exchange within BRICS , the intergovernmental organization viewed as posing a challenge to the West, of which Russia is a founding member. Speaking during the same agribusiness forum in Sochi, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Patrushev explained: “International cooperation is an important instrument. As you are aware, BRICS countries backed Russia’s proposal to create their own grain exchange. The concept that will be presented to the partners is being elaborated at present at the government level.” The initiative is aimed at strengthening food sovereignty of the association’s member states and lowering dependence on Western trading platforms, Patrushev was also quoted as stating by the official Russian Tass news agency.

2025-06-03T12:55:09,"Chainlink Price Prediction Expert Confession: ‘I’ve Invested 30% of My Portfolio in Bitcoin Solaris – Here’s Why’","The post Chainlink Price Prediction Expert Confession: ‘I’ve Invested 30% of My Portfolio in Bitcoin Solaris – Here’s Why’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As someone who’s made a career out of crypto analysis, I’ve always kept a close eye on macro signals. Chainlink (LINK) was no exception. With strong institutional momentum, backed by SWIFT, JPMorgan, and the rollout of CCIP across Solana, its fundamentals looked promising. But when LINK stalled around the $14 mark and failed to decisively break resistance, I realized something was off. Institutional adoption was there, but the growth potential felt… limited. That’s when I started paying attention to Bitcoin Solaris. Chainlink Is Solid—But Bitcoin Solaris Hits Different Chainlink’s CCIP update is a major leap forward, unlocking billions in cross-chain liquidity. But from a pure investor standpoint, it’s a late-stage play. It’s established, it’s respected—but it’s no longer “early.” That’s where Bitcoin Solaris flipped the script for me. It didn’t just look promising—it felt like discovering Ethereum in 2016 or Solana in 2020. It wasn’t on everyone’s radar yet, but it had the structure, scalability, and momentum to redefine what an early-stage investment looks like. Why I Moved 30% of My Crypto Portfolio into BTC-S Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just another altcoin with a cool name. It’s engineered from the ground up to correct everything that’s broken with bloated chains, overhyped tokens, and zero-utility ecosystems. Here’s what made me shift a third of my portfolio: Hybrid Consensus System: The Base Layer leverages Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) for decentralized security, while the Application Layer utilizes Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) for blazing-fast speed. 10,000+ TPS Throughput: This is not a theoretical claim. It’s achieved using its layered structure, and finality hits in just 2 seconds. Mobile Mining Ready: With the upcoming Solaris Nova App, anyone can mine BTC-S right from their phone. Not “someday”—it’s already in rollout plans. Built-In Scarcity: Fixed supply of 21 million tokens. No inflationary nonsense. Just clean, transparent economics. Real Utility: BTC-S supports smart contracts, on-chain apps, and real-world use cases beyond hype. Add to that the fact that it’s been fully audited by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and with a KYC-verified team, I had no reason not to trust it. What Bitcoin Solaris Does That Chainlink Can’t (Yet) To give you context, here’s how I stack them side-by-side: Feature Chainlink Bitcoin Solaris Institutional Adoption Strong (SWIFT, JPMorgan, etc.) Emerging with grassroots credibility Speed & Scalability Moderate TPS 10,000+ TPS with 2-second finality Mining & Participation None Mobile, desktop & browser mining Consensus Mechanism Not applicable (oracle network) Dual-consensus: PoW + PoC & PoH + PoT Token Supply 1 billion LINK Fixed 21 million BTC-S Retail Accessibility Moderate Designed for everyday users Chainlink is an oracle. Bitcoin Solaris is an ecosystem. That’s the difference. The Presale Momentum Is Too Strong to Ignore Right now, BTC-S is in Phase 6 of its presale. Price: $6. Next stop? $7. With a launch price of $20 on the horizon, and only around 8 weeks left in one of crypto’s shortest presales ever, the momentum is unmistakable. Over 11,000+ users have already joined. More than $1.8M has been raised. If you’re reading this, you’re still early—but the window is closing. The Blockchain Revolution Just Went Mobile—Explore BTC-S Now My Personal Bet—and Why It’s Not Too Late for You I’ve analyzed hundreds of projects. Most fail not because of tech, but because of execution. Bitcoin Solaris is executing. From its architecture to its mobile-first accessibility, everything screams readiness. And that’s why 30% of my portfolio is now parked here. It’s not an emotional decision. It’s math, logic, and timing. If you’ve ever looked back and thought, “I should’ve bought Bitcoin under $100,” or “I missed Ethereum at $5,” this might be your chance to reset the clock. Final Thought: Don’t Let Familiarity Be Your Enemy Crypto loves to reward the early. It’s not always about what’s popular. It’s about what’s next. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a competitor to Chainlink—it’s a next-stage opportunity. A new playbook for wealth building, designed for those who missed the first waves. Don’t let the noise distract you from the quiet rise happening right now.

2025-06-03T12:54:28,"Here’s how Bitcoin will drop to $40,000, according to commodity strategist","Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone has warned that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could potentially fall to $40,000 despite currently trading above $100,000. McGlone tied his bearish outlook to broader macroeconomic trends, particularly the risk of deflation and a long-delayed recession that could weigh heavily on risk assets like Bitcoin, he said in an X post on June 3. He pointed to a recent peak in the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio in May, suggesting it may have topped out, especially if U.S. equity markets begin to decline. Bitcoin to gold ratio. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence “Bitcoin $40,000, Gold $4,000; Inflation vs. Deflation, Recession – The languishing price of Bitcoin vs. gold in 2025 may reflect anticipation of a typical cycle where deflation follows inflation,” he said. The ratio, which recently hovered around 33, could narrow significantly if gold strengthens and Bitcoin weakens, a scenario McGlone views as increasingly likely. While markets largely shrugged off recession fears in 2023, McGlone believes the economic downturn was postponed. Gold and S&P 500 price target In this case, investors may turn to traditional safe havens like gold if the economy contracts and the S&P 500 falls toward the 4,000 level. Therefore, gold could surge to $4,000 an ounce, and the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio could drop to around 10, implying a BTC price near $40,000. Such a decline would mark a 62% drop from its current price of $105,387. Bitcoin one-day price chart. Source: Finbold As Finbold reported , McGlone has emphasized the evolving relationship between Bitcoin and gold. He noted that gold’s recent outperformance of the S&P 500, despite competition from Bitcoin, could signal the early stages of a broader market correction. Notably, amid ongoing market uncertainty, including President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, gold has reached new highs while the stock market has experienced significant volatility. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has remained in consolidation above $100,000, recently hitting a record high of over $111,000.

2025-06-03T12:47:56,"Red alert: Cardano price at risk of crashing despite hitting transaction milestone","Cardano price remained in a tight range on Tuesday, June 3, even after the layer-1 network crossed a 110 million transaction milestone. Cardano ( ADA ) was trading at $0.6920, down 20% from its highest point in May. It is also hovering near its lowest level since May 8. ADA price wavered even as on-chain data shows that the network finally crossed the 110 million milestone in total transactions since inception. It handled over 31,000 transactions on Monday, up from 27,000 a day earlier. The rising transactions are a sign that the network is becoming more active, which is typically seen as bullish. Separate data from Santiment shows that the number of Cardano holders has jumped to 4.49 million, up from 4.46 million in May and 4.4 million in January.

These numbers suggest that Cardano is attracting users ahead of the NIGHT and DUSK airdrops. However, additional data shows that Cardano has lagged behind other layer-1 and layer-2 chains. For example, while Cardano has just crossed the 110 million transaction level, the recently launched Unichain has already processed 73.4 million. Berachain, another recently launched chain, has handled 117 million transactions in the past 12 months. Cardano also trails other chains on additional metrics. For instance, DEX protocols on its network have handled over $109.3 million in the past 30 days, while Unichain and Sonic have processed $12 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, over the same period. Cardano price technical analysis points to a deeper dive ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ADA price has dropped significantly in the past few weeks. This decline followed the formation of a double-top pattern at $0.8405. It has since fallen below the neckline at $0.7110, its lowest level on May 19. The coin has also formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have crossed each other, typically a strong bearish signal. Cardano has also formed a bearish flag chart pattern, consisting of a vertical line and a rectangle.

2025-06-03T12:45:42,"Ethereum takes off as Bitcoin ETFs extend slide with $268M outflow","US Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) saw a $268 million outflow, while Ethereum-linked ETFs picked up the pace. Institutional appetite for Bitcoin cooled on Monday as BTC ETFs marked the third straight day of capital pullback. This drawdown signals a short-term dip in confidence among large players. The global digital assets market recorded a marginal surge over the last day as Bitcoin consolidated around the $105,000 level, stuck in a tight range that has dulled bullish momentum. The fear and greed index depicts that investors’ sentiment stood “Neutral” for now after being greedy for a couple of months. Wall Street swaps Bitcoin for Ether According to data , BlackRock’s IBIT led the way in withdrawals, posting $130.4 million of outflows, while ARK’s ARKB remained second in line with almost $74 million in outflows. However, IBIT’s cumulative inflow still stands strong at $48.44 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC saw $50.11 million and $16.47 million withdrawn from the funds, respectively. BTC ETFs recorded a net outflow of over $616.22 million on May 30. This fallback in ETF flows can be seen as a textbook response to price stagnation. Institutions often rotate capital during these consolidation phases, either into altcoins or risk-off assets. Bitcoin price surged marginally over the past day, meanwhile, it is still down by 4% over the past 7 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $105,269 at the press time with a trading volume of $43.88 billion. But while Bitcoin stalls, Ethereum is catching fire. 🚨 Institutional outflows persist — but is the tide turning? A third consecutive day of outflows was recorded, totaling $267.5M — slightly lower than the previous two days. Could this signal a slowdown in selling pressure? 👀 pic.twitter.com/y3p999Szg3 — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) June 3, 2025 ETH ETFs reported $78.17 million in net inflows on Monday. This extends their green streak to 11 consecutive trading days. Over the past week, Ether-linked investment products have attracted $321 million, their biggest haul since December. Data shows that BlackRock’s ETHA recorded $48.40 million of inflow in the last trading session. Its cumulative inflow stood at $4.65 billion. Fidelity’s FETH was the only other ETH-linked ETF that saw inflow. It posted an inflow of almost $30 million for the day. Ethereum price surged by more than 5% in the last 24 hours, leading the way for the altcoins. ETH surged to $2,650.18 before retracing slightly to around $2,600. Ether is trading at an average price of $2,607 as of press time. ARKB slashes share price The diverging flows between BTC and ETH ETFs are reflecting a shifting institutional narrative. As Bitcoin consolidates under heavy resistance, Ethereum is being viewed as a high-conviction bet. Amid all the uncertainty. ARK 21Shares US announced that it will execute a 3-for-1 share split of its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). This will be done to make shares more affordable and accessible, especially for retail investors. It will come into effect from June 16 at market opening. It added that the share split won’t affect the ETF’s NAV, ticker, or investment strategy, but it will reduce the per-share price to a third of its current level. ARKB closed Monday at $104.25, up nearly 27% this quarter. With Bitcoin ETFs pulling in $5.25 billion in May alone, and gold ETFs bleeding out, ARKB’s move could further solidify its position as a vehicle for both retail and institutional exposure to digital gold.

2025-06-03T12:36:27,"Bitcoin: Record Chase Will Continue","Summary Bitcoin surged from $74,434 to $112,000 by May 21, 2025, but pulled back to $103,127. Weekly charts target $125,000–130,000; daily charts show consolidation with support at $97,500–103,000. The global bond crisis and U.S. debt boost Bitcoin's appeal; sentiment and seasonality favor gains until mid-June. MicroStrategy's $84B Bitcoin plan drives prices but risks future losses. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) together with all those Bitcoin spot ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , BITO , ARKB , BITB , HODL , BRRR , EZBC , BITX and BTCW as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) has staged a stunning recovery since its April 6th, 2025, low of USD 74,434, surging past the USD 100,000 milestone to hit a new all-time high of USD 112,000 by May 21st. Driven by strong inflows into Bitcoin Spot ETFs, increasing institutional acceptance, and a supportive U.S. political climate under Donald Trump, the rally has been impressive. However, over the last few days, momentum has slowed down and Bitcoin has pulled back to around USD 103,000ish. Overall, Bitcoin is still holding comfortably above the important USD 100,000 mark, though. Review Since the panic low on April 6th, 2025, at USD 74,434, Bitcoin initially surged to around USD 86,000. This was followed by a week of sideways movement before another upward push propelled prices into the USD 93,000 to USD 97,000 range. A subsequent week-long consolidation preceded Bitcoin breaking through the psychological USD 100,000 barrier. Over the next 12 days, prices stabilized well above this level. Finally, on Wednesday, May 21st, Bitcoin broke out to a new all-time high. The upward momentum continued steadily, with the new peak now at USD 112,000. Due to the temporarily declining stock markets, Bitcoin lost its upward trajectory, however. Even though still trading comfortably above the psychological level of USD 100,000, Bitcoin has dropped back to USD 103,127 over the last 10 days. This well-deserved rest should lay the foundation for the next advance towards new all time-highs. Overall, the two-and-a-half-month correction in early April, when Bitcoin briefly fell below USD 75,000 amid collapsing stock markets, appears in hindsight to have been a healthy breather, as anticipated. The current rally is fueled by strong capital inflows into Bitcoin Spot ETFs, growing institutional adoption, and positive political signals, particularly from the crypto-friendly stance of the U.S. government under Donald Trump. Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US Dollar Weekly Chart: Price Target Around USD 125,000 to USD 130,000 Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of June 1st, 2025. (TradingView) The return to the neckline at approximately USD 75,000 and the strong rally over the past seven weeks have reaffirmed the large cup-and-handle formation on the weekly chart. This suggests Bitcoin is on track to reach our second price target for this formation, in the range of approximately USD 125,000 to USD 130,000. Given the recent dynamic upward movement and new all-time highs, this target could be achieved within the next four weeks already. However, we do not expect significant further price increases before the summer lull. Should Bitcoin have topped out already, your price target has to be postponed towards the 3rd or 4th quarter, though. The weekly Stochastic indicator is already in overbought territory, while the bulls still need to push the upper Bollinger Band (currently at USD 111,294) higher. Short-term consolidations or sharp but temporary pullbacks remain possible, as the bulls still have considerable work ahead. Overall, the weekly chart remains bullish despite being overbought. In fact, it is still pointing to a continuation of the upward trend toward USD 125,000 to USD 130,000. Only if the stock markets, which are closely correlated with Bitcoin, weaken again would a sustained drop below the psychological USD 100,000 mark call our optimistic outlook into question. Daily Chart: Short-Lived Consolidation above USD 100,000 Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of June 1st, 2025. (TradingView) On the daily chart, once the Stochastic oscillator had lost its embedded status on Friday 23rd of May, a short-term pullback started. So far, Bitcoin has pulled back towards USD 103,127. Our maximum price target for this healthy but probably short-lived pullback lies between approximately USD 103,000 and USD 97,500, as the rapidly rising 50-day moving average (USD 98,580) is already nearing current price levels. The lower daily Bollinger Band (USD 101,466) might stop the bears soon. Below that, the next strong support is the rising 200-day moving average (USD 94,814). Downside risk should thus remain very manageable. Overall, the daily chart is bearish in the short term, but the Stochastic oscillator is nearing oversold territory. Once the turning has been achieved, the probabilities for a rise to around USD 125,000 by early summer remain strong. Bitcoin Sentiment - Slightly Too Optimistic Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of June 1st, 2025. (Bitcoin Magazine Pro) The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently stands at 56 out of 100. Compared to the lows of 15 to 18 in early April, market sentiment has completely reversed. In hindsight, the contrarian setup assumed six weeks ago proved ideal. While the current sentiment is not yet excessively euphoric, it is somewhat overly optimistic. CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of May 22nd, 2025. (Coinmarketcap) The CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index from CoinMarketCap also indicates slightly elevated optimism. Overall, sentiment is on the path to euphoria, but there is still room before it becomes clearly excessive. Bitcoin Seasonality - Extremely Positive Until Mid-June Bitcoin Seasonality as of May 22nd, 2025. (Seasonax) This year, Bitcoin is following its seasonal pattern. As expected, the next upward move began in April. Based on the statistical price behavior of the past 15 years, this could continue into the second or third week of June. By mid- to end-June, we expect a potential top formation and a gradual transition into the weaker summer phase. Altcoins may continue to rise slightly longer than Bitcoin. However, if U.S. stock markets follow their classic ""Sell in May"" pattern, momentum could begin to wane rather soon. In summary, the seasonal outlook remains green until around mid-June. The next two to four weeks could bring strong Bitcoin price gains. Sound Money - Bitcoin vs. Gold (Bitcoin/Gold Ratio) Bitcoin/Gold-ratio, daily chart as of June 1st, 2025. (TradingView) With Bitcoin at around USD 105,000 and gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) at approximately USD3,301050 per troy ounce, one Bitcoin currently buys about 31.8 ounces of gold. Conversely, one ounce of gold costs about 0.031 Bitcoin. The last few weeks brought a significant recovery of over +35% for Bitcoin against gold since April 11th. From a low of around 25, the Bitcoin/Gold ratio has risen sharply to currently 32 over the past seven weeks. While gold prices consolidated sideways at a high level, Bitcoin's strong price surge drove the trend reversal in the ratio. After breaking out of a falling wedge, the ratio swiftly reclaimed its rising 200-day line (33). With this widely observed average acting as a barrier and probably soon as support, the ratio should start attempting to push higher. The next resistance zone awaits at around 35. If this is breached, a rise to the 39-40 range in the coming weeks is quite realistic. In summary, the Bitcoin/Gold ratio has clearly shifted in favor of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's outperformance against gold is likely to continue despite elevated volatility. If gold prices remain roughly at USD 3,300 and Bitcoin reaches our price target of around USD 125,000, a Bitcoin/Gold ratio of approximately 39-40 would be achieved. Macro Update - Japan as a Warning Sign of the Global Bond Crisis The global sovereign debt crisis is unfolding gradually before our eyes. Japanese Wholesale Rice Prices as of May 25th, 2025. (The Kobeissi Letter) In Japan, prices are rising sharply: wholesale rice prices surged by 98.4% year-over-year in April, the highest increase since 1971. Energy prices also rose by 9.3% after government subsidies ended in March. As a result, inflation (CPI excluding fresh food) climbed to 3.5% in April, marking the fifth consecutive month above 3%. Meanwhile, Japan's economy contracted by 0.7% in Q1 2025, the first decline in a year. Japan was the first developed nation to experiment with Quantitative Easing (QE) and Yield Curve Control (YCC) to keep interest rates low after the economic crash of the 1980s. With a debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 250%, Japan has been mired in economic stagnation for decades, akin to a patient on life support sustained by zero or negative interest rate policies (NIRP). The global money supply surge in response to the COVID-19 pandemic triggered inflation again, but attempts to raise interest rates led to the collapse of the Yen carry trade in August 2024, shaking global markets. On August 5th, 2024, Japan's stock market suffered its worst loss since 1987. New challenges, such as Trump's tariffs and negative GDP growth, show Japan remains trapped in crisis. Japan's Economic Crisis: Loss of Interest Rate Control and Rising Debt Burden Yield on 40-Year Japanese Government Bonds as of May 26th, 2025. (TradingView) The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasingly losing control, torn between fighting inflation and recession. Yield Curve Control, Japan's last trump card, which involves buying its own government bonds, is no longer effective, as long-term interest rates are becoming unmanageable. Nevertheless, the Japanese government plans to continue repurchasing 30- and 40-year government bonds, as their prices have plummeted in recent weeks, driving yields (and thus debt servicing costs) higher. The yield on 30-year Japanese government bonds surged by 100 basis points in just 45 days. Over USD 500 billion in 40-year bonds lost more than 20% of their value in six weeks. No one wants to hold these long-term bonds due to Japan's exorbitant debt levels and unfavorable demographics (a shrinking working-age population). Japan's Dilemma Bank of Japan Holds Over 50% of Japanese Government Bonds as of May 26th, 2025. (The Kobeissi Letter) These factors make productive debt repayment impossible; the only option would be to print more money, which would significantly devalue the Yen. Due to uncertainty, inflation risks, and systemic dangers, investors are avoiding these long-term bonds. The BoJ already holds 52% of all Japanese government bonds and has been the primary buyer of newly issued debt for decades due to lack of market demand. Amid the current crisis, Japan's Finance Ministry plans to reduce the issuance of long-term bonds and repurchase existing ones to prevent further price declines. However, this blocks genuine price discovery and violates free market principles. The funds for repurchasing are provided through additional money printing, further accelerating the yen devaluation. Japan faces a choice: accept falling bond prices and higher yields or print more Yen to repurchase bonds and support the market. Historically, governments sacrifice the currency to save the bond market, leading to inflation. This dynamic, visible in the world's fifth-largest economy, exposes the weaknesses of the global fiat system. U.S. Sovereign Debt Has Risen by 50% U.S. Sovereign Debt Costs as of April 9th, 2025. (Holger Zschäpitz) Japan serves as a serious warning signal, as all G7 nations may soon face similar challenges. For instance, U.S. sovereign debt has surged dramatically from USD 23 trillion in 2019 to over USD 36 trillion, a 50% increase. With a persistent deficit of approximately USD 2 trillion, the notion of a ""U.S. debt ceiling"" is a farce. Experts expect the ceiling to be raised soon, potentially pushing debt to USD 37 trillion. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. recently lost its last AAA credit rating after Moody's downgraded it from Aaa to Aa1 due to rising sovereign debt and higher interest burdens. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has posted one of its strongest recoveries, rising over 24% since April 7th. However, while the crack-up boom (a catastrophic rally driven by money supply expansion and loss of confidence) has regained momentum, numerous sectors of the U.S. economy are showing concerning signals. Over 6.5% of auto loan borrowers are at least 60 days delinquent, a historical high. Serious delinquencies (90+ days overdue) are also rising for mortgages, home equity loans, auto loans, credit cards, and student loans. Global Bond Crisis Global bond markets are gradually recognizing that yield curve control is increasingly failing. The illusion of debt sustainability is fading. Without yield curve control as a safeguard, the psychology of long-term debt security collapses, as the ""just do it like Japan"" strategy no longer works. This creates a dangerous cycle: rising interest rates exacerbate deficits, requiring more bond issuance, which in turn drives rates higher. The impact of this crisis extends far beyond Japan, as the country plays a key role in the global U.S. dollar system through the massive Yen carry trade. Stopping this vicious cycle would require political will on a scale never seen before. The Rise of Alternative Assets Unsurprisingly, gold, Bitcoin, and bond yields are rising independently of traditional financial indicators like rate cuts, inflation, or risk sentiment. For a few days, Bitcoin had recently surpassed Google (Alphabet, GOOGL ) in market capitalization. This underscores Bitcoin's growing significance as an asset class and shows markets are increasingly decoupling from traditional valuation metrics. Michael Saylor's Risky Bitcoin Bet A key driver of the Bitcoin boom is the aggressive strategy of Michael Saylor and his company, Strategy ( MSTR ) (formerly MicroStrategy), along with its imitators. Through the ""42/42 Plan,"" Saylor aims to raise USD 84 billion by 2027 via stock issuances and convertible bonds to buy more Bitcoin. This relies on risky financial instruments, including mispriced convertible bonds with unrealistically low volatility assumptions and yield-generating stocks that lack sustainable returns. Hedge funds exploit this mispricing through volatility arbitrage, buying the bonds, shorting the stock, and profiting without direct interest in Bitcoin. Saylor's model resembles a Ponzi scheme in parts, as the promised stock returns are funded by new investor capital rather than operational profits or sustainable revenue. As long as Bitcoin's price keeps rising, this structure holds; however, a price drop could lead to significant losses and instability. Instead of a solid Bitcoin reserve, this creates a highly speculative financial system based on arbitrage, speculative inflows, and a sustained price rally. The growing number of imitators drawn by this model's success suggests the next Bitcoin bear market could be particularly painful. Nevertheless, this artificial demand (leveraged buying) is likely to drive Bitcoin prices higher for now. The end of the rally is not yet in sight, and a full-blown buying panic is likely still to come. We currently expect this in the fall or Q4 2025. Conclusion: Bitcoin - Record Chase Will Continue Since the panic low of around USD 74,400 on April 6th, 2025, Bitcoin has staged an impressive recovery, decisively breaking through the psychologically significant USD 100,000 mark after a dynamic rally. On May 21st, it reached a new all-time high of USD 112,000 before the current pullback to USD 103,127 started. Technical analysis confirms the bullish momentum: the cup-and-handle formation on the weekly chart points to a price target of around USD 125,000 to USD 130,000, while the ongoing short-term consolidation should hold above USD 101,000. Sentiment is not yet overheated, and seasonality suggests continued positive momentum until mid- to end-June. Macro-economically, the global bond crisis, particularly Japan's Yen weakness and high inflation, as well as the U.S.'s record debt levels, enhance Bitcoin's appeal as an alternative asset. Michael Saylor's aggressive 42/42 Plan, aiming to raise USD 84 billion for Bitcoin purchases via convertible bonds and stock issuances, further fuels the rally but carries significant long-term risks. However, should the Bitcoin market turn, MicroStrategy and its imitators could face dramatic losses, potentially deepening the next bear market. Geopolitical and Other Risks to Bitcoin's Ascent Of course, the bullish thesis projecting Bitcoin to reach USD 150,000 by the end of 2025, driven by institutional adoption and its role as an inflation hedge, faces certain risks, with geopolitical instability posing a particularly acute threat. Severe geopolitical events, such as escalating conflicts like in Ukraine and the trade war, or a collapse in global economic stability, could disrupt Bitcoin's upward trajectory. While one could assume that global uncertainties may drive Bitcoin adoption, extreme scenarios, like a severe recession or credit market collapse, could trigger widespread liquidations of risk assets, including and especially Bitcoin, as investors prioritize liquidity. Macroeconomic pressures, such as rising bond yields (e.g., the 10-year Treasury yield above 4.75%), which could exacerbate selling pressure during geopolitical turmoil, may potentially push Bitcoin lower. While Bitcoin's fundamentals remain strong, these risks, particularly the unpredictable impact of geopolitical instability, demand careful monitoring to navigate the volatile path to USD 125,000 and USD 150,000. Overall, the short- to medium-term environment remains highly constructive, and we expect Bitcoin prices to continue rising in the coming weeks.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791943-bitcoin-record-chase-will-continue?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","IBIT|FBTC|BITO|ARKB|BITB|HODL|BRRR|EZBC|BITX|BTCW|GBTC|BTC-USD",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T12:35:32,"Ripple Price Analysis: XRP Risks Dumping to $1.6 as Bullish Momentum Lacks","XRP continues to show relative weakness in a recovering crypto market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum held key levels and bounced modestly, Ripple’s token remains in a corrective phase. Both the USDT and BTC pairs have broken key support trendlines, signaling potential for further downside if broader sentiment doesn’t improve. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair The XRP/USDT pair recently broke below its rising wedge formation after failing to reclaim the $2.80 resistance zone. The breakdown occurred with expanding sell-side pressure, driving the price toward the next demand zone around $2. This area aligns with the midline of the larger descending channel, making it a critical level to hold. If the price fails to rise back above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages around $2.40, the bearish structure remains intact. Moreover, the asset is now consolidating just under the wedge’s lower boundary, with no convincing bullish momentum showing up. The RSI sits around 40, reflecting weakening bullish momentum. If sellers continue to dominate, an even lower move toward the $1.60 support range is likely, where liquidity from previous accumulation exists. The BTC Pair In the BTC pair, XRP has broken below the key 2,100 SAT support area with low momentum. A potential breakdown from the falling wedge pattern and the earlier rejection from both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, located around the 2,500 SAT mark, suggests sellers are still in control. There is also no bullish divergence on RSI, which has dipped below 40, showing persistent weakness. The next major area of interest lies around the 1,900–1,700 SAT zone.

2025-06-03T12:35:25,"Best crypto to buy as memecoins outperform crypto market","Memecoins have outperformed the broader cryptocurrency market with strong volumes and a surge in open interest. The total market capitalization of memecoins has risen by 1.9% to $66.6 billion in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinGecko. The broader cryptocurrency market, on the other hand, fell by 0.4% to $3.4 trillion. Bitcoin gained 0.9% to maintain $105k levels. With this renewed interest in memecoins, Bitcoin Pepe is one of the projects that could attract retail interest and rise along with memecoins. Memecoins shine Dogwifhat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT), the Solana-based coins, were among the top gainers with a more than 15% rise in the last 24 hours. WIF was trading at $0.981 while POPCAT was at $0.4138. Mog Coin (MOG), SPX6900 (SPX) were the other gainers among meme coins, increasing by more than 11% and 10%, respectively, in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) continued its dominance as the top meme coin by market capitalisation, gaining 2.8% in the last 24 hours. Shiba Inu (SHIB) also maintained its second position, and the token surged 3.4% in the same period. Surging open interest and trading volume Before the memecoins’ surge, there was a noticeable spike in open interest (OI) of various coins. ConstitutionDAO (PEOPLE) had the highest OI jump as it gained 28% in the last 24 hours, according to data by Coinglass. WIF, POPCAT, and SPX also had noticeable spikes with 18%, 14%, and 21%, respectively, in the last 24 hours. Trading volumes also increased for these memecoins, showing investor interest. WIF and POPCAT’s trading volumes surged by 65% and 66% respectively, in the last 24 hours. SPX’s volumes rallied by 52% in the same period. The increasing prices, along with a jump in open interest and trading volumes, indicate a strong bullish trend with investors entering into new long positions. Why Bitcoin Pepe is gathering momentum Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) offers investors a new token that has the potential to provide high returns. Bitcoin Pepe recently announced that it was going to get listed on June 17. The token had announced a 30% bonus for its existing buyers who bought in the presale. The project has already raised $13.68 million so far and is currently available at $0.0396. With 14 days to go before its listing, the project is expected to attract more interest from investors. Bitcoin Pepe is building Solana on Bitcoin by building on a Layer-2 for Bitcoin. By this architecture, the project will allow Solana’s speed and ultra-low fees on Bitcoin’s platform. Bitcoin Pepe aims to combine BTC’s security and memecoins’ cultural popularity. The project achieves this through the PEP-20 token standard, which will allow investors to issue assets natively on Bitcoin’s ecosystem. This will ensure anyone can create memecoins on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Pepe has also teamed up with organizations to ensure the token has real cross-chain utility and help in its adoption. Bitcoin Pepe has made partnerships such as with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance to ensure the token has a proper infrastructure layer, enhance interoperability, and broaden its usability. As memecoins surge higher than the broader market, Bitcoin Pepe is also expected to ride the wave as investor interest piques in memecoins.

2025-06-03T12:33:57,"BlackRock Analyst Warns of Overexposure to US Markets, Says One Country On Right Side of Incoming ‘Tectonic Shifts’","The world’s largest asset manager says investors may want to think twice before betting the farm on US markets. In an interview with CNBC TV-18 , Ben Powell, chief of Middle East & APAC at BlackRock Investment Institute, says he’s looking at other regions to invest in as uncertainty builds in the US due to a weakening dollar and trade tensions. Says Powell, “Having all your eggs in one basket, even a beautiful basket like the US, feels a bit riskier.” The analyst says BlackRock is looking at emerging markets like India as potential candidates to outperform the US, noting strong labor force growth, technology gains, heightened geopolitical relevance and favorable demographic trends. “We like India, yes. We think India is the right side of a lot of these huge tectonic shifts that we’re seeing. So India, in terms of the geopolitics… Clearly, India is of course a kind of continent-sized country and economy, and everyone wants to be friends with India. It’s neck and neck at the moment but potentially India’s GDP will be overtaking Japan’s relatively soon in the next few quarters… And I still think, if I can say so, what some of the foreigners still fail to understand is the amazing technological productivity advances we’ve seen in India over the last years.” However, Powell also concedes that BlackRock is still overweight US equities and doesn’t discount the possibility that the American stock market can rip higher from here, noting that artificial intelligence (AI) can be the “megaforce” that can act as a tailwind that offsets other concerns in the market.

Millions of Pakistanis are embracing crypto through P2P transactions , stablecoins, and Bitcoin.

2025-06-03T12:30:20,"Bitcoin Price Crash: Why $107,500 And $103,500 Are The Levels To Watch","The Bitcoin price crash is in focus following the flagship crypto’s recent drop to as low as $103,700. Crypto analyst Captain Faibik has commented on why $107,500 and $103,500 are the most important levels to watch as BTC looks to decide its next move. Why $107,500 & $103,500 Are Key For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Captain Faibik explained that $107,500 and $103,500 are key as the bulls and bears battle to dictate the next move for the Bitcoin price. The analyst noted that later this week, BTC bulls will attempt to reclaim the $107,500 resistance and regain momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Break Down To $92,000 As It Enters Accumulation Phase He predicted that a clean break and hold above $107,500 could trigger a bullish leg toward the $117,000 level, which would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship crypto. Meanwhile, on the other hand, $103,500 is an important support level which the bulls must defend as the Bitcoin price eyes new highs. Captain Faibik warned that a breakdown below could shift momentum back in favor of the bears. The Bitcoin price had surged above $106,000 on May 2 following news about the US decision to extend its pause of tariffs on some Chinese goods to August. This provided a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto after Donald Trump stated last week that China had violated the trade deal with the US. Trump and China’s president are set to have a call later this week, which could further boost the Bitcoin price if both sides could resolve any dispute regarding the current trade deal. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell failed to discuss the economy during his speech at the International Finance Division Anniversary Conference, which also continues to fuel market uncertainty. First Step For BTC Is To Get Back Above $106,500 In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital indicated that the first step is for the Bitcoin price to successfully reclaim $106,500. He noted that BTC had recorded a weekly close below this level, which puts the flagship crypto back in the danger zone. The analyst further remarked that BTC needs to get back above this level in the coming days or things can get “sketchy looking.” Kevin Capital added that this has been a key level for months, and nothing has changed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rise To $111,000 ATH Doesn’t Mean The Market Is Bullish, Certified Expert Says Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto revealed that a Katana is forming on the weekly chart for the Bitcoin price. He explained that in Ichimoku analysis, a Katana forms when Tenkan and Kijun overlap. This signals low momentum and market equilibrium.
