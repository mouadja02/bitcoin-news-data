2025-06-03T09:58:16,"Trump Makes TACOs, 3 Altcoins to Pump Amid Hidden Bullish Signals","In case you’ve been living under a rock, Trump’s been making TACOs recently. The acronym, for Trump Always Chickens Out, has become a major talking point when analyzing Trump’s ongoing trade war. Could it explain why most cryptos are trading sideways at the moment? Given the market uncertainty due to Trump’s constantly changing trade wars, Bitcoin is losing some of its shine, and people are asking, What are the best altcoins to buy now? Time for a closer look. Trump, Master of Unpredictability, Continues His Work What’s the single biggest factor limiting crypto growth right now? It’s not the US regulatory environment, which is increasingly pro-crypto. Indeed, right now Congress is in session debating a landmark stablecoin bill. It’s not even the US economy, which has proven surprisingly resilient. It’s Trump’s approach to the trade wars he himself initiated. On key geopolitical issues, like the war in Ukraine, Trump shows signs of changing his tune. And on tariffs and direct trade-related matters, he’s again demonstrating his trademark indecision, with a surprise increase in steel and aluminum tariffs (mostly targeted at China) the latest development. The cryptocurrency market has had to grapple with the fallout, as President Trump’s erratic economic strategies cast a shadow over investor confidence and stall the momentum of digital assets. That was clear in $BTC ETF outflows following Trump’s latest announcements. A net $430M outflow on Friday and another $130M on Monday highlight how rattled investors are. Adding to the risk potential is the approaching end to the 90-day ‘pause’ in tariffs Trump placed on most US trading partners. We’re well over halfway through the pause period, and sky-high tariffs could resume as early as July unless something changes. And yet, TACO uncertainty hasn’t caused widespread losses, but rather a curious mixture of gains, sideways trading, and localized losses. Market Stability Hides Crypto Gains and Falls For one thing, Bitcoin has remained remarkably stable, mainly trading sideways around $105K. There’s not a lot of movement lately, with $BTC down around 0.2% over the past 24 hours. Despite this, market sentiment remains pro-Bitcoin, with news of more companies moving to purchase Bitcoin. Beyond Bitcoin, the rest of the crypto market is a mixed bag. Solana ($SOL) – down 9.4% over the past week, as questions remain about proposed $SOL ETFs Dogecoin ($DOGE) – down 15% over seven days, even as Elon Musk leaves the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) XRP ($XRP) – down 5.34% over the week, even while trading volume remains high Cardano ($ADA) – down 10.33% in a week, but up 3.16% daily, fighting to break through a key $0.70 price barrier It can’t all be blamed on Trump; $XRP and $ADA’s trials could be down to their waiting on the SEC for long-running ETF applications. But, as far as uncertainty goes, even SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw says the SEC needs to do more to provide clarity. While Trump and the SEC decide what to do next, crypto presses on. Here are three of the best altcoins poised to quietly make big gains despite the uncertainty. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Free Bitcoin Airdrops for $BTCBULL Holders What’s one way to profit from crypto? Build a project around the most profitable crypto, Bitcoin itself. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) does just that. Buy $BTCBULL , hold it on your Best Wallet app , and you could earn free $BTC when Bitcoin’s price reaches $150K and $200K. You can also look forward to a mega $BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin reaches $250K. It’s one of the easiest ways to diversify your exposure to Bitcoin. With $BTCBULL, you have four ways to earn: Presale $BTCBULL staking $BTCBULL price increase post-launch $BTC airdrop for token holders using Best Wallet app $BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K On the other hand, token burns for $BTCBULL are programmed for when $BTC hits $125K, $175K, and $225K, reducing supply and driving up the price of $BTCBULL. This Yin and Yang structure of alternate airdrops and token burns keeps $BTCBULL moving in tandem with $BTC, though at a far, far lower price. $BTCBULL currently costs just $0.002545, but our price prediction shows the token could increase 230% to reach $0.0084 by year’s end. Remember to hold your tokens in the Best Wallet app and stay tuned to the $BTCBULL X channel to ensure you get your share of those airdrops. When the requirements are posted, act fast to secure your free Bitcoin. Visit BTC Bull Token presale page . Cardano ($ADA) – Will Growing Adoption Power $ADA Past Resistance? Cardano has an interesting story. Only a few years ago, it was touted as one of the legendary ‘Ethereum killers,’ heir to Ethereum’s spot as the number 2 crypto behind Bitcoin. Cardano and XRP, among others, were tipped to break through with faster transaction speeds and lower fees, stealing Ethereum’s crown as the leading DeFi protocol. These days, though, Ethereum seems safer than ever in second place. So, rather than try to replace Ethereum, chains like Cardano have evolved alongside it. The Cardano network recently passed 110M transactions, indicating broad adoption and support. And yet, the token’s price hasn’t been able to break through the $0.70 resistance mark, held back by futures volatility and ETF uncertainty. If it does push through, could Cardano make big gains and return to its recent highs above $1.20? Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Top Utility for Next-Generation Crypto Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of a top Web3 wallet, Best Wallet. Aside from being non-custodial, no-KYC, multi-chain, and highly secure, the Best Wallet app is the only crypto wallet focusing on presales. It offers a built-in ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section that gathers the top crypto presales in one place, letting investors research and purchase tokens long before they reach the open market. The $BEST token dials wallet functionality up to 11, adding: Early access to the best new crypto projects Higher staking rewards Reduced transaction fees $BEST holders can also participate in community governance and make their voice heard on the direction of the project. The Best Wallet app is easy to use without compromising security. Best Wallet users can also look forward to the arrival of Best Card, which will let them use crypto to pay for goods and services offline as easily as using a credit card. The Wallet + Card +Token combo could push $BEST to $0.035215– up 40% from its current $0.025125, as our price prediction shows . Learn how to buy Best Wallet token , and join a presale already past the $12.9M mark. Visit Best Wallet Token . Will Trump TACOs Deliver Good Deals? The big question with TACO is this; is Trump shooting from the hip, or orchestrating a masterful deal? If uncertainty continues, Bitcoin and the best altcoins could continue to muddle along without significant gains or losses. But if Trump demonstrates his art of the deal one more time, it could send Bitcoin – and $BTCBULL, $ADA, and $BEST – rocketing upwards. Remember, though – always do your own research.

2025-06-03T09:42:15,"CZ Proposes Dark Pool Perp DEX to Tackle Market Manipulation Risks","Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao has proposed building a dark pool-style decentralized exchange for perpetual contracts. In a post on X, he raised concerns over the risks created by full transparency in on-chain trading. CZ believes now is a good time for someone to develop a more private, secure trading solution. CZ’s comments come in the wake of a major liquidation event involving $100 million in Bitcoin long positions on Hyperliquid, reportedly held by trader James Wynn. Crypto whale @JamesWynnReal has exited his $1.25B Bitcoin long on Hyperliquid at a $13.4M loss. The 40x leveraged bet saw $40M in paper gains before turning red. #Hyperliquid #Bitcoin https://t.co/mUpMzr17kj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 25, 2025 The liquidation followed Bitcoin’s drop below $105,000 and sparked allegations on X that some users may have coordinated efforts to trigger Wynn’s liquidation. Order Visibility Threatens Large Traders CZ said he has long questioned why decentralized exchanges allow real-time visibility of user orders. While transparency is a key feature of DeFi, he argued it puts large traders at a disadvantage. “If you’re looking to purchase $1 billion worth of a coin, you wouldn’t want others to see it,” he wrote. “People might try to buy before you, effectively front-running you.” Given recent events, I think now might be a good time for someone to launch a dark pool perp DEX. I have always been puzzled with the fact that everyone can see your orders in real-time on a DEX. The problem is worse on a perp DEX where there are liquidations. Even with a CEX… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 1, 2025 On perp DEXs, the risk is greater, as traders’ liquidation points are often visible on-chain. CZ warned this could allow others to manipulate the market and force liquidations, especially against large leveraged positions. In traditional finance, institutional traders avoid this risk by using dark pools, private exchanges that allow large trades without alerting the public order book. According to CZ, dark pool volumes are typically 10 times larger than those of “lit” public exchanges. Even centralized crypto exchanges offer more privacy than DEXs, he noted, since order books are not tied to identifiable wallet addresses. This level of anonymity helps protect against targeted attacks. CZ Calls for a Privacy-Focused Perp DEX CZ suggested that now might be the right moment to build a dark pool perpetual DEX using privacy technology such as zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. This could involve not showing the order book or hiding smart contract deposits until after a delay. “A dark pool style DEX + perps, either by not showing the orderbook, or even better not showing deposits into smart contracts at all, or until much later. This should be doable with ZK or similar encryptions,” he said. The idea, he added, is not meant to dismiss the benefits of transparency. CZ acknowledged that some traders and market makers might prefer public data for better liquidity and order absorption. But he emphasized that different market participants need different tools. CZ concluded his post by encouraging developers building such a product to reach out to him. However, he clarified there are no guarantees of investment or response. “This is just a Sunday idea,” he wrote. The idea gained traction among users who shared similar concerns. Another user proposed building the solution using ZK rollups on a Layer 2 network, to which CZ responded , “That’s one possible way too. There are many possible tech solutions.” The post CZ Proposes Dark Pool Perp DEX to Tackle Market Manipulation Risks appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/cz-proposes-dark-pool-perp-dex-to-tackle-market-manipulation-risks/,"BTC|MARKET|ZRX|BNB|ZK","Blockchain News|CZ|James Wynn|Perpetual Futures",cryptocompare

On Tuesday, the Solana Foundation announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), a move that signals deeper regional ambitions and long-term infrastructure plans. Still, Solana (SOL) barely budged, trading around $160 despite the strategic implications. Here’s a deeper dive. A Power Move in the MENA Region This MOI sets the stage for tangible initiatives in Dubai, including talent development programs, data-sharing efforts, workshops, and advisory sessions – all building toward a Solana Economic Zone in the city. “This partnership helps Solana founders plug directly into that momentum,” the foundation shared on X. Dubai has made its plans known to become a global Web3 leader, and Solana is clearly aiming to be part of that infrastructure. Solana Foundation just signed an MOU with VARA, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. It sets the stage for deep collaboration between crypto builders and regulators: > Talent development programs > Sharing economic impact + sector data > Workshops + advisory sessions for… pic.twitter.com/vFXCDqzkZx — Solana (@solana) June 3, 2025 Big Money Backs the Blockchain That’s not it, though. Earlier on Monday, NewGenIVF Group Limited, a fertility services provider based in Asia, revealed it would be investing $30 million into Solana staking – a massive leap from its initial $1 million Bitcoin buy in December 2024. “The decision to scale our investment from our initial $1 million Bitcoin position to this substantial $30 million Solana commitment reflects our growing conviction in digital assets as a legitimate asset class,” said Siu Wing Fung Alfred, Founder and CEO of NewGen. It’s a surprising source, sure. While the timing may be coincidental, the back-to-back announcements paint a picture of rising institutional confidence in Solana. Love to see it. Technicals Paint a Cautious Picture Despite the bullish headlines, SOL’s price action has been muted. The token broke below a key ascending trendline last week and dipped over 9%, settling at $157 over the weekend. At the time of writing, it hovers just below the 200-day EMA at $163.22, a critical resistance zone. Technical indicators remain cautious – RSI sits at 45, below neutral, and the MACD shows a bearish crossover. If the 200-day EMA holds, SOL could revisit its May 6 low of $141.41. But if bulls reclaim $163.22, a push toward $184.13 is back on the table. The Big Picture: A Long Game in Motion! Solana’s push into Dubai is about embedding itself into the foundations of global Web3 policy and infrastructure.

2025-06-03T09:30:03,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $267 Million Outflow Shock","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $267 Million Outflow Shock The world of Bitcoin investment is always buzzing, and recent movements in the US spot Bitcoin ETFs have certainly captured attention. After periods of significant inflows or relative stability, June 2 marked a notable shift, with these investment vehicles experiencing substantial net outflows. This development offers a glimpse into current market sentiment and the dynamics at play within the burgeoning Bitcoin ETF market . US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Significant Net Outflows According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, June 2 saw a combined total of $267.64 million worth of net outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs. This figure represents the aggregate flow across all currently operating spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Let’s break down which specific ETFs contributed to this total: BlackRock’s IBIT: This fund, often a leader in inflows, recorded the largest net outflow for the day at $130.56 million . ARK Invest’s ARKB: ARK’s offering followed, with net outflows totaling $73.91 million . Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity’s fund also saw significant outflows, amounting to $50.11 million . Grayscale’s GBTC: While GBTC has historically seen large outflows since converting, its outflow on this particular day was relatively smaller at $16.47 million compared to the others. Interestingly, not all funds experienced outflows. Bitwise’s BITB stood out as the only ETF to record a net inflow, albeit a modest one, totaling $3.41 million for the day. Other ETFs in the market reported no changes in their holdings on June 2. Understanding Bitcoin ETF Outflows: Why Do They Matter? When we talk about Bitcoin ETF outflows , we’re essentially seeing investors pulling their money out of these specific investment products. This can happen for various reasons: Profit Taking: Investors might sell their shares after a period of price appreciation to lock in gains. Market Sentiment: A shift in overall sentiment towards Bitcoin or the broader market can lead to selling pressure. Reallocation: Investors might move funds to other asset classes or investment opportunities. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news or changes in interest rates can influence investment decisions across all markets, including crypto. These flows are important because they provide insight into the demand for Bitcoin via these regulated investment vehicles. Significant and sustained outflows could signal waning investor appetite or a shift away from this particular access point to Bitcoin. Navigating the Current Bitcoin ETF Market Landscape The introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a landmark event, opening up a new avenue for traditional finance participants to gain exposure to Bitcoin. These ETFs have quickly become a significant part of the overall Bitcoin ETF market globally and are closely watched indicators of institutional investment interest. While a single day of outflows, even one totaling over $267 million, doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal, it highlights the dynamic nature of the market. Fund flows in and out of these ETFs can be influenced by daily price movements, news events, and broader market liquidity. It’s crucial for investors to look at the flow data over a longer period to identify potential trends rather than focusing solely on a single day’s figures. The cumulative flows since the launch of these ETFs still represent a substantial amount of capital that has entered the Bitcoin ecosystem. Spotting Broader Crypto ETF Trends Monitoring Crypto ETF trends , including those for Bitcoin, provides valuable context for the wider digital asset space. As more types of crypto ETFs are approved or proposed in various jurisdictions, understanding the flow dynamics helps gauge investor confidence and the maturing infrastructure around crypto as an asset class. Outflows in one type of crypto product could coincide with inflows into others, or they might reflect a general risk-off sentiment. Conversely, strong inflows often accompany periods of positive price momentum and heightened investor optimism. The performance of these ETFs and their flow patterns are likely to continue playing a key role in the narrative around institutional investment in cryptocurrencies. They act as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world, and their activity is a closely watched metric by analysts and investors alike. Conclusion: A Day of Outflows in Focus June 2 presented a notable day for US spot Bitcoin ETFs , with the market collectively experiencing significant net outflows led by major players like BlackRock and ARK. While Bitwise managed to attract some inflows, the overall picture for the day was one of capital leaving these funds. This event serves as a reminder of the volatility and rapid shifts that can occur in the crypto market, influencing the flow of funds even within regulated investment products like ETFs. Keeping an eye on these flows remains essential for anyone tracking the health and direction of the Bitcoin ETF market and broader Crypto ETF trends driven by institutional investment .

Many altcoins have posted impressive gains over the past 24 hours, and the larger caps are led by another HYPE explosion. BTC Stopped at $106.5K The primary cryptocurrency tried to take down the $110,000 level on a couple of occasions last week and perhaps head toward yet another all-time high, but each attempt was halted in its tracks. The most violent rejection came on Thursday and Friday, especially after US President Trump said China had violated the trade agreement between the two economic giants. The consequences for BTC were immediate as the asset plummeted from a Thursday peak of $109,000 to $103,100 by Saturday morning, which became a 12-day low . The bulls managed to defend that level and even helped bitcoin recover some ground to $104,500 during the weekend. Monday began with more volatility as BTC went up to $106,000 before it was pushed south to under $104,000. The asset jumped even further on Tuesday morning, touching $106,500 for the first time since Thursday, but it was stopped again and now trades inches above $105,000. Its market cap sits at $2.090 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has taken a hit and is down by 0.5% daily to 61% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView HYPE Ships Off HYPE was the brightest altcoin start in the middle of May, breaking its previous all-time high and charting a new one at around $40. It retraced toward $30 next, but its run has been restarted as an 11% surge has taken it to over $36. In terms of daily gains, HYPE has been outperformed only by ENA and WIF, as they are up by 12% and 15%, respectively. Other impressive performers from the larger-cap alts include AAVE, ICP, and PEPE. ETH has jumped by 5% and now sits at $2,600, while SOL is close to $160 following a 3% increase.

2025-06-03T09:15:11,"Japanese Bitcoin Hoarder Metplanet Adds $115,600,000 Worth of BTC As Stock Surpasses 263% Gains on the Year","The Japanese hotel and investment firm Metaplanet has gobbled up another $115.6 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ). The firm announced over the weekend that it had acquired another 1,088 Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 8,888 BTC. With Bitcoin trading at $106,309 at time of writing, that means Metaplanet now holds nearly $945 million worth of the top crypto asset. The Japanese firm’s stock is up 263.48% year-to-date. Metaplanet chief executive Simon Gerovich says the firm’s 8,888 BTC are a “symbol of abundance” and a “number of fortune.” The CEO has said previously that he “worries every day” that the company doesn’t own enough Bitcoin. “The window to buy won’t stay open forever. Soon, there will be two kinds of people: those who own Bitcoin and those who regret not buying it. At Metaplanet, we’re accumulating as much as we can so our shareholders can relax.” Gerovich also said earlier this year that he thinks more financial institutions will show interest in adopting BTC. Metaplanet aims to acquire 10,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026. The firm, which is the 11th-largest corporate holder of BTC , also continues to operate a Tokyo hotel, which it plans to renovate and rebrand into “the Bitcoin Hotel.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-03T09:10:56,"Exciting ARKB Share Split: 21Shares Boosts Accessibility for Bitcoin ETF Investors","BitcoinWorld Exciting ARKB Share Split: 21Shares Boosts Accessibility for Bitcoin ETF Investors Big news for investors eyeing the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency investments through traditional markets! 21Shares, a leading issuer of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), has announced a significant move regarding its spot Bitcoin ETF , ticker symbol ARKB. The company is scheduled to implement a 3-for-1 share split for ARKB. This development is set to take effect at the market open on June 16, according to a GlobeNewswire announcement. Understanding the Bitcoin ETF Share Split by 21Shares For those new to the stock market or ETF mechanics, a share split is a corporate action where a company increases the number of its outstanding shares by dividing existing shares. In this case, if you owned one share of ARKB before the split, you will own three shares after the split. It’s important to understand that while the number of shares you own increases, the total value of your holding remains the same immediately after the split, as the price per share is adjusted proportionally. Think of it like cutting a pizza into more slices. You get more slices, but you still have the same amount of pizza. Similarly, a 3-for-1 share split means: For every 1 share you currently hold, you will receive 2 additional shares. Your total number of shares will triple. The price per share will theoretically become one-third of the pre-split price. The overall market capitalization or total value of your investment remains unchanged by the split itself. Why is 21Shares Implementing the ARKB Share Split ? According to the announcement, the primary goals behind this ARKB share split are to make the shares more accessible to a wider range of investors and to optimize trading efficiency. Let’s break down these reasons: Increased Accessibility: When a share price becomes very high, it can be difficult for smaller investors to purchase even a single share. By lowering the per-share price through a split, 21Shares aims to make ARKB more affordable and appealing to retail investors who might be investing smaller amounts. This democratizes access to the Bitcoin ETF . Optimized Trading Efficiency: A lower share price can sometimes lead to increased trading volume and liquidity. A more liquid market means it can be easier for investors to buy and sell shares quickly without significantly impacting the price. This can lead to tighter bid-ask spreads, making trading more efficient and potentially reducing transaction costs for investors. What Does This Mean for Investors in 21Shares ARKB ? If you are already an investor in 21Shares ARKB , you don’t need to take any action. The split will happen automatically for all shareholders of record. On the effective date (June 16), your brokerage account will simply reflect the new number of shares and the adjusted price per share. The total value of your investment in ARKB will remain the same immediately after the split, assuming no other market factors are at play. For potential investors, the lower per-share price might make ARKB a more attractive entry point, allowing them to purchase more shares for the same investment amount compared to the pre-split price. This could be particularly relevant for those using dollar-cost averaging strategies. The Growing Landscape of Crypto ETF s and ETPs The move by 21Shares comes amidst a rapidly evolving landscape for cryptocurrency investment products in traditional financial markets. Spot Bitcoin ETF s, including ARKB, have seen significant interest and inflows since their approval in the United States. As these products mature and attract more capital, issuers are exploring various strategies to enhance their appeal and functionality. Share splits are a common practice in the traditional stock market for established companies. Implementing this action for a relatively new asset class like a spot Bitcoin ETF signals a step towards normalizing crypto investment vehicles within conventional financial frameworks. It shows issuers are actively managing these products to meet investor expectations and market dynamics. Key Details of the ARKB Share Split : Here’s a quick summary of the essential information: Issuer: 21Shares Product: 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) Split Ratio: 3-for-1 Effective Date: Market open on June 16 Purpose: Increase accessibility and optimize trading efficiency Investors should monitor their brokerage accounts around the effective date to see the updated share count and price. While the split itself doesn’t change the underlying value, market reactions to the split or other external factors can still influence the price performance of ARKB. In Conclusion: A Strategic Move for ARKB 21Shares’ decision to implement a 3-for-1 share split for its ARKB spot Bitcoin ETF is a strategic move aimed at broadening the appeal and improving the trading experience for investors. By lowering the per-share price, the company hopes to attract more participants and potentially increase liquidity, further integrating ARKB into the mainstream investment ecosystem. This action highlights the ongoing efforts by crypto ETP issuers to adapt and optimize their offerings in response to market demand and investor needs. It’s an interesting development in the lifecycle of one of the prominent US spot Bitcoin ETFs.

2025-06-03T09:05:29,"Older Bitcoin Holders Show Signs of Selling Exhaustion – What Does This Mean?","A few days ago, analysts at the market research and intelligence firm Glassnode discovered that older Bitcoin holders were leading the sell-off that triggered BTC’s correction. Currently, it appears that this investor cohort is showing signs of selling exhaustion. Considering historical data, this development is a positive one for bitcoin’s price trajectory in the coming weeks. OG Bitcoin Holders Lead Spending Spike According to a tweet by Glassnode, the three-year to five-year Bitcoin holder cohort is experiencing a slowdown in their BTC sales. This comes after they resumed selling in April, depleting their supply share by a notable percentage. CryptoPotato reported last week that Bitcoin investors holding the digital asset for a year to five years recorded a spike in their spending, bringing their aggregate volume to $4.02 billion. There are three age cohorts in this investor group, comprising one- to two-year, two- to three-year, and three- to five-year holders. These investors have spent notable amounts of BTC each time the cryptocurrency rallied in March, October, November 2024, and February 2025. The spending spike recorded this time is the fifth-largest in this bull cycle, and it has been led by the three-year to five-year age cohort with $2.16 billion. Glassnode mentioned that this figure marked their second-largest outflow of the cycle, following $6 billion recorded in March 2024. Older Investors Show Exhaustion Signs Additional information now provided by Glassnode reveals that the three-to-five-year cohort reached an all-time high (ATH) of 15.7% in supply on November 9, 2024. Such levels had not been seen since March 2017. This investor cohort began selling soon after hitting the ATH, paused for some time, and resumed again in April 2025. Currently, their supply share stands at 11.9%, significantly above the cycle low of approximately 3%, suggesting a pause in sales. Glassnode states that this represents a significant overhang and that this group, which still controls a large share of wealth, tends to sell into strength. This means that even though the three-year to five-year cohort is showing signs of selling exhaustion, they are likely to sell when BTC hits higher prices, especially with their supply share still hovering around 12%. As older Bitcoin holders are currently refraining from taking profits, BTC is likely to witness its next leg up soon. However, as they take profits during rallies, BTC will face significant resistance during the next surge.

2025-06-03T09:00:34,"Ethereum’s $3K Setup, Pi Coin Targets $1.25 But Web3 ai is the Best Crypto to Buy Before the Next 1000x","Is this the breakout window traders have been waiting for? Ethereum (ETH) resistance level is holding above $2,630, with CME futures and ETF buzz backing the move. At the same time, Pi (PI) coin breakout potential is catching serious attention as analysts forecast long-term targets between $500 and $1,000. While the headlines are focused on these majors, the real sleeper play may be Web3 ai. Its current presale stage 7 is still offering $WAI at just $0.000402, and whales are already stacking. Why? Because it’s not just another presale. Web3 ai is building a live platform of AI tools, and $WAI will be the key to unlock everything post-launch. If you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy, this isn’t about hype, it’s about timing. ETH and PI are already moving, but Web3 ai is still early. That’s where the biggest upside usually hides, before the noise kicks in. Web3 ai: The Last 1000x Play Hidden in Plain Sight Web3 ai is looking like the best crypto to buy before the next wave really starts rolling. Right now, it’s sitting in Stage 7 of its presale, priced at just $0.000402, with $6.8 million already raised. At this level, it’s cheap, but the upside isn’t about hype. It’s about utility. $WAI will power access to a full suite of AI-driven tools that automate crypto trading, manage portfolios, detect fraud, and more. This isn’t another whitepaper fantasy, it’s tech built for day-one deployment. While the $777K giveaway and referral push are pulling in a lot of attention, that’s just the front door. What’s behind it is what has whales loading up: long-term adoption of AI in crypto. Web3 ai plans to lead that shift. If even a portion of traders and Web3 builders start using its AI bots and analytics, demand for $WAI will explode, taking prices with it. And that’s why early entry matters. By the time Web3 ai lists at $0.005242, most traders will already be late. Smart buyers know the window for life-changing ROI is during presale, when risk meets timing. This is what made early Bitcoin entries legendary. Web3 ai may not be BTC, but it’s tapping into the same formula: innovation + utility + scarcity. So if you’re looking for the best crypto to buy, don’t just chase charts. Look where the big wallets are stacking. Web3 ai isn’t riding the AI trend, it’s building the rails for it. And if it delivers, that “1000x” label might just be conservative. Ethereum (ETH) Resistance Level Holds the Key to $3K Push All eyes are on Ethereum (ETH) resistance level as it repeatedly tests the $2,940 mark. This zone has become a key battleground, with bulls defending against any deeper correction. After bouncing off support at $2,700 and pushing back toward $2,930, traders are now focused on a clean breakout that could send ETH beyond the $3,000 barrier. With rising network activity and L2 scaling adoption holding steady, Ethereum isn’t just holding the line, it’s gaining strength for the next leg up. What makes the current move so interesting is the confluence of technical pressure and broader market sentiment. Institutional buyers are watching closely, and strong fundamentals continue to back Ethereum’s long-term potential. If the Ethereum (ETH) resistance level at $2,940 flips to support, analysts are pointing toward $3,100–$3,400 as the next big targets. It’s not a breakout yet, but the setup is strong, and if momentum holds, ETH could easily be one of the top performers heading into June. Pi (PI) Coin Breakout Could Be Just Getting Started The Pi (PI) coin breakout is back in focus as price action pushes against key resistance near $0.69. After a stretch of low volatility, Pi has been gaining traction with fresh optimism around its June 2025 mainnet updates. Traders are watching the token closely as it attempts to break past the short-term ceiling and establish a path toward its longer-term projection near $1.25. This setup has put Pi right back on the radar for those tracking high-upside altcoins. What’s fueling interest is the strong narrative around utility. Pi’s community-first model and real-world integration goals are lining up with broader market attention. If the Pi (PI) coin breakout confirms with strong volume and momentum, analysts are calling for a move toward $1.05–$1.25 in the coming weeks. It’s still early for Pi, but the technical structure and active user base make it a chart worth tracking, especially for anyone looking to catch a fresh run before it gains wider visibility. Summing Up The Ethereum (ETH) resistance level near $3,000 is holding strong as buyers step back in, with analysts watching for a confirmed breakout. On the other hand, the Pi (PI) coin breakout is building momentum, with targets set between $1.05 and $1.25 if volume keeps rising. Both assets are heating up the charts, but neither offers the same early-stage upside as Web3 ai. With $WAI priced at just $0.000402 in Stage 7 and $6.8 million already raised, the entry window is still wide open. Web3 ai isn’t just riding market hype, it’s locking in utility. The $777K giveaway is grabbing attention, but whales are buying because of the platform’s 12-tool AI suite going live post-launch.

2025-06-03T08:45:51,"Norway’s NBX Joins Bitcoin Treasury Trend, Stock Jumps 138%","The post Norway’s NBX Joins Bitcoin Treasury Trend, Stock Jumps 138% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin tide continues to turn corporate heads , this time in Norway. As BTC hovers above $105,000, firms are racing to embrace it not just as a store of value but as a key pillar of financial strategy. And the latest player to jump in to the crypto game is Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX), which triggered markets on June 2 with a bold Bitcoin treasury announcement that sent its shares soaring by 138%. Starting with a low profile Norway is quietly getting started with their Bitcoin buying plans. NBX Buys BTC, Stock Erupts NBX kicked off its treasury strategy with the purchase of 6 BTC, worth around $633,700, with plans to increase that to 10 BTC by month’s end. But the move wasn’t just symbolic, NBX outlined plans to use its Bitcoin to issue USDM, a stablecoin on Cardano, and unlock yield within the Cardano ecosystem. Investors loved the idea. NBX shares skyrocketed 138.5% in a single trading day, closing at €0.033 ($0.038), signaling strong confidence in BTC-backed innovation. Crypto Banking Next? NBX isn’t stopping at Bitcoin reserves. The company hinted at ambitions to turn into a full-fledged digital asset bank. By leveraging BTC as collateral, NBX aims to offer Bitcoin-backed loans and boost operational efficiency, potentially drawing institutional capital from firms now warming up to crypto. However, in the journey NBX isn’t alone. Norway’s Aker ASA already holds 1,170 BTC via its crypto subsidiary, Seetee , while brokerage firm K33 raised $6.2 million for its own Bitcoin play. Even Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund holds indirect exposure to nearly 3,821 BTC through equity holdings. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Fed Chair Powell Hints at Softer Monetary Policy, Bitcoin Back to $106K , Bitcoin Treasury Trend Spreads Its massively trending worldwide, Companies from France’s Blockchain Group to Indonesia’s DigiAsia Corp have seen similar stock boosts after announcing Bitcoin purchases.

Overall, Bitcoin isn’t just digital gold anymore, it’s turning into a corporate growth engine.

Understanding what this means is crucial for navigating the coming weeks and months. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is designed to give investors a snapshot of which part of the market cycle we are in – Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season . It’s a simple yet powerful tool based on historical performance. Here’s how it generally works: It looks at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens). It compares the performance of these altcoins against Bitcoin over a specific period, typically the last 90 days. The index ranges from 1 to 100. According to the metric, as of 00:28 UTC on June 3, the index registered 26. This specific number falls squarely into the definition of Bitcoin Season . How Does the Index Define Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season? The thresholds are quite clear-cut: Altcoin Season: This occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. An index score typically above 75 would indicate this phase. Bitcoin Season: This occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. An index score below 25 would indicate this phase. Scores between 25 and 75 might indicate a transitional or undefined phase, sometimes referred to as ‘Neither’ season. With the index at 26, it indicates that only a small percentage of the top 100 altcoins have managed to perform better than Bitcoin over the last three months. This firmly places the current crypto market state in Bitcoin Season . What Does Being in Bitcoin Season Mean for Your Portfolio? Entering or being in Bitcoin Season has several implications for participants in the crypto market . It doesn’t mean altcoins will necessarily crash, but it suggests a specific dynamic is at play. Challenges During Bitcoin Season: Potential Altcoin Underperformance: The most direct implication is that many altcoins are likely to underperform compared to Bitcoin . If Bitcoin goes up, altcoins might go up less, stay flat, or even go down. If Bitcoin goes down, altcoins often go down harder. Reduced Speculative Frenzy: The widespread, rapid pumps seen across a broad range of altcoins during peak Altcoin Season are less common. Focus Shifts to Bitcoin: Media attention, retail interest, and even institutional flows tend to focus more heavily on Bitcoin during this time. Potential Opportunities During Bitcoin Season: Strong Bitcoin Performance: Historically, Bitcoin Season can coincide with periods of significant gains for Bitcoin itself, potentially driven by factors like halving events, institutional adoption news, or macroeconomic shifts. Accumulation Opportunities: If altcoins are consolidating or pulling back, it can present opportunities for investors to accumulate positions in promising projects at potentially lower prices in anticipation of the next Altcoin Season. Clearer Market Leader: With Bitcoin often dictating the pace, the overall market direction can sometimes feel less chaotic than during peak Altcoin Season when dozens of narratives are simultaneously driving different tokens. Why Might the Crypto Market Be in Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors can contribute to the market shifting into Bitcoin Season . While the index is based purely on relative price performance over 90 days, this performance is driven by underlying market dynamics. Possible contributing factors include: Post-Halving Dynamics: The Bitcoin halving event often precedes periods where Bitcoin shows strength as the supply issuance decreases, and attention is drawn to its scarcity model. Institutional Interest: Large institutional investors often start with Bitcoin due to its size, liquidity, and regulatory clarity (especially with products like spot Bitcoin ETFs). Increased institutional flows into Bitcoin can cause it to outperform other assets in the short to medium term. Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of broader economic uncertainty, investors might rotate out of more speculative assets (like many altcoins ) and into the perceived relative safety of Bitcoin within the crypto space. Early Cycle Phase: Historically, Bitcoin often leads the initial stages of a bull run, with altcoins catching up and eventually outperforming later in the cycle. Being in Bitcoin Season could indicate we are still in an earlier phase of a larger potential upward trend. Actionable Insights for Navigating Bitcoin Season So, the Altcoin Season Index says it’s Bitcoin Season . What should you do? Here are some strategies to consider: Review Your Allocation: Assess your portfolio’s current split between Bitcoin and altcoins . Does it align with your risk tolerance and expectations for a Bitcoin Season environment? You might consider increasing your Bitcoin exposure or trimming positions in underperforming altcoins that don’t fit your long-term thesis. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: If you are bullish on Bitcoin ‘s long-term prospects, continuing or starting a DCA strategy can be effective during this phase. Research Altcoins for the Next Cycle: Use this period to research promising altcoin projects. Look for strong fundamentals, active development, clear use cases, and engaged communities. Building a watchlist now can position you well when the market eventually shifts back towards altcoins . Be Patient with Altcoins: If you hold altcoins you believe in long-term, understand that they may underperform Bitcoin for a while. Avoid panic selling based solely on the index reading. Focus on the project’s fundamentals. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, economic indicators, and on-chain data for both Bitcoin and your chosen altcoins . Market conditions can change rapidly. Remember, the Altcoin Season Index is a historical look (90 days) and an indicator, not a crystal ball. It tells us the current state based on recent performance, but it doesn’t predict the future with certainty. Market cycles are fluid. Is This Normal? Understanding Crypto Market Cycles Absolutely. The crypto market is well-known for its cyclical nature. Periods where Bitcoin leads are typically followed by periods where altcoins have their turn to shine, and vice versa. Think of it like seasons in nature. We have Bitcoin Season (perhaps like winter or early spring, where the foundation strengthens) and Altcoin Season (like summer, where everything grows rapidly). The index simply helps us identify which season we are currently experiencing based on recent performance trends. Past cycles have shown distinct periods of Bitcoin dominance followed by explosive growth in altcoins . The fact that the index is currently low is not a sign of a broken market, but rather a reflection of the current phase of the cycle. When Might Altcoin Season Return? Predicting the exact timing is impossible, but historical patterns and potential catalysts can offer clues: Bitcoin Consolidation: Often, after a significant run-up, Bitcoin may enter a period of consolidation. This sideways movement can free up capital and investor attention, allowing focus to shift towards promising altcoins . Emergence of New Narratives: Strong performance in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions, or gaming can sometimes kickstart broader interest in altcoins . Improved Market Sentiment: A general increase in risk appetite across global financial markets can flow into the crypto space, benefiting altcoins which are generally considered higher risk than Bitcoin . Significant Altcoin Developments: Major mainnet launches, protocol upgrades, or widespread adoption news for specific large-cap altcoins can also contribute to a shift. Watching the Altcoin Season Index , alongside other market indicators and news, can help you anticipate potential shifts. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Season Ahead The Altcoin Season Index, currently sitting at 26, provides a clear signal: the crypto market is in Bitcoin Season . This means that over the last 90 days, Bitcoin has largely outperformed the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins . While this phase can present challenges for pure altcoin holders, it’s a normal part of the market cycle and can offer opportunities, particularly for those focused on Bitcoin or looking to accumulate quality altcoins at potentially favorable prices. Understanding this dynamic, adjusting your strategy if necessary, and remaining patient are key to navigating the current crypto market landscape.

With a 10.00% non-cumulative fixed dividend and perpetual duration, STRD aims to provide long-term, high-yield exposure positioned between the firm's senior preferred (STRF) and convertible preferred (STRK) offerings. Unlike STRF, which offers a senior claim and is designed to be overcollateralized with lower volatility—comparable to investment-grade securities STRD is junior in seniority but delivers the highest yield of Strategy’s preferred offerings. STRK, by contrast, sits between the two in both risk and return, offering an 8% fixed dividend and convertibility. At the base of the capital stack lies MSTR, the firm’s common stock and primary vehicle for leveraged bitcoin exposure. According to Strategy, STRD is non-callable under normal conditions, but may be repurchased upon a “fundamental change” or select tax events. Its quarterly dividends are discretionary and paid in cash only when declared by the board. In the broader market, STRD compares favorably against other preferred equity and high-yield bond funds. With a 10% yield and zero management fees, STRD offers a compelling alternative to ETFs like PFF (7% yield, 0.46% fee) and USHY (8% yield, 0.08% fee), while maintaining comparable volatility levels. The STRD offering supports Strategy’s broader initiative to offer diversified, structured exposures that span from stable yield to high-conviction digital asset plays anchoring a new approach to capital structuring in the digital era.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/03/strategy-expands-capital-stack-with-launch-of-high-yield-strd-preferred-shares,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|STRK","Markets|MicroStrategy|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T08:38:36,"Fed Chair Powell Hints at Softer Monetary Policy, Bitcoin Back to $106K","The post Fed Chair Powell Hints at Softer Monetary Policy, Bitcoin Back to $106K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has jumped back to $106k today after dipping to some of its weekend losses around $103k. The surge comes right after as the Federal Reserve hints at a possible change in its strict money policy later this year. Therefore, traders are bullish on the bitcoin surge. Powell Hints at Softer Money Policy Speaking at an event for the Fed’s International Finance (IF) Division, Powell said their work helps understand the world’s economy and all the risks. He didn’t mention interest rates directly, but he did say that global data matters a lot now.. Powell’s comments didn’t go unnoticed. Investors saw them as a quiet sign that the Fed is starting to think about changing its current tight money approach if economic trends keep heading in the right direction. Why This Could Be Good News for Bitcoin This talk of a softer policy shift is good news for Bitcoin and other riskier assets. Eventually, the inflation is slowing down, and jobs are steady. Currently, inflation is at 2.3% , close to the Fed’s 2% goal. Meanwhile, the Unemployment rate is also around 4.2%, showing that people are still working and the economy is okay. Even though Powell didn’t say there will be cuts soon, he said that global data is very important. Traders think this could mean the Fed might lower rates later if inflation keeps falling and jobs stay strong. Lower rates make it easier to borrow money, which usually helps things like Bitcoin go up. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Norway’s NBX Joins Bitcoin Treasury Trend, Stock Jumps 138% , Cautious Approach, But Market’s Ready For now, the Fed is being careful.

This careful but open approach has traders hopeful that Bitcoin and other cryptos will see more gains soon. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $105,253, reflecting a slight drop seen in the last 24 hours. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Fed remains cautious, with no immediate cuts expected, but traders see potential easing later if inflation keeps falling. How does the Federal Reserve’s policy affect Bitcoin? When the Fed signals lower interest rates or a softer monetary stance, it often boosts investor confidence in riskier assets like Bitcoin. How might future Fed decisions impact Bitcoin’s trajectory?

2025-06-03T08:30:57,"Crypto Fear Greed Index: Navigate Market Greed Wisely","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear Greed Index: Navigate Market Greed Wisely Are you watching the markets and wondering how others are feeling? The Crypto Fear Greed Index is a popular tool designed to answer just that, giving you a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment . Recently, this index, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 64, holding steady from the previous day. This number firmly places the market sentiment in the territory known as ‘Greed’. But what exactly does this mean for your approach to crypto investing ? Understanding the Crypto Fear Greed Index At its core, the Crypto Fear Greed Index aims to quantify the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market participants. Emotions like fear and greed can significantly influence investment decisions. When the market is experiencing extreme fear, it often signals that investors are panic-selling, potentially creating buying opportunities. Conversely, when extreme greed takes over, it might suggest the market is due for a correction as assets become overvalued. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed A reading of 64, as we see currently, falls comfortably within the ‘Greed’ zone. This suggests that market participants are feeling optimistic and are potentially buying aggressively, perhaps driven by positive price movements or general enthusiasm. Understanding this kind of market psychology is crucial. How Does the Index Calculate Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear Greed Index isn’t based on just one factor. It aggregates data from several different sources to provide a holistic view. Here are the components the index typically considers, along with their weightings: Factor Weighting Description Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum / Volume 25% Compares the current market volume and momentum to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market indicates greedy/bullish behavior. Social Media 15% Analyzes tweets and posts from various platforms, looking at specific hashtags, sentiment analysis, and how fast conversations are happening. High engagement around positive topics can signal greed. Surveys 15% Polls conducted weekly asking investors about their market sentiment. (Note: As mentioned in the source, surveys are currently paused, meaning this factor’s weight might be temporarily redistributed or excluded from the calculation). Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear (as investors move from altcoins to BTC, seen as safer) or greed (if BTC is strongly rallying). The index interprets this nuancedly. Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might signal fear, while terms like “buy crypto” during a rally could indicate greed. By combining these diverse factors, the index attempts to capture the overall feeling in the market beyond just looking at the Bitcoin price or trading volume in isolation. What Does ‘Greed’ at 64 Signal for Investors? A reading of 64 suggests that market participants are generally bullish and confident. This isn’t yet ‘Extreme Greed’ (75+), which is often seen as a strong warning sign of an impending correction. However, being in the ‘Greed’ zone still warrants caution. Historically, periods of high greed have preceded market downturns. This is based on the principle of ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ or simply that markets tend to revert to the mean. When everyone is euphoric and buying, there are fewer potential buyers left, and any negative news or catalyst can trigger a wave of selling. For someone engaged in crypto investing , a 64 reading could imply: Prices might be getting stretched and potentially overvalued in the short term. There’s a higher risk of a pullback or correction compared to times of fear. New investments might carry more risk if not carefully considered. It might be a time to consider taking some profits, rebalancing your portfolio, or setting stricter stop-losses. It’s essential to remember that the index is an indicator of sentiment, not a crystal ball predicting exact price movements or timing. Is the Crypto Fear Greed Index a Reliable Tool? The index is a valuable tool for understanding market psychology , but it has its benefits and challenges. Benefits: Quantifies Emotion: Provides a simple, numerical representation of market feelings. Counter-Trading Signal: Can sometimes offer contrarian signals (e.g., extreme fear might be a buy signal, extreme greed a sell signal). Historical Context: Allows comparison of current sentiment to past market cycles. Quick Snapshot: Offers a fast way to gauge the overall mood without deep analysis of every factor individually. Challenges: Not a Sole Indicator: Should not be used in isolation for making investment decisions. Doesn’t Predict Price: Indicates feeling, not guaranteed future price action. The market can remain irrational longer than you expect. Factor Weighting: The exact impact of each factor can change, and the temporary pausing of surveys shows it’s dynamic. Lagging vs. Leading: It’s often a reflection of recent price action rather than a predictor of future moves. Using the index effectively means integrating it into a broader analysis framework that includes technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and understanding the specific dynamics of the Bitcoin price and other assets you’re interested in. Using Market Psychology in Your Crypto Investing Strategy Understanding market psychology , as reflected by the Crypto Fear Greed Index, can be a powerful addition to your crypto investing strategy. When the index is high (Greed), it’s a reminder to: Be Cautious: Avoid making impulsive decisions driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk exposure. Are you comfortable with your current holdings if a correction occurs? Plan Your Exits: Consider setting profit targets or stop-losses to protect gains. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Stick to a DCA plan if you have one, rather than putting large sums in when sentiment is high. Look for Undervalued Assets: Sometimes, even in a generally greedy market, specific assets might be lagging or undervalued. Conversely, when the index drops into ‘Fear’ or ‘Extreme Fear’, it might signal a time to look for potential buying opportunities, assuming your fundamental analysis supports the assets. The current reading of 64 is a prompt to be mindful. The market feels good, but that’s precisely when complacency can set in. Smart investors use sentiment indicators like this to temper their own emotions and make more rational decisions, rather than being swept up in the prevailing mood. Conclusion: Navigating Greed in the Crypto Market The Crypto Fear Greed Index holding at 64 signifies that ‘Greed’ remains the dominant crypto market sentiment . While not yet in the extreme zone, this reading serves as a valuable signal for anyone involved in crypto investing . It highlights the current bullish market psychology but also reminds us that periods of high optimism often carry increased risk of pullbacks. Understanding the factors behind the index, from volatility and momentum to social media and Bitcoin price trends, helps paint a clearer picture. The index is not a standalone predictor but a crucial tool for gauging the emotional temperature of the market. Use this insight to inform your strategy, manage risk, and avoid making decisions driven solely by emotion. Staying disciplined and informed is key to navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency.

2025-06-03T08:30:48,"Another Proof Says Ripple CTO Is Satoshi Bitcoin Creator","Another proof that Ripple CTO David Schwartz is a Satoshi Nakamoto, the group of developers that created Bitcoin, has emerged. Vandell, the co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, has revived a long-circulating theory tying early digital currency development to U.S. intelligence agencies, specifically the National Security Agency (NSA). In a recent tweet, Vandell revisits a 1996 NSA publication titled “How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash” and raises questions about the timing of David Schwartz’s involvement with the NSA. Schwartz, one of the original architects behind the XRP Ledger, filed a patent for distributed ledger technology the same year the NSA paper was released. This 1996 NSA article “How to Make a Mint” Coincidence David Shwartz, one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger began work with the NSA the same year his patent was accepted? Reference Line 11. “ Tatsuaki Okamoto” David Shwartz is a Satoshi Nakamoto. Hidden in plain… pic.twitter.com/rOOWLzH54j — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) June 1, 2025 The 1996 NSA Paper and Cryptographic Foundations The NSA’s How to Make a Mint outlines the technical requirements for creating anonymous digital cash. Among the references cited in the document is a 1995 paper by Tatsuaki Okamoto titled An Efficient Divisible Electronic Cash Scheme (reference #11 in the bibliography of the image Vandell shared). Vandell draws attention to this citation to highlight a potential connection between foundational digital cash concepts and the eventual creation of Bitcoin. Okamoto’s work has long been recognized in the cryptographic community as pioneering and influential in the development of electronic money protocols. The Schwartz Timeline and Patent Filing What Vandell emphasizes is the convergence of events in 1996: the NSA’s publication of the anonymous digital cash paper and the acceptance of David Schwartz’s patent for distributed computer systems. Schwartz reportedly began working with the NSA the same year. Vandell implies that this timeline is not coincidental but indicative of a coordinated effort involving government agencies and select technologists. The patent in question, filed by Schwartz, outlines a method for securely managing distributed computer systems—technology that resembles early blockchain concepts. This technological overlap is central to Vandell’s thesis: that both Bitcoin and XRP may share common developmental roots traceable to work done within or influenced by NSA research. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications Regarding Satoshi Nakamoto Vandell further escalates the claim by suggesting that David Schwartz is, in fact, Satoshi Nakamoto —the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. He argues that the parallels between Schwartz’s early government work, his technical contributions to distributed ledger systems, and the timing of Bitcoin’s conceptual development form a compelling case. According to Vandell, these data points are not random but deliberately connected, pointing to Schwartz as a likely identity behind Satoshi. While no direct evidence is provided to confirm this assertion, the alignment of events and technologies is presented as circumstantial proof. Vandell states that Bitcoin and XRP both trace back to NSA labs and that this origin has been “hidden in plain sight.” He also claims that the creation of Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems may have occurred under the oversight of intelligence agencies and powerful technology interests. Vandell’s tweet reinforces a long-running narrative suggesting that the genesis of blockchain technology was not solely the product of anonymous developers or decentralized communities, but instead may involve state-level research and coordination. By referencing the NSA’s 1996 paper, David Schwartz’s patent, and foundational cryptographic research by Tatsuaki Okamoto, Vandell outlines what he believes to be a credible timeline that repositions Schwartz not only as a key figure in the XRP ecosystem but potentially as the creator of Bitcoin itself. These claims remain speculative, but they reflect ongoing curiosity and skepticism about the true origins of digital currency.

2025-06-03T08:30:47,"USDC Issuer Circle Now Targets $7.2 Billion Valuation In Major US IPO","Circle, the issuer of the second largest stablecoin by market cap, USDC , announced on Monday that it has increased the expected price range for its upcoming initial public offering (IPO). According to Reuters, the new price range has been adjusted from the previously announced $24 to $26 per share to a more ambitious $27 to $28 per share, detailed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Circle Set For NYSE Debut Under Ticker ‘CRCL’ At the upper end of this revised price range, Circle anticipates raising approximately $896 million, which would propel the company’s valuation to $7.2 billion, according to Reuters. The decision to upsize the IPO is attributed to several factors, including Circle’s growing momentum in the stablecoin market, a strong investor appetite for cryptocurrency firms, and an anticipated favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump. Additionally, Circle is anticipated to benefit from a stablecoin bill currently progressing through Congress in the form of the GENIUS ACT , which aims to set clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. Circle plans to go public on the New York Stock Exchange later this week under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” Initially, when Circle filed for its IPO on May 27, it aimed for a valuation of $5.65 billion at the original price target. Positive Outlook For Crypto IPOs By going public, Circle will be subject to US securities laws, including mandatory quarterly earnings reports and regulatory disclosures, which are designed to establish trust among conservative investors, banks, and government entities. In a strategic move, Circle recently launched its stablecoin-powered cross-border payments network, known as the Circle Payments Network (CPN). This network facilitates various financial transactions, including business-to-business (B2B) supplier payments, cross-border remittances , global cash consolidations, payroll, and mass disbursements. Earlier this year, the firm also acquired Hashnote, the issuer of the USYC stablecoin, which was developed by Cumberland Labs. This integration aims to position USYC as a preferred yield-bearing collateral on cryptocurrency exchanges, custodians, and with prime brokers alongside Circle’s existing USDC stablecoin. Matt Kennedy, a senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, commented on the positive outlook for cryptocurrency IPOs last week, stating that the current climate is more favorable than it has been in the past three years. He attributed this optimism to improved trade negotiations between the US and key trading partners, which have revitalized the IPO market and mitigated the effects of previous tariffs. For its upcoming offering, Circle intends to sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders, including venture capital firms Accel and General Catalyst, will offer an additional 14.4 million shares. Notably, ARK Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, has expressed interest in purchasing up to $150 million worth of shares during the stablecoin issuer’s initial public offering.

2025-06-03T08:29:54,"Monero Bull Run Accelerating, XMR-BTC Price Chart Signals","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency monero (XMR) has outperformed bitcoin BTC this year, and the trend is likely to continue in the coming weeks. That's the message from the XMR-BTC ratio trading on Poloniex. The ratio representing XMR's bitcoin-denominated price recently rose to the highest since January 2024, confirming a ""double-bottom"" breakout on the weekly time frame. The double bottom comprises two consecutive peaks with lows at about the same price, representing an exhaustion of the preceding downtrend. It also includes a horizontal line, called the neckline resistance, drawn connecting the temporary recovery between the two troughs. A move past the neckline is said to confirm the breakout or a bearish-bullish shift in the market trend. The ratio carved out two troughs at around 0.00165 early this year and recently broke above the neckline resistance, indicating a double-bottom bullish reversal. In other words, XMR has likely begun a new bull run relative to bitcoin. The pair's move above the Ichimoku cloud also suggests the same. The bullish outlook risks invalidation in case of a renewed dip below the double top support (former resistance). Monero has surged 86% this year, outperforming Bitcoin's 12% rise by a significant margin, according to CoinDesk data.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/03/monero-bull-run-impending-xmr-btc-price-chart-signals,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XMR","Markets|XMR|Monero|Bitcoin|Markets|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T08:27:08,"Best Crypto to Buy Now: Ignore the Price — This Metric Screams Accumulation","If you’re still waiting for the perfect price, you might already be late. In 2025, the smartest traders aren’t focused on candles—they’re watching wallet activity. One behavioral metric has quietly appeared before every major rally in cryptocurrency history. It has nothing to do with hype and everything to do with conviction. When long-term holders begin accumulating and social mentions spike at the same time, something’s happening. This was true in 2017, again in 2021, and it’s beginning to resurface now. If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy now, this data matters more than headlines ever will. Let’s break down the pattern—and the top cryptocurrencies and a presale coin ( Dawgz AI ) flashing the signal today. The One Metric That Keeps Predicting Bull Runs Wallet accumulation combined with rising community engagement. That’s the metric. Platforms like Santiment, DefiLlama, and Glassnode track wallet growth, exchange outflows, and social sentiment. When those metrics converge, it signals quiet market conviction—investors buying without announcing it. Right now, these signs are flashing again. Not just for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but for emerging projects. That’s why this April, many are watching Dawgz AI, Ethereum, and one other token with mounting long-term holder interest. If you’re scanning for the best crypto to buy now , this signal should be your first filter—not price. Dawgz AI – Behavioral Signals Backed by Growth Dawgz AI isn’t trending for its memes. It’s trending because real money is moving in. This Ethereum-based project blends meme culture with serious AI-powered utility. At a current presale price of just $0.00438, it’s caught early attention thanks to its trading bots, blockchain staking tools, and real-time analytics built for user growth. It’s not hype—it’s data. Wallet accumulation is up. Social mentions are increasing. And over $3.6 million has already been raised. Why Dawgz AI May Be the Best Crypto to Buy Now: AI-Powered Trading: Bots trade markets 24/7, built to grow your holdings. Day-One Staking: Hold and earn from the start—staking is live from presale. Multi-Chain Vision: Ethereum native, expanding to blockchain platforms like Solana. SolidProof Audit : Complete audit transparency, a rarity in meme-backed tokens. Community Momentum: Daily growth in holders, mentions, and investor engagement. This metric isn’t just appearing—it’s accelerating. If you're searching for a crypto to buy this April, Dawgz AI stands out as one of the top opportunities. Ethereum – Still the Smart Money Favorite Ethereum is more than just the OG smart contract layer. It remains a backbone for the cryptocurrency economy. Now trading at $2,720.97, with a $301.57 billion market cap, Ethereum is still seeing growth in active wallets. That’s not price chasing—that’s conviction. After the 2022 merge to proof-of-stake, Ethereum slashed its energy usage by 99.98%. It now powers thousands of DeFi apps, blockchain games, NFT protocols, and DAOs. All while maintaining dominance across exchanges and dev networks. If you’re looking for a crypto for long term hold, Ethereum remains a foundation—respected by institutions and sought after by individual traders alike. Wallet inflows, rising validator counts, and consistent market traction show that Ethereum is far from done. Bitcoin – Watch the Reserve, Not Just the Chart Still leading the cryptocurrency sector, Bitcoin has evolved into a macro asset. Currently priced at $108,462 with a $2.13 trillion cap, BTC is again the focus of serious capital. Why? U.S. regulators have announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, triggering a new round of institutional accumulation. But here’s what matters most—the outflows. Exchange withdrawals are rising. On-chain wallets holding BTC long-term are increasing. This is the same signal that appeared pre-2017 and pre-2021 rallies. If you’re still wondering about the best crypto to buy now, Bitcoin might not be cheap, but it's still a foundational hold for many. The long-term signals are flashing green. Why This Metric Could Define 2025’s Bull Run Price is noisy. But data? Data is direction. Wallet activity, staking behaviors, and social engagement all reveal where serious investors are focusing. Platforms like Glassnode have shown these same behavioral trends in every major crypto rally—and they’re showing up again. In 2025, invest based on what wallets are doing, not what influencers are saying. This month, Dawgz AI is tracking similar patterns to early-stage stars like SHIB and PEPE before they ran. But unlike those tokens, Dawgz brings actual utility with AI systems, blockchain staking, and an audited framework. So if you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, focus on the data that actually moves the needle. 3 Reasons These Coins Top the List Right Now Here’s why Dawgz AI, Ethereum, and Bitcoin stand out as the best cryptocurrencies to watch this month: Early Accumulation Patterns: Wallet growth is rising before price jumps. Real-World Utility: Whether it’s Ethereum’s smart contracts or Dawgz AI’s trading tools, these coins have something functional. Community Momentum: Social and wallet data align—indicating strong conviction, not just short-term hype. This is what investors should be watching—not just candlesticks or price pumps. Final Thoughts: Stay Ahead by Watching Behavior, Not Buzz In 2025, the game has changed. Those chasing quick pumps are getting left behind. Long-term success comes from reading the blockchain, not just the charts. Behavioral data like wallet inflows and social volume shows what the smart money is doing before the rest of the market catches on. And right now? Dawgz AI is showing the best mix of momentum, traction, and accumulation. It’s an early-stage crypto to buy now—not because of hype, but because the metrics say so. Don’t wait for headlines. Follow the wallets. FAQs Section Which coin has 1000x potential? While no coin guarantees this kind of growth, presale tokens like Dawgz AI offer the early entry points and behavioral momentum that suggest strong upside potential. Which crypto coin will boom next? Coins showing rising wallet activity and social volume—like Ethereum and Dawgz AI—are positioned for strong movement. These indicators have preceded previous bull runs. Which crypto will skyrocket?

2025-06-03T08:22:57,"What are the hottest crypto payment cards this cycle, and how to get them?","Crypto payment cards have become increasingly popular in recent years as a means of spending digital assets in everyday scenarios. Once seen solely as an investment, cryptocurrencies in 2025 are widely being used for payments, particularly by younger, tech-savvy users who seek convenience without sacrificing control over their finances. A recent study by Coupon Follow reveals that 42% of U.S. millennials have used cryptocurrency for purchases in the past year, marking a 12% increase since 2022. With more people looking to spend their crypto, several new payment cards now make the leap from wallet to checkout much easier. Here are five widely used options for spending crypto: Crypto.com Visa card Launched in 2018 following a partnership between crypto exchange Crypto.com and payments giant Visa, the Crypto.com Visa Card was one of the first mainstream offerings to connect digital assets with real-world spending. It allows users to top up using cryptocurrencies held in their Crypto.com wallet, which are then automatically converted into fiat at the time of purchase. What sets it apart is its tiered rewards structure based on the amount of CRO, Crypto.com’s native token, that a user stakes. Depending on the tier, cardholders can earn up to 5% cash back in CRO on everyday purchases, along with benefits such as free subscriptions to Spotify and Netflix, as well as airport lounge access for premium users. Further, there are no annual fees, and the card works anywhere Visa is accepted. The Crypto.com Visa Card is available across the U.S., U.K., European Economic Area (EEA), Canada, Singapore, and several Asia-Pacific markets. Users can apply directly through the Crypto.com app by completing identity verification and choosing their preferred card tier. Once approved, a physical card is mailed out, and a virtual card is immediately accessible for online use.

Users can link their Wirex app to the card and instantly convert crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDC into fiat at the point of sale. The card offers up to 8% cashback in WXT, Wirex’s native token, on eligible purchases, with no monthly maintenance or exchange fees. The Wirex Card is currently available across the U.K., EEA, and parts of the Asia-Pacific region. It can be ordered directly through the Wirex app following standard identity verification, and users receive both a physical card and a virtual version for online transactions. RedotPay card The RedotPay Card supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, with the option to automatically convert to fiat currency at checkout. Backed by Visa, the card can be used at over 130 million merchants globally and is compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay in select regions.

It is currently available in most major markets, including the U.S., U.K., and several countries across Asia and Europe. Users can apply through the RedotPay website after completing basic KYC verification. Coinbase card The Coinbase card was also launched in partnership with Visa, allowing direct crypto spending from a user’s Coinbase account with the option of automatic conversion to fiat at the point of sale. One of the card’s notable features is its rotating crypto rewards program, which is currently limited to users in the United States . Users there can earn up to 4% back in various cryptocurrencies on eligible purchases. It is accepted at over 40 million merchants worldwide that accept Visa, and supports integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay for contactless payments. To obtain the Coinbase Card, users must have a verified Coinbase account. After completing identity verification, they can apply for the card through the Coinbase app or website. Once approved, a virtual card is available for immediate use, and a physical card is mailed to the user. Burner card As opposed to standard crypto payment cards, the Burner Card has been positioned as a lightweight tool for gifting or using it as a portable cold storage. Developed by Burner.pro, it functions as a tap-to-use self-custody wallet embedded in an NFC-enabled smart card. Each Burner Card is configured for a specific blockchain, with current options supporting Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Base. Users can currently store assets, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, or the gasless stablecoin USD II, directly on the cards, which can be accessed via a smartphone.

The move reflects a growing trend among Nordic companies to incorporate Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. Initial Purchase and Future Plans On June 2, NBX confirmed the acquisition of 6 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $633,700. The firm aims to increase its holdings to 10 BTC before the end of June. The company is also in talks to raise additional capital to expand its Bitcoin position. By the close of June 2’s trading day, NBX shares had surged by 138.5%, ending at 0.033 euros ($0.038), according to Google Finance. Despite this jump, the stock remains far below its all-time high of 0.93 euros ($1.06), which it reached in January 2022. Bitcoin as Collateral and Operational Tool NBX plans to use its newly acquired Bitcoin to support the issuance of USDM, a stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain. The Bitcoin will also generate yield within the Cardano ecosystem. The platform stated, “Bitcoin is becoming an important part of the global financial infrastructure.” NBX believes the holdings will enhance “operational efficiency” and attract capital from crypto-curious businesses. The company also revealed ambitions to explore Bitcoin-backed loans as part of a broader effort to evolve into a digital asset bank. Growing Bitcoin Adoption in Norway NBX is not alone in embracing Bitcoin. Norwegian industrial giant Aker ASA entered the space in 2021 by creating a crypto-focused subsidiary, Seetee, which now holds 1,170 BTC. According to Bitcointreasuries.net, Aker bought its Bitcoin at an average cost of $50,200, with current holdings valued at approximately $123 million. Another Norwegian brokerage, K33, has raised 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) to begin purchasing Bitcoin, signaling wider interest among regional firms. Even Norway’s central wealth fund is indirectly exposed—Norges Bank held 3,821 BTC via equity investments by the end of 2024. Global Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries NBX’s stock rally mirrors other cases where firms gained after announcing Bitcoin investments. France’s Blockchain Group revealed its Bitcoin buy in November 2023 and saw its stock rise 225% to 0.48 euros. In Indonesia, DigiAsia Corp announced a $100 million Bitcoin investment plan, prompting a 91% increase in its stock price.

Now, with the Bitcoin price recoiling from hitting a new all-time high above $111,000, the crypto analyst is back with next steps and where the cryptocurrency could be headed from here. Why The Bitcoin Price Golden Cross Matters In his X post, Doctor Profit starts out by explaining the psychology of the current market, calling out those who continue to call out for a bear market. He refers to these people as ‘exit liquidity’ for the real players, hinting that they’re wrong for their stance. Rather, he points out an important formation in the Bitcoin price chart and that is the Golden Cross, which appeared last week. Related Reading: 312 Million Dogecoin Moved To Coinbase – What’s Going On? The analyst calls the appearance of this Golden Cross “a macro-level signal with historic accuracy.” He explains that since this signal is so rare, but has been right every time, there is no reason to deviate from it. Also, he further explains that the Golden Cross has always been a long-game signal. Hence, results are not expected to start showing so early. The Golden Cross pattern had appeared on the weekly chart, and the crypto analyst highlights its historical accuracy. Each time that the Bitcoin price has formed this Golden Cross, it has usually led to a multi-month rally. If this is the case this cycle, then it suggests that the Bitcoin bull run is far from over. Don’t Worry About The Bears After the Golden Cross pattern appeared, another concerning development had taken place on the Bitcoin price chart and that is a bearish divergence on the weekly timeframe. Normally, this means an end to the rally and that the price could start to plummet. However, the crypto analyst seems unfazed by this. He refers to a similar bearish divergence appearing when the Bitcoin price was trading at $80,000 and nothing happened. Since the cryptocurrency had continued its bullish run at that point, the analyst takes this as a hint that the bearish divergence is lagging and only appeared due to Donald Trump’s tariff announcement last week. “No actionable value here,” Doctor Profit said. Things To Watch Out For So far, Doctor Profit attributes the drawdown in the Bitcoin price to “standard cycle behavior.” This includes profit-taking from short-term holders who bought in the last six months, while long-term holders remain unmoved. Another bullish factor includes the fact that BlackRock’s outflows remain low despite Trump’s renewed tariff war.

Also, the Bitcoin price has been recording higher highs and higher lows after recording its bottom at $74,000, which shows trend support remains strong. The Bitcoin price is also trading above all major moving averages (MAs), including the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages. Last but not least, Doctor Profit also pointed out that the MACD line has crossed above the signal line on the weekly chart. This means that momentum remains in favor of the bulls. Given this, the analyst believes “there is no reason to be scared at all.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-to-104000/,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|analyst|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news",cryptocompare

On Monday, Ardoino said that the transfer would help support their investment in Bitcoin treasury firm Twenty One Capital . He wrote on X that the transfer is a part of the “pre-funding of the initial convert/equity raise in Twenty One Capital.” Tether Group had moved 4812.22029710 BTC to address bc1qzup4k7zn9jur7a8kz0dnaernzyf60h8ez6s9cpmp23wfw5djhvusd4p0v3 as part of the pre-funding of the initial convert/equity raise in Twenty One Capital (XXI) https://t.co/SqhVRzq3k9 — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) June 2, 2025 Twenty One Capital, led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers , is backed by major players, including Bitfinex, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald.

Twenty One Capital Aims to Be Transparent in BTC Reserves Inspired by Michael Saylors’s Strategy, which became a market leader by taking on corporate debt to buy Bitcoin, Twenty One aims to amass as much as 42,000 BTC, which would put it among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in the world. Mallers noted that the company will show proof-of-reserves to keep all its Bitcoin accumulation transparent. “As Bitcoiners, we hear a lot about how Wall Street has arrived to Bitcoin,” he wrote on X last week. “With Twenty One, Bitcoin has arrived on Wall Street.” Announcing Proof of Reserves for Twenty One As Bitcoiners, we hear a lot about how Wall Street has arrived to #Bitcoin . With Twenty One, #Bitcoin has arrived on Wall Street. Don't trust, verify. pic.twitter.com/johay8PJFI — Jack Mallers (@jackmallers) May 29, 2025 The company will be publishing multiple addresses over the next week proving its Bitcoin reserves, he said in another post. “All these professional economists, they are like Bitcoin is risky and volatile, no it’s not,” said Mallers during the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas. Company to Sell $100M in New Convertible Notes to Buy BTC In a separate announcement made last week, Mallers said that the company will sell $100 million in new convertible notes. The proceeds from the sale will go toward buying more Bitcoin, he added. Twenty One Capital will be going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Cantor Equity Partners (CEP). The combined company will trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol ‘XXI’ upon the deal’s closure.
