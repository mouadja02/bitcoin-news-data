2025-06-03T17:47:27,"Expert Projects Timeline When 10,000 XRP Will Cost You $150,000","A bold prediction about XRP’s future valuation is stirring renewed interest in long-term accumulation. In a recent post on X, crypto influencer X Finance Bull suggested that by 2030, the cost of 10,000 XRP could exceed $150,000, translating to a price of $15 per token or more. Drawing attention to rapid institutional adoption and supportive AI-driven projections from platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and GROK, the analyst argued that the retail window for affordable XRP may be closing fast. This projection, while optimistic, resonates with a growing chorus of voices in the XRP community who believe the token is structurally undervalued. As Ripple expands its global financial partnerships and as utility-driven demand for XRP gains traction, the case for a substantial revaluation is being taken more seriously, especially among long-term holders. 10,000 $XRP sounds cheap now? Just wait By 2030, it could cost $150K… or more AI projections like GROK, ChatGPT and Gemini are screaming one thing: retail is getting priced out. Fast If you don’t stack now, you may never afford it later #XRP accumulation season is ending pic.twitter.com/RJLcY7j2GX — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) June 2, 2025 The $150K Valuation: Ambitious, but Not Baseless The suggestion that 10,000 XRP could be worth $150,000 in less than a decade is grounded in several key assumptions: widespread adoption of Ripple’s blockchain technology, XRP’s growing utility in cross-border payments and tokenized asset flows, and favorable regulatory outcomes. While skeptics may balk at such high projections, it’s worth noting that the crypto market has witnessed similarly dramatic transformations before. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum underwent massive re-pricings within a single cycle, often defying expectations and valuation models. X Finance Bull’s post captures this potential, stressing that current market prices may not reflect the long-term trajectory of XRP’s role in financial infrastructure. With prices still hovering under the $1 mark at press time, the implied valuation of $15 per XRP by 2030 would represent a 15x increase from today’s levels, a scenario that is plausible if Ripple’s technology becomes integral to the back-end of international finance. AI Models Echo Long-Term Optimism Supporting the narrative are forecasts from leading artificial intelligence platforms. While AI models like ChatGPT, GROK, and Gemini do not offer real-time financial advice or investment guarantees, they have shown broad consensus in identifying XRP as one of the few cryptocurrencies with tangible utility, regulatory resilience, and enterprise-grade adoption. These platforms have evaluated XRP within the context of its use cases: real-time settlement, liquidity provisioning, and tokenized asset interoperability. Based on these functions and market trends, they consistently rank XRP among the most likely tokens to benefit from long-term institutional integration. While not a guarantee of price, these AI-driven outlooks reinforce the sentiment that XRP may be entering a phase where scarcity and demand could push valuations significantly higher. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Retail Window May Be Closing One of the most pointed warnings in X Finance Bull’s post is the suggestion that “retail is getting priced out. Fast.” As history has shown with Bitcoin, early accumulation opportunities tend to diminish quickly once institutional demand surges and retail liquidity thins out. XRP’s growing integration into banking corridors via Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution already puts it in a different category from purely speculative tokens. The post also frames the current market as the tail end of the “accumulation season”—a phase where patient investors acquire undervalued assets before the rest of the market recognizes their full potential. If XRP follows the same path as Bitcoin post-2016 or Ethereum in early 2020, the current price range may eventually be seen as a missed opportunity. Looking Ahead to 2030 While no projection is immune to market cycles or external risks, the $150,000 valuation for 10,000 XRP reflects a credible long-term thesis: that utility-driven tokens with institutional backing and a proven track record will eventually see re-pricing to reflect their foundational role in the new financial order. For those still on the sidelines, the message from analysts like X Finance Bull is clear—delaying may come at a cost. If current trends continue, the window to accumulate XRP at sub-$1 levels could be closing, and by 2030, the cost of entry might be out of reach for most retail investors.

2025-06-03T17:45:28,"XRP Ledger Activity Drops After Strong Start to 2025","The XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized blockchain network, has seen its platform’s activity slow down sharply. Recent data has shown fewer transactions and less overall use on the network. This came after XRPL started strong this year. This marks a significant shift in the usual transaction volume on the ledger, which is popularly known for its speed and low-cost transaction fees. XRPL Sees Noticeable Drop in Transactions and Users Since March, payment activity on the XRP Ledger has dropped sharply. Transactions fell to 320,747, the lowest level since October last year. This marks a sharp drop from over 1 million monthly transactions in 2025. Data from XRPScan also shows fewer people are using the network, with active addresses dropping below 10,000, the lowest since October. Notably, these addresses represent individual users making payments or other actions. The amount of XRP burned as transaction fees dropped to just 1,500 XRP, showing fewer overall transactions. Fewer new accounts are being created, too, and each new account usually requires a 1 XRP reserve. This slowdown comes after a strong start to the year. According to Messari, from January to March, transaction activity on XRPL jumped 36%, and active users rose by 142%. This remarkable growth underscores the increasing adoption and utilization of the XRPL network. XRP Struggles While Bitcoin Thrives Market watchers have compared Ripple’s native token XRP to Bitcoin (BTC) market movement. While the flagship crypto recently reached a price peak of over $110,000 in late May, XRP grew by 62%. The token climbed from $1.60 to $2.60, benefiting from the general market recovery. However, XRP has slowed down since then and has not returned to its January peak of $3.40. This shows that XRP is not growing as fast as Bitcoin anymore. Meanwhile, macroeconomics and market uncertainty play a significant role in pressuring crypto’s trajectory. According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP is trading at $2.22 at the time of writing, up 3.25% in the last 24 hours . Ripple’s Moves Strengthen the XRP Ecosystem Ripple, the company behind the XRPL project, has made big moves lately . The fintech company bought Hidden Road in April , becoming the first crypto firm to run a global prime brokerage. This move is expected to improve XRP liquidity and trading services. More recently, Ripple’s new stablecoin RLUSD also got approved by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). This means RLUSD can now be used in Dubai’s leading financial center, opening new doors for Ripple. Looking ahead, Ripple is getting ready to host its XRP Ledger Apex 2025 event in Singapore from June 10 to 12. This event could bring more updates and attract new interest in the XRPL and Ripple’s associated token.

2025-06-03T17:38:24,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Top Analysts Predict A Stronger, Sustained Bull Run","Zoom out on the charts, and the current market trend looks less like a fluke and more like a reset in motion. Bitcoin’s recent dip followed a fresh all-time high, but rather than triggering panic, it’s exposing a deeper shift. This isn’t the top, some say. Analysts tied to major funds continue to allocate, and their tone hasn’t softened either. Skeptics focus on the drop, but those tracking institutional moves are seeing conviction, not hesitation. The old four-year rhythm may be breaking apart. Momentum hasn’t vanished; it’s moving under the surface, quiet and forceful. To those watching closely, the price action feels less like the end of a cycle and more like the middle of something bigger. Quiet Accumulation May Indicate Strong Market Conviction When it comes to BTC accumulation, the company that stands at the forefront right now may be MicroStrategy, and it doesn’t seem to be scaling back. Its most recent purchase adds to an already massive position, reflecting how certain institutions now treat Bitcoin as a long-term reserve embraced by leading investors. A growing number of firms, from asset managers to international funds are slowly building exposure. They're not waiting for clarity. They believe it’s already here. This is why this crypto cycle will be bigger and last longer than most people think.Applications and real world use cases were artificially suppressed by the hostile regulatory environment of 2020-2024. But the infrastructure kept improving, and is now remarkably robust — high… https://t.co/NlKCrG25lS — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) May 29, 2025 Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan suggests this entire cycle may outlast the historical norm. Years of regulatory friction suppressed application growth, but the groundwork kept evolving. With new policies forming and political voices like Trump calling digital assets a national priority, analysts now expect faster deployment of real-world crypto use cases. Hougan describes the current moment as compressed potential. He argues that volatility will remain, but major pullbacks are likely to be shorter and shallower than before. There’s simply more diversity in the investor base, and fewer sellers among them. Funds, governments, and crypto-native firms are holding steady and their models are built on longer timelines. They’re not chasing parabolic moves, but rather on the lookout for staking claims. The market may look uncertain on the surface, but those who’ve studied its depth aren’t backing away. They’re buying quietly while others hesitate, likely sitting on massive profits already given the recent all-time high level it crossed. Best Crypto to Buy Now As the Bull Market Looks Ready to Pump Further SUBBD A few years ago, creators were chasing platform partnerships and algorithm visibility. Now, the most ambitious ones are asking how to leave the platforms entirely. SUBBD was built for that moment. It isn’t some half-formed idea still waiting on use cases. Its token underpins a direct, creator-led economy where artists, writers, streamers, and niche builders can monetize their audiences without losing ownership to middlemen or advertising logic. What separates SUBBD from other attempts is that it isn’t just about tipping or digital collectibles. The token is functional, not decorative. Fans can use it to unlock gated content, vote on creative decisions, stake for early access, and even receive a share of revenue from projects they support. This means activity around the token reflects real creative exchange rather than pure speculation. $SUBBD Presale Hits $500k! Embracing the future of AI Agent content creation... https://t.co/dLCKejpxpp pic.twitter.com/AFeslybq8A — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) May 24, 2025 In the context of a prolonged bull run, this becomes more relevant. As institutions and large investors settle into long-term crypto allocations, the attention turns to projects that carry economic weight beyond charts. SUBBD appeals to that shift. It’s aligned with the decentralization of culture, not just finance. And as creators continue to look for a way out of the algorithm trap, a token that powers a fully self-hosted ecosystem feels like more than a niche experiment. It’s not a coin pretending to be a movement. It’s a protocol designed for a transition that’s already happening. Solaxy Solaxy doesn’t market itself with claims of domination. It isn’t trying to outpace Ethereum or absorb Solana’s traffic. Its purpose is far less dramatic and far more useful: build clean, efficient links between chains that are too often siloed. That goal makes it easy to overlook and easy to underestimate. But it’s precisely this utility-first approach that could carry it through the kind of longer, steadier bull market many now expect. At the technical level, Solaxy serves as a high-throughput Layer 2 capable of routing value between networks that often struggle to communicate directly. In practice, this means fewer bottlenecks, lower costs, and a smoother user experience across ecosystems. For developers, this opens the door to applications that no longer need to bet on one chain’s future. For token holders, it creates staking and liquidity options that are both competitive and flexible. These functions matter more in a market driven by practical adoption than speculative bursts. As major funds and infrastructure players prepare for a multi-year upcycle, they’re gravitating toward tools that solve problems instead of chasing trends. Solaxy has already launched its staking program, issued its native token, and begun expanding support for new dApps. It doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel. It just needs to keep building smoother roads across fragmented territory. In a cycle where institutional interest is growing but still cautious, projects like Solaxy offer something rare: quiet relevance and technical endurance. BTC Bull Plenty of tokens talk about “community,” but BTC Bull hardwires it into the product. Its model is built around a simple but effective mechanism: as Bitcoin crosses certain price levels, token holders receive automatic rewards. Each milestone triggers a distribution event. There’s no guessing, no lotteries, and no passive waiting. It’s a token built to move with Bitcoin, not in its shadow. This gives BTC Bull a very specific kind of utility. It allows users to ride Bitcoin’s strength in real time, turning price milestones into scheduled moments of shared upside. But it doesn’t stop there. Every airdrop is paired with a burn, steadily reducing the total supply. Over time, this dynamic creates an incentive loop that rewards early adoption, long holding periods, and continued engagement. What makes this interesting in the current market is how well it fits with the evolving mood of crypto investors. Institutions may be buying Bitcoin in record quantities, but retail investors are looking for ways to connect with that movement without chasing risky leverage or speculative bets. BTC Bull offers an answer. It’s not trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s giving everyday users a structured way to benefit from its growth. In a market where many projects still rely on narrative momentum, BTC Bull’s structure speaks for itself. It reacts to real price events and rewards real participation. That’s enough to make it relevant and perhaps more resilient as the cycle matures. Snorter At first glance, Snorter looks like another internet joke minted onto a blockchain. It’s named after a pig, branded like a parody, and talks more like a meme than a protocol. But dig a little deeper and it becomes clear why this project has caught the attention of early buyers who aren’t just here for a laugh. Snorter is doing what so many meme tokens fail to even attempt: backing its popularity with actual functionality. The team has introduced utility that stretches far beyond the typical community token playbook. Holders can stake their SNORT tokens for rewards, but the staking model is tied to both participation and engagement. This means that the more active the community, the better the reward dynamics. There’s also a built-in deflationary system designed to gradually reduce supply based on on-chain activity, creating stronger alignment between users and token health over time. What’s interesting is how Snorter positions itself during a market phase where major players are becoming more serious. Popular crypto channels including 99Bitcoins have covered the project as one of the top potential picks to consider this season. It makes sense, as the project uses humor to draw attention, but doesn’t rely on it to survive. Behind the branding is a smart contract system designed to keep the project breathing through multiple market cycles, with mechanisms that adapt to liquidity shifts, user participation, and staking depth. In a cycle that could stretch longer than usual, projects like Snorter stand a better chance than they seem to at first. It's funny on the surface, but what it’s building isn’t a joke. Conclusion When the charts zoom out and the noise clears, it’s rarely the loudest tokens that last. Projects with clear roles, built-in utility, and quiet confidence tend to hold ground while others churn in and out of relevance. If this really is the beginning of a longer, stronger bull market, as many believe, the most worthwhile investment bets may not be the ones making headlines but the ones working on utility and investors-oriented solutions, preparing to survive the years that follow.

2025-06-03T17:35:09,"Russia to introduce higher investment ceiling for digital financial assets","The Central Bank of Russia has proposed to increase the maximum amount of money ordinary Russians can put into regulated digital assets. The change comes in a draft circular updating the regulator’s requirements for tokenized assets that Russian investors can acquire legally in the country. Russia to introduce higher investment ceiling for digital financial assets The Bank of Russia is trying to raise an annual limit on digital asset purchases for non-qualified investors to 1 million rubles (more than $12,600 currently), according to a draft directive amending rules for offerings in this strictly regulated market. The document, released for public consultations, concerns “digital financial assets” (DFAs) as described in Russian law. These are usually tokenized real assets issued by CBR-authorized platforms on private blockchains, the Russian biz news outlet RBC noted in a report. The category also includes “digital rights,” or digital representations of monetary claims and investor rights, including foreign digital rights (FDRs) approved for circulation in the Russian Federation. The definition covers some cryptocurrencies, mainly stablecoins. The Bank of Russia’s proposal expands access to DFAs for ordinary Russians as it aims to increase the limit, which currently stands at 600,000 rubles (approx. $7,600). The monetary authority said it’s acting in response to requests from participants in the developing DFA market. Both citizens and companies will be able to invest in DFAs, but the CBR divides them into three groups – qualified investors, investors subject to the annual limit, and investors facing no restrictions, with the latter two being non-qualified investors. Russian companies to buy digital assets without restrictions According to the draft , legal entities will be permitted to acquire DFAs without any limits, even if they are not recognized as qualified investors. The goal is to allow businesses to more actively use digital financial assets, including in trade which has been affected by Western sanctions. Non-qualified investors will be granted access to a wide range of DFAs such as those based on shares, bonds, foreign currencies, precious metals, oil, and index instruments, up to the specified 1 million-ruble limit, RBC detailed. At the same time, the Bank of Russia admits only “ highly qualified ” investors to decentralized crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC). To be accepted as such, private individuals would have to prove annual income of at least 50 million rubles (over $633,000) and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (almost $1.27 million). The CBR updated its regulations for FDRs last month, introducing stricter rules for foreign digital rights recognized as digital assets entering the Russian market. According to one of the requirements, these FDRs should not be linked to securities issued by organizations based in “unfriendly nations.” The Russian central bank also emphasized issuers and payment processors should not be able to freeze such assets and that the FDRs must not certify rights to receive cryptocurrencies that are prohibited in Russia. In practice, these conditions close the door for popular stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. The new rules were unveiled after in March, Tether blocked 2.5 billion rubles’ worth of assets in wallets hosted by the sanctioned Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex . The coin trading platform has been accused by the U.S. of assisting criminals, laundering money and violating sanctions against Russia. Following Tether’s move, the government in Moscow went as far as to announce that its finance ministry is considering issuing a Russian stablecoin, similar to the USDT in design but pegged to a different fiat currency, not the U.S. dollar. The Central Bank of Russia will be accepting suggestions and comments on the proposed regulations for digital financial assets until June 15. They will enter into force 10 days after the official release of the circular, the regulator said.

Top officials at the Equitable Bank in Waterford, Wisconsin, say they are fed up with the increasing scams targeting seniors, reports TMJ4 News. Says Equitable Bank branch manager Dawn Jurgensen, “Fraud is just crazy now. Every day, these fraudsters are creating new ways to scam people.” The bank’s six branches across the state are receiving at least one fraud report per day targeting seniors or others. The bank’s officials are holding community events to educate residents about the fraud and ways to protect themselves. They are also working with the Wisconsin Bankers Association to urge state lawmakers to pass tougher anti-fraud regulations. Says Erin Arneson, the Equitable Bank’s vice president of retail banking, “We were able to tell them how important it is that they push through the legislation that will help us help our elderly customers.” Among the new regulations the bankers are asking for is the ability to slow down suspicious transactions, including when there are large cash withdrawals.

The Solana memecoin is now nipping at DogWifHat’s heels as traders bet on feline dominance in the $65 billion meme sector. With its market cap exploding past fallen giants like $PNUT, this cat-themed token proves memecoins still have nine lives. Investors are loving it and they are hungry for the next viral predator. Community-Driven or Hype-Fueled? Why Traders Are Betting Big on $POPCAT At press time, $POPCAT is trading around $0.412, bouncing from an intraday low of $0.3546 to a local high of $0.4268. Many observers credit the token’s meteoric rise to its limitless meme appeal, strong community backing, and popularity among leveraged traders who view it as the ultimate money-printing memecoin. According to DexScreener, $POPCAT now boasts over 142,000 holders and 53 liquidity providers, reflecting its substantial community on the Solana network.

While nothing is certain in crypto markets, the current technical picture appears favorable for $POPCAT holders. $POPCAT Bull Case Builds, But Support at $0.25 Must Hold to Avoid Trend Breakdown Following its rally from the early accumulation zone, $POPCAT consistently formed higher lows through March to early May, supported by an ascending trendline, an indicator of sustained buying interest. However, the price recently fell below that trendline, indicating a short-term loss of momentum. Even so, $POPCAT seems to be stabilizing, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounding from 40 and currently sitting at 47.33. Source: TradingView This indicates that selling pressure is subsiding, and bullish momentum could return if RSI breaks above 50. Looking ahead, if buyers reclaim control, the next major resistance sits at $0.5707. A successful breakout above that level could pave the way for a move toward $0.7692 and potentially a retest of $1.0074, a key level from late December 2024. Conversely, if support doesn’t hold, $POPCAT may revisit the $0.20–$0.25 range.

2025-06-03T16:43:16,"Live Coin Watch Trading Anomaly: Bitcoin Solaris Accumulation Pattern Mirrors Bitcoin’s 2010-2013 Smart Money Phase","Every crypto bull market has its silent build-up phase—the calm before the explosion—when “smart money” quietly accumulates. According to a recent Live Coin Watch anomaly, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) may be showing the exact same accumulation pattern seen in Bitcoin’s legendary 2010–2013 phase. For those who’ve dreamed of catching the next early Bitcoin, this may be the only real shot left. But what makes Bitcoin Solaris fundamentally different from today’s sea of altcoins? Let’s dig in. The Smart Money Phase: How Early Bitcoin Accumulation Looked Back in the early 2010s, Bitcoin was ignored by most and scooped up by a few. These investors weren’t driven by hype—they were motivated by the tech, the scarcity, and the belief that decentralized money could transform the world. That’s the exact kind of quiet build-up Bitcoin Solaris is now experiencing, and according to trading watchers, the accumulation is no longer subtle. Today’s altcoin market is flooded with trendy tokens that swing wildly, yet offer no real protection. With recent top losers like Dogwifhat, Injective, and PEPE plummeting between 10–17% in a single 24-hour cycle, it’s clear many tokens are fueled by speculation, not structure. Why Bitcoin Solaris Isn’t Like Other Altcoins Bitcoin Solaris was built to solve crypto’s long-standing flaws—not ride its hype. It’s not just about fast TPS or flashy features. It’s about a blockchain that was designed from the ground up to mirror Bitcoin’s value architecture but add next-gen scalability, accessibility, and earning potential. Here’s what sets it apart: Dual-layer architecture: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Contribution for security and decentralization. The Solaris Layer incorporates advanced mechanisms for speed and network coordination. 10,000+ TPS with 2-second finality: Matches top-tier throughput while ensuring stable processing. Mobile-first mining: Unlike complex Bitcoin rigs, BTC-S mining is accessible via the upcoming Solaris Nova App—bringing wealth-building potential to anyone with a phone. Hybrid consensus: Flexibly blends decentralization and scalability through a system designed for real-world growth. Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed Liquid Staking: Full Flexibility, Full Rewards One standout feature helping Bitcoin Solaris attract real accumulation is its liquid staking model. Users can stake their BTC-S and receive 1:1 sBTC-S tokens, which remain fully tradable and usable in DeFi ecosystems. Benefits of this system include: Rewards without restrictions: Earn staking income while still being able to use your funds. DeFi-ready sBTC-S: Compatible with liquidity pools, lending, and more. Efficiency: Integrated directly with the upcoming Solaris Nova App. Security and trust: Validator selection is automated, reducing technical barriers for users. Bitcoin Solaris’s Explosive Presale Growth While most altcoins stumble through market cycles, BTC-S has engineered one of the strongest presale growth runs seen in years. We’re now in Phase 6 , and momentum hasn’t slowed. Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% With just around 8 weeks remaining until the July 31 launch, the numbers say it all—over $1.8 million raised and 11,000+ unique users joined. Industry veterans are calling it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. Referral System: A Network Built by the Community Another catalyst fueling this smart money movement? Bitcoin Solaris’s double rewards referral program . Referrers earn 5% in BTC-S tokens for every referral purchase. Referred users receive a 5% bonus on their token allocation. This model promotes genuine community growth, not hollow marketing pushes—precisely the kind of momentum that sustains long-term adoption. Influencer Buzz and Market Validation Interest is soaring, and it’s not just investors paying attention. A deep dive by influencer Crypto Dex World sheds light on how Bitcoin Solaris is different. The review praises its performance structure, mobile-first mining model, and dual-consensus design—reasons why it’s being discussed alongside legacy projects. And with a fully KYC-verified team and double-audited smart contracts , trust in the project is rising as fast as its user base. Conclusion: The Only Legitimate ‘Buy Bitcoin in 2010’ Opportunity? The market is telling a clear story. While others ride volatility or fall victim to meme token fads, Bitcoin Solaris is quietly being accumulated by those who recognize what it represents—scarcity, utility, and the infrastructure to scale. Whether it’s the mobile mining revolution, the next-gen staking flexibility, or its unmatched security model, BTC-S is ticking the boxes that made early Bitcoin a generational wealth opportunity.

2025-06-03T16:38:40,"DAG Managing Director Explains How XRP ETF Could Impact XRP Price","XRP advocate Jake Claver, Managing Director of Digital Ascension Group, recently weighed in on how XRP's price could react to the launch of spot ETFs. In a recent disclosure , Claver expressed his anticipation that XRP spot ETFs could launch this year. Notably, the SEC has postponed decisions on filings from firms like Grayscale, Franklin, and WisdomTree as predicted. However, the broader expectation is that these products will launch in the last quarter of 2025, specifically around October, when the SEC reaches a final decision deadline. With the products going live, Claver noted he expects price appreciation for XRP. He drew parallels to what happened with Bitcoin.XRP Could Follow Bitcoin’s PathNotably, Bitcoin spot ETFs launched in January 2024, when Bitcoin was trading around $45K. The initial hype led to a brief ""sell the news"" event, where Bitcoin dipped shortly after the launch.However, a historic price rally followed, with Bitcoin peaking above $73K ahead of its April 2024 halving. This marked the first time BTC claimed a new ATH before the halving. Bitcoin went on to surpass the $100K level by the end of the year as Bitcoin ETFs accumulated over 1 million BTC tokens, with BlackRock leading the charge. Claver believes a similar scenario could play out for XRP. He noted that a glimpse of this occurred in late 2024 when XRP’s price broke out massively to the upside for the first time in years. The price movement coincided with major developments, including repeated news of asset managers filing to list XRP ETFs. Bitwise and Canary Capital were among the first movers, followed shortly after by others like Grayscale and WisdomTree.While a cooldown from the frenzy brought XRP's price below $2 multiple times, the coin has largely remained stable around the $2 mark. Proponents believe that an official ETF approval announcement would bring fresh momentum for XRP.Latest on XRP ETFsThe latest development from the SEC concerning XRP ETFs is that the regulator has initiated proceedings to decide whether to approve the WisdomTree XRP Fund. In a May 27 notice, the SEC stated it is evaluating whether the proposal complies with statutory laws. Accordingly, the agency has called on the public to provide input.The public has 21 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register to submit comments, and 35 days for rebuttals.While filings from major industry names are already present, BlackRock and Fidelity, which are leaders in Bitcoin spot ETFs, are notably absent. As a result, the XRP community is widely anticipating their filings. Their involvement could be a game-changer for XRP, similar to their impact on Bitcoin.How High Could XRP Go?Speculation around XRP’s potential price performance following the ultimate arrival of ETFs has been widespread.One theory projects XRP’s potential based on attracting just a portion of Bitcoin ETF inflows , should U.S. approval occur.Since January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have seen about $40 billion in inflows. If XRP ETFs attract 15% of that ($6 billion), and a 100x inflow-to-valuation multiplier is applied, XRP’s market cap could rise by $600 billion to reach $715 billion. Specifically, this would push the price to $12, a 450% increase from its current $2.22.Meanwhile, analyst Zach Rector predicts XRP could reach $15 if XRP ETFs attract strong inflows. Notably, he used a more aggressive market cap multiplier model.Rector bases his forecast on JPMorgan’s estimate that XRP ETFs could see $4–$8 billion in inflows during their first year. Using the lower $4 billion figure and a 200x market cap multiplier, he estimates an $800 billion boost in XRP’s valuation. Adding this to XRP’s current $125 billion market cap brings it to $925 billion.While these forecasts sound promising, they are based on hypothetical scenarios that may not materialize.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/03/dag-managing-director-explains-how-xrp-etf-could-impact-xrp-price/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dag-managing-director-explains-how-xrp-etf-could-impact-xrp-price,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|ZRX","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|Latest XRP ETF News Market Insights|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T16:33:44,"How Bitcoin Is Becoming A Cornerstone Of American Economic Policy","Summary Bitcoin has become a mainstream economic priority, now embraced by U.S. government leaders and major financial institutions. The BITCOIN Act of 2025 proposes a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, aiming to acquire 1 million bitcoins over five years. America leads globally in Bitcoin ownership, corporate holdings, ETFs, and national reserves, reflecting a deliberate national strategy. Bitcoin represents the next chapter in American innovation, offering economic independence, scarcity, and growth potential in the digital age. “We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy and are here to stay.” That was the message Vice President JD Vance delivered to a packed audience at last week’s Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas. It’s a message that has clearly taken root. What began as a movement of early adopters—many of them twentysomethings dressed in hoodies—has matured into a full-blown national economic priority, embraced by leaders at the highest levels of government and finance. Last summer, if you recall, then-candidate Donald Trump made headlines as the first former U.S. president to speak at a Bitcoin conference. He pledged to lower the regulatory hurdles of the Biden administration, to kill Operation Choke Point 2.0, and to position the U.S. as the global leader in Bitcoin. Less than a year later, and a little over 100 days into Trump’s second administration, that vision is rapidly becoming reality. A Strategic Reserve for the Digital Age The Las Vegas conference was the largest in Bitcoin’s history, with over 35,000 attendees. The speaker list read like a who’s who of power players: sitting senators and representatives, big-name executives, and the president’s own sons. It was more than a convention for crypto enthusiasts. It was a policy summit. One of the most salient points of discussion was the BITCOIN Act of 2025. The proposed legislation calls for the U.S. government to acquire 1 million bitcoins over a five-year period and hold them in custody. The goal is to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, modeled after the existing reserves for petroleum and gold. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis pointed out that holding even 4 million Bitcoins over a 20-year period could theoretically draw down the national debt, which currently stands at just under $37 trillion. U.S. Global Investors This isn’t the sort of talk you’d expect to hear about an asset that, just a few years ago, was derided by many as a vehicle for crime and terrorism. How times have changed! Today, some 50 million Americans own Bitcoin, compared with just under 37 million who own gold, according to new research by Bitcoin financial firm River. For the first time in history, Bitcoin has overtaken its analog cousin in retail ownership in the U.S. U.S. Global Investors The U.S. Leads the World in Every Bitcoin Metric That Matters Indeed, the U.S. dominates in every measurable category of Bitcoin leadership, according to River’s research. Approximately 40% of the world’s mined Bitcoin is held by Americans. Publicly traded U.S. companies account for almost 95% of global corporate Bitcoin holdings. America also holds the majority of Bitcoin in ETFs, venture funding, and national stockpiles. As of today, the U.S. government owns more than twice the global market share of Bitcoin as it does of gold. I don’t believe any of this happened by accident. It happened because our country’s entrepreneurs, technology experts, futurists, and policymakers saw an opportunity and ran with it. U.S. Global Investors Gold Preserves Wealth, Bitcoin Builds It None of this is to say that gold is going away anytime soon. As I told a roomful of YPO attendees last week, I still believe deeply in gold as a store of value. Unlike Bitcoin, the yellow metal is a tangible asset, used in jewelry, electronics, and much more. Countless households have relied upon gold for centuries. When families fled Vietnam and, more recently, Syria, many did so thanks to the universal acceptance of precious metal, which also later helped them rebuild their lives. Gold preserves wealth in times of fear. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is about growth. It’s about creating wealth, not just preserving it. Bitcoin is programmable. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and it doesn’t recognize borders or gatekeepers. It’s scarce in a way that few assets are. This is why companies, ETFs, and whole governments are looking to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. As Eric Trump told the audience, everyone wants to add Bitcoin right now; no one wants to sell. That’s true in every corner of the earth, from the Americas to Africa, from the Middle East to Asia. I believe the logic is simple. As the world goes digital and decentralizes, Bitcoin offers a new form of reserve asset that combines scarcity with transparency and portability. It’s a hedge against economic uncertainty and bad policymaking. Bitcoin Marks the Next Chapter in American Innovation Next year is the United States’ 250th anniversary, and I can think of no better symbol of economic independence than Bitcoin. It represents the very values Americans hold dear: individual responsibility, innovation, and freedom from centralized control. Fiat currencies can be printed without limit, but Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. It requires work and energy to produce. Several speakers at the Vegas conference likened Bitcoin to the early days of the internet. You probably remember the dial-up modems and clunky browsers. A lot of people back then dismissed the internet as a novelty. In 1998, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman famously (and hilariously) wrote that the internet was a disappointment and would eventually prove itself to be as economically impactful as the fax machine. As we all know, the internet is the backbone of today’s global economy. The same arc of adoption is playing out in real time with Bitcoin. I agree wholeheartedly with VP Vance: Bitcoin isn’t going away, and it’s only going to grow stronger with America leading the charge.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4792030-how-bitcoin-is-becoming-a-cornerstone-of-american-economic-policy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|RESEARCH","BTC-USD",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T16:32:36,"Standard Chartered's Bill Winters criticizes UK’s regulatory chokehold on banks","Bill Winters, chief executive of Standard Chartered, said this week that banks have been left behind by private credit firms, and the gap won’t be closing anytime soon. He made the comments during a Bloomberg Television interview aired on Tuesday, marking his tenth year leading the London-based lender. “That’s just the reality,” Bill said. “I don’t think it’s going to change anytime soon. The result of which is banks are disadvantaged lenders.” According to Bloomberg, he blamed higher capital requirements that were enforced after the 2008 financial meltdown for tilting the field in favor of private credit. Bill explained that while traditional banks stepped back from riskier lending, private credit firms stepped in fast. The total size of that industry has now ballooned to $1.7 trillion, and firms like Apollo Global Management are convinced this is just the beginning. He didn’t attack the post-crisis Basel reforms directly but pointed fingers at UK regulators, especially the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), for making it worse. “We’ve got really huge numbers of individuals in the UK — the PRA and FCA — who are focusing on our business,” he said. “One, they’re too intrusive, it’s too costly. Two, I don’t think you actually get a good return on that.” Bill criticizes UK’s regulatory chokehold on banks Bill, who used to work at JPMorgan Chase, said the current regulatory culture has left bank executives relying too heavily on what their supervisors approve. “If our supervisors don’t stop us, we assume it must be OK,” he said. “Of course, we don’t make that consciously, but deep down, I think there’s a risk we get there.” That mindset, Bill warned, is dangerous and can lead to poor decisions, especially when pressure from regulators blocks innovation and slows reaction time. He also weighed in on the growing complaints from other major banks like HSBC and Lloyds. They’ve been speaking out against the UK ring-fencing rules, which require banks to separate consumer banking from riskier investment activity. Bill helped design those rules years ago, but now he thinks they need to be updated. “There is a debate now about whether the ring-fenced entity should be allowed to be bigger or to take more deposits before you have to ring-fence,” he said. “I think those kinds of refinements make perfect sense.” While Bill was tackling the challenges that banks face in the regulated world, his company has been strongly advocating for crypto, and Bitcoin the most. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered, said his original Bitcoin forecast was too conservative. In an email to clients sent in May, Geoffrey admitted , “I apologise that my USD120k Q2 target may be too low.” He originally made the call in April, predicting that Bitcoin would hit $120,000 in the second quarter of 2025, driven by whale accumulation and investors moving money away from US assets. Geoffrey expects Bitcoin to keep rising through the summer, with a year-end target of $200,000. “We expect these supportive factors to push BTC to a new all-time high of around USD 120,000 in Q2,” he said. “We see gains continuing through the summer, taking BTC-USD towards our year-end forecast of 200,000. “The dominant story for Bitcoin has changed again,” Geoffrey wrote. “It was a correlation to risk assets… It then became a way to position for strategic asset reallocation out of US assets.” And now? “It is now all about flows. And flows are coming in many forms.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/stanchart-ceo-banks-disadvantaged-lenders/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH","News|Bitcoin|Standard Chartered",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T16:26:08,"Bitcoin (BTC) Warning from Standard Chartered! ""$90K is Very Critical!""","As Bitcoin (BTC) adoption has been steadily increasing, led by major institutional bull MicroStrategy (Strategy), an increasing number of companies have started holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets in recent months. While this situation reveals increasing demand for BTC, Standard Chartered warned against this situation. If market conditions for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies deteriorate, price volatility will increase, which could trigger a wave of forced liquidations, Standard Chartered warned in a note today. Standard Chartered digital assets analyst Geoff Kendrick noted that a “pain level of 22% below the average purchase price is a potential liquidation level” for companies holding Bitcoin. The bank listed 61 companies that hold Bitcoin treasuries. Stating that there are some that have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies but hold Bitcoin for balance sheet diversification, the bank stated that these companies have a total of 673,897 BTC, or 3.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. Kendrick noted that half of these firms purchased their BTC at an average price of over $90,000, potentially putting them at risk of liquidation if Bitcoin falls below $90,000. Citing Core Scientific, which collapsed in 2022, as an example for this situation, the analyst said the following. “These companies could become forced sellers if the Bitcoin price drops 22% below their average purchase price. At this point, $90,000 remains a critical level for these companies. Because it would only take the price of Bitcoin to fall back below $90,000 for half of the companies that bought Bitcoin to suffer losses. MicroStrategy, which leads the institutional Bitcoin strategy, holds the majority (86%) of BTC reserves and has a much lower average purchase price of around $70,000. However, Kendrick, who noted that new institutional participants are at greater risk, said: “In the last two months, there has been an increase in companies buying Bitcoin and the average purchase price is higher than MSTR. This means there is more risk.” Standard Chartered analyst Kendrick said the real question is how much pain companies can take before they have to sell their Bitcoin holdings. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T16:20:14,"Binance Dominates Crypto Liquidity with Largest Stablecoin Reserves: CryptoQuant","The latest CryptoQuant data shows Binance holding the largest stash of stablecoins among major exchanges, giving it an edge in overall liquidity. Binance holds 59% of all stablecoin reserves, with $31B in USDT and USDC. It leads 2025 inflows with $180B and sees the highest average BTC deposits. pic.twitter.com/p0ipDA97tN — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 3, 2025 Binance’s wallets hold roughly $31 billion in USDT and USDC—more than any other centralized exchange. That stash makes up about 59% of all stablecoin reserves industry-wide, showing how much trading liquidity is parked on the platform. Traders use stablecoins much like ready cash, making them a vital part of an exchange’s liquidity, so Binance’s large share demonstrates how effectively it draws in capital that’s primed to trade. In May alone, Binance received $31 billion in USDT and USDC deposits, narrowly edging out Coinbase, which reported $30 billion in the same period. For the year so far, Binance has attracted $180 billion in cumulative stablecoin inflows, compared to Coinbase’s $195 billion, demonstrating the consistent magnetism of both platforms for institutional and retail capital. Transparency as a Strategic Advantage In total exchange reserves, Coinbase ranks first with $129 billion, followed by Binance with $110 billion. Combined, they account for 60% of total reserves across the top 20 centralized exchanges, with holdings spread across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major stablecoins, reports CryptoQuant. While both exchanges dominate in scale, they diverge in transparency. Binance sets itself apart by publishing comprehensive Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) reports, including wallet addresses that verify its on-chain holdings. This level of transparency enhances Binance’s credibility among crypto-native users who prioritize decentralization and verifiability. In contrast, Coinbase does not provide public PoR reports, instead relying on traditional financial disclosures to build institutional trust, reflecting a more regulated approach to exchange operations. Binance Attracts Larger Bitcoin Players Beyond stablecoins, Binance continues to demonstrate its appeal to large market participants through Bitcoin inflows. On May 22, when Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $112,000, the average Bitcoin deposit to Binance spiked to 7 BTC, the highest among all exchanges. For comparison, Bitfinex saw an average of 5 BTC, while OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase recorded lower figures—1.23, 0.7, and 0.8 BTC, respectively. These numbers suggest Binance is the preferred venue for whales and high-volume traders. The broader capital inflow trends for 2025 further reinforce the leadership of Binance and Coinbase. Binance has drawn $335 billion in cumulative USD inflows this year, slightly behind Coinbase’s $344 billion. These volumes are not only evidence of user trust but also serve as indicators of liquidity depth, platform stability, and the perceived security of each exchange, says CryptoQuant. In sum, Binance’s dominant position in stablecoin reserves, coupled with its public Proof-of-Reserves and appeal to large Bitcoin holders, positions it as a cornerstone of global crypto liquidity. While Coinbase maintains a lead in overall reserves and capital inflows, Binance’s transparency and consistent performance in attracting capital inflows suggest it remains a formidable leader in the competitive exchange sector.

According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, Tether has transferred 10,500 BTC, valued at approximately $1.1 billion, to an address linked to Japanese investment giant SoftBank as part of its upcoming investment into Twenty One Capital.

Ardoino noted that this allocation was made to support investor options in the venture. Earlier, on June 2, Tether and its affiliates executed a combined transfer of 25,812 BTC, amounting to approximately $2.7 billion. That round included 14,000 BTC from Tether, 7,000 BTC from Bitfinex, and a 4,812 BTC portion designated for an equity raise. Together with the latest transactions, Twenty One Capital now holds over 42,000 BTC, making it the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, behind Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and MARA Holdings. The latest disclosure builds on an earlier investment made on May 9, when Tether acquired 4,812 BTC at an average price of $95,319 per token. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, those coins were transferred to an escrow wallet, lifting Twenty One Capital’s treasury to 36,312 BTC at the time. What is Twenty One Capital? Tether, along with Bitfinex and SoftBank, co-founded Twenty One Capital in April 2025, establishing it as a Bitcoin-first institutional platform designed to facilitate capital market services natively on Bitcoin, including custody, lending, and asset issuance. Twenty One Capital plans to build native infrastructure for custody, lending, and capital markets directly on Bitcoin, thereby acting as a foundational layer for institutional BTC adoption. Strike CEO Jack Mallers is leading the venture as it plans to go public via a SPAC merger with Cantor Fitzgerald’s Cantor Equity Partners. Under the terms of the business combination agreement, Tether agreed to contribute Bitcoin equivalent to proceeds from a PIPE investment, to be sold to Twenty One Capital at the time of the merger’s close. The new entity will list on Nasdaq under the ticker “XXI” and debut with more than 42,000 BTC in its treasury. As part of its commitment, Tether will add 23,950 BTC, while SoftBank and Bitfinex will contribute 10,500 BTC and 7,000 BTC, respectively. All allocations will be converted into shares priced at $10 each. Cantor Fitzgerald is also advising on the deal and securing additional capital. According to Mallers, upon launch, Twenty One Capital will become an investment vehicle “built by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners,” aiming to become the most successful company in Bitcoin. Contrary to the traditional approach, the firm will focus on “Bitcoin per share” as a core performance metric, shifting away from conventional measures such as earnings or revenue growth. Instead, its success will be gauged by how much Bitcoin it holds relative to its outstanding shares.

2025-06-03T16:00:06,"Powell Just Confirmed It—The Dollar’s Reign Is Ending, Bitcoin Is The Exit","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may not have mentioned Bitcoin—but to Jack Mallers, he didn’t have to. In a fiery video released just hours after Powell’s latest speech, the Strike CEO declared that the Fed Chair had “finally said the quiet part out loud”: that the post-World War II monetary system is collapsing, and Bitcoin is the only rational response. “The Bretton Woods era is over. And they’re telling you,” Mallers said, eyes locked on the camera. “They’re invalidating us Bitcoiners—by validating everything we’ve been saying for years.” Bitcoin Is The Only Way Out The comments came in response to Powell’s June 2 remarks at the Federal Reserve’s 75th anniversary of its International Finance Division, in which the Fed Chair openly acknowledged that the 1970s marked a fundamental break in monetary policy. “The end of the Bretton Woods era fundamentally changed the conduct of monetary policy,” Powell had said. “Policymakers had to understand the effects of potentially more volatile movements of the US dollar.” For Mallers, this wasn’t a historical footnote—it was an admission of systemic failure. “Before, the Fed’s job was to defend the peg. The dollar was redeemable for gold,” Mallers explained. “But when we divorced ourselves from the gold standard , we also divorced ourselves from the physical constraints of mother nature. And the world’s been a fucking mess ever since. Excuse my language—it’s a kids’ show, I know.” The heart of Mallers’ critique is rooted in physics. Gold, and now Bitcoin, are governed by physical laws. Fiat money is not. “None of us can print energy. None of us can defy the laws of time,” he said. “Proof-of-work ties us to reality. That’s what makes Bitcoin the hardest asset humans have ever known.” In Powell’s comments, Mallers saw a shift—not in theory, but in tone. “He’s admitting it. He literally said: our job got more complicated. And he’s right. When you’re not anchored to reality, when you can print money without limit, your job becomes about managing politics, leverage, volatility—basically managing chaos.” Mallers argued that this new mandate has turned the Fed into a machine for volatility suppression—not price stability. “Markets today are structurally short volatility,” he said. “Why? Because they’re addicted to leverage. And leverage can’t survive volatility. So what do the authorities do? They spoon-feed the market. They telegraph every move. And now Jerome Powell is warning us—gently, methodically—that he’s going to change the inflation target. He’s going to change the employment target. He’s laying the groundwork for a regime shift.” Mallers insisted the public is being softened up for major monetary changes. “Let me be on record,” he said. “If Powell comes out and says the inflation target is 4%, not 2%—boom. If he says the Fed will help fund the US government through some form of yield curve control—boom. This was the first breadcrumb. There are more coming.” But the broader theme of Mallers’ video was more existential than tactical. “You cannot replace Chinese or Russian buying power with Wall Street hedge funds,” he said. “So you let them lever up. But when you do that, you have to kill volatility. You have to micromanage everything. And eventually, it all breaks.” And when it breaks? “Bitcoin is the exit,” Mallers declared. “It’s the only monetary instrument governed by the laws of physics. Gold used to do that, until we left it. Bitcoin is that—on the internet. And it’s here. And it’s working.” To underscore the seriousness of Powell’s shift, Mallers referenced a recent Reuters article titled “Historic Dollar Fall Needed to Eliminate US Trade Deficit.” “This is not fringe anymore,” he said. “The media, the Fed—they’re all saying it. The post-war dollar system is collapsing. They’re saying the quiet part out loud.” He finished with a stark prediction: “This is a monetary regime change. You don’t get many in a lifetime. And Bitcoin is going to play a massive role in what comes next.” For years, Bitcoiners have claimed that US monetary policy was built on illusion. Now, with Powell’s own words, Jack Mallers believes the illusion is cracking—and the world is watching what comes next.

He made this assertion in response to data on the latest Bitcoin treasury companies.12 New Bitcoin Treasury Companies Disclose BTC Holdings For context, last month ended on a high note for Bitcoin. Notably, several companies leveraged Strategy’s Bitcoin playbook by converting part of their cash reserves to BTC for the first time. Crypto commentator Berit shared data showing that 12 companies acquired Bitcoin last month, marking it as their first BTC purchase. According to the data, GameStop acquired 4,710 BTC, Zap Solutions 1,500 BTC, DDC Enterprise 100 BTC, Roxom Global 98.01 BTC, and ATAI 58 BTC. Other companies whose Bitcoin acquisition became public knowledge in May include KindlyMD/Nakamoto (21 BTC), Coinsilium Group Forza (10 BTC), Walnut Capital (10 BTC), Where Food Comes From (7 BTC), GreenMerc (6.2 BTC), Al Abraaj Restaurants (5 BTC), and H100 Group (4.39 BTC). Binance Founder: ""Not Taking Risks to Buy Bitcoin Is a Risk""In response, the Binance founder said these new Bitcoin treasury companies are making deliberate, risk-based decisions by purchasing BTC. He emphasized that every company takes risks, whether they’re buying Bitcoin or engaging in other activities.According to him, risk is not a binary concept requiring an all-or-nothing approach. Instead, the amount of risk a company assumes should be based on a calculated position on a scale of 0–100%.CZ, who previously stated that Bitcoin was going to the ""moon,"" asserted that with the right balance, a firm could achieve an optimal risk-to-ROI ratio.https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1929842539634249940Managing Risks Rather than criticizing or endorsing any specific strategy, CZ's commentary framed Bitcoin acquisition by treasury companies as part of a broader discussion on corporate risk management. It suggests that companies must find a personalized, optimal balance of risk and return, whether that includes Bitcoin or not.In response to his commentary, a follower asked CZ how much risk exposure he is taking, and he replied, ""Too much.""He said he holds more fiat than necessary, humorously describing it as riskier than holding Bitcoin. In parallel, Zhao noted he plans to reduce his risk exposure in fiat currencies. However, he did not indicate whether he would convert some fiat currencies to cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1929843774361907386Essentially, the Binance founder's message is that firms face significant risks by refusing to take risks.

2025-06-03T15:54:07,"BlackRock Dumps $561 Million in Bitcoin to Buy Ethereum","The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is again making headlines in the crypto space, and this time for selling Bitcoin to buy Ethereum. Over the past few days, on-chain data has shown BlackRock gradually liquidating portions of its Bitcoin holdings via the Coinbase Prime institutional platform. The trend of BlackRock’s BTC sales picked up on June 2 at 10:56 UTC, when it moved 300 BTC worth $31.3 million to Coinbase. For context, prior to this transaction, the last outflow to Coinbase was three weeks ago.BlackRock went on to offload a total of 5,362 BTC through a series of transactions: multiple 300 BTC batches, one transaction of 212 BTC, and another of 49 BTC. Altogether, the prominent asset manager dumped Bitcoin worth $561 million.Interestingly, while offloading BTC on Coinbase, BlackRock was simultaneously acquiring Ethereum. During this period, the firm withdrew 27,241 ETH from Coinbase, valued at $69.25 million. Snapshot of BlackRock Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions Why Is BlackRock Selling Bitcoin?Notably, the amount of Bitcoin BlackRock sold aligns almost perfectly with the outflow figures recorded by its iShares Bitcoin Trust over the past two days. On Monday, BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF posted a $130.4 million outflow. On Friday, May 30, it recorded a $430.8 million outflow, bringing the two-day total to $561 million.During this same period, the overall U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF market experienced consecutive daily outflows starting last Thursday, totaling a $1.23 billion net drain.These negative trends followed ten consecutive days of positive flows into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs. The shift coincided with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of approximately $112,000 in May before undergoing a retracement.Amid this retrace, investors grew cautious and began offloading their positions, as evidenced by outflows from BlackRock and other ETF managers. Notably, BTC’s price dipped to around $103,000 before rebounding slightly to $106,600 at press time, up 2.5% over the past 24 hours.Despite BlackRock liquidating over half a billion dollars' worth of Bitcoin in two days, its total Bitcoin spot ETF flows since inception remain strong at $48.439 billion. Meanwhile, its entire BTC holdings stand at 661,142 tokens, worth approximately $70 billion.Ethereum ETFs Remain PositiveWhile the Bitcoin spot ETF market has recently seen heavy outflows, Ethereum ETFs have shown a different trend.

2025-06-03T15:51:09,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Subdued As Risk-Off Sentiment Takes Hold","Bitcoin (BTC) registered a marginal decline during the ongoing session as it remained pinned under the 20-day SMA. The flagship cryptocurrency has started the new month shrouded in uncertainty, with market watchers unsure where the market will head. BTC had plunged to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and move to its current level of $105,980. Strategy To Raise $250M To Buy More Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s Strategy plans to raise $250 million through an initial public offering of a new class of perpetual preferred stock to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. The company will issue 2.5 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock at $100 per share. Proceeds from the raise will be used to fund future Bitcoin purchases and provide working capital. Perpetual preferred stocks pay fixed dividends indefinitely with no maturity date and typically get priority over common stock in payouts. Strategy released a statement announcing its decision, “Strategy (Nasdaq: MSTR; STRK; STRF) today announced that subject to market and other conditions, it intends to conduct an initial public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), of 2,500,000 shares of Strategy’s 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD). Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital.” The offering gives Strategy a new avenue to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. The company primarily funded Bitcoin acquisitions through common stock and convertible note offerings. Strategy has become the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 580,955 BTC worth over $67.7 billion. The $250 million from its latest offering will allow the firm to purchase 2,351.8 BTC at current prices. 21Shares Announces Share Split For Spot Bitcoin ETF 21Shares has announced a 3-for-1 share split for its flagship ARK 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB. The move aims to make the fund more accessible to retail investors and will take effect at market opening on June 16. The split will triple the number of shares available and reduce the price per share without impacting the fund’s value. ARKB will continue to trade under its current sticker. “21Shares US LLC (21Shares), an affiliate of 21Shares AG, one of the world’s largest issuers of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today announced a 3-for-1 share split for its flagship fund ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). This move is designed to make shares more accessible to a broader base of investors and enhance trading efficiency. The share split is expected to be effective at market open on June 16, 2025.” The fund is a physically backed spot Bitcoin ETF tracking the New York Variant of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CF Bitcoin Reference Data, providing investors with direct access to Bitcoin in a regulated investment environment. Matador Technologies Listed On The Frankfurt Stock Exchange Bitcoin-focused Matador Technologies has announced it will begin trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The listing adds a key European listing to its existing US and Canadian markets. The listing aligns with Matador’s goal of offering round-the-clock trading access to its shares, modeled on Bitcoin’s 24/7 trading schedule. Matador Technologies CEO Deven Soni stated, “This listing completes a key part of our global capital markets strategy. It enables European investors to participate more easily in our growth story.” Matador has branded itself as a Bitcoin ecosystem company focusing on building a Bitcoin-backed treasury and fintech platform. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally up during the ongoing session as it struggles to cross the 20-day SMA. The flagship cryptocurrency faces rejection around the $105,000 level, with subdued price action indicating risk-off sentiment. Markets are jittery thanks to renewed trade tensions between the US and China, geopolitical tensions, and continuous outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Risk-on sentiment took a beating as tensions escalated in the Middle East after Israeli soldiers opened fire on people who strayed from a designated route to a food distribution site. Apart from escalating tensions in the Middle East, the Russia-Ukraine war has also seen an increase in hostilities. Institutional demand has also weakened, with data from SoSoValue highlighting outflows of $267 million from spot Bitcoin ETFs on Monday. While the outflows are relatively lower compared to February, an increase could lead to a substantial decline in BTC’s price. Despite trading in positive territory, markets remain cautious, expecting more geopolitical volatility. According to the Kobeissi Letter, markets are pricing out the Ukraine-Russia peace deal, stating, “This is effectively the market pricing out the Russia-Ukraine peace deal that President Trump has been working on for 3+ months. However, we have yet to receive a single comment from the US or President Trump. Clearly, something is going on behind the scenes. How will the US respond?” BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday (May 23), falling nearly 4% to $107,356. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,103. The price continued to push higher on Monday, registering a marginal increase, but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.03% to $107,834. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Price action remained bearish on Friday as BTC fell 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. BTC fell to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure returned. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903. The current session sees BTC up almost 1%, trading around $106,743, as buyers look to build momentum and push towards $110,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
