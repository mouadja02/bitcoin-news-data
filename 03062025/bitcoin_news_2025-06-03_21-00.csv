2025-06-03T18:45:56,"Authorities Warn of Phony Text Messages Phishing for Sensitive Information, Telling Victims Their Bank Account Is at Risk","Authorities in a town in Tennessee are warning residents about a new texting scam that has been impersonating local banks. The Shelbyville Police Department says the scam texts have been circulating through the local community. “Several citizens have reported receiving messages claiming to be from local banks, urging them to click a suspicious link. DO NOT click any links or provide personal information. These texts are not legitimate and are designed to steal your sensitive information. Below is an example of the text. If you receive one of these messages, delete it immediately and contact your bank directly if you have concerns.” Source: Shelbyville Police Department/Facebook In a similar vein, Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine warned last month that a crew of con artists had been calling seniors on Long Island and pretending to be their banks. The fraudsters tell the seniors that their bank accounts are under attack and that their credit and debit cards have malfunctioned. The scammers subsequently offer to pick the cards up from the victims and attempt to lure them to reveal their PINs, Romaine explained. “And guess what? Then they go to the ATM machine and steal their money. And this happened to a number of seniors.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a new interview with CNBC, Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager for Morgan Stanley’s Investment Management division, says he’s not expecting the S&P 500 to be “substantially above” the 6,000 mark any time soon. Says Slimmon, “My base case for the year has been [that] it’s a pause year. We’ve had two great years in a row and the market needs kind of a timeout, or a breather. If I work backwards from the end of the year, it’s tough to see the markets substantially above 6,000 and 5,900 that’s not a lot of upside, and I’ve learned that the market doesn’t just creep along slowly, it deviates around that central norm so somewhere along the way another drawdown and suspect it’ll be later in the summer. I will tell you this. I’m always very intrigued when the actual data diverges significantly from what is projected by the supposed experts to come. And the actual data, earnings came in strong in the first quarter, they beat by $3.50 versus consensus, but the whole-year number is down $10 because ‘the bad is yet to come.’ And this does kind of remind me of Covid which analysts ended up being way too negative on earnings for 2020-2021. I suspect that will be the same case, so I do think we’ll get a rally into the end of the year as analysts are forced to raise their numbers, but in the meantime, I wouldn’t be surprised if not much happens to the market between now and the fourth quarter.” At time of writing, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,975, about a 2.8% move away from all-time highs.

2025-06-03T18:30:34,"Is $250K Bitcoin Possible This Year? This Research Chief Thinks So","Tom Lee, Fundstrat’s head of research, says Bitcoin could climb to $250,000 by the end of 2025. According to an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box today, Lee pointed out that Bitcoin recently dipped from its all-time high of $111,970 down to about $104,000. He still thinks that the market is holding up around that level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Max Keiser Isn’t Buying The Hype Around New Crypto Holding Companies Lee’s Short-Term Outlook Lee told Squawk Box’s host Joe Kernen that 95% of all Bitcoin—about 19.80 million coins—has already been mined out of a maximum of 21 million. That leaves roughly 1.13 million coins waiting to be produced. He sees that as a tight supply setup. He also noted that while nearly all Bitcoin exists, 95% of the global population does not own any. Based on reports, that gap between supply and potential buyers could push prices higher in the months ahead. To reach $250,000 from around $104,000 now, Bitcoin would need to jump about 140%. Lee still believes it can hit $150,000 by December and could even stretch toward $200,000 to $250,000 if demand heats up. Supply And Demand Gap Lee highlighted the fact that most people in the world have not bought any Bitcoin. He said this creates an imbalance. On one side you have a nearly fixed supply. On the other, there may be millions of new buyers in the next 10 years. He explained that if even a fraction of those people decide to buy Bitcoin, the price could move a lot higher. Right now, only about 5% of all coins remain to be mined. That means new supply is slowing down fast. At the same time, more wallets, apps, and easy ways to buy could bring in fresh money. Lee thinks this mismatch is a big part of why Bitcoin could keep climbing. Long-Term Valuation Targets When asked about Bitcoin’s terminal value—meaning its price when all coins are mined by 2140—Lee said he expects it to match gold’s roughly $23 trillion market cap. That works out to at least $1.15 million per Bitcoin if there are 20 million coins in circulation. He chose 20 million instead of 21 million because assumed losses (lost keys, forgotten wallets) mean not every coin will ever be spent. Lee went further, saying he sees room for Bitcoin to hit $2 million or $3 million per coin. That would put his average “bull case” at $2.5 million, which is roughly a 2,300% rise from today’s levels. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Other Analyst Projections VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, also has a long-range prediction. Based on what Sigel told investors, VanEck sees Bitcoin hitting $3 million by 2050. That forecast lines up with Lee’s idea of Bitcoin matching or even beating gold over time. Both calls assume steady growth in demand, plus wider use by big institutions like hedge funds or pension plans.

The latest offender, Rep. Brandon Gill, a big fan of President Donald Trump, has reportedly violated a federal financial law by improperly disclosing about half a million dollars in Bitcoin purchases. According to a signed disclosure he submitted to the House of Representatives, Gill bought Bitcoin of between $100,001 and $250,000 on January 29 and February 27. However, he did not reveal both trades until weeks after a 45-day disclosure deadline mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act. BREAKING: We just found more STOCK Act violations. Representative Brandon Gill just filed purchases of up to $850K of Bitcoin. Some of the trades were made over 100 days ago. The reporting deadline is 45 days. Gill sits on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform pic.twitter.com/CI01ct2ozM — Quiver Quantitative (@QuiverQuant) June 2, 2025 Gill made Bitcoin purchases just before Trump’s crypto bills The STOCK Act was put in place to prevent insider trading and conflicts of interest among members of Congress. So when Gill made his January 29 Bitcoin purchase the week after Trump signed an executive order to “establish United States leadership in digital and financial technology,” it raised eyebrows. The lawmaker’s February 27 purchase also falls under similar circumstances, as it came a week before Trump announced the creation of a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile” to make the United States “a leader among nations in government digital asset strategy.” Gill has also disclosed making two additional Bitcoin purchases last month with the first happening on May 13 valued at between $100,001 and $250,000 and another on May 18 valued at between $50,001 and $100,000. In both cases, which Gill disclosed before the 45-day federal deadline, Bitcoin’s value was slightly below its current price. So far, Gill has filed for purchases of up to $850k BTC, and he is not the only Congress member accused of ethically questionable stock trading. Congress are pushing the boundaries of the STOCK Act Gill’s Bitcoin purchases put him in the league of Congress members like Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Dwight Evans (D-Pa.) and Neal Dunn (R-Fla.), who have been fingered in violating the STOCK Act this decade. The $200 penalty for missing the reporting deadline for Congressional trading “tends to be a joke.” Source: @QuiverQuant Others like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), Jefferson Shreve (R-Ind.), Julie Johnson (D-Texas), Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), reportedly made a flurry of stock trades immediately before or after Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements that roiled stock indices. Meanwhile, at least two members of Congress — Rep. George Whitesides (D-Calif.) and Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) — have confirmed they are no longer trading individual stocks in a bid to avoid real or perceived financial conflicts of interest. Now, there is a bipartisan coalition of federal lawmakers — made up of some on the far-right and far-left — who are supporting legislation that would ban members of Congress and their families from trading individual stocks and cryptocurrency outright. Trump also seems to be on the same side as these lawmakers. This year, he even said he would “sign a bill.” Talk of banning Congress members from trading has become a hot topic, especially since the tariff announcement, and the subject has overwhelming public support as well. It remains to be seen if such legislation will pass, as some Congress members see their ability to trade as a perk. However, there is no doubt that the trading embargo is under serious consideration.

Calm or High Volatility Expected?","Although activity in the cryptocurrency market continues to be low as the summer months begin, June is not expected to be a quiet month on the US economic policy front, according to digital asset research firm K33. According to a report published today by K33 Research President Vetle Lunde, the 90-day tariff moratorium ends on July 9, while President Donald Trump hopes to get the “One Big Beautiful Bill” through the Senate by July 4. These two developments signal a turbulent period for markets at the end of June. “We had a pleasant period free of discussions about tariffs for most of May. However, Trump disrupted this peace by threatening the EU with a 50% tariff and then postponed the decision on the tariffs until July 9,” said Lunde, adding that Bitcoin retreated from its peak levels after Trump’s statement and has not yet approached those levels. He conveyed that this situation shows how sensitive the market is to discourses about tariffs. Related News: BREAKING: After Remaining Silent for a Long Time, Trump Makes His Move in Cryptocurrencies! And He's Not Stopping There—He's Partnering with a Surprise Altcoin Last week, Wall Street began using a new acronym for Trump: “TACO,” which stands for Trump Always Chickens Out. The term was coined as a reference to the easing of tensions with China following the tariffs and the postponement of those tariffs. But Lunde said such rhetoric and the upcoming tariff deadline could increase pressure on Trump to pursue tougher policies. At the same time, Republicans are said to be working overtime throughout June to pass Trump’s “Magnificent Act” through the Senate and onto the president’s desk. The legislation could add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, with much of that burden coming from corporate and individual tax cuts and other stimulus and spending plans. According to Lunde, the Senate bill debate and possible amendments could create significant market volatility in June. If the bill is approved, these expansionary effects could boost market morale and offset the pressure from the return of tariffs. *This is not investment advice.

In a press release, the Norway-based crypto exchange Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) says it has started buying Bitcoin to hold on its balance sheet. “As part of the initial allocation, the company has obtained six Bitcoin and will expand to approximately 10 within June. This will allow for a limited proof of concept.” The company says it will use Bitcoin as collateral to issue USDM , a stablecoin on the Cardano ( ADA ) blockchain, and “generate yield on both the Bitcoin and within the Cardano and USDM ecosystems.” “NBX will not sell this Bitcoin or go short in any form… NBX will also use proceeds to buy additional Bitcoin.” The company also says that “Bitcoin is becoming an important part of the global financial infrastructure” and that launching a Bitcoin treasury will not only help with operational efficiency but also attract investors looking for exposure to the flagship crypto asset. Amid the announcement, NBX shares soared from a low on June 2nd of 0.021 euros ($0.024) to 0.053 euros ($0.060) on June 3rd, an increase of about 150%. Founded in 2018, NBX says the BTC treasury is the latest effort to increase adoption of digital assets, highlighting how it has already issued the first credit card in the world that rewards customers with BTC for each transaction.

2025-06-03T17:52:54,"BTC traders realized $500M an hour during several periods of selling","Traders accelerated their profit-taking in the past few days, realizing $500M an hour in profits. Based on Glassnode data, traders are trying to lock in gains while reassessing the next move for BTC. Traders are profiting from the BTC market, using each recent recovery. As BTC regained $105,000 and showed signs of recovery, traders still sold to lock in recent profits. According to Glassnode data , profit-taking accelerated to $500M an hour, with three major periods of selling for the last 24 hours. Based on holders waves heatmap, wallets holding coins for less than a month and between 3-6 months reduced their balances, while all other cohorts retained or slightly increased their balances. Most of the sellers have realized profits based on the adjusted Spending Output Profit Ratio. Glassnode data showed the average BTC sold in the past few days had a 16% profit. In the past few weeks, coins flowed into addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC , while larger cohorts with over 1,000 and 10,000 BTC sold off their coins. Many large holders (‘whales’) already realized profits during previous peaks, and the current selling is likely from small, speculative wallets offloading BTC on the open market. The recent rounds of selling also met with enough buyers aiming to store physical coins. BTC is showing signs of scarcity on the spot market, and even derivative exchanges see an outflow of reserves. BTC reserves flow out rapidly from spot exchanges, reaching the lowest levels since 2022. Despite profit-taking, the sellers are matched with significant demand from spot buyers. | Source: Cryptoquant Spot exchanges carry 1.023M BTC, the lowest reserves since 2022. The remaining 1.30M are on derivative exchanges, with a steep slide in the past month. As with previous local peaks, BTC traders have shown more rational behavior, aiming to lock in gains. At the same time, spot BTC accumulation continues, driven by the recent trend of growing corporate treasuries . BTC still gets a boost from derivative traders The recent trader behavior follows a pullback of the fear and greed index, down to 64 points from 74 points the previous week. Realizing profits is not unusual even for whale wallets, and selling originated even from the ETF wallets of BlackRock. Despite the selling, BTC still had the energy to rally as high as $106,559. BTC remains range-bound, with potential for volatility in either direction. The recent profit-taking also shows the market remains relatively resilient, and derivative trading continues independent of spot market activities. BTC’s open interest on derivative markets increased by $1.2B in the past day, rising again toward $34B after a series of liquidations. In the past few hours, the trend has been toward shorting the asset, though long positions still dominate over 53% of open interest. An accumulation of short positions may also lead to a rally to liquidate the short sellers. The BTC derivative market is also closely watched for volatility, based on the position of risky trader James Wynn . His position, with a liquidation price of $104,980, is at risk for even a small downward move, especially driven by organized selling. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-03T17:47:27,"Expert Projects When 10,000 XRP Will Cost You $150,000","A bold prediction about XRP’s future valuation is stirring renewed interest in long-term accumulation. In a recent post on X, crypto influencer X Finance Bull suggested that by 2030, the cost of 10,000 XRP could exceed $150,000, translating to a price of $15 per token or more. Drawing attention to rapid institutional adoption and supportive AI-driven projections from platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and GROK, the analyst argued that the retail window for affordable XRP may be closing fast. This projection, while optimistic, resonates with a growing chorus of voices in the XRP community who believe the token is structurally undervalued. As Ripple expands its global financial partnerships and as utility-driven demand for XRP gains traction, the case for a substantial revaluation is being taken more seriously, especially among long-term holders. 10,000 $XRP sounds cheap now? Just wait By 2030, it could cost $150K… or more AI projections like GROK, ChatGPT and Gemini are screaming one thing: retail is getting priced out. Fast If you don’t stack now, you may never afford it later #XRP accumulation season is ending pic.twitter.com/RJLcY7j2GX — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) June 2, 2025 The $150K Valuation: Ambitious, but Not Baseless The suggestion that 10,000 XRP could be worth $150,000 in less than a decade is grounded in several key assumptions: widespread adoption of Ripple’s blockchain technology, XRP’s growing utility in cross-border payments and tokenized asset flows, and favorable regulatory outcomes. While skeptics may balk at such high projections, it’s worth noting that the crypto market has witnessed similarly dramatic transformations before. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum underwent massive re-pricings within a single cycle, often defying expectations and valuation models. X Finance Bull’s post captures this potential, stressing that current market prices may not reflect the long-term trajectory of XRP’s role in financial infrastructure. With prices still hovering under the $1 mark at press time, the implied valuation of $15 per XRP by 2030 would represent a 15x increase from today’s levels, a scenario that is plausible if Ripple’s technology becomes integral to the back-end of international finance. AI Models Echo Long-Term Optimism Supporting the narrative are forecasts from leading artificial intelligence platforms. While AI models like ChatGPT, GROK, and Gemini do not offer real-time financial advice or investment guarantees, they have shown broad consensus in identifying XRP as one of the few cryptocurrencies with tangible utility, regulatory resilience, and enterprise-grade adoption. These platforms have evaluated XRP within the context of its use cases: real-time settlement, liquidity provisioning, and tokenized asset interoperability. Based on these functions and market trends, they consistently rank XRP among the most likely tokens to benefit from long-term institutional integration. While not a guarantee of price, these AI-driven outlooks reinforce the sentiment that XRP may be entering a phase where scarcity and demand could push valuations significantly higher. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Retail Window May Be Closing One of the most pointed warnings in X Finance Bull’s post is the suggestion that “retail is getting priced out. Fast.” As history has shown with Bitcoin, early accumulation opportunities tend to diminish quickly once institutional demand surges and retail liquidity thins out. XRP’s growing integration into banking corridors via Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution already puts it in a different category from purely speculative tokens. The post also frames the current market as the tail end of the “accumulation season”—a phase where patient investors acquire undervalued assets before the rest of the market recognizes their full potential. If XRP follows the same path as Bitcoin post-2016 or Ethereum in early 2020, the current price range may eventually be seen as a missed opportunity. Looking Ahead to 2030 While no projection is immune to market cycles or external risks, the $150,000 valuation for 10,000 XRP reflects a credible long-term thesis: that utility-driven tokens with institutional backing and a proven track record will eventually see re-pricing to reflect their foundational role in the new financial order. For those still on the sidelines, the message from analysts like X Finance Bull is clear—delaying may come at a cost. If current trends continue, the window to accumulate XRP at sub-$1 levels could be closing, and by 2030, the cost of entry might be out of reach for most retail investors.

2025-06-03T17:45:28,"XRP Ledger Activity Drops After Strong Start to 2025","The XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized blockchain network, has seen its platform’s activity slow down sharply. Recent data has shown fewer transactions and less overall use on the network. This came after XRPL started strong this year. This marks a significant shift in the usual transaction volume on the ledger, which is popularly known for its speed and low-cost transaction fees. XRPL Sees Noticeable Drop in Transactions and Users Since March, payment activity on the XRP Ledger has dropped sharply. Transactions fell to 320,747, the lowest level since October last year. This marks a sharp drop from over 1 million monthly transactions in 2025. Data from XRPScan also shows fewer people are using the network, with active addresses dropping below 10,000, the lowest since October. Notably, these addresses represent individual users making payments or other actions. The amount of XRP burned as transaction fees dropped to just 1,500 XRP, showing fewer overall transactions. Fewer new accounts are being created, too, and each new account usually requires a 1 XRP reserve. This slowdown comes after a strong start to the year. According to Messari, from January to March, transaction activity on XRPL jumped 36%, and active users rose by 142%. This remarkable growth underscores the increasing adoption and utilization of the XRPL network. XRP Struggles While Bitcoin Thrives Market watchers have compared Ripple’s native token XRP to Bitcoin (BTC) market movement. While the flagship crypto recently reached a price peak of over $110,000 in late May, XRP grew by 62%. The token climbed from $1.60 to $2.60, benefiting from the general market recovery. However, XRP has slowed down since then and has not returned to its January peak of $3.40. This shows that XRP is not growing as fast as Bitcoin anymore. Meanwhile, macroeconomics and market uncertainty play a significant role in pressuring crypto’s trajectory. According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP is trading at $2.22 at the time of writing, up 3.25% in the last 24 hours . Ripple’s Moves Strengthen the XRP Ecosystem Ripple, the company behind the XRPL project, has made big moves lately . The fintech company bought Hidden Road in April , becoming the first crypto firm to run a global prime brokerage. This move is expected to improve XRP liquidity and trading services. More recently, Ripple’s new stablecoin RLUSD also got approved by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). This means RLUSD can now be used in Dubai’s leading financial center, opening new doors for Ripple. Looking ahead, Ripple is getting ready to host its XRP Ledger Apex 2025 event in Singapore from June 10 to 12. This event could bring more updates and attract new interest in the XRPL and Ripple’s associated token.

2025-06-03T17:38:24,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Top Analysts Predict A Stronger, Sustained Bull Run","Zoom out on the charts, and the current market trend looks less like a fluke and more like a reset in motion. Bitcoin’s recent dip followed a fresh all-time high, but rather than triggering panic, it’s exposing a deeper shift. This isn’t the top, some say. Analysts tied to major funds continue to allocate, and their tone hasn’t softened either. Skeptics focus on the drop, but those tracking institutional moves are seeing conviction, not hesitation. The old four-year rhythm may be breaking apart. Momentum hasn’t vanished; it’s moving under the surface, quiet and forceful. To those watching closely, the price action feels less like the end of a cycle and more like the middle of something bigger. Quiet Accumulation May Indicate Strong Market Conviction When it comes to BTC accumulation, the company that stands at the forefront right now may be MicroStrategy, and it doesn’t seem to be scaling back. Its most recent purchase adds to an already massive position, reflecting how certain institutions now treat Bitcoin as a long-term reserve embraced by leading investors. A growing number of firms, from asset managers to international funds are slowly building exposure. They're not waiting for clarity. They believe it’s already here. This is why this crypto cycle will be bigger and last longer than most people think.Applications and real world use cases were artificially suppressed by the hostile regulatory environment of 2020-2024. But the infrastructure kept improving, and is now remarkably robust — high… https://t.co/NlKCrG25lS — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) May 29, 2025 Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan suggests this entire cycle may outlast the historical norm. Years of regulatory friction suppressed application growth, but the groundwork kept evolving. With new policies forming and political voices like Trump calling digital assets a national priority, analysts now expect faster deployment of real-world crypto use cases. Hougan describes the current moment as compressed potential. He argues that volatility will remain, but major pullbacks are likely to be shorter and shallower than before. There’s simply more diversity in the investor base, and fewer sellers among them. Funds, governments, and crypto-native firms are holding steady and their models are built on longer timelines. They’re not chasing parabolic moves, but rather on the lookout for staking claims. The market may look uncertain on the surface, but those who’ve studied its depth aren’t backing away. They’re buying quietly while others hesitate, likely sitting on massive profits already given the recent all-time high level it crossed. Best Crypto to Buy Now As the Bull Market Looks Ready to Pump Further SUBBD A few years ago, creators were chasing platform partnerships and algorithm visibility. Now, the most ambitious ones are asking how to leave the platforms entirely. SUBBD was built for that moment. It isn’t some half-formed idea still waiting on use cases. Its token underpins a direct, creator-led economy where artists, writers, streamers, and niche builders can monetize their audiences without losing ownership to middlemen or advertising logic. What separates SUBBD from other attempts is that it isn’t just about tipping or digital collectibles. The token is functional, not decorative. Fans can use it to unlock gated content, vote on creative decisions, stake for early access, and even receive a share of revenue from projects they support. This means activity around the token reflects real creative exchange rather than pure speculation. $SUBBD Presale Hits $500k! Embracing the future of AI Agent content creation... https://t.co/dLCKejpxpp pic.twitter.com/AFeslybq8A — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) May 24, 2025 In the context of a prolonged bull run, this becomes more relevant. As institutions and large investors settle into long-term crypto allocations, the attention turns to projects that carry economic weight beyond charts. SUBBD appeals to that shift. It’s aligned with the decentralization of culture, not just finance. And as creators continue to look for a way out of the algorithm trap, a token that powers a fully self-hosted ecosystem feels like more than a niche experiment. It’s not a coin pretending to be a movement. It’s a protocol designed for a transition that’s already happening. Solaxy Solaxy doesn’t market itself with claims of domination. It isn’t trying to outpace Ethereum or absorb Solana’s traffic. Its purpose is far less dramatic and far more useful: build clean, efficient links between chains that are too often siloed. That goal makes it easy to overlook and easy to underestimate. But it’s precisely this utility-first approach that could carry it through the kind of longer, steadier bull market many now expect. At the technical level, Solaxy serves as a high-throughput Layer 2 capable of routing value between networks that often struggle to communicate directly. In practice, this means fewer bottlenecks, lower costs, and a smoother user experience across ecosystems. For developers, this opens the door to applications that no longer need to bet on one chain’s future. For token holders, it creates staking and liquidity options that are both competitive and flexible. These functions matter more in a market driven by practical adoption than speculative bursts. As major funds and infrastructure players prepare for a multi-year upcycle, they’re gravitating toward tools that solve problems instead of chasing trends. Solaxy has already launched its staking program, issued its native token, and begun expanding support for new dApps. It doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel. It just needs to keep building smoother roads across fragmented territory. In a cycle where institutional interest is growing but still cautious, projects like Solaxy offer something rare: quiet relevance and technical endurance. BTC Bull Plenty of tokens talk about “community,” but BTC Bull hardwires it into the product. Its model is built around a simple but effective mechanism: as Bitcoin crosses certain price levels, token holders receive automatic rewards. Each milestone triggers a distribution event. There’s no guessing, no lotteries, and no passive waiting. It’s a token built to move with Bitcoin, not in its shadow. This gives BTC Bull a very specific kind of utility. It allows users to ride Bitcoin’s strength in real time, turning price milestones into scheduled moments of shared upside. But it doesn’t stop there. Every airdrop is paired with a burn, steadily reducing the total supply. Over time, this dynamic creates an incentive loop that rewards early adoption, long holding periods, and continued engagement. What makes this interesting in the current market is how well it fits with the evolving mood of crypto investors. Institutions may be buying Bitcoin in record quantities, but retail investors are looking for ways to connect with that movement without chasing risky leverage or speculative bets. BTC Bull offers an answer. It’s not trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s giving everyday users a structured way to benefit from its growth. In a market where many projects still rely on narrative momentum, BTC Bull’s structure speaks for itself. It reacts to real price events and rewards real participation. That’s enough to make it relevant and perhaps more resilient as the cycle matures. Snorter At first glance, Snorter looks like another internet joke minted onto a blockchain. It’s named after a pig, branded like a parody, and talks more like a meme than a protocol. But dig a little deeper and it becomes clear why this project has caught the attention of early buyers who aren’t just here for a laugh. Snorter is doing what so many meme tokens fail to even attempt: backing its popularity with actual functionality. The team has introduced utility that stretches far beyond the typical community token playbook. Holders can stake their SNORT tokens for rewards, but the staking model is tied to both participation and engagement. This means that the more active the community, the better the reward dynamics. There’s also a built-in deflationary system designed to gradually reduce supply based on on-chain activity, creating stronger alignment between users and token health over time. What’s interesting is how Snorter positions itself during a market phase where major players are becoming more serious. Popular crypto channels including 99Bitcoins have covered the project as one of the top potential picks to consider this season. It makes sense, as the project uses humor to draw attention, but doesn’t rely on it to survive. Behind the branding is a smart contract system designed to keep the project breathing through multiple market cycles, with mechanisms that adapt to liquidity shifts, user participation, and staking depth. In a cycle that could stretch longer than usual, projects like Snorter stand a better chance than they seem to at first. It's funny on the surface, but what it’s building isn’t a joke. Conclusion When the charts zoom out and the noise clears, it’s rarely the loudest tokens that last. Projects with clear roles, built-in utility, and quiet confidence tend to hold ground while others churn in and out of relevance. If this really is the beginning of a longer, stronger bull market, as many believe, the most worthwhile investment bets may not be the ones making headlines but the ones working on utility and investors-oriented solutions, preparing to survive the years that follow.

2025-06-03T17:35:09,"Russia to introduce higher investment ceiling for digital financial assets","The Central Bank of Russia has proposed to increase the maximum amount of money ordinary Russians can put into regulated digital assets. The change comes in a draft circular updating the regulator’s requirements for tokenized assets that Russian investors can acquire legally in the country. Russia to introduce higher investment ceiling for digital financial assets The Bank of Russia is trying to raise an annual limit on digital asset purchases for non-qualified investors to 1 million rubles (more than $12,600 currently), according to a draft directive amending rules for offerings in this strictly regulated market. The document, released for public consultations, concerns “digital financial assets” (DFAs) as described in Russian law. These are usually tokenized real assets issued by CBR-authorized platforms on private blockchains, the Russian biz news outlet RBC noted in a report. The category also includes “digital rights,” or digital representations of monetary claims and investor rights, including foreign digital rights (FDRs) approved for circulation in the Russian Federation. The definition covers some cryptocurrencies, mainly stablecoins. The Bank of Russia’s proposal expands access to DFAs for ordinary Russians as it aims to increase the limit, which currently stands at 600,000 rubles (approx. $7,600). The monetary authority said it’s acting in response to requests from participants in the developing DFA market. Both citizens and companies will be able to invest in DFAs, but the CBR divides them into three groups – qualified investors, investors subject to the annual limit, and investors facing no restrictions, with the latter two being non-qualified investors. Russian companies to buy digital assets without restrictions According to the draft , legal entities will be permitted to acquire DFAs without any limits, even if they are not recognized as qualified investors. The goal is to allow businesses to more actively use digital financial assets, including in trade which has been affected by Western sanctions. Non-qualified investors will be granted access to a wide range of DFAs such as those based on shares, bonds, foreign currencies, precious metals, oil, and index instruments, up to the specified 1 million-ruble limit, RBC detailed. At the same time, the Bank of Russia admits only “ highly qualified ” investors to decentralized crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC). To be accepted as such, private individuals would have to prove annual income of at least 50 million rubles (over $633,000) and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (almost $1.27 million). The CBR updated its regulations for FDRs last month, introducing stricter rules for foreign digital rights recognized as digital assets entering the Russian market. According to one of the requirements, these FDRs should not be linked to securities issued by organizations based in “unfriendly nations.” The Russian central bank also emphasized issuers and payment processors should not be able to freeze such assets and that the FDRs must not certify rights to receive cryptocurrencies that are prohibited in Russia. In practice, these conditions close the door for popular stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. The new rules were unveiled after in March, Tether blocked 2.5 billion rubles’ worth of assets in wallets hosted by the sanctioned Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex . The coin trading platform has been accused by the U.S. of assisting criminals, laundering money and violating sanctions against Russia. Following Tether’s move, the government in Moscow went as far as to announce that its finance ministry is considering issuing a Russian stablecoin, similar to the USDT in design but pegged to a different fiat currency, not the U.S. dollar. The Central Bank of Russia will be accepting suggestions and comments on the proposed regulations for digital financial assets until June 15. They will enter into force 10 days after the official release of the circular, the regulator said.

2025-06-03T17:30:18,"Head And Shoulders Pattern Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Down Toward $95,000","The Head and Shoulders technical pattern has just formed on the Bitcoin price chart , signaling that a possible crash may be imminent. According to a crypto analyst, this classic bearish reversal formation could trigger a sharp pullback , potentially driving Bitcoin down to $95,000 in the near term. Analyst Warns Of Looming Bitcoin Price Crash Crypto Patel, a technical and fundamental analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has issued a stark warning about Bitcoin’s short-term price outlook. Despite the flagship cryptocurrency reaching fresh all-time highs recently and outperforming most altcoins in the market , Crypto Patel still believes that BTC could be on the verge of a significant price crash. His bearish forecast centers around the appearance of a Head and Shoulders pattern on the 3-hour Bitcoin price chart—a technical formation often considered a strong indicator of trend reversals . According to Crypto Patel, this pattern is already in motion and signals a potential breakdown that could drag the BTC price down to $95,000 in the coming sessions. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,409, meaning a possible drop to $95,000 would represent a massive 9.87% price crash. Crypto Patel also highlights that this looming decline hinges on one crucial level: the neckline of the Head and Shoulders pattern , currently located at $103,000. This neckline acts as a critical support level, separating the current consolidation phase from a possible bearish spiral . Should Bitcoin break below this neckline, it could open the door to aggressive sell pressure . Crypto Patel’s technical projections further confirm that failing to hold the neckline support area will solidify Bitcoin’s likely breakdown to the $95,000 zone, marking an 8.74% decline from $103,000. Bitcoin could also crash even lower than the initial $95,000 target. Crypto Patel’s chart highlights a possible decline between $94,600 and $93,600 for the flagship cryptocurrency. This zone is also expected to serve as a lower support area for BTC to prevent further price declines. Support Zone Could Offer Buy-Dip Opportunity Despite the bearish implications and a possible increase in sell pressure, all eyes are on the strong support zone just below $95,000, which Crypto Patel suggests could attract significant buying interest. The analyst warns that this breakdown zone may be a battleground for short-term bears and long-term bulls. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market Not Over: Analyst Reveals Why August 2025 Is The Target If the price falls to this level, the analyst notes that it could serve as a strong buy-the-dip opportunity for long-term investors, especially those awaiting a more favorable entry point after Bitcoin’s recent ATH rise near $112,000 . Given this outlook, market participants are expected to keep a close watch on the $103,000 neckline as a potential breakdown point and the support zone below $95,000 for an optimal buying opportunity.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-is-headed-to-95000/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|altcoins|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto Patel|Head and Shoulders Pattern",cryptocompare

Top officials at the Equitable Bank in Waterford, Wisconsin, say they are fed up with the increasing scams targeting seniors, reports TMJ4 News. Says Equitable Bank branch manager Dawn Jurgensen, “Fraud is just crazy now. Every day, these fraudsters are creating new ways to scam people.” The bank’s six branches across the state are receiving at least one fraud report per day targeting seniors or others. The bank’s officials are holding community events to educate residents about the fraud and ways to protect themselves. They are also working with the Wisconsin Bankers Association to urge state lawmakers to pass tougher anti-fraud regulations. Says Erin Arneson, the Equitable Bank’s vice president of retail banking, “We were able to tell them how important it is that they push through the legislation that will help us help our elderly customers.” Among the new regulations the bankers are asking for is the ability to slow down suspicious transactions, including when there are large cash withdrawals. Says Arneson, “We’re trying to protect them, and that’s really our message. We’re not doing it to be nosy or to be punitive in any way.

The Solana memecoin is now nipping at DogWifHat’s heels as traders bet on feline dominance in the $65 billion meme sector. With its market cap exploding past fallen giants like $PNUT, this cat-themed token proves memecoins still have nine lives. Investors are loving it and they are hungry for the next viral predator. Community-Driven or Hype-Fueled? Why Traders Are Betting Big on $POPCAT At press time, $POPCAT is trading around $0.412, bouncing from an intraday low of $0.3546 to a local high of $0.4268. Many observers credit the token’s meteoric rise to its limitless meme appeal, strong community backing, and popularity among leveraged traders who view it as the ultimate money-printing memecoin. According to DexScreener, $POPCAT now boasts over 142,000 holders and 53 liquidity providers, reflecting its substantial community on the Solana network.

While nothing is certain in crypto markets, the current technical picture appears favorable for $POPCAT holders. $POPCAT Bull Case Builds, But Support at $0.25 Must Hold to Avoid Trend Breakdown Following its rally from the early accumulation zone, $POPCAT consistently formed higher lows through March to early May, supported by an ascending trendline, an indicator of sustained buying interest. However, the price recently fell below that trendline, indicating a short-term loss of momentum. Even so, $POPCAT seems to be stabilizing, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounding from 40 and currently sitting at 47.33. Source: TradingView This indicates that selling pressure is subsiding, and bullish momentum could return if RSI breaks above 50. Looking ahead, if buyers reclaim control, the next major resistance sits at $0.5707. A successful breakout above that level could pave the way for a move toward $0.7692 and potentially a retest of $1.0074, a key level from late December 2024. Conversely, if support doesn’t hold, $POPCAT may revisit the $0.20–$0.25 range.

2025-06-03T16:43:16,"Live Coin Watch Trading Anomaly: Bitcoin Solaris Accumulation Pattern Mirrors Bitcoin’s 2010-2013 Smart Money Phase","Every crypto bull market has its silent build-up phase—the calm before the explosion—when “smart money” quietly accumulates. According to a recent Live Coin Watch anomaly, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) may be showing the exact same accumulation pattern seen in Bitcoin’s legendary 2010–2013 phase. For those who’ve dreamed of catching the next early Bitcoin, this may be the only real shot left. But what makes Bitcoin Solaris fundamentally different from today’s sea of altcoins? Let’s dig in. The Smart Money Phase: How Early Bitcoin Accumulation Looked Back in the early 2010s, Bitcoin was ignored by most and scooped up by a few. These investors weren’t driven by hype—they were motivated by the tech, the scarcity, and the belief that decentralized money could transform the world. That’s the exact kind of quiet build-up Bitcoin Solaris is now experiencing, and according to trading watchers, the accumulation is no longer subtle. Today’s altcoin market is flooded with trendy tokens that swing wildly, yet offer no real protection. With recent top losers like Dogwifhat, Injective, and PEPE plummeting between 10–17% in a single 24-hour cycle, it’s clear many tokens are fueled by speculation, not structure. Why Bitcoin Solaris Isn’t Like Other Altcoins Bitcoin Solaris was built to solve crypto’s long-standing flaws—not ride its hype. It’s not just about fast TPS or flashy features. It’s about a blockchain that was designed from the ground up to mirror Bitcoin’s value architecture but add next-gen scalability, accessibility, and earning potential. Here’s what sets it apart: Dual-layer architecture: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Contribution for security and decentralization. The Solaris Layer incorporates advanced mechanisms for speed and network coordination. 10,000+ TPS with 2-second finality: Matches top-tier throughput while ensuring stable processing. Mobile-first mining: Unlike complex Bitcoin rigs, BTC-S mining is accessible via the upcoming Solaris Nova App—bringing wealth-building potential to anyone with a phone. Hybrid consensus: Flexibly blends decentralization and scalability through a system designed for real-world growth. Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed Liquid Staking: Full Flexibility, Full Rewards One standout feature helping Bitcoin Solaris attract real accumulation is its liquid staking model. Users can stake their BTC-S and receive 1:1 sBTC-S tokens, which remain fully tradable and usable in DeFi ecosystems. Benefits of this system include: Rewards without restrictions: Earn staking income while still being able to use your funds. DeFi-ready sBTC-S: Compatible with liquidity pools, lending, and more. Efficiency: Integrated directly with the upcoming Solaris Nova App. Security and trust: Validator selection is automated, reducing technical barriers for users. Bitcoin Solaris’s Explosive Presale Growth While most altcoins stumble through market cycles, BTC-S has engineered one of the strongest presale growth runs seen in years. We’re now in Phase 6 , and momentum hasn’t slowed. Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% With just around 8 weeks remaining until the July 31 launch, the numbers say it all—over $1.8 million raised and 11,000+ unique users joined. Industry veterans are calling it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. Referral System: A Network Built by the Community Another catalyst fueling this smart money movement? Bitcoin Solaris’s double rewards referral program . Referrers earn 5% in BTC-S tokens for every referral purchase. Referred users receive a 5% bonus on their token allocation. This model promotes genuine community growth, not hollow marketing pushes—precisely the kind of momentum that sustains long-term adoption. Influencer Buzz and Market Validation Interest is soaring, and it’s not just investors paying attention. A deep dive by influencer Crypto Dex World sheds light on how Bitcoin Solaris is different. The review praises its performance structure, mobile-first mining model, and dual-consensus design—reasons why it’s being discussed alongside legacy projects. And with a fully KYC-verified team and double-audited smart contracts , trust in the project is rising as fast as its user base. Conclusion: The Only Legitimate ‘Buy Bitcoin in 2010’ Opportunity? The market is telling a clear story. While others ride volatility or fall victim to meme token fads, Bitcoin Solaris is quietly being accumulated by those who recognize what it represents—scarcity, utility, and the infrastructure to scale. Whether it’s the mobile mining revolution, the next-gen staking flexibility, or its unmatched security model, BTC-S is ticking the boxes that made early Bitcoin a generational wealth opportunity.

2025-06-03T16:38:40,"DAG Managing Director Explains How XRP ETF Could Impact XRP Price","XRP advocate Jake Claver, Managing Director of Digital Ascension Group, recently weighed in on how XRP's price could react to the launch of spot ETFs. In a recent disclosure , Claver expressed his anticipation that XRP spot ETFs could launch this year. Notably, the SEC has postponed decisions on filings from firms like Grayscale, Franklin, and WisdomTree as predicted. However, the broader expectation is that these products will launch in the last quarter of 2025, specifically around October, when the SEC reaches a final decision deadline. With the products going live, Claver noted he expects price appreciation for XRP. He drew parallels to what happened with Bitcoin.XRP Could Follow Bitcoin’s PathNotably, Bitcoin spot ETFs launched in January 2024, when Bitcoin was trading around $45K. The initial hype led to a brief ""sell the news"" event, where Bitcoin dipped shortly after the launch.However, a historic price rally followed, with Bitcoin peaking above $73K ahead of its April 2024 halving. This marked the first time BTC claimed a new ATH before the halving. Bitcoin went on to surpass the $100K level by the end of the year as Bitcoin ETFs accumulated over 1 million BTC tokens, with BlackRock leading the charge. Claver believes a similar scenario could play out for XRP. He noted that a glimpse of this occurred in late 2024 when XRP’s price broke out massively to the upside for the first time in years. The price movement coincided with major developments, including repeated news of asset managers filing to list XRP ETFs. Bitwise and Canary Capital were among the first movers, followed shortly after by others like Grayscale and WisdomTree.While a cooldown from the frenzy brought XRP's price below $2 multiple times, the coin has largely remained stable around the $2 mark. Proponents believe that an official ETF approval announcement would bring fresh momentum for XRP.Latest on XRP ETFsThe latest development from the SEC concerning XRP ETFs is that the regulator has initiated proceedings to decide whether to approve the WisdomTree XRP Fund. In a May 27 notice, the SEC stated it is evaluating whether the proposal complies with statutory laws. Accordingly, the agency has called on the public to provide input.The public has 21 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register to submit comments, and 35 days for rebuttals.While filings from major industry names are already present, BlackRock and Fidelity, which are leaders in Bitcoin spot ETFs, are notably absent. As a result, the XRP community is widely anticipating their filings. Their involvement could be a game-changer for XRP, similar to their impact on Bitcoin.How High Could XRP Go?Speculation around XRP’s potential price performance following the ultimate arrival of ETFs has been widespread.One theory projects XRP’s potential based on attracting just a portion of Bitcoin ETF inflows , should U.S. approval occur.Since January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have seen about $40 billion in inflows. If XRP ETFs attract 15% of that ($6 billion), and a 100x inflow-to-valuation multiplier is applied, XRP’s market cap could rise by $600 billion to reach $715 billion. Specifically, this would push the price to $12, a 450% increase from its current $2.22.Meanwhile, analyst Zach Rector predicts XRP could reach $15 if XRP ETFs attract strong inflows. Notably, he used a more aggressive market cap multiplier model.Rector bases his forecast on JPMorgan’s estimate that XRP ETFs could see $4–$8 billion in inflows during their first year. Using the lower $4 billion figure and a 200x market cap multiplier, he estimates an $800 billion boost in XRP’s valuation. Adding this to XRP’s current $125 billion market cap brings it to $925 billion.While these forecasts sound promising, they are based on hypothetical scenarios that may not materialize.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/03/dag-managing-director-explains-how-xrp-etf-could-impact-xrp-price/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dag-managing-director-explains-how-xrp-etf-could-impact-xrp-price,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|ZRX","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|Latest XRP ETF News Market Insights|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T16:33:44,"How Bitcoin Is Becoming A Cornerstone Of American Economic Policy","Summary Bitcoin has become a mainstream economic priority, now embraced by U.S. government leaders and major financial institutions. The BITCOIN Act of 2025 proposes a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, aiming to acquire 1 million bitcoins over five years. America leads globally in Bitcoin ownership, corporate holdings, ETFs, and national reserves, reflecting a deliberate national strategy. Bitcoin represents the next chapter in American innovation, offering economic independence, scarcity, and growth potential in the digital age. “We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy and are here to stay.” That was the message Vice President JD Vance delivered to a packed audience at last week’s Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas. It’s a message that has clearly taken root. What began as a movement of early adopters—many of them twentysomethings dressed in hoodies—has matured into a full-blown national economic priority, embraced by leaders at the highest levels of government and finance. Last summer, if you recall, then-candidate Donald Trump made headlines as the first former U.S. president to speak at a Bitcoin conference. He pledged to lower the regulatory hurdles of the Biden administration, to kill Operation Choke Point 2.0, and to position the U.S. as the global leader in Bitcoin. Less than a year later, and a little over 100 days into Trump’s second administration, that vision is rapidly becoming reality. A Strategic Reserve for the Digital Age The Las Vegas conference was the largest in Bitcoin’s history, with over 35,000 attendees. The speaker list read like a who’s who of power players: sitting senators and representatives, big-name executives, and the president’s own sons. It was more than a convention for crypto enthusiasts. It was a policy summit. One of the most salient points of discussion was the BITCOIN Act of 2025. The proposed legislation calls for the U.S. government to acquire 1 million bitcoins over a five-year period and hold them in custody. The goal is to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, modeled after the existing reserves for petroleum and gold. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis pointed out that holding even 4 million Bitcoins over a 20-year period could theoretically draw down the national debt, which currently stands at just under $37 trillion. U.S. Global Investors This isn’t the sort of talk you’d expect to hear about an asset that, just a few years ago, was derided by many as a vehicle for crime and terrorism. How times have changed! Today, some 50 million Americans own Bitcoin, compared with just under 37 million who own gold, according to new research by Bitcoin financial firm River. For the first time in history, Bitcoin has overtaken its analog cousin in retail ownership in the U.S. U.S. Global Investors The U.S. Leads the World in Every Bitcoin Metric That Matters Indeed, the U.S. dominates in every measurable category of Bitcoin leadership, according to River’s research. Approximately 40% of the world’s mined Bitcoin is held by Americans. Publicly traded U.S. companies account for almost 95% of global corporate Bitcoin holdings. America also holds the majority of Bitcoin in ETFs, venture funding, and national stockpiles. As of today, the U.S. government owns more than twice the global market share of Bitcoin as it does of gold. I don’t believe any of this happened by accident. It happened because our country’s entrepreneurs, technology experts, futurists, and policymakers saw an opportunity and ran with it. U.S. Global Investors Gold Preserves Wealth, Bitcoin Builds It None of this is to say that gold is going away anytime soon. As I told a roomful of YPO attendees last week, I still believe deeply in gold as a store of value. Unlike Bitcoin, the yellow metal is a tangible asset, used in jewelry, electronics, and much more. Countless households have relied upon gold for centuries. When families fled Vietnam and, more recently, Syria, many did so thanks to the universal acceptance of precious metal, which also later helped them rebuild their lives. Gold preserves wealth in times of fear. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is about growth. It’s about creating wealth, not just preserving it. Bitcoin is programmable. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and it doesn’t recognize borders or gatekeepers. It’s scarce in a way that few assets are. This is why companies, ETFs, and whole governments are looking to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. As Eric Trump told the audience, everyone wants to add Bitcoin right now; no one wants to sell. That’s true in every corner of the earth, from the Americas to Africa, from the Middle East to Asia. I believe the logic is simple. As the world goes digital and decentralizes, Bitcoin offers a new form of reserve asset that combines scarcity with transparency and portability. It’s a hedge against economic uncertainty and bad policymaking. Bitcoin Marks the Next Chapter in American Innovation Next year is the United States’ 250th anniversary, and I can think of no better symbol of economic independence than Bitcoin. It represents the very values Americans hold dear: individual responsibility, innovation, and freedom from centralized control. Fiat currencies can be printed without limit, but Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. It requires work and energy to produce. Several speakers at the Vegas conference likened Bitcoin to the early days of the internet. You probably remember the dial-up modems and clunky browsers. A lot of people back then dismissed the internet as a novelty. In 1998, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman famously (and hilariously) wrote that the internet was a disappointment and would eventually prove itself to be as economically impactful as the fax machine. As we all know, the internet is the backbone of today’s global economy. The same arc of adoption is playing out in real time with Bitcoin. I agree wholeheartedly with VP Vance: Bitcoin isn’t going away, and it’s only going to grow stronger with America leading the charge.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4792030-how-bitcoin-is-becoming-a-cornerstone-of-american-economic-policy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|RESEARCH","BTC-USD",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T16:32:36,"Standard Chartered's Bill Winters criticizes UK’s regulatory chokehold on banks","Bill Winters, chief executive of Standard Chartered, said this week that banks have been left behind by private credit firms, and the gap won’t be closing anytime soon. He made the comments during a Bloomberg Television interview aired on Tuesday, marking his tenth year leading the London-based lender. “That’s just the reality,” Bill said. “I don’t think it’s going to change anytime soon. The result of which is banks are disadvantaged lenders.” According to Bloomberg, he blamed higher capital requirements that were enforced after the 2008 financial meltdown for tilting the field in favor of private credit. Bill explained that while traditional banks stepped back from riskier lending, private credit firms stepped in fast. The total size of that industry has now ballooned to $1.7 trillion, and firms like Apollo Global Management are convinced this is just the beginning. He didn’t attack the post-crisis Basel reforms directly but pointed fingers at UK regulators, especially the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), for making it worse. “We’ve got really huge numbers of individuals in the UK — the PRA and FCA — who are focusing on our business,” he said. “One, they’re too intrusive, it’s too costly. Two, I don’t think you actually get a good return on that.” Bill criticizes UK’s regulatory chokehold on banks Bill, who used to work at JPMorgan Chase, said the current regulatory culture has left bank executives relying too heavily on what their supervisors approve. “If our supervisors don’t stop us, we assume it must be OK,” he said. “Of course, we don’t make that consciously, but deep down, I think there’s a risk we get there.” That mindset, Bill warned, is dangerous and can lead to poor decisions, especially when pressure from regulators blocks innovation and slows reaction time. He also weighed in on the growing complaints from other major banks like HSBC and Lloyds. They’ve been speaking out against the UK ring-fencing rules, which require banks to separate consumer banking from riskier investment activity. Bill helped design those rules years ago, but now he thinks they need to be updated. “There is a debate now about whether the ring-fenced entity should be allowed to be bigger or to take more deposits before you have to ring-fence,” he said. “I think those kinds of refinements make perfect sense.” While Bill was tackling the challenges that banks face in the regulated world, his company has been strongly advocating for crypto, and Bitcoin the most. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered, said his original Bitcoin forecast was too conservative. In an email to clients sent in May, Geoffrey admitted , “I apologise that my USD120k Q2 target may be too low.” He originally made the call in April, predicting that Bitcoin would hit $120,000 in the second quarter of 2025, driven by whale accumulation and investors moving money away from US assets. Geoffrey expects Bitcoin to keep rising through the summer, with a year-end target of $200,000. “We expect these supportive factors to push BTC to a new all-time high of around USD 120,000 in Q2,” he said. “We see gains continuing through the summer, taking BTC-USD towards our year-end forecast of 200,000. “The dominant story for Bitcoin has changed again,” Geoffrey wrote. “It was a correlation to risk assets… It then became a way to position for strategic asset reallocation out of US assets.” And now? “It is now all about flows. And flows are coming in many forms.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/stanchart-ceo-banks-disadvantaged-lenders/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH","News|Bitcoin|Standard Chartered",cryptocompare
