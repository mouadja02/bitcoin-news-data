2025-06-03T06:53:34,"POPCAT, WIF, and MUBARAK surge over 10% — which memecoin looks the most bullish?","Memecoins POPCAT, WIF, and MUBARAK have each posted double-digit gains in the past 24 hours, continuing their bounces from recent pullbacks. Which one of them shows the highest bullish potential? Popcat ( POPCAT ) price is up 15% in the past 24 hours, currently trading around $0.42, with 24-hour trading volume surging over 80% to $70 million. After the steep pullback from $0.60, the price recently bounced from the key support level at around $0.35 and is now continuing this recovery as it tests its 20 EMA, which acts as a dynamic resistance. However, it’s important to note the recent shift in market structure. Before the pullback, POPCAT’s price failed to make a new high higher, forming a lower high. This was followed by the break of the neckline of a double top pattern and then the formation of a lower low at $0.33. How the price reacts to the 20 EMA resistance will be critical in determining whether the recent break in structure signals the start of a broader downtrend or if the pullback was just a liquidity grab at a lower support level. Momentum is neutral, with the RSI at 47. However, it’s pointing upwards and just about to break above its moving average, potentially forming a golden cross – a bullish signal.

Similarly to POPCAT, WIF price has recently broken the uptrend structure, forming a lower low at $0.80. However, three days ago, the price strongly rebounded from that level and is now continuing its recovery, having just wicked above the 20 EMA. With the continuation of the bounce from $0.80, the memecoin ‘s price has now reclaimed the previous higher low at around $0.95. If WIF maintains this upward momentum and closes above the 20 EMA, it could signal the resumption of an uptrend. On the momentum side, MACD bearish crossover is still in place. However, histogram is negative but showing decreasing red bars, suggesting bearish momentum is weakening. RSI is 52, recovering from neutral territory, but still way below its moving average.

Since breaking out of its previous range on May 9, MUBARAK price has been consolidating in the $0.04 – $0.07 range. Recently, the price dipped below $0.04, but then bounced and reclaimed the $0.0430 support level. However, volume is still weak, and the price has yet to break above the EMA 20, which is acting as its dynamic resistance. Despite this, bearish momentum is fading, as indicated by the declining MACD histogram and an upward-sloping RSI. A break above the 20 EMA with strong volume would likely confirm bullish momentum and open the path toward a retest of the $0.06 – $0.07 resistance at the top of the range.

While Lee maintained his year-end target for the S&P 500 at 6,600 points, his most notable statements were about Bitcoin. Tom Lee described Bitcoin's current movement as “consolidation” and stated that the market has already reacted to the increase in global liquidity and the expectation of a more dovish FED in 2025. Stating that this situation creates strong support for BTC, Lee said, “Bitcoin is an asset that is sensitive to liquidity. Liquidity is increasing in the world right now and this is an upward signal for Bitcoin.” Lee also made the following striking statement, citing Bitwise’s statistics: “95% of the Bitcoin supply has already been mined. However, 95% of the world's population does not yet own BTC. This creates a huge demand-supply imbalance for the next 10 years.” Related News: Massive XRP Move from Chinese Company - “300 Million Dollar Treasury...” Lee stated that Bitcoin could reach levels of $150,000 to $250,000 this year. Tom Lee thinks that Bitcoin is a more valuable asset compared to gold. The market value of gold is around $23 trillion. If this value is reflected in Bitcoin, Lee calculated that a single Bitcoin could reach $1.2 million, and went further and said: “I think BTC, in the long run, can go up to $2 million or even $3 million. Even higher.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T06:27:28,"U.S. Share of Bitcoin, Ether and Solana Trading Volume Falls Below 45% as Asia Catches Up","The rebound in digital assets since early April has been marked by a significant shift in activity, with Asian trading hours gaining market share in global bitcoin BTC, ether ETH and solana SOL spot trading volumes, while the U.S. steadily loses ground. The U.S. trading hours' share of the spot volume in the three major tokens has dropped below 45% on a 30-day simple moving average basis, having peaked at an all-time high of over 55% at the beginning of 2025, according to data tracked by institutional crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX. The latest reading is the lowest since pro-crypto Donald Trump's victory in the November presidential election. Meanwhile, Asian trading hours now account for nearly 30% of global activity, with Europe accounting for the remainder. Slower activity during the U.S. represents a change in investor mix driving the price action, according to FalconX. ""It may point to increased influence from non-U.S. portfolio flows or suggest that U.S. investors are focusing more on markets beyond spot crypto,"" FalconX's Head of Research David Lawant said in a note shared with CoinDesk. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has surged 40% to $105,000 since hitting lows under $75,000 in early April, according to CoinDesk data. Ether and solana have surged 87% and 68%, respectively, during the same period. Low-volume BTC rally Although bitcoin's price has surged to new highs, global spot trading activity hasn't yet recovered to levels seen early this year. According to FalconX, daily volume in BTC spot markets, which averaged over $15 billion on a 30-day rolling basis after the November election, declined during the April sell-off and has since held below $10 billion. A low-volume rally is often viewed as a bear trap. However, that's not necessarily the case this time, as ETFs have recently gained popularity as investment vehicles. According to FalconX, the cumulative volume in the 11 U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs has surged from approximately 25% of the global spot BTC market volume to a record 45% in under two months. The spike in ETF volume stems mainly from bold directional bets rather than non-directional arbitrage bets like the cash and carry trade, involving a long position in the ETF and a simultaneous short position in the CME BTC futures. The 11 spot ETFs have amassed $44 billion in net inflows since inception in January 2024, according to data source Farside Investors. BlackRock's IBIT, the largest of them all, attracted $6.35 billion in May, the most since January 2025, indicating growing institutional demand for BTC amid trade tensions and bond market jitters. ""All of this points to room for growth and suggests that ETFs are likely to remain a major force behind demand in this rally,"" Lawant said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/03/u-s-share-of-bitcoin-ether-and-solana-trading-volume-falls-below-45-as-asia-catches-up,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|Markets|market analysis|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T06:25:00,"Top Analyst Spots XRP Breakout If It Holds This Crucial Level","Renowned cryptocurrency analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) has updated the technical outlook on XRP, focusing on a potential bullish continuation pattern developing on the 3-day timeframe. According to the analyst, a decisive close above $2.3, along with confirmation above the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), would signal the validation of a double bottom structure . The chart shared by EGRAG CRYPTO shows that XRP recently tested a key support region around $2.07 multiple times, which the analyst believes is the likely bottom on the 3-day timeframe. The analysis suggests that as long as the digital asset’s price remains above this critical $2.07 support level, bullish momentum remains intact. EGRAG CRYPTO emphasizes that holding this zone is essential for bulls, as it would prevent further downside and maintain the validity of the projected wave count structure. #XRP – A Close Above $2.3 Shields the Double Bottom Pattern : A strong close above $2.30 on the 3-day timeframe and above the 21 EMA will confirm that the Double Bottom is in play for #XRP , opening the door to potential targets around: $2.50 $2.65 $3.00 As long… pic.twitter.com/bguB9ujpZe — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 2, 2025 Double Bottom Pattern and Upside Targets EGRAG CRYPTO’s projection includes a potential double bottom formation, a classical technical pattern that often precedes upward breakouts. For this pattern to be confirmed, XRP must close decisively above $2.3. Such a close would also put the price above the 21 EMA, a resistance level that has recently capped upside attempts. With a confirmed breakout, the analysis sets clear price objectives. The near-term targets for XRP include $2.5, $2.65, and an extended move toward $3. Other well-known analysts have shared paths to targets around $3 , further supporting EGRAG CRYPTO’s prediction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The target levels are marked by horizontal green dashed lines on the chart and are likely based on Fibonacci extensions or historical resistance zones. The chart also projects a $24 target as part of a larger bullish wave structure. Notably, a Bitcoin advocate recently predicted that XRP could hit the $24 target in 2025 , and EGRAG CRYPTO’s chart suggests further gains beyond the $3 level under favorable conditions. Market Structure and Technical Setup From a technical standpoint, the chart illustrates that XRP is in a multi-wave structure. The asset rose to the wave (1) peak, followed by a corrective A-B-C structure leading to the wave (2) bottom. The successful defense of the support zone around $2.07 is consistent with the completion of wave C, aligning with common Elliott Wave Theory interpretations. EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis shows the importance of $2.07 as a pivotal support level, and XRP is currently trading at $2.18. The chart further illustrates an anticipated continuation of the bullish wave cycle, with the next impulsive phase targeting the $24 mentioned above.

Ether ETH led gains among majors at 4.5%, coming as the blockchain’s Foundation restructured staffing to focus on protocol developments in a competitive and crowded network landscape — bumping bullish sentiment for the world’s second-largest token. Dogecoin DOGE followed with a 3% rise, with Solana’s SOL SOL, Cardano’s ADA ADA, XRP XRP, and BNB Chain’s BNB BNB adding as much as 2.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, rose 2%. After weeks of gains, bitcoin’s latest price action has traders closely watching for signs of a potential cooling-off period. Caution is emerging among some as technical signals hint that the rally may be losing momentum. “Bitcoin hovering around the $105,000 range is circumstantial natural cooling after a strong rally, with elevated trading volumes followed by sustained interest, now hints at fatigue,” said Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, said in a Tuesday update shared with CoinDesk. “BTC could consolidate between $103,000 and $108,000, with $100,000 acting as psychological support. If that level fails, downside targets near $97,000–$93,000 may be tested,” Lee said. Lee added that on-chain data shows continued whale accumulation, typically a bullish sign that any correction could offer an entry point. For ETH, Lee noted that repeated rejections and long upper wicks around the $2,800 level indicate hesitation. “Overall strength remains intact, but momentum is capped unless ETH decisively breaks above $2,810,” he said. The bigger picture for BTC remains solid on a macro basis. “On a YTD basis, BTC remains a strong outperformer on a macro basis and vs equity, though there are short-term signs that we might be up for more challenging times ahead, with OGs and natives continuing to be better sellers and profit takers against mainstream buying,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Tuesday message. Geopolitical risks continue to weigh on sentiment. Fresh tariff headlines and a tense trade backdrop between the U.S. and China have traders bracing for more volatility, with key policy deadlines in early July on the radar, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market broadcast late Monday.

2025-06-03T06:12:18,"Bitcoin Waiting for Leverage Flush Before Next Big Move: Analyst","“Now is a bad time to take paper bets on BTC,” said technical analyst Willy Woo on June 2. He said it was “open season on liquidation hunts due to high levels of betting,” before adding that Bitcoin was “waiting to purge the bets before the next swing of all-time-highs.” Paper bets are generally crypto derivatives such as futures, options , and perpetual contracts that allow speculators to bet on the price direction without ever holding the asset. Woo said spot Bitcoin prices are hard to move up with too many of these “casino hitchhikers” onboard. NOW is a BAD TIME to take paper bets on BTC. It’s open season on liquidation hunts due to high levels of betting. BTC is waiting to purge the bets before the next swing of all-time-highs. Chart: paper bets on BTC, hard to move up with too many casino hitchhikers onboard. pic.twitter.com/bj9ikjdn8Q — Willy Woo (@woonomic) June 2, 2025 Leverage Flush Imminent Most derivatives gamblers use leveraged trading, which tends to overheat markets and create more volatility, especially when they get liquidated. When asked about the $100 million liquidation of Hyperliquid whale trader James Wynn last week, Woo explained that the buying pressure was low last week, which means “whales can push things around.” “In neutral environments, it’s easy to move price, especially weekends and summer months,” he said before warning: “Now add incentives to make money through liquidations, it’s the perfect setup for liquidation hunts NOW.” Bitcoin open interest (OI), or the number of open futures contracts that have yet to be settled, hit an all-time high of $80 billion on May 23, according to Coinglass. It has since fallen to $72 billion but remains elevated, indicating a high level of “paper bets” or leverage in the market. When OI surges, it indicates that massive leveraged positions have built up with lots of speculators holding large positions with borrowed money. When the spot price of BTC moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated. These flushouts can create a cascade effect and amplify selling pressure, which can cause a sharp decline in prices and volatility spikes. BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin prices are up marginally on the day, hitting an intraday high of $106,450 before retreating to around $105,350 during Tuesday morning trading in Asia. Since falling from its May 22 all-time high, the asset has remained in consolidation around current levels for the past few days. It looks very strong on the long-term view, but could see more volatility if Woo’s “casino hitchhikers” get liquidated. Meanwhile, the M2 money supply has just hit an all-time high, which is good news for risk-on assets such as crypto.

2025-06-03T06:11:11,"Australia Imposes New Restrictions on Crypto ATMs Amid Rising Scams","Australia’s financial crime regulator, AUSTRAC, has placed fresh rules on nationwide crypto ATM operators amid alarming crypto fraud cases. The regulator, on Tuesday, refused to renew the registration of a local crypto ATM operator , Harro’s Empires. The agency placed operating conditions, including transaction limits, on them. “The conditions come after an AUSTRAC taskforce flagged worrying trends in crypto ATM compliance,” the announcement read. The regulator has imposed a A$5,000 ($3,233) limit on cash deposits and withdrawals, enhanced customer due diligence obligations, mandatory scam warnings, and requirements for more robust transaction monitoring. “In light of the risks and harms we consider it is absolutely necessary to ensure the sector meets minimum standards and reduces the criminal misuse of crypto ATMs.” Crypto ATMs Increased 15X in Two Years Per Coin ATM Radar , there are around 1,824 crypto ATMs across Australia, with the highest number of machines in Sydney. Australia has over 1,800 crypto ATMs. (Source: Coin ATM Radar) The national financial intelligence agency noted that Australia had only 23 operating crypto ATMs in 2019. Besides, the trend increased to 60 in 2022 and over 1,200 in 2024. “In just two years, the number of crypto ATMs in Australia increased more than 15 times,” the agency said. Further, Austrac projected that around 150,000 transactions occur annually, with A$275 million ($178 million) being moved using crypto ATMs. About 99% of those transactions are cash deposits for crypto purchases, mostly Bitcoin , Ethereum and Tether , it added. “I would warn anybody who is asked to use one of these machines to send funds to someone to stop and think twice, as once your money is gone, it is almost impossible for authorities to retrieve it,” said Austrac CEO Brendan Thomas. He added that the agency will continue to monitor the space and take more action if needed. Austrac Taskforce Uncovers “Disturbing Trends” According to Thomas, the Austrac taskforce has uncovered “disturbing trends,” after observing customer activity for several months. “Surprisingly, the 60 to 70 age group were identified as the one of the most prolific users of crypto ATMs in Australia,” he said. They account for 29% of all transactions by value. Besides, after reviewing 9 crypto kiosk providers, the majority of users are over 50 years of age and account for almost 72% of all transactions by value. Though the A$5,000 cash limits apply to crypto ATM operators, Austrac is also planning to apply similar limits to crypto exchanges if they accept cash for crypto transactions. “This will reduce their exposure to money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crime risks,” said Thomas.

2025-06-03T06:00:08,"Ethereum Flashes Bullish Morning Star Candlestick Pattern – Is ETH Rally Getting Started?","While Ethereum (ETH) has posted impressive gains of 37.7% over the past month, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization still remains over 33% below its June 2024 levels. However, recent technical and on-chain indicators suggest that ETH may be on the verge of a significant breakout. Ethereum Prints Bullish Morning Star Candlestick Pattern In a post on X earlier today, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader highlighted a potentially bullish development on the Ethereum monthly chart. According to Merlijn, ETH has printed a Morning Star candlestick pattern – often regarded as a strong bullish reversal signal. For the uninitiated, the Morning Star is a bullish reversal pattern that appears after a downtrend, signaling a potential shift to upward momentum. It consists of a large bearish candle, a small candle showing indecision, and a strong bullish candle that closes well into the first candle’s body. Beyond technical indicators, Ethereum is also seeing growing interest from institutional investors. A recent CoinShares report revealed that global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw $286 million in net inflows during the week ending May 30. Ethereum-based ETPs were a key contributor to this trend. Data from SoSoValue further confirms this momentum. In May 2025 alone, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded total net inflows of $564 million – up sharply from $66 million in April. In addition, an increasing number of entities continue to stake their ETH on the network. In a separate X post, crypto analyst Ted Pillows outlined how Abraxas Capital had staked ETH worth $7.5 million earlier today. To recall, Ethereum staking involves locking up ETH to help secure the Ethereum network and validate transactions, a core part of its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. In return, stakers earn rewards, typically paid out in ETH, for participating in network operations. Important To Hold This Support Level Veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez emphasized the importance of the $2,550 support level, noting that ETH must hold above this threshold to sustain its bullish momentum. If it does, Martinez predicts a possible push toward the $2,650 level. In line with this sentiment, fellow analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that ETH may be gearing up for a run to $3,800, citing a breakout from a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart. The analyst also pointed out that ETH is currently holding above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which often signals continued upward movement. Adding to the bullish case, nearly 300,000 ETH left Binance between mid-April and mid-May, potentially contributing to a supply crunch. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,538, up 0.8% in the last 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-flashes-bullish-morning-star-candlestick-pattern-is-eth-rally-getting-started/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|Altcoin|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ether|ethereum etf|ethereum ETP|ETHUSDT|morning star candlestick pattern",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T05:57:54,"Coinbase breach linked to customer data leak in India - report","Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase ( NASDAQ: COIN ) was aware as early as January of a customer data leak at an outsourcing firm tied to a broader security breach that could cost up to $400 million, according to six sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters. At least one part of the breach, publicly disclosed in a May 14 SEC filing, occurred when an India-based employee of the U.S. outsourcing firm TaskUs ( NASDAQ: TASK ) was caught taking photographs of her work computer with her personal phone, according to five former TaskUs employees, the report said. The ex-employees said they were briefed on the matter by company investigators or colleagues who witnessed the incident in the Indian city of Indore, noting that the woman and a suspected accomplice were alleged to have been feeding Coinbase ( COIN ) customer information to hackers in return for bribes. The ex-employees and person familiar with the matter said more than 200 TaskUs ( TASK ) employees were soon fired in a mass layoff that drew Indian media attention. Coinbase had previously blamed ""support agents overseas"" for the breach, which it estimated could cost up to $400 million.

2025-06-03T05:57:53,"Crypto ATM operators in Australia hit with cash limits and tougher compliance checks","Australia has introduced new operating conditions and cash transaction limits for crypto ATM providers to curb scams and enhance anti-money laundering compliance. In a June 3 press release , the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) stated that crypto ATM operators must now implement a cash deposit and withdrawal cap of 5,000 Australian dollars (approximately $3,250). Operators must also display scam warning messages at machines to alert users about potential fraud . In addition, ATM providers are now required to conduct more thorough customer checks and enhance their transaction monitoring for suspicious activity. “These conditions are designed to help protect individuals from scams and businesses from criminal exploitation,” AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said in a statement. “In light of the risks and harms we consider it is absolutely necessary to ensure the sector meets minimum standards and reduces the criminal misuse of crypto ATMs,” he added. The new rules come as part of an enforcement initiative following an AUSTRAC taskforce investigation into crypto ATM usage across the country. The task force analyzed data from nine providers and found that individuals aged over 50 accounted for nearly 72% of all transaction value, with those aged 60 to 70 making up 29% alone. You might also like: Australia cracks down on crypto ATM providers over anti-money laundering rule compliance The agency also refused to renew the registration of one operator, Harro’s Empires, citing ongoing risks of misuse. It warned that other digital currency exchange providers failing to meet their obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act could face similar consequences. Although the current cash limit applies only to crypto ATM providers, AUSTRAC urged all exchanges accepting cash to consider adopting similar thresholds to reduce exposure to financial crime risks. In collaboration with the Australian Federal Police-led Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre (JPC3), AUSTRAC has also developed educational materials that will be placed near ATMs to alert users about common scam tactics, warning signs, and how to report suspicious activity. The announcement follows AUSTRAC’s warnings earlier this year, when it cautioned crypto ATM providers that non-compliance with AML/CTF rules would lead to legal action. At the time, AUSTRAC said it had already been working with industry participants since December 2024 to improve standards across the growing network of machines. Authorities highlighted that some Australians had lost their life savings after being directed to crypto ATMs by scammers. With most machines accepting only cash for Bitcoin purchases, officials say this raises significant risks of exploitation. Meanwhile, in a separate June 3 report , the Australian Federal Police reported 150 scam-related cases involving crypto ATMs between January 2024 and January 2025, with losses exceeding 3.1 million Australian dollars. Authorities believe the actual number may be higher, as many victims are either unaware they’ve been defrauded or are hesitant to come forward. As of last check, Australia is home to over 1,800 crypto ATMs, a dramatic rise from just 23 machines in 2019. According to AUSTRAC, nearly 150,000 transactions occur annually through these machines, moving an estimated $275 million in cash, with Bitcoin, Tether, and Ether being the primary assets purchased.

Analysts say Ethereum’s breakout versus Bitcoin could trigger a 250x altcoin market rally, with ETH/BTC forming bullish cup-and-handle patterns targeting 55% upside. Bitcoin Pepe raises $13.6m in its extended presale, timing perfectly with the altcoin rotation as the world’s first Bitcoin Layer 2 meme ICO prepares massive exchange announcements for June 17th The altcoin rotation everyone has been waiting for has just kicked into gear. Bitcoin’s stranglehold on the market is cracking. Ethereum just posted its first positive monthly return in 2025, rallying 46% in May as institutional money floods back into altcoins. Meanwhile, whale addresses holding between 10K-100K ETH grew their holdings by a massive 1.4 million ETH during the month—the largest monthly whale buying pressure since July 2022. Institutional investors poured $494 million into Ethereum ETFs during May—nine straight days of buying that shows they’re betting big on higher prices. ETH/BTC breakout signals massive altcoin explosion incoming Ethereum is forming some interesting patterns that historically precede massive altcoin runs. When you look at the ETH/BTC chart, it’s showing patterns that historically appear right before major altcoin rallies begin. When Ethereum starts outperforming Bitcoin, it signals that investors are rotating money out of Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies. Above : ETH/BTC ratio breaks higher, which may stimulate a huge altcoin season soon. Source : TradingView . Analyst Trader Tardigrade believes Ethereum’s breakout versus Bitcoin could initiate the altseason in 2025, taking cues from periods when Ether’s outperformance versus Bitcoin has coincided with massive rallies in the altcoin market, namely the 2,500%-plus gains during the 2020-2021 crypto bull market. $ETHBTC is forming a Bullish Cup and Handle pattern A breakout could kick off #Altseason in 2025 pic.twitter.com/70rrxzw2Bu — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) May 31, 2025 The technical analysis suggests this rotation could push Ethereum 30-55% higher against Bitcoin over the next few months. History shows that when ETH’s strength builds versus Bitcoin in such a way, smaller projects like Bitcoin Pepe emerge as the best crypto to buy now. Solana is also flashing buy signals while testing the critical $159 support level. As long as Solana holds above the $159 support level, the asset maintains a structurally bullish outlook. The TD Sequential indicator just flashed a buy signal—typically seen during final retracement stages before new impulses begin. With this technical backdrop in place, the question becomes which assets are positioned to capture the most upside. History shows that infrastructure plays and established ecosystems with real utility, they tend to lead during these rotations. Three projects stand out amid this context: Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): The Bitcoin infrastructure play hitting at the perfect time Bitcoin Pepe is tackling something no one else has figured out—bringing meme coin trading to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Most projects try to compete with Bitcoin; BPEP extends it by building a layer 2 that delivers Solana-speed transactions on the world’s most secure network. The project recently extended its presale to lock in additional tier 1 exchange partnerships. All existing investors get a 30% token bonus, and major announcements drop June 17th. Smart timing, considering altcoin season momentum is building. Think about what this solves. Bitcoin has $2 trillion in value but processes seven transactions per second. Meanwhile, meme coins need fast, cheap transactions to go viral. Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 standard bridges that gap—thousands of transactions per second while settling on Bitcoin. The team’s already secured numerous partnerships, such as Plena Finance for mobile DeFi, GETE Network for gaming infrastructure, and BE__TV for viral content distribution. They’re building actual use cases rather than launching into the void. All staking pools sold out completely, with the top tier hitting 10,000% APY. That’s serious demand from investors who see what’s coming. Currently at $0.0396 with $13.6m raised, the window closing before June 17th potentially changes the game for Bitcoin meme trading. Ethereum (ETH): The altseason catalyst with institutional backing Ethereum is leading the altcoin charge. As the infrastructure layer for most DeFi, NFTs, and altcoins, ETH benefits when any part of the ecosystem grows. It’s the ‘picks and shovels’ play for altcoin season. Currently trading around $2,500 after hitting resistance at $2,750, Ethereum is holding key support levels that often precede major moves higher. The whale accumulation data is also strong, with 1.4 million ETH added to large wallets, indicating a serious level of conviction among prolific traders. ETF flows also contribute to the alt season narrative. When BlackRock and friends start buying and holding instead of trading, it removes supply from circulation permanently. That’s the foundation for sustained altcoin runs—reduced selling pressure from Bitcoin’s biggest competitor. Solana (SOL): The performance powerhouse ready for meme season Solana’s quietly building the foundation for its next explosive move. Trading around $153 after testing $180 resistance, SOL is holding critical support levels while accumulating energy for the next leg up. The chart just flashed a buy signal right at the $159 support level—a compelling risk-reward setup. Volume’s picking up during recent weakness, suggesting smart money is accumulating while retail investors panic. What makes Solana essential for altcoin season is simple: speed and cost. The network processes thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees, making it the preferred platform for meme coin launches and DeFi protocols that explode during bull markets. If SOL breaks back above $180, the technical target points toward previous highs above $200. It’s positioned to profit from several altcoin season trends as it serves as both an infrastructure play and the hub for meme coin trading. Positioning for the rotation This setup doesn’t come around often. ETH whales are accumulating, technical patterns are breaking bullish, and infrastructure projects like Bitcoin Pepe are positioning themselves perfectly for the altcoin surge. When altcoin seasons hit, they move quickly. The projects that capture the most upside are usually the ones with clear catalysts, real utility, and timing that aligns with market momentum. Bitcoin Pepe checks all three boxes. The presale window is closing fast, with multiple tier 1 exchanges already locked in for launch day. Bitcoin Pepe has raised $13.6m and counting, but the June 17th announcement will be when this project truly explodes into mainstream crypto consciousness. Right now, you’re still early. Most retail investors haven’t discovered the world’s first Bitcoin layer 2 meme project. But when those exchange announcements hit and people realize what BPEP actually solves—bringing meme coin speed to Bitcoin’s ecosystem—these presale prices become a distant memory.

2025-06-03T05:30:53,"Bitcoin Could Go ‘Bananas’ If Price Closes Above This Level, Top Analyst Says","An analyst has explained how Bitcoin has been tracking Gold for a while now, which could provide hints about what may be next for BTC. Bitcoin Has Been Following In Gold’s Footsteps on 2-Day Timeframe Last year, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards shared in an X post how Bitcoin was following the same structure as the Gold all-time high (ATH). Below is the chart that the analyst posted back then. From the graph, it’s visible that BTC was consolidating at its 2021 ATH in a manner similar to Gold’s movement around the 1980 ATH. The latter’s consolidation ended with it breaking out and rallying to a point two times higher. Related Reading: Solana Down 13%, But This Indicator Just Turned Bullish In a new post, Edwards has shared a late update on how things ended up playing out for Bitcoin. As the consolidation around the respective ATHs already hinted, there indeed ended up being some similarity between the breakouts for the prices of the two assets as well. But this is all in the past, where does the latest Bitcoin price action stack up against Gold? Here is another chart posted by the analyst, highlighting the point BTC is currently at: As Edwards has highlighted in the graph, BTC’s breakout since the consolidation phase around the ATH has continued to resemble Gold’s, except for the fact that BTC’s volatility has been roughly twice as high, in terms of both upward and downward moves. That said, the cryptocurrency’s latest close has looked less promising than what the precious metal displayed at a similar stage in its structure. It’s possible that the two could diverge from here, but in the case that they don’t, Gold’s path may provide a glimpse into what could lie ahead for the coin. As is apparent from the chart, the traditional safe-haven asset saw a significant surge from this point. Based on this, the analyst has noted, “close back above $110K and this will probably go bananas.” It now remains to be seen how things would play out for Bitcoin in the near future. Related Reading: Crypto Bulls See $644M Bloodbath As Bitcoin Dips Below $105,000 In some other news, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora has shared data related to how the cryptocurrency’s supply is currently distributed among the various segments of the sector. It would appear the individual investors control around 69.4% of the total potential Bitcoin supply. The ETFs and other funds own around 6.1%, while businesses about 4.4%. About 7.5% of all BTC that there ever will be has already been lost due to missing keys and/or being forgotten.

2025-06-03T05:30:00,"SEC Opens Bitcoin ETF Rule Review as Staking Guidance Faces Internal Rebuttal","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is under renewed scrutiny following two key developments that signal a shifting stance on cryptocurrency regulation. The agency recently invited public feedback on a rule change that could allow in-kind redemptions for the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund, while also releasing updated guidance suggesting certain crypto staking services may not be classified as securities. The moves have drawn sharp criticism from former SEC officials and current commissioners alike, raising questions about legal consistency and the Commission’s evolving role in digital asset oversight. SEC Seeks Public Input on In-Kind Redemptions for WisdomTree Bitcoin ETF The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a formal review process and is inviting public commentary on whether to permit in-kind creations and redemptions for the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved earlier this year. The move signals a potential shift in regulatory posture toward more flexible and crypto-native ETF structures, but for now, the agency is asking stakeholders to weigh in. The SEC’s call for public feedback, issued Monday, follows previous delays and open-ended inquiries concerning in-kind redemptions for a number of major crypto funds, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, and the VanEck Ethereum Trust. “Institution of proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change,” the SEC wrote in its notice. “Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved.” The Commission is now giving the public 21 days to submit written comments, data, or arguments for or against allowing in-kind transactions for BTCW. The period offers a rare opportunity for both institutional and retail investors, crypto advocates, and regulatory experts to shape how the next wave of crypto ETFs are structured. Currently, most approved crypto ETFs, including BTCW, operate under a cash creation and redemption model. This means that when an investor wants to redeem shares, they receive US dollars rather than the actual underlying asset, Bitcoin, in this case. In contrast, in-kind redemptions allow investors to receive the underlying asset itself, a key feature of many traditional commodity ETFs, such as those tracking gold. This mechanism offers notable advantages: Tax efficiency for investors through avoidance of taxable events until sale. Lower transaction costs by minimizing intermediary conversions between Bitcoin and USD. Operational benefits for issuers, particularly those with on-chain capabilities. However, the SEC has long been hesitant to allow in-kind processes for crypto ETFs due to concerns about custody, market manipulation, and the regulatory status of crypto-native infrastructure. WisdomTree’s ETF Journey WisdomTree’s spot Bitcoin ETF , launched in January 2024, was one of several spot products approved after years of rejection by the SEC. Its approval was seen as a landmark event following Grayscale’s legal victory over the SEC in 2023, which compelled the agency to reconsider its hardline stance on spot Bitcoin ETFs. The current debate over in-kind redemptions is likely the next major battleground in the maturation of Bitcoin ETFs. A shift toward approving such mechanisms could pave the way for more efficient fund operations and greater institutional involvement in the crypto space. It would also reduce reliance on fiat settlements, aligning these products more closely with the ethos of decentralization and digital asset mobility. Industry leaders have advocated strongly for this change. BlackRock, in particular, has been vocal in its requests for in-kind permissions, suggesting that current cash-only models are suboptimal and inconsistent with traditional ETF standards. The SEC’s decision to formally institute proceedings, rather than approve or deny the request outright, indicates that the agency is seeking to build a robust legal and public record before issuing a final verdict. This approach mirrors its process during the spot ETF approval saga, in which waves of public commentary, institutional lobbying, and judicial pressure eventually influenced regulatory direction. If approved, WisdomTree’s BTCW could become one of the first US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs to offer redemptions in actual Bitcoin — a feature that has been long sought after by crypto-native investors and fund managers alike. A Decision with Broader Ramifications Should the SEC approve in-kind transactions for BTCW, it would likely set a precedent for other issuers, including BlackRock, VanEck, and Fidelity, all of whom have expressed interest in similar capabilities. Moreover, the implications go beyond Bitcoin. Ethereum ETFs, which are still under review, could benefit from the framework set by BTCW’s outcome, potentially enabling a new generation of physically settled digital asset ETFs. As the 21-day window for public comment opens, the SEC is positioning itself to make one of the most consequential ETF-related decisions since the initial wave of spot approvals. SEC Faces Internal and External Firestorm Over Staking Guidance Shift Meanwhile, controversy erupted following new guidance issued by the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance on May 29, which stated that some crypto staking offerings may not qualify as securities under the Securities Act. The updated stance effectively provides relief to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains and opens a new chapter in the SEC’s evolving approach to digital asset regulation. While the guidance was framed as an effort to provide clarity, critics argue it’s anything but. Among the harshest critics is John Reed Stark, former chief of the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, who unleashed a scathing critique on social media. In a lengthy post on X, Stark accused the agency of undermining its core mission of investor protection. “This is how the SEC dies – in plain view,” Stark wrote. “It’s a shameful abdication of its investor protection mission and a betrayal of its proud 90-year legacy.” Stark emphasized that the SEC’s new position directly contradicts federal court rulings in high-profile cases against Binance and Coinbase, in which judges acknowledged that staking programs could indeed be treated as securities offerings under the Howey test, the foundational legal standard used to define securities. While the Coinbase case had been allowed to proceed in March 2024, it was later dismissed in February 2025, a shift many saw as foreshadowing the SEC’s new guidance. Similarly, the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance's staking program was dismissed with prejudice in May 2025, barring the agency from refiling the case, a ruling that marked a symbolic defeat for the regulator’s aggressive stance on staking. Internal Divide: SEC Commissioners at Odds The regulatory turmoil is not limited to external voices. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, a sitting member of the SEC, issued a sharply worded dissent in response to the May 29 guidance, arguing that the new interpretation does not align with legal precedent. “The staff’s analysis may reflect what some wish the law to be,” Crenshaw said, “but it does not square with the court decisions on staking and the longstanding Howey precedent on which they are based.” Crenshaw further warned that the SEC's recent actions are part of a broader trend of policy inconsistency and regulatory retreat. “This is yet another example of the SEC’s ongoing ‘fake it till we make it’ approach to crypto — taking action based on anticipation of future changes while ignoring existing law.” Her statement echoes a growing concern that the agency is attempting to rewrite policy through enforcement discretion, a practice that could lead to a ”regulatory vacuum” where market participants are left to guess what rules apply. Over the past six months, the SEC has adopted what many in the industry see as a deregulatory posture toward digital assets. In addition to dropping several lawsuits and investigations, the agency has hosted multiple closed-door roundtables with industry stakeholders aimed at ”collaborative rulemaking.” Critics like Stark have described this shift as a “crypto-deregulatory blitzkrieg” — a rapid pivot that not only contradicts prior agency enforcement actions but also risks undermining the SEC’s credibility with courts and investors alike. Regulatory Contradictions and Token Classification Confusion The May 29 guidance has also reignited a key debate over the classification of specific crypto assets. Commissioner Crenshaw pointed to a pattern of inconsistency in the SEC’s treatment of assets like Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL). “How is it that these crypto assets are supposedly not securities when it comes to registration requirements, but conveniently are securities when a registrant sees an opportunity to sell a new product?” she asked. These comments reflect ongoing frustration over the SEC’s lack of clear standards for asset classification, a problem that has plagued U.S. crypto regulation for years. Not everyone at the Commission shares these concerns. At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, Commissioner Hester Peirce, widely known as “Crypto Mom” for her pro-innovation stance, defended the agency’s approach. “Most crypto assets, as we see them today, are probably not themselves securities,” Peirce said. “That doesn’t mean that you can’t sell a token that is not itself a security in a transaction that is a securities transaction.” Peirce emphasized that the SEC’s focus should be on the structure of the offering, not the underlying asset — a nuanced legal position that she argues requires contextual, rather than categorical, regulation. Her comments, though more tempered, align with the growing industry consensus that transaction-level guidance is essential to resolving the murky legal landscape surrounding staking and token offerings. A Divided Commission, A Fragmented Framework As it stands, the SEC appears increasingly divided on crypto policy, with Commissioners Peirce and Crenshaw representing opposing philosophical camps: one advocating for principle-based innovation, the other warning of legal overreach and dilution of the Commission’s regulatory responsibilities. In the meantime, crypto companies are left in regulatory limbo, unsure whether future products involving staking — such as staking-as-a-service, validator pooling, or liquid staking tokens — will require registration, trigger enforcement, or receive a green light under the new interpretation. For institutional investors and retail users alike, the shifting regulatory landscape creates significant uncertainty.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9408/sec-opens-bitcoin-etf-rule-review-as-staking-guidance-faces-internal-rebuttal,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Strategy retains the right to redeem all 2.5 million shares if less than 25% remain outstanding, and it can also redeem if certain tax events occur, it stated. This preferred stock offering gives the firm more capital to buy more Bitcoin while offering investors a potential 10% dividend. However, the dividends aren’t guaranteed, and the company can skip them without penalty. Additionally, there is an adjustable liquidation preference, which is an unusual feature designed to protect investors if the stock price rises significantly after issuance. Moreover, the involvement of major investment banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, and TD Securities, as underwriters, suggests this is a substantial fundraising effort. “Our treasury strategy is designed to provide investors with varying degrees of economic exposure to Bitcoin by offering a range of securities, including equity and fixed income instruments,” the firm stated in the prospectus. Strategy Buys More BTC On June 2, Strategy announced that it had purchased a further 705 BTC, worth $75.1 million, at around $106,495 per BTC. The firm has been making regular purchases following Michael Saylor’s tweeting a screenshot from his portfolio tracker . The latest Bitcoin buy brings its treasury to 580,955 BTC or almost 3% of the circulating supply. The huge stash is worth $61.46 billion at current market prices and has an unrealized profit of 51% or $20.7 billion and a dollar cost average purchase price of $70,000 per BTC. The firm’s class A stock (MSTR) gained a little on the day to reach $372 in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance. Shares in the company are up 28.5% year-to-date. Bitcoin had gained marginally on the day to top $106,000 during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session.

2025-06-03T04:12:45,"Ethereum Extends Winning Streak to 6 Weeks, Inflows Hit $1.19 Billion","Ethereum has led digital asset inflows over the past week, marking its strongest run since early 2024. With $321 million in inflows in the past seven days, Ethereum extended its winning streak to six consecutive weeks. This brings the total for this timeframe to $1.19 billion, the most since December 2024, which reflected “a decisive improvement in sentiment” according to CoinShares. Digital Asset AUM Drops Despite Ethereum’s Inflow Streak According to the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report ,’ digital asset investment products recorded $286 million in inflows last week, which extended their seven-week streak to $10.9 billion. However, total assets under management dropped from $187 billion to $177 billion due to market volatility spurred by U.S. tariff concerns. Bitcoin started the week with solid inflows, but momentum shifted mid-week after a New York Court ruled US tariffs illegal, leading to $8 million in outflows by week’s end – the first dip after six straight weeks of $9.6 billion inflows. Meanwhile, there were $3.6 million in outflows from short Bitcoin funds last week, suggesting traders are less confident that BTC will fall. Ethereum dominated inflows this week, but Sui, Solana, and Chainlink also saw modest gains of $2.2 million, $1.5 million, and $0.8 million, respectively, while Cardano posted a minor $0.1 million in weekly inflows. On the other hand, XRP led the outflows this week, shedding over $28 million. Multi-asset investment products also saw $2.4 million in outflows during the same period. Investor Focus Diversifies Investor attention slightly shifted away from the United States, though it still brought in $199 million in inflows last week. Germany followed with $42.9 million, and Australia attracted $21.5 million. Hong Kong stood out, recording its highest weekly inflow – $54.8 million – since the launch of its exchange-traded products over a year ago. Canada settled for $4.5 million in inflows. The same cannot be said for Switzerland, which bucked the trend, as it faced $32.8 million in outflows, which made it one of the few countries with net outflows so far this year.
