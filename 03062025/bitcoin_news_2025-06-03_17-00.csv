2025-06-03T14:57:15,"Money Flooding Into  Ethereum—Is the Momentum Building for the ETH Price Rally to $4000?","The post Money Flooding Into Ethereum—Is the Momentum Building for the ETH Price Rally to $4000? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Ethereum price is experiencing a notable surge, trading around $2625 after marking a significant rebound from the recent lows. The rise has been bolstered by substantial inflows of ETFs, marking the largest weekly inflow of 2025. This suggests the institutional interest is fueling the bullish momentum. On the other hand, the US SEC has recently approved staking programs for Ethereum, enhancing investors’ confidence and contributing to increased demand. Besides, the ETH price is heading towards a breakout zone of a bullish pattern, suggesting a potential reversal and signalling positive market sentiment. Meanwhile, the drop in the ETH reserves in the CEXs points towards self-custody and accumulation. The key resistance was breached at $2550 with nearly 288K in trading volume, due to which the overall trend remains bullish as higher lows continue to hold. Meanwhile, the token has formed a bullish morning star pattern in the monthly charts, pointing towards a long-term reversal to the upside. On the other hand, the Open Interest and volume are both rising, substantiating the bullish claim. What’s next? When will the ETH price breakout from the accumulation and reach $3000? The daily chart shows the price accumulating within a bullish, ascending triangle while the range between $2691 and $2712 is acting as a strong resistance zone. Meanwhile, the CMF has rebounded after testing the average range at 0, hinting towards a significant influx of liquidity that may help the price to remain elevated. Besides, the MACD displays a drop in the selling pressure, which may further promote a bullish crossover. This could help the price rise beyond the pattern that may further validate the beginning of a fresh bullish trend. Therefore, until the Ethereum price remains above $2550, the bullish structure could continue to prevail, with the upper target between $2700 and $3000 being the key resistance. However, a confirmation at $2800 could be pivotal as a downside risk arises if the support is broken. On the other hand, ETH/BTC is also showing signs of reversal, implying possible Ethereum outperformance vs. Bitcoin and a broader altseason.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/money-flooding-into-ethereum-is-the-momentum-building-for-the-eth-price-rally-to-4000/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T14:55:29,"Australia adds over 400 crypto ATMs in 2025","Almost one third of the population owns digital assets in Australia, so it’s hardly surprising that the country has installed over 400 new Bitcoin ( BTC ) ATMs in 2025. This brings the number of BTC ATM installations from 1,385 on January 1, 2025 to 1,821 as of June 3 as per data from CoinATMradar . The statistics solidify Australia’s position as the third-largest crypto ATM market in the world, behind only the United States and Canada. BTC ATM installations growth in Australia. Source: CoinATMRadar.com Crypto ATM regulations in Australia There’s been a lot of drama surrounding cryptocurrency ATMs in Australia, as scams using the machines have resulted in losses amounting to AU$3.1 million (~US$2 million) over a 12-month period. Today, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) introduced new rules to prevent crypto ATM misuse, including a new AU$5,000 (~US$3,250) limit on cash transactions. While the limits apply directly to ATM operators, AUSTRAC implores digital currency exchanges to follow suit, especially if they also accept physical cash. With around 150,000 transactions annually, crypto ATMs are clearly the preferred entry point for many residents, particularly those aged 60 to 70 (i.e., those most vulnerable to scams), according to AUSTRAC. Still, the Australian Bitcoin ATM market continues to grow, as evidenced by the expanding ATM infrastructure. The primary challenge for the regulatory bodies will lie in ensuring that growth continues in a safe environment.

2025-06-03T14:34:42,"Cardano to $1.50, XRP to $3, Bitcoin to $110K if June ETF Buzz Holds Up","Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing with excitement as key players like Cardano , XRP , and Bitcoin show signs of promising gains . Predictions suggest impressive price surges—Cardano aiming for $1.50, XRP seeking $3, and Bitcoin potentially hitting $110K. Looking into the factors that could drive these coins higher, this article delves into the latest market dynamics and trends. Cardano Price Insights: Analyzing Recent Performance and Current Levels Cardano experienced a slight decline of about 0.43% over the past month, reflecting minimal fluctuations in short-term price actions. However, the last six months showed a more significant drop of nearly 41.46%, indicating a sustained bearish trend. Price movements during this period demonstrated limited recovery, with market sentiment remaining cautious amidst wider negative trends. The contrast between the monthly and half-year performances reveals underlying vulnerabilities in market confidence that have become apparent over time. Current prices are trading between a low of $0.597 and a high of $0.819, with nearest resistance at $0.95 and a secondary point at $1.17. Downside support is noted at $0.51, with an additional cushion at $0.29. With bears dominating based on indicators like the Awesome Oscillator at -0.055 and an RSI of 42.09, the outlook appears negative. Traders should watch for potential buying opportunities if prices rally above $0.95. Conversely, a drop below $0.51 could indicate further bearish momentum, warranting close attention to shifts within these levels. XRP Price Patterns: Modest Gains Amid Long-Term Decline XRP experienced a modest increase of 0.75% in the last month while facing a 6.67% drop over the past six months. Price oscillated within a $1.95 to $2.53 range, reflecting a brief recovery despite ongoing downward pressure. Recent behavior shows that short-term gains are overshadowed by longer-term trends that remain negative. Trading activity highlights mixed signals, with temporary stabilization often yielding to broader weakness. Indicators suggest potential for short-term rebounds, but sustained factors continue to suggest a bearish outlook. XRP currently trades within a range of roughly $1.95 to $2.53, with important levels for traders. Resistance is near $2.88, and support holds at about $1.73. Additional resistance around $3.45 and secondary support near $1.15 may influence price actions. Indicators show slight downward momentum; the Awesome Oscillator at -0.133 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.125 indicate seller impact. The RSI at 43.52 suggests a lack of overbought conditions, yet bears maintain a visible advantage. The absence of a clear trend means oscillation around key levels is likely. Traders might consider short-term trades near support while being cautious of resistance levels, where selling pressure could rise. Bitcoin Price Trends and Current Market Dynamics Bitcoin experienced a rise of nearly 10% over the past month while displaying a 7% growth over the last six months. A slight dip over the past week indicates minor short-term weakness amid the overall upward movement. Price fluctuations during this period highlight a balance between gradual gains and intermittent pullbacks. Previous trading sessions saw improvement in price levels that suggest growing buyer interest despite occasional downturns, making the historical trend one of cautious recovery and steady advancement. The current price holds between $95,000 and $113,000, with key support at about $85,000 and resistance near $122,000. A secondary support around $66,000 and additional resistance close to $140,000 provide crucial zones to monitor. The market sentiment shows bulls and bears in near equilibrium with no strong directional trend. Traders can consider entering positions near the support if the price dips or setting stops around the resistance if buyers push higher, allowing for strategic, risk-managed trades. Conclusion If the excitement around the June ETF persists, ADA might reach $1.50, XRP could hit $3, and BTC might climb to $110K. The outcomes depend heavily on the ETF's impact.

2025-06-03T14:32:16,"Riot Platforms Boosts Bitcoin Output to 514 BTC as Hashrate and Expansion Plans Ramp Higher","Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) reported on Tuesday strong production growth in May, mining 514 BTC — an 11% increase from April and a 139% jump compared to the year-ago level. The company sold nearly all the new bitcoin, generating $51.3 million in proceeds at an average price of $102,591 per token. Riot’s hashrate also climbed, with total deployed computing power reaching 35.4 exahashes per second, a 5% increase over April and 142% higher than the previous year. Operating efficiency improved as well, with the fleet running at 21.2 joules per terahash — down from 28 J/TH last May. Beyond mining, Riot is positioning itself for growth in the AI and high-performance computing (HPC) sectors. In May, the company closed the acquisition of 355 acres of land near its Corsicana facility in Texas. CEO Jason Les said the site will support the development of data centers tailored for enterprise and hyperscale clients, noting that these centers require significantly larger footprints than traditional mining operations. To lead this effort, Riot hired industry veteran Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer. The move signals Riot’s ambition to diversify beyond bitcoin and into the fast-growing market for AI-ready infrastructure.

In an interview with Barron’s, Moynihan says four reasons contribute to the exceptionalism of the US as a place to invest and do business. “What’s fundamentally strong about the United States is the rule of law. The ability to have a flexible workforce, the ability to bring people into the country, even under different sets of rules over time. But the ability to have innovation… from research all the way through the process into commercialization at a level no one else has. And that capital markets’ capability, that innovation from pure science all the way through to the commercialization of it. Those are things America’s had. And then the other thing that makes America important is the final demand. [At] the end of the day, the biggest economy in the world, two-thirds of it driven by consumer activity. That is a place that if I’m selling consumer goods of any kind in the world, or machines to make consumer goods or whatever, I’ve got to think about the United States as a market. Because even though other places have more population, the size of spending and the GDP per capita are not close.” According to the Bank of America CEO, sentiment on the US could change over the short term, but the fundamental advantages the world’s largest economy enjoys will persist. “I think there will be ebbs and flows in the views of what to do for the next six months, year, two years. But across long periods of time, America’s the best place to invest.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While the Paris-based organization’s forecast coincided with stocks having weathered tariff-related volatility to close green on Monday, underlying trends suggest the global economy is heading for its weakest growth since the Covid pandemic. In its latest report, the OECD warned that global economic growth is expected to slow from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.9% in both 2025 and 2026. For the U.S., the OECD projects that annual gross domestic product growth will decline from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. “The global economy has shifted from a period of resilient growth and declining inflation to a more uncertain path,” said OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann. “Our latest economic outlook shows that today’s policy uncertainty is weakening trade and investment, diminishing consumer and business confidence and curbing growth prospects.” Tariffs and continued uncertainty are likely to fuel further negativity across financial markets, with swings aligning with trade agreements or breakdown of talks. Markets have already followed this trajectory amid U.S.-China trade tensions, and similarly during the episode when former U.S. President Donald Trump recommended, then postponed, 50% tariffs on the European Union.

Referring to large companies accumulating Bitcoin (BTC), CZ said that they were taking a big risk with their BTC accumulation strategy. At this point, CZ, quoting a post listing major companies that bought Bitcoin in May 2025, commented, “Not taking risks is a risk in itself.” According to May data, GameStop led the majors by purchasing more than 4,000 BTC, followed by US firm Strike with 1,500 BTC.

Regarding the companies holding Bitcoin treasuries that emerged in May, CZ said that “every company takes risks” and the risks are not binary. CZ stated that avoiding crypto completely is the biggest risk today, and said that investors should manage their risks by expressing that they should take risks in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments. When asked how much risk he was taking, CZ replied, “A lot.” He said he was holding more fiat than he wanted and planned to reduce that position. “These companies take risks.

The feature allows developers to leverage staked assets from any integrated blockchain to verify protocol decisions on any other supported chain. According to a press release shared with Cryptonews, Relay unlocks shared staking logic and trustless coordination across blockchain ecosystems, which was previously impossible for developers. “This opens the door for protocols to build bridges, settlement layers, oracles, and rollups without relying on multisigs or proof-of-authority setups, and without sacrificing decentralization,” Symbiotic noted. Staking is Possible Between Entirely Different Networks, Tokens The announcement marks the first time, stake alignment is possible between different networks, tokens, and consensus layers. Additionally, this capability introduces a new paradigm for building truly multichain decentralized applications (dApps), the release explained. Algys Ievlev, co-founder of Symbiotic, emphasized the difficulties in building secure multichain infrastructure, which remained expensive custom work. “Relay solves that,” he noted. It makes verifiable, stake-backed coordination between chains as simple as a plug-in without any trust assumptions or permissioning, enabling secure outcomes across ecosystems.” Besides, for users, the dApps can verify outcomes and process interactions across chains, without trust issues. Symbiotic Relay Enables a Unified Crypto Ecosystem The feature combines the strengths of the largest blockchain ecosystems into a single coordination layer, the release read. Chains including Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana , which were once siloed, can now be tapped simultaneously. This includes combining Bitcoin’s security, Ethereum’s programmability, and Solana’s speed, all while using staked capital as a shared source of verifiable security. In April, Symbiotic raised a $29 million Series A funding round led by Pantera Capital. The funding saw participation from Coinbase Ventures and more than 100 angel investors across industry-leading teams such as Aave, Polygon, and StarkWare. Symbiotic announced a $29 million fund that would launch the Universal Staking framework, extending blockchain security into broader economic coordination. #Symbiotic #Staking #BlockchainSecurity https://t.co/8lXScjcp88 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 23, 2025 Misha Putiatin, co-founder of Symbiotic, told Cryptonews at the TOKEN2049 Dubai exclusive interview that the company is already working with over 40 networks, preparing to launch. “Most protocols want to reward users and create meaningful alignment between users and protocol success,” he told Cryptonews. “But there hasn’t been a flexible, modular system that lets you do that across multiple chains—until now.” The post Coinbase-Backed Symbiotic Launches ‘Relay’ for Trustless Multichain Staking and Consensus appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-backed-symbiotic-launches-relay-for-trustless-multichain-staking-and-consensus/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|SOL|SPONSORED","Blockchain News|Staking|Symbiotic",cryptocompare

Strategic Diversification and Treasury Resilience The move, revealed in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 2, positions the Hong Kong -based logistics technology and real estate company among a growing list of global firms turning to Bitcoin as a reserve asset. According to details from the filing, Reitar Logtech’s proposed Bitcoin acquisition is part of a broader treasury diversification initiative aimed at reinforcing the company’s financial resilience. The firm plans to use the digital asset allocation to support its global logistics technology infrastructure expansion while leveraging the benefits of holding a non-correlated financial asset. CEO’s Perspective Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Chan emphasized the strategic rationale behind the move, stating, “This strategic treasury diversification initiative underscores our commitment to maintaining a strong financial foundation while scaling our global logistics technology platform…By exploring bitcoin treasury allocation, we aim to fortify our financial position while aligning with digital transformation trends in the supply chain industry.” BTC Program and Acquisition Framework The Nasdaq-listed firm (RITR) disclosed it is in advanced negotiations with a consortium of institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals experienced in digital asset investments. Under its proposed ""BTC Program,"" Reitar Logtech would acquire Bitcoin held by the consortium by issuing its ordinary shares. The number of shares allocated would be determined based on the prevailing Bitcoin price and the company’s share price at the time of each transaction. The company’s tentative plan outlines the purchase of 15,000 Bitcoin, with an illustrative valuation of $1.5 billion based on a hypothetical price of $100,000 per Bitcoin. Reitar’s management indicated the initiative would not only bolster its balance sheet but also provide operational flexibility for logistics technology acquisitions and expansion into high-growth Asian smart logistics markets. Market Reaction and Next Steps Following the announcement and SEC filing, shares of Reitar Logtech rose by 9% on Monday, reflecting investor optimism around the strategic shift. The positive market response signals a broader acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets as credible components of corporate treasury strategies. Reitar Logtech noted that discussions remain ongoing, with the final terms subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory clearances, and due diligence processes. The company acknowledged that there is no guarantee the deal will proceed or that any Bitcoin will ultimately be purchased. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While eyes are on Hedera (HBAR) long-term value as analysts debate whether $2 is too ambitious, and bold calls on XRP investment return range from $22 to $150 by 2040, there’s a new player heating up early portfolios. Meet Unstaked, an AI-powered SocialFi platform that’s doing more than just talking utility. Its $1 million giveaway isn’t just hype, it’s bait for believers. Twenty people will win $50,000 in $UNSD each, just for getting in before the mainnet drops. With over a billion tokens already sold, a $5 future price target, and real AI agents that automate Web3 tasks for creators, DAOs, and projects, Unstaked is building fast. Early entries aren’t just hoping for upside, they’re locking in utility. If you’re asking what is the next big crypto, this might be your answer. Unstaked isn’t waiting for hype to find it, it’s building the reason to stay. Unstaked Giveaway Goes Viral: $1M UNSD on the Table Unstaked is doing more than talking, it’s putting $1 million in $UNSD on the table. Twenty winners will each walk away with $50,000 worth of tokens. But this isn’t just some promo stunt, it’s a calculated push to supercharge user onboarding before things really take off. Every giveaway entry doubles as early access to the presale. You’re not just entering to win, you’re locking in tokens ahead of listings. Right now, the presale is in stage 18, and $UNSD is priced at $0.010743. Over 1 billion tokens have already been sold, and Unstaked has raised nearly $9 million. This isn’t vaporware, real tools are already in the works. AI agents built by Unstaked are designed to moderate DAOs, automate payouts, boost creator revenue, and streamline Web3 community tasks. If you’re still asking what is the next big crypto, this project deserves a hard look. Unstaked has the three things every serious project needs, utility, incentive, and a story people want to be part of. It’s not just another memecoin hoping for hype. It’s delivering value with AI that actually works. As the Web3 space shifts toward automation, Unstaked could become core infrastructure. The $1 million giveaway is just the beginning. It’s an open invite to early adopters who want to do more than speculate. If what is the next big crypto is the question on your mind, Unstaked might be the most serious answer you’ll find right now. HBAR Charts Show Room to Grow Hedera is trying to bounce back, but analysts say a move to $2 needs more than hope. C-Zar, a well-followed crypto YouTuber, highlighted that unless Hedera (HBAR) long-term value aligns with a big Bitcoin rally, targets over $1.80 could be too ambitious. The key short-term hurdle is the $0.183–$0.188 range. A clean break above this level could spark momentum, but falling back to $0.15 isn’t off the table either, and that might just be the reset it needs. Zooming out, C-Zar mapped bull flag patterns suggesting a potential run to $1.20–$1.80. He even mentioned a $2 price as possible, if HBAR and Bitcoin peak together during the next bull wave. Until then, analysts see the Hedera (HBAR) long-term value sitting somewhere more modest, but with solid upside. For traders betting on long-term growth and a smart recovery, HBAR’s current setup offers both a challenge and an opportunity. Can You Retire with XRP? Breaking Down the Bold XRP Investment Return Predictions XRP is sitting near $2.15 today, and future targets are all over the place. One analysis puts a XRP investment return at $22 by 2040, solid but steady. At that rate, $500,000 would need around 22,727 XRP today, or roughly $53,000 invested. For a $1 million return, you’d need double that. The prediction leans on wider adoption for international payments and regulatory clarity. Then there’s the $150 moonshot prediction by Google Gemini. That would change everything, only 3,333 XRP would be enough to hit $500,000. But that scenario would take massive global usage and near-perfect market conditions. Most analysts say the real target likely sits somewhere between $22 and $150. Still, for long-term holders, the XRP investment return potential is real. It may not be an overnight success story, but for patient investors looking for high upside, XRP is still in the conversation. Parting Thoughts Hedera (HBAR) long-term value still looks promising if it clears resistance at $0.188 and aligns with Bitcoin’s next rally. Analysts say a run toward $1.80 or even $2 is possible, but perfect timing is key. Meanwhile, XRP investment return projections vary wildly, from a solid $22 by 2040 to a moonshot $150. For long-term holders, the upside is hard to ignore if global adoption picks up. But if you’re asking what is the next big crypto, Unstaked might be it. Its $1 million giveaway isn’t just marketing, it’s a real shot to get in early. With over 1 billion tokens sold, $9 million raised, and the price now at $0.010743 in stage 18, momentum is building. The $5 target may sound bold, but with real AI tools launching soon and a fired-up community, Unstaked is turning heads. If you’re looking for an early entry before listings hit, this might be your window.

As many as 61 publicly listed companies have adopted the cryptocurrency as a treasury asset, and these firms now own a combined 673,897 bitcoin as of the end of May, or 3.2% of the cryptocurrency's total supply, the report said. That big number, of course, owes nearly everything to Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), which by itself holds a total of 580,955 tokens. ""Based on the 2022 example of Core Scientific (CORZ), we estimate that prices more than 22% below average purchase prices could lead to liquidations,"" wrote Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. In the bear market of that year, the bitcoin miner under considerable financial pressure sold 7,202 bitcoins in June 2022 at an average price of $23,000 to raise about $167 million.. ""The forced sale price (forced in the sense that creditors would no longer fund Core Scientific's business model) was just 22% below the cost of production,"" said Kendrick. If bitcoin were to move back below the $90,000 level, half of these bitcoin treasuries would be underwater, he added.

2025-06-03T13:53:49,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: AI-Fueled Energy Crisis Could Trigger $250K BTC Boom","The US session Bitcoin price is accelerating, recently hitting an intraday high of $106,500 before consolidating at $105,336, up 0.83% in the last 24 hours. It’s all about the sentiment shift, as concerns about Bitcoin’s energy consumption are easing in light of the growing energy demands of artificial intelligence (AI). With institutional buying, we might see a run to $250,000. AI’s Energy Appetite Shifts Spotlight From Bitcoin For years, Bitcoin has faced criticism over its energy consumption, which amounts to around 176 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually. However, a recent study in Joule projects that AI could soon overshadow Bitcoin’s impact, with predictions that AI may consume 49% of global data center electricity by 2025, totaling approximately 201 TWh per year. New analysis by Alex de Vries-Gao predicts that by late 2025, AI’s power consumption will approach half of all global data center energy use — meaning AI could soon outpace Bitcoin mining! #AI #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/jIfhjLrktm — YomirGo (@YomirGo) June 3, 2025 Industry experts, such as Alex de Vries-Gao , note that AI’s unchecked growth is driven by big tech firms rapidly expanding their infrastructure without complete transparency on energy usage. Nvidia alone has been absorbing nearly 48% of Taiwan Semiconductor’s chip packaging capacity, underscoring the surge in demand for AI hardware. Elon Musk’s xAI initiative aims to create one of the world’s largest AI superclusters, intensifying concerns about energy demands. This shift in focus from Bitcoin’s energy use to AI’s consumption has improved Bitcoin’s environmental perception among investors, helping it regain momentum. Institutional Confidence Drives Bullish Outlook; Bitcoin Supported? Adding fuel to Bitcoin’s rally is The Blockchain Group’s recent acquisition of 624 BTC worth $68.7 million, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC, valued at over $106 million. The company plans to acquire 260,000 BTC by 2033, reflecting robust institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

Bitcoin Technical Setup Points to $250K Potential Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC has formed a tightening symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart, with dynamic support from the 50-period exponential moving average (EMA) near $105,295. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick patterns, including doji and spinning tops, suggest indecision and potential reversal, while the MACD is turning bullish with an impending crossover. Entry: Buy above $106,571 on confirmation. Target: $108,933, with a potential upside to $250K as catalysts align. Stop-loss: Below $105,215 to manage risk. This unique combination of AI’s energy impact, improved sentiment, and rising institutional interest presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s next significant move toward $250,000. BTC Bull Token Presale Nears $7.8M Cap as 61% APY Staking Attracts Investors With BTC/USD trading near $105K, attention is rapidly shifting to altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . As of today, the presale has raised $6,772,528.93 out of a $7,789,647 cap, with just over $1 million left before the next price hike. BTC-Pegged Rewards and Supply Burns Drive Scarcity BTC Bull Token’s innovative mechanism ties rewards directly to Bitcoin’s price. Here’s how it works: BTC Airdrops: Token holders receive BTC rewards, with presale participants enjoying priority. Supply Reductions: For every $50,000 increase in BTC’s price, a portion of $BTCBULL is burned, reducing overall supply and supporting token value. Current Token Price: $0.002545, poised to rise as the cap nears. This approach blends dynamic rewards with built-in scarcity, aligning $BTCBULL’s value with Bitcoin’s performance. 61% APY Staking Pool Without Lockups BTC Bull Token’s staking pool offers an enticing 61% APY, currently holding 1,731,936,103 $BTCBULL. The key benefits include: No Lockups or Fees: Investors can stake and unstake their tokens freely without incurring penalties. Full Liquidity: Access funds anytime, unlike typical DeFi lockups. Consistent Yields: Passive income for token holders, independent of market conditions. This structure appeals to both seasoned DeFi investors and newcomers seeking yield without complex terms. Momentum Builds Ahead of Presale Cap With less than $1 million left before the presale closes, buyers are moving fast. BTCBULL’s combination of BTC-tied rewards, strategic burns, and high-yield staking is driving participation. The presale offers an opportunity to enter before the subsequent price increase, especially as BTC’s price action intensifies.

2025-06-03T13:52:44,"Altcoin season builds as Ethereum outpaces Bitcoin with ETF inflows: MEXC","Ethereum is leading Bitcoin in ETF flows post-Pectra upgrade, suggesting a coming altcoin season, says Tracy Jin of MEXC. Bitcoin’s (BTC) grip on the crypto market may soon loosen. On Tuesday, June 3, MEXC COO Tracy Jin shared her analysis with crypto.news, highlighting significant signs of an upcoming altcoin season. Notably, Jin explains that Ethereum’s (ETH) performance following the Pectra upgrade is showing strong momentum. “Ethereum is decisively leading the charge for transition and capital rotation into altcoins in this current market cycle, and other coins like XMR, ENA, HYPE, AAVE, and ARB are following suit, posting more than 5% gains in contrast to BTC’s muted 0.6% gain during Tuesday’s recovery rally,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. You might also like: Here’s why we won’t see altcoin season any time soon, according to analysts Jin also emphasized that exchange-traded fund flows have recently tilted decisively in Ethereum’s favor. Specifically, Ethereum ETFs have recorded an 11-day streak of inflows totaling $630 million. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw three consecutive days of outflows, totaling $1.2 billion. According to Jin, this indicates rising institutional interest in Ethereum, especially in the aftermath of the Pectra upgrade. She notes that more institutions are now considering alternatives to Bitcoin ahead of the next market cycle. You might also like: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is a game changer, staking infrastructure firm P2P.org explains We are not in altcoin season yet, Jin suggests Still, Jin clarifies that the altcoin season has not officially begun. For one, only 27 out of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong at 63.1% . That said, Ethereum has posted modest gains, with its dominance increasing by 2% in May. “While recent altcoin performance has been encouraging, history suggests that the true altseason typically begins when Bitcoin’s dominance starts to diminish, and doesn’t take hold until Bitcoin’s dominance starts to decline more meaningfully,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. For a full-fledged altcoin season to emerge, Jin believes Bitcoin’s dominance must drop more sharply. She suggests this is possible as Bitcoin stabilizes at the psychological level of $100,000. In that case, Ethereum could break through the $2,750 resistance and rally toward $3,200.

The proposal, submitted in January by Bitcoin champion Ethan Peck, representing the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), asked Meta to convert a portion of its $72 billion in excess cash and cash equivalents into the apex crypto to better preserve shareholder value. The measure touted Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and strong past performance compared to bonds, as a more reliable long-term store of value. Peck claimed that the tech giant should treat the largest crypto as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to endure monetary policy uncertainty. He also pointed out that Meta’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable. While Meta doesn’t want to hold crypto on its balance sheet, the firm has previously dipped its toes into blockchain. In June 2019, it unveiled Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That project collapsed in 2022 after unwelcome regulatory scrutiny and internal wrangles, rebranding briefly as Diem before shutting down and selling assets to crypto bank Silvergate . Peck also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon on behalf of the conservative think tank NCPPR. Microsoft shareholders voted against the plan in December, while Amazon shareholders are awaiting a vote on whether to put at least 5% of the company’s assets into Bitcoin. Bitcoin Treasury Frenzy Though Bitcoin treasury proposals were rejected by Meta and Microsoft, global publicly listed companies continue accumulating the flagship crypto. Data tracked by Bitcoin Treasuries shows that over 115 public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, with one of the newest entrants being GameStop. Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads all publicly traded firms with 580,955 BTC , worth over $60 billion, while eight others, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Elon Musk’s Tesla, each hold roughly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/meta-wont-add-bitcoin-to-balance-sheet-as-shareholders-strongly-reject-treasury-proposal/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T13:35:02,"XRP court ruling clarifies crypto status, counters claims by Bitcoin advocates","Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) marked a key turning point last year when Judge Analisa Torres issued a decision on XRP’s legal status. The ruling clarified that retail sales of XRP do not constitute investment contracts, effectively placing them outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. This decision has been pivotal in shaping the regulatory understanding of digital assets, despite ongoing debates from Bitcoin advocates who continue to claim XRP lacks clear classification. Ripple lawyer Bill Morgan has now directly addressed these arguments, asserting that legal clarity has been established where it matters most — in court. bill morgan @Belisarius2020 · Follow There is illogical nonsense being spread about the issue of legal clarity and XRP. The proposition is that XRP lacks legal clarity because no court has ‘classified’ what it is. Bitcoin maxis say Bitcoin has been classified as a commodity but XRP has not been so classified so 4:06 PM · Jun 3, 2025 73 Reply Copy link Read 12 replies XRP retail sales not securities, says Torres ruling Morgan, a pro-Ripple legal analyst, outlined that the core issue in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple was never about labelling XRP itself as a security or commodity, but whether the nature of its sale to investors met the criteria of an investment contract under existing securities law. Judge Torres found that institutional sales of XRP did meet that definition, while retail sales did not. This dual outcome provided a nuanced legal framework that separates XRP’s treatment based on how and to whom it was sold. Morgan explained that US courts do not assign labels to digital assets. Instead, they resolve disputes based on the facts of a case. Therefore, the question of whether XRP is a security or commodity misses the point. The clarity comes from how the court interpreted the law in the context of XRP’s distribution — a distinction often overlooked by critics. Bitcoin classification argument lacks legal grounding Bitcoin supporters — often referred to as Bitcoin Maximalists or “Maxis” — have argued that because XRP has not received a classification from regulatory bodies such as the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), it remains in a legal grey area. They contrast this with Bitcoin’s status as a commodity recognised by both agencies, suggesting this places Bitcoin on firmer regulatory footing. Morgan challenged that logic, stating that classification is not absolute and can vary depending on the legal framework of different countries. For instance, Australian authorities treat Bitcoin as property rather than a commodity. He noted that insisting on a single, universal classification is legally flawed and undermines how the court system functions in the US. In his view, the ruling from Judge Torres has already settled the question of XRP’s legal status for retail sales, and that alone constitutes meaningful clarity. Ripple supports regulatory framework for crypto In addition to the courtroom win, Ripple has also welcomed legislative developments aimed at improving the regulatory environment for digital assets. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty endorsed the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act passed in the US last week, which aims to provide clearer rules for the classification and regulation of cryptocurrencies. Morgan echoed the sentiment, adding that clarity should come through legal outcomes rather than political declarations or market assumptions. He maintained that the court ruling on XRP offers a strong precedent for how digital asset transactions should be assessed going forward. Rather than fixating on labels, he said, regulators and industry participants should focus on how assets are used and sold in practice. In a symbolic gesture of reconciliation, Ripple co-founder Brad Garlinghouse donated the “Skull of Satoshi” artwork — often seen as a satirical emblem of crypto culture — to the Bitcoin community. While largely symbolic, the move appeared to aim at diffusing hostilities between supporters of rival blockchain platforms following years of animosity.

STRD will offer exposure to BTC for private investors, to be sold to selected buyers in an IPO. Strategy announced STRD, a new perpetual preferred stock, which will be sold to selected investors in an IPO. The new shares will be part of the financing tools for additional BTC acquisitions. BREAKING: Strategy launches $STRD , its third preferred stock this year. Offering a 10% perpetual dividend and 6× Bitcoin backing—via IPO to select investors. pic.twitter.com/kSG6s6Oh52 — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) June 3, 2025 Stride (STRD) is the third offering, happening in what Strategy considers a strong market environment. The new asset will tap the services of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Moelis & Company and TD Securities for its launch and distribution. The IPO happens at a time when all Strategy assets are putting on strong performances, including the MSTR common stock, as well as previous preferred assets STRF and STRK. The decision to add another preferred type of shares follows the outperformance of Strategy compared to other technical stocks. Strategy to offer dividends on STRD Strategy (MSTR, STRF, STRK) announced its plans to sell 2.5M of the new preferred STRD shares. Depending on market conditions and approval, Strategy will sell 10% Series A preferred stock with the STRD ticker. The proceeds from the sale will go toward the company’s regular BTC purchases , as well as general corporate purchases and working capital. The preferred stock sale will give some momentum to the company’s BTC purchases, though in the past weeks, the buying was mostly financed with MSTR sales and smaller placements of STRK. The latest BTC purchase was financed with STRF and STRK proceeds. STRD will carry non-mandatory dividends at a 10% yearly rate, after approval by the board of directors. If the board declares a dividend, STRD will observe payment periods on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year. The first dividend payment period will start on September 30. The STRD dividends will be non-cumulative and will not accrue additional interest or rewards. The dividends will be payable fully in cash. The STRD shares can accrue over 10% in dividends during favorable conditions. Strategy also reserves the right to redeem all STRD shares if the amount of shares outstanding is less than 25% of the total supply. In that case, Strategy has a right to a full redemption, but no partial purchases. The liquidation price of STRD is set at $100, and holders can also demand repurchase in the case of unusual events and unfavorable market conditions. The STRD asset carries a higher risk Compared to STRF and STRK, the new STRD asset is higher-risk. The priority in case of liquidation will be above common stock holders, but below STRK. The new STRD shares will carry no BTC upside. Strategy currently carries 0.00209 BTC per share, though not all investors will have a claim on that reserve in the case of unfavorable market events. The sale is considered a boost in the short term, especially for investors seeking passive income. However, the non-cumulative, non-mandatory dividends are seen as risky, in addition to exposure in the case of a bear market. Strategy has mentioned it may sell some of its BTC holdings to cover dividend payments. So far, Strategy has not announced sales, though not all of its wallets are public. The current stock strategy has created a flywheel effect for BTC, but only during a period of growth, with high risks during a bear market. The recent stock sale coincides with BTC stability, as the price recovered to $105,375. MSTR has fallen to $372.27, following a brief rally above $400.
