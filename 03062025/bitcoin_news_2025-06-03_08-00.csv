2025-06-03T05:57:53,"Crypto ATM operators in Australia hit with cash limits and tougher compliance checks","Australia has introduced new operating conditions and cash transaction limits for crypto ATM providers to curb scams and enhance anti-money laundering compliance. In a June 3 press release , the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) stated that crypto ATM operators must now implement a cash deposit and withdrawal cap of 5,000 Australian dollars (approximately $3,250). Operators must also display scam warning messages at machines to alert users about potential fraud . In addition, ATM providers are now required to conduct more thorough customer checks and enhance their transaction monitoring for suspicious activity. “These conditions are designed to help protect individuals from scams and businesses from criminal exploitation,” AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said in a statement. “In light of the risks and harms we consider it is absolutely necessary to ensure the sector meets minimum standards and reduces the criminal misuse of crypto ATMs,” he added. The new rules come as part of an enforcement initiative following an AUSTRAC taskforce investigation into crypto ATM usage across the country. The task force analyzed data from nine providers and found that individuals aged over 50 accounted for nearly 72% of all transaction value, with those aged 60 to 70 making up 29% alone.

It warned that other digital currency exchange providers failing to meet their obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act could face similar consequences. Although the current cash limit applies only to crypto ATM providers, AUSTRAC urged all exchanges accepting cash to consider adopting similar thresholds to reduce exposure to financial crime risks. In collaboration with the Australian Federal Police-led Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre (JPC3), AUSTRAC has also developed educational materials that will be placed near ATMs to alert users about common scam tactics, warning signs, and how to report suspicious activity. The announcement follows AUSTRAC’s warnings earlier this year, when it cautioned crypto ATM providers that non-compliance with AML/CTF rules would lead to legal action. At the time, AUSTRAC said it had already been working with industry participants since December 2024 to improve standards across the growing network of machines. Authorities highlighted that some Australians had lost their life savings after being directed to crypto ATMs by scammers. With most machines accepting only cash for Bitcoin purchases, officials say this raises significant risks of exploitation. Meanwhile, in a separate June 3 report , the Australian Federal Police reported 150 scam-related cases involving crypto ATMs between January 2024 and January 2025, with losses exceeding 3.1 million Australian dollars. Authorities believe the actual number may be higher, as many victims are either unaware they’ve been defrauded or are hesitant to come forward. As of last check, Australia is home to over 1,800 crypto ATMs, a dramatic rise from just 23 machines in 2019. According to AUSTRAC, nearly 150,000 transactions occur annually through these machines, moving an estimated $275 million in cash, with Bitcoin, Tether, and Ether being the primary assets purchased.

Analysts say Ethereum’s breakout versus Bitcoin could trigger a 250x altcoin market rally, with ETH/BTC forming bullish cup-and-handle patterns targeting 55% upside. Bitcoin Pepe raises $13.6m in its extended presale, timing perfectly with the altcoin rotation as the world’s first Bitcoin Layer 2 meme ICO prepares massive exchange announcements for June 17th The altcoin rotation everyone has been waiting for has just kicked into gear. Bitcoin’s stranglehold on the market is cracking. Ethereum just posted its first positive monthly return in 2025, rallying 46% in May as institutional money floods back into altcoins. Meanwhile, whale addresses holding between 10K-100K ETH grew their holdings by a massive 1.4 million ETH during the month—the largest monthly whale buying pressure since July 2022. Institutional investors poured $494 million into Ethereum ETFs during May—nine straight days of buying that shows they’re betting big on higher prices. ETH/BTC breakout signals massive altcoin explosion incoming Ethereum is forming some interesting patterns that historically precede massive altcoin runs. When you look at the ETH/BTC chart, it’s showing patterns that historically appear right before major altcoin rallies begin. When Ethereum starts outperforming Bitcoin, it signals that investors are rotating money out of Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies. Above : ETH/BTC ratio breaks higher, which may stimulate a huge altcoin season soon. Source : TradingView . Analyst Trader Tardigrade believes Ethereum’s breakout versus Bitcoin could initiate the altseason in 2025, taking cues from periods when Ether’s outperformance versus Bitcoin has coincided with massive rallies in the altcoin market, namely the 2,500%-plus gains during the 2020-2021 crypto bull market. $ETHBTC is forming a Bullish Cup and Handle pattern A breakout could kick off #Altseason in 2025 pic.twitter.com/70rrxzw2Bu — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) May 31, 2025 The technical analysis suggests this rotation could push Ethereum 30-55% higher against Bitcoin over the next few months. History shows that when ETH’s strength builds versus Bitcoin in such a way, smaller projects like Bitcoin Pepe emerge as the best crypto to buy now. Solana is also flashing buy signals while testing the critical $159 support level. As long as Solana holds above the $159 support level, the asset maintains a structurally bullish outlook. The TD Sequential indicator just flashed a buy signal—typically seen during final retracement stages before new impulses begin. With this technical backdrop in place, the question becomes which assets are positioned to capture the most upside. History shows that infrastructure plays and established ecosystems with real utility, they tend to lead during these rotations. Three projects stand out amid this context: Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): The Bitcoin infrastructure play hitting at the perfect time Bitcoin Pepe is tackling something no one else has figured out—bringing meme coin trading to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Most projects try to compete with Bitcoin; BPEP extends it by building a layer 2 that delivers Solana-speed transactions on the world’s most secure network. The project recently extended its presale to lock in additional tier 1 exchange partnerships. All existing investors get a 30% token bonus, and major announcements drop June 17th. Smart timing, considering altcoin season momentum is building. Think about what this solves. Bitcoin has $2 trillion in value but processes seven transactions per second. Meanwhile, meme coins need fast, cheap transactions to go viral. Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 standard bridges that gap—thousands of transactions per second while settling on Bitcoin. The team’s already secured numerous partnerships, such as Plena Finance for mobile DeFi, GETE Network for gaming infrastructure, and BE__TV for viral content distribution. They’re building actual use cases rather than launching into the void. All staking pools sold out completely, with the top tier hitting 10,000% APY. That’s serious demand from investors who see what’s coming. Currently at $0.0396 with $13.6m raised, the window closing before June 17th potentially changes the game for Bitcoin meme trading. Ethereum (ETH): The altseason catalyst with institutional backing Ethereum is leading the altcoin charge. As the infrastructure layer for most DeFi, NFTs, and altcoins, ETH benefits when any part of the ecosystem grows. It’s the ‘picks and shovels’ play for altcoin season. Currently trading around $2,500 after hitting resistance at $2,750, Ethereum is holding key support levels that often precede major moves higher. The whale accumulation data is also strong, with 1.4 million ETH added to large wallets, indicating a serious level of conviction among prolific traders. ETF flows also contribute to the alt season narrative. When BlackRock and friends start buying and holding instead of trading, it removes supply from circulation permanently. That’s the foundation for sustained altcoin runs—reduced selling pressure from Bitcoin’s biggest competitor. Solana (SOL): The performance powerhouse ready for meme season Solana’s quietly building the foundation for its next explosive move. Trading around $153 after testing $180 resistance, SOL is holding critical support levels while accumulating energy for the next leg up. The chart just flashed a buy signal right at the $159 support level—a compelling risk-reward setup. Volume’s picking up during recent weakness, suggesting smart money is accumulating while retail investors panic. What makes Solana essential for altcoin season is simple: speed and cost. The network processes thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees, making it the preferred platform for meme coin launches and DeFi protocols that explode during bull markets. If SOL breaks back above $180, the technical target points toward previous highs above $200. It’s positioned to profit from several altcoin season trends as it serves as both an infrastructure play and the hub for meme coin trading. Positioning for the rotation This setup doesn’t come around often. ETH whales are accumulating, technical patterns are breaking bullish, and infrastructure projects like Bitcoin Pepe are positioning themselves perfectly for the altcoin surge. When altcoin seasons hit, they move quickly. The projects that capture the most upside are usually the ones with clear catalysts, real utility, and timing that aligns with market momentum. Bitcoin Pepe checks all three boxes. The presale window is closing fast, with multiple tier 1 exchanges already locked in for launch day. Bitcoin Pepe has raised $13.6m and counting, but the June 17th announcement will be when this project truly explodes into mainstream crypto consciousness. Right now, you’re still early. Most retail investors haven’t discovered the world’s first Bitcoin layer 2 meme project. But when those exchange announcements hit and people realize what BPEP actually solves—bringing meme coin speed to Bitcoin’s ecosystem—these presale prices become a distant memory.

2025-06-03T05:30:53,"Bitcoin Could Go ‘Bananas’ If Price Closes Above This Level, Top Analyst Says","An analyst has explained how Bitcoin has been tracking Gold for a while now, which could provide hints about what may be next for BTC. Bitcoin Has Been Following In Gold’s Footsteps on 2-Day Timeframe Last year, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards shared in an X post how Bitcoin was following the same structure as the Gold all-time high (ATH). Below is the chart that the analyst posted back then. From the graph, it’s visible that BTC was consolidating at its 2021 ATH in a manner similar to Gold’s movement around the 1980 ATH. The latter’s consolidation ended with it breaking out and rallying to a point two times higher. Related Reading: Solana Down 13%, But This Indicator Just Turned Bullish In a new post, Edwards has shared a late update on how things ended up playing out for Bitcoin. As the consolidation around the respective ATHs already hinted, there indeed ended up being some similarity between the breakouts for the prices of the two assets as well. But this is all in the past, where does the latest Bitcoin price action stack up against Gold? Here is another chart posted by the analyst, highlighting the point BTC is currently at: As Edwards has highlighted in the graph, BTC’s breakout since the consolidation phase around the ATH has continued to resemble Gold’s, except for the fact that BTC’s volatility has been roughly twice as high, in terms of both upward and downward moves. That said, the cryptocurrency’s latest close has looked less promising than what the precious metal displayed at a similar stage in its structure. It’s possible that the two could diverge from here, but in the case that they don’t, Gold’s path may provide a glimpse into what could lie ahead for the coin. As is apparent from the chart, the traditional safe-haven asset saw a significant surge from this point. Based on this, the analyst has noted, “close back above $110K and this will probably go bananas.” It now remains to be seen how things would play out for Bitcoin in the near future.

It would appear the individual investors control around 69.4% of the total potential Bitcoin supply. The ETFs and other funds own around 6.1%, while businesses about 4.4%. About 7.5% of all BTC that there ever will be has already been lost due to missing keys and/or being forgotten.

2025-06-03T05:30:00,"SEC Opens Bitcoin ETF Rule Review as Staking Guidance Faces Internal Rebuttal","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is under renewed scrutiny following two key developments that signal a shifting stance on cryptocurrency regulation. The agency recently invited public feedback on a rule change that could allow in-kind redemptions for the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund, while also releasing updated guidance suggesting certain crypto staking services may not be classified as securities. The moves have drawn sharp criticism from former SEC officials and current commissioners alike, raising questions about legal consistency and the Commission’s evolving role in digital asset oversight. SEC Seeks Public Input on In-Kind Redemptions for WisdomTree Bitcoin ETF The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a formal review process and is inviting public commentary on whether to permit in-kind creations and redemptions for the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved earlier this year. The move signals a potential shift in regulatory posture toward more flexible and crypto-native ETF structures, but for now, the agency is asking stakeholders to weigh in. The SEC’s call for public feedback, issued Monday, follows previous delays and open-ended inquiries concerning in-kind redemptions for a number of major crypto funds, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, and the VanEck Ethereum Trust. “Institution of proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change,” the SEC wrote in its notice. “Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved.” The Commission is now giving the public 21 days to submit written comments, data, or arguments for or against allowing in-kind transactions for BTCW. The period offers a rare opportunity for both institutional and retail investors, crypto advocates, and regulatory experts to shape how the next wave of crypto ETFs are structured. Currently, most approved crypto ETFs, including BTCW, operate under a cash creation and redemption model. This means that when an investor wants to redeem shares, they receive US dollars rather than the actual underlying asset, Bitcoin, in this case. In contrast, in-kind redemptions allow investors to receive the underlying asset itself, a key feature of many traditional commodity ETFs, such as those tracking gold. This mechanism offers notable advantages: Tax efficiency for investors through avoidance of taxable events until sale. Lower transaction costs by minimizing intermediary conversions between Bitcoin and USD. Operational benefits for issuers, particularly those with on-chain capabilities. However, the SEC has long been hesitant to allow in-kind processes for crypto ETFs due to concerns about custody, market manipulation, and the regulatory status of crypto-native infrastructure. WisdomTree’s ETF Journey WisdomTree’s spot Bitcoin ETF , launched in January 2024, was one of several spot products approved after years of rejection by the SEC. Its approval was seen as a landmark event following Grayscale’s legal victory over the SEC in 2023, which compelled the agency to reconsider its hardline stance on spot Bitcoin ETFs. The current debate over in-kind redemptions is likely the next major battleground in the maturation of Bitcoin ETFs. A shift toward approving such mechanisms could pave the way for more efficient fund operations and greater institutional involvement in the crypto space. It would also reduce reliance on fiat settlements, aligning these products more closely with the ethos of decentralization and digital asset mobility. Industry leaders have advocated strongly for this change. BlackRock, in particular, has been vocal in its requests for in-kind permissions, suggesting that current cash-only models are suboptimal and inconsistent with traditional ETF standards. The SEC’s decision to formally institute proceedings, rather than approve or deny the request outright, indicates that the agency is seeking to build a robust legal and public record before issuing a final verdict. This approach mirrors its process during the spot ETF approval saga, in which waves of public commentary, institutional lobbying, and judicial pressure eventually influenced regulatory direction. If approved, WisdomTree’s BTCW could become one of the first US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs to offer redemptions in actual Bitcoin — a feature that has been long sought after by crypto-native investors and fund managers alike. A Decision with Broader Ramifications Should the SEC approve in-kind transactions for BTCW, it would likely set a precedent for other issuers, including BlackRock, VanEck, and Fidelity, all of whom have expressed interest in similar capabilities. Moreover, the implications go beyond Bitcoin. Ethereum ETFs, which are still under review, could benefit from the framework set by BTCW’s outcome, potentially enabling a new generation of physically settled digital asset ETFs. As the 21-day window for public comment opens, the SEC is positioning itself to make one of the most consequential ETF-related decisions since the initial wave of spot approvals. SEC Faces Internal and External Firestorm Over Staking Guidance Shift Meanwhile, controversy erupted following new guidance issued by the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance on May 29, which stated that some crypto staking offerings may not qualify as securities under the Securities Act. The updated stance effectively provides relief to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains and opens a new chapter in the SEC’s evolving approach to digital asset regulation. While the guidance was framed as an effort to provide clarity, critics argue it’s anything but. Among the harshest critics is John Reed Stark, former chief of the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, who unleashed a scathing critique on social media. In a lengthy post on X, Stark accused the agency of undermining its core mission of investor protection. “This is how the SEC dies – in plain view,” Stark wrote. “It’s a shameful abdication of its investor protection mission and a betrayal of its proud 90-year legacy.” Stark emphasized that the SEC’s new position directly contradicts federal court rulings in high-profile cases against Binance and Coinbase, in which judges acknowledged that staking programs could indeed be treated as securities offerings under the Howey test, the foundational legal standard used to define securities. While the Coinbase case had been allowed to proceed in March 2024, it was later dismissed in February 2025, a shift many saw as foreshadowing the SEC’s new guidance. Similarly, the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance's staking program was dismissed with prejudice in May 2025, barring the agency from refiling the case, a ruling that marked a symbolic defeat for the regulator’s aggressive stance on staking. Internal Divide: SEC Commissioners at Odds The regulatory turmoil is not limited to external voices. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, a sitting member of the SEC, issued a sharply worded dissent in response to the May 29 guidance, arguing that the new interpretation does not align with legal precedent. “The staff’s analysis may reflect what some wish the law to be,” Crenshaw said, “but it does not square with the court decisions on staking and the longstanding Howey precedent on which they are based.” Crenshaw further warned that the SEC's recent actions are part of a broader trend of policy inconsistency and regulatory retreat. “This is yet another example of the SEC’s ongoing ‘fake it till we make it’ approach to crypto — taking action based on anticipation of future changes while ignoring existing law.” Her statement echoes a growing concern that the agency is attempting to rewrite policy through enforcement discretion, a practice that could lead to a ”regulatory vacuum” where market participants are left to guess what rules apply. Over the past six months, the SEC has adopted what many in the industry see as a deregulatory posture toward digital assets. In addition to dropping several lawsuits and investigations, the agency has hosted multiple closed-door roundtables with industry stakeholders aimed at ”collaborative rulemaking.” Critics like Stark have described this shift as a “crypto-deregulatory blitzkrieg” — a rapid pivot that not only contradicts prior agency enforcement actions but also risks undermining the SEC’s credibility with courts and investors alike. Regulatory Contradictions and Token Classification Confusion The May 29 guidance has also reignited a key debate over the classification of specific crypto assets. Commissioner Crenshaw pointed to a pattern of inconsistency in the SEC’s treatment of assets like Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL). “How is it that these crypto assets are supposedly not securities when it comes to registration requirements, but conveniently are securities when a registrant sees an opportunity to sell a new product?” she asked. These comments reflect ongoing frustration over the SEC’s lack of clear standards for asset classification, a problem that has plagued U.S. crypto regulation for years. Not everyone at the Commission shares these concerns. At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, Commissioner Hester Peirce, widely known as “Crypto Mom” for her pro-innovation stance, defended the agency’s approach. “Most crypto assets, as we see them today, are probably not themselves securities,” Peirce said. “That doesn’t mean that you can’t sell a token that is not itself a security in a transaction that is a securities transaction.” Peirce emphasized that the SEC’s focus should be on the structure of the offering, not the underlying asset — a nuanced legal position that she argues requires contextual, rather than categorical, regulation. Her comments, though more tempered, align with the growing industry consensus that transaction-level guidance is essential to resolving the murky legal landscape surrounding staking and token offerings. A Divided Commission, A Fragmented Framework As it stands, the SEC appears increasingly divided on crypto policy, with Commissioners Peirce and Crenshaw representing opposing philosophical camps: one advocating for principle-based innovation, the other warning of legal overreach and dilution of the Commission’s regulatory responsibilities. In the meantime, crypto companies are left in regulatory limbo, unsure whether future products involving staking — such as staking-as-a-service, validator pooling, or liquid staking tokens — will require registration, trigger enforcement, or receive a green light under the new interpretation. For institutional investors and retail users alike, the shifting regulatory landscape creates significant uncertainty.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9408/sec-opens-bitcoin-etf-rule-review-as-staking-guidance-faces-internal-rebuttal,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

It intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital,” it stated. The firm is enabling preferred stock options to “institutional investors and select non-institutional investors,” said Saylor. Strategy today announced the launch of $STRD (“Stride”), a new perpetual preferred stock offering, available to institutional investors and select non-institutional investors. For more information, click here. $MSTR https://t.co/D2Wy9M2bqa — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 2, 2025 Preferred Stock Offering There will be a 10% annual dividend rate, but payments are not mandatory, and dividends are non-cumulative. Dividends will be paid quarterly, and the first payment will be on September 30, 2025. Strategy retains the right to redeem all 2.5 million shares if less than 25% remain outstanding, and it can also redeem if certain tax events occur, it stated. This preferred stock offering gives the firm more capital to buy more Bitcoin while offering investors a potential 10% dividend. However, the dividends aren’t guaranteed, and the company can skip them without penalty. Additionally, there is an adjustable liquidation preference, which is an unusual feature designed to protect investors if the stock price rises significantly after issuance. Moreover, the involvement of major investment banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, and TD Securities, as underwriters, suggests this is a substantial fundraising effort. “Our treasury strategy is designed to provide investors with varying degrees of economic exposure to Bitcoin by offering a range of securities, including equity and fixed income instruments,” the firm stated in the prospectus. Strategy Buys More BTC On June 2, Strategy announced that it had purchased a further 705 BTC, worth $75.1 million, at around $106,495 per BTC. The firm has been making regular purchases following Michael Saylor’s tweeting a screenshot from his portfolio tracker . The latest Bitcoin buy brings its treasury to 580,955 BTC or almost 3% of the circulating supply. The huge stash is worth $61.46 billion at current market prices and has an unrealized profit of 51% or $20.7 billion and a dollar cost average purchase price of $70,000 per BTC.

2025-06-03T04:30:03,"South Korea Sees First Institutional Crypto Sale Ahead Of Presidential Election – Details","South Korea saw its first institutional digital assets sale following the start of its ban lift on institutional crypto transactions. The positive development came two days before the snap presidential elections, scheduled for June 3, 2025. First Institutional Crypto Sale In South Korea On Sunday, South Korean non-profit organization World Vision made the first digital assets sale by an institution in the country. In a statement from Dunamu, Upbit’s parent company, the crypto exchange announced that it had supported the historical first sale of 0.55 Ether (ETH) by a corporation for 1.98 million won, equivalent to $1,437. Starting June 1, 2025, non-profit organizations, including charities and universities, are permitted to sell crypto holdings through local exchanges as part of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) roadmap for corporate participation in the digital asset market. In February, the FSC’s Virtual Asset Committee announced it would gradually lift its ban on institutional investment in digital assets by allowing the creation of real-name accounts for institutions, starting with non-profits in Q2 2025. In South Korea, real-name accounts are required for crypto investments, with only the accounts that have completed this verification under the Specified Financial Transaction Information Act being allowed to invest in digital assets. Nonetheless, the FSC had guided banks not to issue these accounts to corporations, limiting institutional crypto trading despite the absence of legal barriers or official bans. As Dunamu revealed, World Vision was able to connect its K Bank corporate account to its Upbit account and successfully sold the Ethereum received as donations three months ago through the exchange’s KRW market. Dunamu and the non-profit conducted a digital assets donation campaign in March, targeting Upbit users to purchase school uniforms, backpacks, and other essential items needed for the new school year for vulnerable teenagers who struggle to afford them. Upbit’s parent company revealed its plan to continue supporting non-profit organizations to sell their digital assets received as donations while “adhering to guidelines established by financial authorities and the industry to establish a healthy virtual asset donation culture.” Additionally, it announced it is preparing for the second phase of FSC’s roadmap, where qualified publicly traded companies and professional investors will be allowed to access the digital asset market in Q3 2025. A New Era For Digital Assets? This key development for the South Korean crypto industry will be followed by the June 3 snap presidential election to replace impeached president Yoon Suk-yeol, who attempted to declare martial law in December 2024. Despite the outcome, digital asset investors in the country are expected to benefit, as the two major candidates vowed to implement industry-friendly policies to capture the nearly 18 million people who invest in digital assets in South Korea. As reported by Bitcoinist, the People Power Party (PPP) candidate, Kim Moon-soo, announced he will allow spot crypto Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) if he wins. Kim vowed to push for approval of digital asset-based investment products and other financial policies to increase the wealth accumulation of the middle class. Kim’s camp cited the increasing number of digital asset investors in the younger generations as a decisive factor for incorporating spot ETFs and the institutionalization of digital assets into the pledges’ list. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) candidate, Lee Jae-myung, also pledged to introduce spot crypto ETFs and lower digital assets transaction taxes in the country. Lee promised to “create a safe virtual asset investment environment by establishing an integrated surveillance system” and “expand the cryptocurrency market while simultaneously strengthening investor protection.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/south-korea-sees-first-institutional-crypto-sale-ahead-of-presidential-election-details/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|Crypto donations|Crypto Market|ETH|Ethereum|ETHUSDT|Financial Services Commission (FSC)|FSC|South Korea crypto|south Korea Elections|South Korean authorities|South korean crypto exchange|Upbit",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T04:12:45,"Ethereum Extends Winning Streak to 6 Weeks, Inflows Hit $1.19 Billion","Ethereum has led digital asset inflows over the past week, marking its strongest run since early 2024. With $321 million in inflows in the past seven days, Ethereum extended its winning streak to six consecutive weeks. This brings the total for this timeframe to $1.19 billion, the most since December 2024, which reflected “a decisive improvement in sentiment” according to CoinShares. Digital Asset AUM Drops Despite Ethereum’s Inflow Streak According to the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report ,’ digital asset investment products recorded $286 million in inflows last week, which extended their seven-week streak to $10.9 billion. However, total assets under management dropped from $187 billion to $177 billion due to market volatility spurred by U.S. tariff concerns. Bitcoin started the week with solid inflows, but momentum shifted mid-week after a New York Court ruled US tariffs illegal, leading to $8 million in outflows by week’s end – the first dip after six straight weeks of $9.6 billion inflows. Meanwhile, there were $3.6 million in outflows from short Bitcoin funds last week, suggesting traders are less confident that BTC will fall. Ethereum dominated inflows this week, but Sui, Solana, and Chainlink also saw modest gains of $2.2 million, $1.5 million, and $0.8 million, respectively, while Cardano posted a minor $0.1 million in weekly inflows. On the other hand, XRP led the outflows this week, shedding over $28 million. Multi-asset investment products also saw $2.4 million in outflows during the same period. Investor Focus Diversifies Investor attention slightly shifted away from the United States, though it still brought in $199 million in inflows last week. Germany followed with $42.9 million, and Australia attracted $21.5 million. Hong Kong stood out, recording its highest weekly inflow – $54.8 million – since the launch of its exchange-traded products over a year ago. Canada settled for $4.5 million in inflows. The same cannot be said for Switzerland, which bucked the trend, as it faced $32.8 million in outflows, which made it one of the few countries with net outflows so far this year.

Some analysts suggest that holding its current range could send the cryptocurrency to a another retest of its historical $420 resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rise To $111,000 ATH Doesn’t Mean The Market Is Bullish, Certified Expert Says Monero Bounces From Range Lows Amid the crypto market pullback, Monero led the top 100 tokens by market capitalization list with a double-digit jump in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency surged 11.5% on Monday morning, breaking out of its seven-day downtrend. Notably, XMR has seen a 66% price increase over the past month and a half, jumping from the $220 support zone to its current levels. The token registered a significant 55% daily increase at the end of April, touching the $340 mark before retracing. The surge was reportedly fueled by a “suspicious transfer” of 3,520 BTC, worth around $330.7 million, from a potential victim of social engineering. According to crypto sleuth ZachXBT, the stolen funds were swapped for XMR, leading cryptocurrency to retest a key horizontal level. Despite this, the privacy token continued its rally during the May market recovery, which propelled XMR to a four-year high a week ago, nearing the crucial $420 resistance for the first time since 2021. Now, the market’s recent performance has sent Monero alongside the rest of the leading cryptocurrencies to retest key levels. The token retraced 21% in the past week, briefly losing its three-week price range on Saturday. However, XMR has bounced from this level over the past two days after reclaiming the $325 mark and nearing the $370 resistance. XMR Rally Hangs On This Level Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems affirmed that “Monero has an impressive chart and is likely one of the few ‘dino’ coins not far from breaking its all-time high.” He highlighted that XMR is retesting the recently flipped support and resistance zone, which is key for a rally continuation. Losing the $310-$345 area could send the cryptocurrency toward the gap between this level and the next major support around the $220 mark. Similarly, analyst Rekt Capital previously noted Monero repeated its early 2021 playbook after breaking out of its multi-year accumulation range in Q4 2024, surging above the $286 resistance and hitting last cycle’s high levels. He recently pointed out that XMR has historically ended its bull market around the key $422 resistance, with “this sort of price action for XMR occurs once every four years,” and price rallies into the major resistance “often briefly upside wicking beyond there.” Related Reading: $3 XRP Dream Delayed—No Bull Run Before November, Says Top Analyst Amid its recent rejection from the $419 cycle high, the analyst considers that Monero must hold its current range, “if price wants to go against the grain of history and break the $422 resistance over time.” If it fails to hold above the $300 mark, Rekt Capital affirmed that the $286 support is the next crucial level, but added that historically, XMR’s retest post-rejection usually fails. As of this writing, Monero trades at $366, a 32.2% increase in the monthly timeframe.

2025-06-03T03:40:05,"AI x Crypto – The Infrastructure of a New Internet Economy","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post The convergence of AI (artificial intelligence) and crypto isn’t a trend – it’s a structural shift. As both ecosystems mature, they’re beginning to solve each other’s most difficult limitations. AI brings automation, content generation and adaptive intelligence. Crypto brings trustless systems, composability and programmable ownership. Together, they are not just reshaping software – they are laying the foundation for the next internet economy. Over the past decade, crypto has quietly built the base infrastructure for a more open internet. Blockchains, smart contracts, decentralized storage and public-key systems have created the rails for verifiable, user-owned applications. But the applications themselves have often lacked a human interface. Meanwhile, AI has become a transformative force in content, conversation and utility but it exists primarily behind APIs owned by private companies. Without crypto, AI has no native way to express ownership, prove authenticity or distribute value. The intersection of these two technologies is where things get interesting. Crypto fixes the ownership problem in AI. When an AI model generates an image, a video, a song or an essay, who owns that output? Who gets credited or paid? With crypto, we can establish provenance, register outputs as NFTs, encode revenue splits via smart contracts and give AI-generated content an on-chain identity. It’s not just about digital art or collectibles – it’s about building economic rails for intelligence itself. What we’re talking about is the ability to assign financial agency to digital creators that aren’t human and to do it in a way that’s transparent, immutable and global. At the same time, AI fixes the usability problem in crypto. Crypto protocols are powerful, but they’ve always required users to learn complex interfaces and workflows. AI simplifies that. With AI-powered agents or virtual characters, crypto becomes easier to use, more intuitive and more personal. Agents can explain your transaction history, recommend a DeFi strategy, auto-compound your staking rewards or even act on your behalf. Imagine an AI wallet that knows your goals and can navigate crypto like a power user – but with zero friction. This drastically reduces the cognitive load required to participate in decentralized systems. What emerges is a new kind of software, autonomous, self-improving and financially active. Virtual influencers that post, respond and grow audiences. Trading bots that learn and adapt in real time. Digital concierges that offer services across platforms 24/7. These aren’t just AI toys. They are monetizable digital labor. They generate value, interact with users and evolve. And they require crypto infrastructure to function – wallets, payments, identity, coordination and access to permissionless systems. We’re already seeing this materialize in the creator economy. A musician can deploy a digital twin that composes, remixes and engages with fans on their behalf. A fitness influencer can scale themselves into dozens of AI-powered coach bots that interact with users in real time. Every one of these agents can be tokenized, monetized and operated autonomously. And behind it all, crypto is the connective tissue that ensures payments, permissions and provenance work at scale. These systems are already emerging. But the real opportunity is in making them composable, where developers can plug together AI models, data sources and crypto primitives to build entirely new categories of experiences. Just as Shopify enabled a long tail of e-commerce entrepreneurs, this stack will unlock a long tail of intelligent, automated and monetizable software. At a deeper level, what we’re witnessing is the birth of a new computing layer. AI turns software into services that adapt. Crypto turns services into networks that anyone can join or fork. Together, they form ecosystems that are intelligent, decentralized and economically aligned. You don’t just use the app, you own a piece of it, improve it or extend it with your own logic. There are also governance implications. As AI systems begin to participate in markets, we’ll need ways to manage collective behavior, enforce accountability and define rights – not just for human users but for the digital agents and influencers themselves. Crypto-native governance, DAOs and reputation systems may offer a starting point for building these new frameworks. The internet is evolving. We’re moving from platforms to protocols. From static pages to conversational agents. From corporate-owned to user-owned networks. In that world, AI gives us the intelligence to act. Crypto gives us the structure to coordinate. And what we build on top will redefine how people interact, earn and create online. If crypto gave us digital property rights, AI gives us digital labor. The combination isn’t just powerful, it’s inevitable – a nd we’re still early. Harrison Hines is the CEO and founder of Fleek , an agentic cloud platform that gives developers and creators the tools to create, manage and monetize AI agents and virtual influencers.

The move, announced in a company press release on June 2, will take effect at the opening of markets on June 16. The split will triple the number of shares available, reducing the price per share without affecting the fund’s overall value. 21Shares stated that the split is intended “to make shares more accessible to a broader base of investors and enhance trading efficiency.” ARKB will continue to trade under its current ticker, with no changes to its net asset value, investment strategy, or underlying Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings. The fund is a physically backed spot Bitcoin ETF that tracks the New York Variant of the Chicago Mercentile Exchange CF Bitcoin Reference Rate. It provides direct access to Bitcoin in a regulated investment environment. ARKB, which is now trading at $104.33, has gained about 27% in the last quarter and nearly 12% this year. The fund currently holds 45,410 Bitcoin, which is worth about $4.82 billion, as per SoSoValue data .

The share split comes at a time when interest in crypto ETFs is growing rapidly, following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s landmark approval of spot Bitcoin funds in January 2024. Since then, the ETF market has expanded rapidly, with $125 billion now held across 11 U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs. According to data from SoSoValue, the sector has drawn $5.26 billion in net inflows over the past month alone. 21Shares is positioning the split as part of a strategy to drive retail participation . With Bitcoin recently climbing above $100,000, lowering the per-share cost could attract new investors while maintaining institutional appeal. The company launched the first physically-backed crypto exchange-traded product in 2018. In addition to ARKB, its U.S. offerings include the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Futures Strategy ETF, which trades Bitcoin futures, and the ARK 21Shares Blockchain and Digital Payments ETF, which targets companies building products in blockchain infrastructure and digital finance.

2025-06-03T03:17:54,"AUSTRAC imposes a $3,250 cash limit on deposits and withdrawals at crypto ATMs","Australia’s financial intelligence agency has imposed new limits on cryptocurrency ATMs in a sweeping move to combat fraud and protect consumers. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) now requires all cash-based crypto transactions via ATMs to be capped at roughly USD 3,250 per transaction. This is just one part of the government’s crackdown on financial crime and scam activities that are now taking full advantage of cryptocurrency kiosks all over Australia. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said crypto ATMs are increasingly being used for financial fraud. In response, AUSTRAC set a new transaction limit and refused to renew the license of one ATM operator for failing to report transaction volumes and comply with AML/CTF laws. In addition to the limit, AUSTRAC announced tougher compliance rules. These would include the need for greater customer identity verification, compulsory scam warnings on cash machine screens, and enhanced transaction monitoring systems. The new regulations apply to all registered DCEs running crypto ATMs, with AUSTRAC urging similar limits for all cash-for-crypto services. Australia sees rapid growth in crypto ATMs Over the past seven years, the number of crypto ATMs in Australia has risen sharply. AUSTRAC reveals that over 1,800 of these machines are in operation, a steep jump from the 23 bank machines in 2019. This accelerated expansion has established Australia as the third biggest market for crypto kiosks worldwide after the United States of America and Canada. But the boom has also raised grave concerns. Many of the transactions performed on these ATMs are related to criminal activities . Enforcement agencies have found that various scammers are increasingly using the machines, including those operating romance and fake investment schemes and remote access fraud — offenses that frequently victimize older Australians. Austrac’s data analysis shows those aged 50-plus are particularly susceptible, making up 72% of all transactions by value. The 60- to 70-year-olds constitute almost 30% of this activity alone. Scammers often trick victims into using these machines to send money. AUSTRAC’s CEO warns that anyone told to use a crypto ATM for payments should pause and consider it a red flag for a scam. AUSTRAC establishes working group to strengthen supervision To address the risks, AUSTRAC has initiated a task force to assess crypto ATM providers’ developments. The squad formed in late 2024 had carried out dozens of site visits, business evaluations, and outreach sessions to registered companies. Any provider that does not then meet the enhanced, including adequate KYC (Know Your Customer) checks, transaction monitoring, and suspicious matter reporting requirements — will face enforcement action by the regulator, including deregistration. Recently, AUSTRAC permanently barred a crypto ATM operator that refused to improve its compliance measures. Australia’s action is among the harshest efforts anywhere to control the abuse of crypto ATMs. The new rules could serve as a blueprint for other countries wrestling with accommodating cryptocurrency growth while protecting consumers. Regulators in the US, UK, and the EU have also singled crypto ATMs out as a fraud and money laundering risk. By doing so, Australia joined a growing club of governments seeking to balance innovation with protections. AUSTRAC said it would like everyone to access a full range of financial services, including digital currency services, without fear of them being misused by criminals. Trust in these systems can be developed if the systems are secure, transparent, and not misused by criminals, the agency said.

2025-06-03T03:10:28,"Bitcoin ETF: SEC Weighs Game-Changing In-Kind Redemptions for WisdomTree Fund","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF: SEC Weighs Game-Changing In-Kind Redemptions for WisdomTree Fund Attention all crypto enthusiasts and financial market watchers! The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is making moves that could significantly impact the structure and mechanics of Bitcoin ETF offerings in the United States. Specifically, the regulator has opened the floor for public feedback on a crucial aspect of the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund’s operations: the potential adoption of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms. This might sound technical, but it’s a development with potentially positive ripple effects for the broader Bitcoin market. Understanding Bitcoin ETF Creation and Redemption Before diving into the specifics of the SEC Bitcoin ETF feedback request, let’s quickly recap how ETFs generally work, particularly concerning their creation and redemption processes. This is fundamental to understanding why the SEC’s request is noteworthy. ETFs, or Exchange-Traded Funds, are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. They typically hold assets like stocks, bonds, commodities, or, in this case, Bitcoin. The price of an ETF share is designed to track the value of its underlying assets. To keep the ETF’s market price aligned with the value of its holdings (Net Asset Value or NAV), specialized financial institutions called Authorized Participants (APs) can create or redeem ETF shares directly with the fund issuer. This process helps prevent significant premiums or discounts between the ETF’s market price and its NAV. There are two primary ways this creation and redemption can happen: Cash Creation/Redemption: This is the method currently used by the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. When APs create new shares, they give the fund issuer cash equivalent to the value of the Bitcoin needed. The issuer then uses this cash to buy Bitcoin on the open market. When APs redeem shares, the issuer sells Bitcoin and gives the APs cash. In-Kind Creation/Redemption: This is the method commonly used by ETFs holding physical assets like gold or shares of stock. When APs create new shares, they deliver the actual underlying assets (Bitcoin, in this case) to the fund issuer in exchange for new ETF shares. When APs redeem shares, they receive a basket of the underlying assets (Bitcoin) from the issuer in exchange for returning ETF shares. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Cash Model (Current U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs) In-Kind Model (SEC is reviewing for WisdomTree) Creation Process APs give cash to issuer. Issuer buys Bitcoin. APs give Bitcoin to issuer. Issuer creates shares. Redemption Process APs return shares to issuer. Issuer sells Bitcoin and gives cash to APs. APs return shares to issuer. Issuer gives Bitcoin to APs. Market Impact (Selling Pressure) Issuer may sell Bitcoin on open market during redemptions. Issuer transfers Bitcoin directly to APs during redemptions, avoiding open market sales. Operational Complexity Simpler from issuer’s perspective (handles cash). More complex (requires secure handling and transfer of Bitcoin). Tax Implications (Potential) Potential for capital gains events for the fund when selling Bitcoin for redemptions. May avoid capital gains events for the fund during redemptions (assets are transferred, not sold). Why the SEC is Requesting Feedback on In-Kind Redemption The news, initially reported by The Block, highlights that the SEC is specifically asking for public comments on whether its rules should be changed to accommodate this in-kind mechanism for the WisdomTree Bitcoin ETF . This is a significant step because, despite approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC mandated the cash creation/redemption model for all approved funds. The SEC’s cautious approach has historically stemmed from concerns about market manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin market, custody of digital assets, and investor protection. The cash model was seen by some as simpler to oversee and potentially mitigating certain risks associated with directly handling Bitcoin during the creation/redemption process. However, the in-kind model has proponents who argue it offers distinct advantages, particularly regarding market impact and potential tax efficiency. The SEC’s request for feedback suggests they are now willing to revisit this aspect, possibly influenced by the successful launch and operation of the cash-based ETFs, or perhaps prompted by renewed arguments from filers like WisdomTree. The Potential Benefits of In-Kind for Bitcoin ETFs Permitting in-kind redemption is the core focus of the SEC’s inquiry and a key point of discussion among market participants. Here’s why it’s considered potentially beneficial: Reduced Selling Pressure: This is perhaps the most frequently cited benefit. In the cash model, when investors redeem ETF shares, the fund issuer must sell Bitcoin on the open market to get the cash needed to pay the Authorized Participant. This selling can contribute to downward pressure on the Bitcoin price, especially during periods of heavy redemptions. With the in-kind model, the fund issuer simply gives Bitcoin directly to the AP. The AP receives Bitcoin, not cash from a sale, thus bypassing the need for the issuer to sell into the market. This could lead to smoother ETF operations with less direct impact on the spot price of Bitcoin. Potential Tax Efficiency: For the ETF fund itself, in-kind redemptions can be more tax-efficient. In the cash model, selling Bitcoin to meet redemptions can trigger capital gains taxes for the fund, which are then passed on to shareholders. In the in-kind model, transferring the asset (Bitcoin) to the AP is generally not considered a taxable event for the fund. This could potentially lead to better after-tax returns for long-term ETF holders. ( Note: Individual investor tax implications upon selling ETF shares remain the same, but the fund’s internal tax efficiency improves. ) Alignment with Traditional Asset ETFs: The in-kind model is standard for many ETFs holding physical commodities or large baskets of securities. Adopting it for Bitcoin ETFs would bring them more in line with these traditional structures, which some argue is a sign of market maturation and regulatory comfort. Potential for Tighter Tracking: Some argue that the direct exchange of asset for shares in the in-kind model can lead to slightly tighter tracking of the underlying asset’s price compared to the cash model, although the difference is often minimal in practice for highly liquid assets. Challenges and Regulatory Considerations While the benefits are compelling, the SEC’s request for feedback also implicitly acknowledges potential challenges that need careful consideration: Operational Complexity: Handling physical Bitcoin (or rather, managing private keys and secure transfers on the blockchain) is operationally more complex than simply moving cash. Fund issuers and APs would need robust infrastructure, security protocols, and custody solutions to manage these transfers safely and efficiently. Custody Requirements: The secure custody of the underlying Bitcoin is paramount. While current cash ETFs already rely on custodians, an in-kind model requires the custodian to facilitate direct transfers to and from APs, adding layers of operational and security considerations. Regulatory Hurdles: The SEC’s initial preference for cash wasn’t arbitrary. They had concerns about the potential for manipulation or difficulties in overseeing direct Bitcoin transfers in the creation/redemption process. The feedback request aims to understand if these concerns can be adequately addressed by proponents of the in-kind model. Impact on Market Makers: Authorized Participants play a critical role. Switching to in-kind would change their operational workflows and risk management strategies. The SEC will want to understand how this impacts market liquidity and stability from the AP perspective. The Role of Crypto Regulation This specific feedback request is a microcosm of the broader landscape of crypto regulation in the United States. The SEC is navigating the integration of a novel asset class (Bitcoin) into traditional financial structures (ETFs). Each decision, like the choice between cash and in-kind mechanisms, reflects the regulator’s ongoing effort to balance fostering innovation with ensuring investor protection and market integrity. The fact that the SEC is even considering this change for the WisdomTree fund, after initially standardizing on cash for all issuers (BlackRock, Fidelity, etc.), suggests an evolving perspective or a willingness to refine the rules based on practical experience since the January 2024 launches. What Does This Mean for the Market and Investors? For the Bitcoin market, a shift towards in-kind redemptions across multiple ETFs (if approved) could potentially reduce a source of selling pressure during downturns, contributing to slightly more stable price action related to ETF flows. It might also be seen as another step towards institutional normalization of Bitcoin. For investors, while the direct impact on buying and selling ETF shares might be minimal, the potential for improved tax efficiency within the fund could lead to slightly better long-term returns. It also signals ongoing refinement in how these investment products operate. Actionable Insights What should investors and market participants do with this information? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the SEC’s public comment process and any subsequent announcements regarding WisdomTree’s application or potential rule changes. Understand Your ETF: If you hold a Bitcoin ETF, understand its current creation/redemption mechanism (currently cash for all U.S. spot ETFs) and how potential changes could affect it. Consider the Broader Regulatory Landscape: This development is part of the larger picture of how crypto is being integrated into traditional finance. Understanding these regulatory nuances is key to navigating the space. Conclusion: A Step Towards Maturation? The SEC’s request for feedback on allowing in-kind redemption for the WisdomTree Bitcoin ETF is more than just a technical tweak; it’s a signal that the regulatory conversation around Bitcoin ETFs is ongoing and potentially evolving. While the cash model served as an initial, perhaps more cautious, approach, exploring in-kind mechanisms reflects a deeper dive into the operational realities and potential benefits for both fund efficiency and market dynamics. Permitting in-kind creations and redemptions could streamline processes, potentially enhance tax outcomes for fund holders, and, crucially, reduce the instances where fund issuers need to sell Bitcoin on the open market during redemptions. This could be a subtle but important positive development for the stability of Bitcoin price action influenced by ETF flows. As the SEC gathers feedback, the industry will be watching closely to see if this leads to a rule change that could eventually apply to other Bitcoin ETFs, further shaping how this increasingly popular investment vehicle interacts with the underlying digital asset market. It’s another step in the complex, but fascinating, journey of integrating Bitcoin into mainstream finance under the watchful eye of crypto regulation .

2025-06-03T03:05:08,"Ripple News: John Deaton Says XRP ETFs Are Coming","The post Ripple News: John Deaton Says XRP ETFs Are Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News BitGo, a leading crypto custody and trading firm, has entered a strategic partnership with VivoPower. As part of this deal, VivoPower will use BitGo’s exclusive over-the-counter (OTC) trading services to purchase $100 million worth of XRP tokens. This move is part of VivoPower’s new treasury strategy, following its successful $121 million fundraising round . A Sign of Growing Interest in Altcoin Treasury Holdings This step by VivoPower marks one of the first major corporate treasury allocations into XRP — a move that mirrors what companies like MicroStrategy did with Bitcoin . By holding crypto assets as part of their corporate reserves, firms aim to diversify and potentially benefit from the growing digital asset market. John Deaton’s Take on the Bigger Picture Reacting to the news, Pro-XRP attorney and expert John Deaton connected this development to a broader trend. He recalled how, after the long-awaited approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs , he had predicted that ETFs for other altcoins like ETH, XRP, and SOL would eventually follow. After the Bitcoin Spot ETF was finally granted (more like demanded – after being forced to fight Gensler’s Bad Faith @SECGov , which was found to have acted “arbitrary and capricious” in denying one), I said that I had zero doubts about Alt-Coin ETFs eventually following – and not… https://t.co/nDp5lnpUNk — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 2, 2025 While some doubted him at the time, Deaton’s reasoning was based on a simple observation: once Bitcoin ETFs proved to be massively successful, even becoming some of the best-performing ETFs in history, Wall Street would naturally look to replicate that success with other digital assets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For June 3 , Companies Copying the Bitcoin Treasury Model Deaton also explained that what Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy did with Bitcoin — turning it into a corporate treasury asset — would eventually inspire other firms to do the same with select altcoins like XRP. VivoPower’s move seems to be the first public example of this trend taking shape. Greed Drives Innovation Deaton was clear that he isn’t endorsing or celebrating these actions, but rather showing how financial incentives and Wall Street’s appetite for profits often predict market shifts before regulations or public sentiment catch up. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-03T02:30:45,"Massive 7,000 Bitcoin Transfer from Bitfinex Sparks Intrigue","BitcoinWorld Massive 7,000 Bitcoin Transfer from Bitfinex Sparks Intrigue In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, large movements of digital assets often capture the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. A significant event recently unfolded, involving a substantial Bitcoin transfer that originated from a major exchange. Unpacking the Recent 7,000 Bitcoin Transfer Reports indicate that a colossal amount of Bitcoin, specifically 7,000 BTC, was recently transferred from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. This movement was promptly flagged by tracking services that monitor large blockchain transactions. At the time of the report, this significant transfer was valued at approximately $731 million, highlighting the immense value that can be moved on the Bitcoin network. Such large-scale movements are not everyday occurrences for individual investors, making them points of interest for those trying to gauge market sentiment or potential strategic plays by major holders. The Role of Whale Alert in Transparency How do we even know about such a massive Bitcoin transfer ? This is where services like Whale Alert come into play. Whale Alert is a well-known cryptocurrency transaction tracker that provides real-time updates on large movements of digital assets across various blockchains. By monitoring publicly available blockchain data, Whale Alert identifies transactions exceeding a certain threshold, often involving millions or even billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. Their reporting brings a degree of transparency to the otherwise pseudonymous world of blockchain transactions. While the identities behind the wallet addresses remain unknown unless linked to a specific entity (like a registered exchange), the fact that a large amount of value has moved is immediately visible. This allows market participants to react to or analyze these movements, speculating on their potential meaning. Key functions of Whale Alert and similar services include: Tracking large transactions across multiple cryptocurrencies. Identifying source and destination wallets (though not necessarily the owners). Reporting transaction value in fiat currency at the time of transfer. Alerting the community via social media and other platforms. Their work is crucial for market observers who want to understand the flow of capital within the crypto ecosystem. Who is the Crypto Whale Behind This Movement? The term “ crypto whale ” refers to an individual, entity, or group that holds a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Because of their large holdings, their trading activities or transfers can potentially influence market prices due to the sheer volume involved. In the context of Bitcoin, a crypto whale is typically someone holding thousands of BTC. The 7,000 BTC transferred from Bitfinex certainly qualifies as a whale-sized movement. However, identifying the exact “whale” is challenging because the destination is reported as an “unknown new wallet.” This could represent several possibilities: A large individual investor moving funds to personal cold storage. An institution (like a hedge fund or corporation) taking custody of purchased Bitcoin. An over-the-counter (OTC) desk facilitating a large private sale, with the buyer moving funds off-exchange. Bitfinex itself moving funds for internal purposes, such as replenishing cold storage reserves or managing balances. Without further information linked to the destination address, the identity of the whale remains a subject of speculation. The term “unknown new wallet” often suggests a wallet that hasn’t been previously tagged or associated with a known entity by blockchain analysis firms. Why Would Bitfinex Be Involved? The transfer originating from Bitfinex is a key detail. Bitfinex is one of the older and larger cryptocurrency exchanges in the market. Exchanges constantly handle large volumes of cryptocurrency, managing deposits, withdrawals, and internal transfers. There are several reasons why a large amount of Bitcoin might move *from* an exchange like Bitfinex: Customer Withdrawal: The most straightforward reason is a large customer withdrawing their Bitcoin from the exchange to their own wallet. This is common for whales or institutions who prefer to hold their assets in self-custody rather than on an exchange. Exchange Cold Storage Management: Exchanges typically hold a significant portion of their users’ funds in “cold storage” – offline wallets that are less susceptible to hacking. They periodically move funds between hot wallets (online, for daily operations) and cold wallets for security and management purposes. This transfer could be Bitfinex moving funds to a new or existing cold storage address. OTC Desk Activity: Many exchanges, including Bitfinex, operate OTC desks for large trades that might otherwise impact the public order book. If a large buyer acquired 7,000 BTC via Bitfinex’s OTC service, this transfer could represent the exchange delivering the purchased Bitcoin to the buyer’s specified wallet. Internal Balance Rebalancing: Exchanges might move funds between different internal wallets for operational efficiency, security partitioning, or consolidating smaller inputs. Understanding the likely reason often requires additional context or analysis of the wallet’s subsequent activity, which isn’t always immediately available. The Significance of a Large Crypto Transaction Every large crypto transaction , especially one involving a significant amount of Bitcoin like 7,000 BTC, is scrutinized for potential market signals. The significance lies in the potential impact these movements *could* have, although correlation is not always causation. Here’s why such transactions are watched: Potential Selling Pressure: If a large amount of Bitcoin moves *to* an exchange from an unknown wallet, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and exerting downward pressure on price. However, this specific transfer is *from* an exchange, which usually doesn’t indicate imminent selling on that exchange’s public market. Potential Buying Pressure (Indirect): If the transfer is a customer withdrawal after an OTC purchase, it indicates significant buying demand that has already been fulfilled off-exchange. This is often seen as a bullish signal, as a large buyer is accumulating and moving assets into secure storage. Increased Confidence/Adoption: Movements to cold storage can indicate a long-term holding strategy by large players, suggesting confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Institutional adoption often involves large purchases followed by transfers to secure custody solutions. Market Sentiment Indicator: The frequency and direction of large transfers can sometimes serve as a rough indicator of overall market sentiment among whales. It’s important to note that a single large transfer doesn’t dictate the market direction, but it adds a data point to the complex puzzle analysts try to solve. Analyzing the “Unknown New Wallet” Aspect The destination being an “unknown new wallet” is a crucial piece of information. If the destination were a known exchange wallet, it might suggest inter-exchange transfers or preparation for selling. The fact that it’s an unknown, presumably newly active wallet, leans towards the possibilities of cold storage or a new entrant taking custody. Consider the implications: Security Focus: Moving large amounts off-exchange into self-custody is generally viewed as a security-conscious move, reducing counterparty risk associated with keeping funds on an exchange. Long-Term Holding Intent: Wallets associated with long-term holding strategies (like cold storage) typically see large inflows and minimal outflows, especially not to exchanges. Future activity from this wallet would be key to confirming this. Potential New Player: It could represent a significant new institutional or high-net-worth individual entering the space or consolidating previous purchases. While the term “unknown” adds a layer of mystery, blockchain analysis firms are constantly working to de-anonymize addresses by linking them to known entities or activities over time. Challenges and Benefits of Tracking Whale Movements Tracking large crypto transactions offers valuable insights, but it’s not without its challenges. Benefits: Increases transparency in the market. Provides data points for market analysis and sentiment gauging. Helps identify potential large-scale buying or selling activity (when moving to/from exchanges). Highlights significant movements for security monitoring. Challenges: Wallet addresses are pseudonymous, not anonymous; ownership is not immediately clear. A single large transaction can have multiple interpretations (withdrawal, cold storage, OTC, internal transfer). Wallets can be consolidated or split, making it hard to track funds precisely over time. It’s difficult to distinguish between institutional, exchange internal, or large individual movements solely based on the address. Correlation does not equal causation; a transfer doesn’t guarantee a specific market outcome. Therefore, while tracking services like Whale Alert provide crucial raw data, interpreting that data requires careful consideration of context and other market factors. What Does This Mean for the Average Investor? For most individual cryptocurrency holders, a 7,000 BTC transfer might seem like a distant event involving players with vastly different capital. However, these movements are part of the larger market ecosystem that can eventually influence price and sentiment. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed, But Don’t Panic: Use reports like this as information, not necessarily a direct signal to buy or sell immediately. Large transfers are relatively common. Understand the Context: Try to understand the potential reasons behind the transfer (e.g., from vs. to an exchange, to a known vs. unknown wallet) rather than just reacting to the headline number. Consider Security: Large transfers to unknown wallets often highlight the practice of moving assets off exchanges for security. This might prompt you to review your own security practices, especially if you hold a significant amount of crypto on an exchange. Focus on Long-Term Trends: While whale movements are interesting, they are just one data point. Focus on broader market trends, fundamental analysis of assets, and your own investment strategy rather than making impulsive decisions based on single large transactions. Ultimately, while whale watching provides fascinating insights into the activities of major market participants, it should be part of a broader approach to understanding the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: Another Day, Another Whale Movement The transfer of 7,000 BTC from Bitfinex to an unknown new wallet, reported by Whale Alert, is a significant event in terms of the value moved ($731 million). While the exact purpose and owner of the destination wallet remain unconfirmed, such large movements from exchanges often indicate substantial withdrawals by major holders, possibly for cold storage or following an OTC trade. These transactions, tracked diligently by services like Whale Alert, offer a glimpse into the activities of crypto whales and contribute to the overall market narrative. While they don’t provide a crystal ball for price prediction, they serve as valuable data points highlighting the ongoing flow of capital and the increasing adoption and strategic positioning by large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

2025-06-03T02:30:05,"Analyst Suggests Altcoin Recovery May Follow Bitcoin’s Final Cycle Stage—Here’s Why","Bitcoin continues to showcase resilience in the current cryptocurrency market cycle, consistently setting new records while many altcoins remain below their previous peaks. Currently trading just above $104,000, Bitcoin has recently retraced from its all-time high above $111,000, set last month. Contrasting Bitcoin’s consistent growth, Ethereum and other prominent altcoins have yet to surpass historical highs that they reached several years ago, highlighting a notable divergence in market performance. This divergence has been a focal point among analysts, prompting a deeper examination of investor behavior and capital flows between Bitcoin and altcoins. Recent insights from CryptoQuant analyst Dan suggest that while Bitcoin remains dominant, the situation for altcoins might shift in the upcoming phase of the crypto market cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Bulls See $644M Bloodbath As Bitcoin Dips Below $105,000 Bitcoin Investor Behavior Suggests Potential Shift Ahead CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan recently explored the broader implications of this Bitcoin-dominated cycle in his market commentary. According to Dan’s analysis, previous market cycles typically saw a gradual reduction in mid-to-long-term Bitcoin holdings as investor capital redistributed into altcoins. This shift traditionally drove altcoins significantly higher, usually marking the late stages of a bullish cycle. However, this cycle exhibits a different pattern. Frequent minor corrections in Bitcoin’s price are followed by more significant and sharp downturns for altcoins, demonstrating persistent weakness. Crypto Dan notes that currently, very few altcoin investors have realized meaningful profits, an unusual circumstance compared to prior cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Says It’s Time For ‘Cautious Optimism’ — Further Upside Growth Incoming? Despite this ongoing difficulty for altcoin holders, the analyst maintains optimism, emphasizing that historical patterns suggest Bitcoin’s dominance typically declines towards the end of each cycle. If history repeats, altcoins might experience substantial upward movements as the cycle approaches its maturity. Thus, while altcoins currently underperform, investors are advised to maintain patience until Bitcoin’s momentum reaches its final bullish push, potentially signaling a turning point. Whale Activities Hint at Upcoming Altcoin Attention Complementing this perspective, another analyst from CryptoQuant, Maartunn, provided insights into stablecoin inflows to major exchanges. Specifically, Maartunn highlighted that over 75% of Tether (USDT) deposits to Binance, tracked via the TRC-20 network, originated from large wallets, commonly known as whales, since November 2023. Over 75% of USDT Inflows to Binance Are from Whales “The data shows a clear trend: whales prefer Binance. Since November 2023, approximately 75% of total USDT deposits to Binance have originated from whale addresses.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/KCBA8cVCdb — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 2, 2025 This substantial concentration of whale activity suggests that major market participants prefer Binance for significant capital movements involving stablecoins. The notable whale-driven inflows to Binance could indicate preparation for substantial market activity, including potential purchasing of Bitcoin or an eventual shift towards altcoins. Historically, stablecoin deposits from large holders precede increased volatility and trading activity, as whales position themselves strategically in anticipation of market shifts.
