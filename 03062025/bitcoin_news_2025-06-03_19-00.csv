Top officials at the Equitable Bank in Waterford, Wisconsin, say they are fed up with the increasing scams targeting seniors, reports TMJ4 News. Says Equitable Bank branch manager Dawn Jurgensen, “Fraud is just crazy now. Every day, these fraudsters are creating new ways to scam people.” The bank’s six branches across the state are receiving at least one fraud report per day targeting seniors or others. The bank’s officials are holding community events to educate residents about the fraud and ways to protect themselves. They are also working with the Wisconsin Bankers Association to urge state lawmakers to pass tougher anti-fraud regulations. Says Erin Arneson, the Equitable Bank’s vice president of retail banking, “We were able to tell them how important it is that they push through the legislation that will help us help our elderly customers.” Among the new regulations the bankers are asking for is the ability to slow down suspicious transactions, including when there are large cash withdrawals. Says Arneson, “We’re trying to protect them, and that’s really our message. We’re not doing it to be nosy or to be punitive in any way.

The Solana memecoin is now nipping at DogWifHat’s heels as traders bet on feline dominance in the $65 billion meme sector. With its market cap exploding past fallen giants like $PNUT, this cat-themed token proves memecoins still have nine lives. Investors are loving it and they are hungry for the next viral predator. Community-Driven or Hype-Fueled? Why Traders Are Betting Big on $POPCAT At press time, $POPCAT is trading around $0.412, bouncing from an intraday low of $0.3546 to a local high of $0.4268. Many observers credit the token’s meteoric rise to its limitless meme appeal, strong community backing, and popularity among leveraged traders who view it as the ultimate money-printing memecoin. According to DexScreener, $POPCAT now boasts over 142,000 holders and 53 liquidity providers, reflecting its substantial community on the Solana network. One trader recently shared his success from a long position on $POPCAT, securing over 720% in profits during the latest rally.

This rapid rise has earned listings on top-tier exchanges, including Bybit, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Gate.io.

The token just cleared an important technical marker—its 100-day moving average. This typically suggests growing strength. Currently, $0.52 and $0.53 represent the immediate challenges. One prominent analyst noted, “If it breaks out, we could see a rapid move toward $0.64, the recent local high.” $POPCAT daily chart. Price has reclaimed the 100d ema which is a very positive sign.

Market watchers are also paying close attention. The token’s ability to hold these gains could determine its next major move. While nothing is certain in crypto markets, the current technical picture appears favorable for $POPCAT holders. $POPCAT Bull Case Builds, But Support at $0.25 Must Hold to Avoid Trend Breakdown Following its rally from the early accumulation zone, $POPCAT consistently formed higher lows through March to early May, supported by an ascending trendline, an indicator of sustained buying interest. However, the price recently fell below that trendline, indicating a short-term loss of momentum. Even so, $POPCAT seems to be stabilizing, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounding from 40 and currently sitting at 47.33. Source: TradingView This indicates that selling pressure is subsiding, and bullish momentum could return if RSI breaks above 50. Looking ahead, if buyers reclaim control, the next major resistance sits at $0.5707. A successful breakout above that level could pave the way for a move toward $0.7692 and potentially a retest of $1.0074, a key level from late December 2024. Conversely, if support doesn’t hold, $POPCAT may revisit the $0.20–$0.25 range.

2025-06-03T16:43:16,"Live Coin Watch Trading Anomaly: Bitcoin Solaris Accumulation Pattern Mirrors Bitcoin’s 2010-2013 Smart Money Phase","Every crypto bull market has its silent build-up phase—the calm before the explosion—when “smart money” quietly accumulates. According to a recent Live Coin Watch anomaly, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) may be showing the exact same accumulation pattern seen in Bitcoin’s legendary 2010–2013 phase. For those who’ve dreamed of catching the next early Bitcoin, this may be the only real shot left. But what makes Bitcoin Solaris fundamentally different from today’s sea of altcoins? Let’s dig in. The Smart Money Phase: How Early Bitcoin Accumulation Looked Back in the early 2010s, Bitcoin was ignored by most and scooped up by a few. These investors weren’t driven by hype—they were motivated by the tech, the scarcity, and the belief that decentralized money could transform the world. That’s the exact kind of quiet build-up Bitcoin Solaris is now experiencing, and according to trading watchers, the accumulation is no longer subtle. Today’s altcoin market is flooded with trendy tokens that swing wildly, yet offer no real protection. With recent top losers like Dogwifhat, Injective, and PEPE plummeting between 10–17% in a single 24-hour cycle, it’s clear many tokens are fueled by speculation, not structure. Why Bitcoin Solaris Isn’t Like Other Altcoins Bitcoin Solaris was built to solve crypto’s long-standing flaws—not ride its hype. It’s not just about fast TPS or flashy features. It’s about a blockchain that was designed from the ground up to mirror Bitcoin’s value architecture but add next-gen scalability, accessibility, and earning potential. Here’s what sets it apart: Dual-layer architecture: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Contribution for security and decentralization. The Solaris Layer incorporates advanced mechanisms for speed and network coordination. 10,000+ TPS with 2-second finality: Matches top-tier throughput while ensuring stable processing. Mobile-first mining: Unlike complex Bitcoin rigs, BTC-S mining is accessible via the upcoming Solaris Nova App—bringing wealth-building potential to anyone with a phone. Hybrid consensus: Flexibly blends decentralization and scalability through a system designed for real-world growth. Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed Liquid Staking: Full Flexibility, Full Rewards One standout feature helping Bitcoin Solaris attract real accumulation is its liquid staking model. Users can stake their BTC-S and receive 1:1 sBTC-S tokens, which remain fully tradable and usable in DeFi ecosystems. Benefits of this system include: Rewards without restrictions: Earn staking income while still being able to use your funds. DeFi-ready sBTC-S: Compatible with liquidity pools, lending, and more. Efficiency: Integrated directly with the upcoming Solaris Nova App. Security and trust: Validator selection is automated, reducing technical barriers for users. Bitcoin Solaris’s Explosive Presale Growth While most altcoins stumble through market cycles, BTC-S has engineered one of the strongest presale growth runs seen in years. We’re now in Phase 6 , and momentum hasn’t slowed. Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% With just around 8 weeks remaining until the July 31 launch, the numbers say it all—over $1.8 million raised and 11,000+ unique users joined. Industry veterans are calling it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. Referral System: A Network Built by the Community Another catalyst fueling this smart money movement? Bitcoin Solaris’s double rewards referral program . Referrers earn 5% in BTC-S tokens for every referral purchase. Referred users receive a 5% bonus on their token allocation. This model promotes genuine community growth, not hollow marketing pushes—precisely the kind of momentum that sustains long-term adoption. Influencer Buzz and Market Validation Interest is soaring, and it’s not just investors paying attention. A deep dive by influencer Crypto Dex World sheds light on how Bitcoin Solaris is different. The review praises its performance structure, mobile-first mining model, and dual-consensus design—reasons why it’s being discussed alongside legacy projects. And with a fully KYC-verified team and double-audited smart contracts , trust in the project is rising as fast as its user base. Conclusion: The Only Legitimate ‘Buy Bitcoin in 2010’ Opportunity? The market is telling a clear story. While others ride volatility or fall victim to meme token fads, Bitcoin Solaris is quietly being accumulated by those who recognize what it represents—scarcity, utility, and the infrastructure to scale. Whether it’s the mobile mining revolution, the next-gen staking flexibility, or its unmatched security model, BTC-S is ticking the boxes that made early Bitcoin a generational wealth opportunity.

2025-06-03T16:33:44,"How Bitcoin Is Becoming A Cornerstone Of American Economic Policy","Summary Bitcoin has become a mainstream economic priority, now embraced by U.S. government leaders and major financial institutions. The BITCOIN Act of 2025 proposes a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, aiming to acquire 1 million bitcoins over five years. America leads globally in Bitcoin ownership, corporate holdings, ETFs, and national reserves, reflecting a deliberate national strategy. Bitcoin represents the next chapter in American innovation, offering economic independence, scarcity, and growth potential in the digital age. “We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy and are here to stay.” That was the message Vice President JD Vance delivered to a packed audience at last week’s Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas. It’s a message that has clearly taken root. What began as a movement of early adopters—many of them twentysomethings dressed in hoodies—has matured into a full-blown national economic priority, embraced by leaders at the highest levels of government and finance. Last summer, if you recall, then-candidate Donald Trump made headlines as the first former U.S. president to speak at a Bitcoin conference. He pledged to lower the regulatory hurdles of the Biden administration, to kill Operation Choke Point 2.0, and to position the U.S. as the global leader in Bitcoin. Less than a year later, and a little over 100 days into Trump’s second administration, that vision is rapidly becoming reality. A Strategic Reserve for the Digital Age The Las Vegas conference was the largest in Bitcoin’s history, with over 35,000 attendees. The speaker list read like a who’s who of power players: sitting senators and representatives, big-name executives, and the president’s own sons. It was more than a convention for crypto enthusiasts. It was a policy summit. One of the most salient points of discussion was the BITCOIN Act of 2025. The proposed legislation calls for the U.S. government to acquire 1 million bitcoins over a five-year period and hold them in custody. The goal is to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, modeled after the existing reserves for petroleum and gold. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis pointed out that holding even 4 million Bitcoins over a 20-year period could theoretically draw down the national debt, which currently stands at just under $37 trillion. U.S. Global Investors This isn’t the sort of talk you’d expect to hear about an asset that, just a few years ago, was derided by many as a vehicle for crime and terrorism. How times have changed! Today, some 50 million Americans own Bitcoin, compared with just under 37 million who own gold, according to new research by Bitcoin financial firm River. For the first time in history, Bitcoin has overtaken its analog cousin in retail ownership in the U.S. U.S. Global Investors The U.S. Leads the World in Every Bitcoin Metric That Matters Indeed, the U.S. dominates in every measurable category of Bitcoin leadership, according to River’s research. Approximately 40% of the world’s mined Bitcoin is held by Americans. Publicly traded U.S. companies account for almost 95% of global corporate Bitcoin holdings. America also holds the majority of Bitcoin in ETFs, venture funding, and national stockpiles. As of today, the U.S. government owns more than twice the global market share of Bitcoin as it does of gold. I don’t believe any of this happened by accident. It happened because our country’s entrepreneurs, technology experts, futurists, and policymakers saw an opportunity and ran with it. U.S. Global Investors Gold Preserves Wealth, Bitcoin Builds It None of this is to say that gold is going away anytime soon. As I told a roomful of YPO attendees last week, I still believe deeply in gold as a store of value. Unlike Bitcoin, the yellow metal is a tangible asset, used in jewelry, electronics, and much more. Countless households have relied upon gold for centuries. When families fled Vietnam and, more recently, Syria, many did so thanks to the universal acceptance of precious metal, which also later helped them rebuild their lives. Gold preserves wealth in times of fear. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is about growth. It’s about creating wealth, not just preserving it. Bitcoin is programmable. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and it doesn’t recognize borders or gatekeepers. It’s scarce in a way that few assets are. This is why companies, ETFs, and whole governments are looking to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. As Eric Trump told the audience, everyone wants to add Bitcoin right now; no one wants to sell. That’s true in every corner of the earth, from the Americas to Africa, from the Middle East to Asia. I believe the logic is simple. As the world goes digital and decentralizes, Bitcoin offers a new form of reserve asset that combines scarcity with transparency and portability. It’s a hedge against economic uncertainty and bad policymaking. Bitcoin Marks the Next Chapter in American Innovation Next year is the United States’ 250th anniversary, and I can think of no better symbol of economic independence than Bitcoin. It represents the very values Americans hold dear: individual responsibility, innovation, and freedom from centralized control. Fiat currencies can be printed without limit, but Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. It requires work and energy to produce. Several speakers at the Vegas conference likened Bitcoin to the early days of the internet. You probably remember the dial-up modems and clunky browsers. A lot of people back then dismissed the internet as a novelty. In 1998, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman famously (and hilariously) wrote that the internet was a disappointment and would eventually prove itself to be as economically impactful as the fax machine. As we all know, the internet is the backbone of today’s global economy. The same arc of adoption is playing out in real time with Bitcoin. I agree wholeheartedly with VP Vance: Bitcoin isn’t going away, and it’s only going to grow stronger with America leading the charge.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4792030-how-bitcoin-is-becoming-a-cornerstone-of-american-economic-policy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|RESEARCH","BTC-USD",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T16:32:36,"Standard Chartered's Bill Winters criticizes UK’s regulatory chokehold on banks","Bill Winters, chief executive of Standard Chartered, said this week that banks have been left behind by private credit firms, and the gap won’t be closing anytime soon. He made the comments during a Bloomberg Television interview aired on Tuesday, marking his tenth year leading the London-based lender. “That’s just the reality,” Bill said. “I don’t think it’s going to change anytime soon. The result of which is banks are disadvantaged lenders.” According to Bloomberg, he blamed higher capital requirements that were enforced after the 2008 financial meltdown for tilting the field in favor of private credit. Bill explained that while traditional banks stepped back from riskier lending, private credit firms stepped in fast. The total size of that industry has now ballooned to $1.7 trillion, and firms like Apollo Global Management are convinced this is just the beginning. He didn’t attack the post-crisis Basel reforms directly but pointed fingers at UK regulators, especially the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), for making it worse. “We’ve got really huge numbers of individuals in the UK — the PRA and FCA — who are focusing on our business,” he said. “One, they’re too intrusive, it’s too costly. Two, I don’t think you actually get a good return on that.” Bill criticizes UK’s regulatory chokehold on banks Bill, who used to work at JPMorgan Chase, said the current regulatory culture has left bank executives relying too heavily on what their supervisors approve. “If our supervisors don’t stop us, we assume it must be OK,” he said. “Of course, we don’t make that consciously, but deep down, I think there’s a risk we get there.” That mindset, Bill warned, is dangerous and can lead to poor decisions, especially when pressure from regulators blocks innovation and slows reaction time. He also weighed in on the growing complaints from other major banks like HSBC and Lloyds. They’ve been speaking out against the UK ring-fencing rules, which require banks to separate consumer banking from riskier investment activity. Bill helped design those rules years ago, but now he thinks they need to be updated. “There is a debate now about whether the ring-fenced entity should be allowed to be bigger or to take more deposits before you have to ring-fence,” he said. “I think those kinds of refinements make perfect sense.” While Bill was tackling the challenges that banks face in the regulated world, his company has been strongly advocating for crypto, and Bitcoin the most. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered, said his original Bitcoin forecast was too conservative. In an email to clients sent in May, Geoffrey admitted , “I apologise that my USD120k Q2 target may be too low.” He originally made the call in April, predicting that Bitcoin would hit $120,000 in the second quarter of 2025, driven by whale accumulation and investors moving money away from US assets. Geoffrey expects Bitcoin to keep rising through the summer, with a year-end target of $200,000. “We expect these supportive factors to push BTC to a new all-time high of around USD 120,000 in Q2,” he said. “We see gains continuing through the summer, taking BTC-USD towards our year-end forecast of 200,000. “The dominant story for Bitcoin has changed again,” Geoffrey wrote. “It was a correlation to risk assets… It then became a way to position for strategic asset reallocation out of US assets.” And now? “It is now all about flows. And flows are coming in many forms.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-06-03T16:26:08,"Bitcoin (BTC) Warning from Standard Chartered! ""$90K is Very Critical!""","As Bitcoin (BTC) adoption has been steadily increasing, led by major institutional bull MicroStrategy (Strategy), an increasing number of companies have started holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets in recent months. While this situation reveals increasing demand for BTC, Standard Chartered warned against this situation. If market conditions for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies deteriorate, price volatility will increase, which could trigger a wave of forced liquidations, Standard Chartered warned in a note today. Standard Chartered digital assets analyst Geoff Kendrick noted that a “pain level of 22% below the average purchase price is a potential liquidation level” for companies holding Bitcoin. The bank listed 61 companies that hold Bitcoin treasuries. Stating that there are some that have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies but hold Bitcoin for balance sheet diversification, the bank stated that these companies have a total of 673,897 BTC, or 3.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. Kendrick noted that half of these firms purchased their BTC at an average price of over $90,000, potentially putting them at risk of liquidation if Bitcoin falls below $90,000. Citing Core Scientific, which collapsed in 2022, as an example for this situation, the analyst said the following. “These companies could become forced sellers if the Bitcoin price drops 22% below their average purchase price. At this point, $90,000 remains a critical level for these companies. Because it would only take the price of Bitcoin to fall back below $90,000 for half of the companies that bought Bitcoin to suffer losses. MicroStrategy, which leads the institutional Bitcoin strategy, holds the majority (86%) of BTC reserves and has a much lower average purchase price of around $70,000. However, Kendrick, who noted that new institutional participants are at greater risk, said: “In the last two months, there has been an increase in companies buying Bitcoin and the average purchase price is higher than MSTR. This means there is more risk.” Standard Chartered analyst Kendrick said the real question is how much pain companies can take before they have to sell their Bitcoin holdings. *This is not investment advice.

The Group revealed that the acquisition value of its total BTC reserves was approximately $150.7 million. The firm clarified that its total BTC reserve value was based on the average price of $102,473 per BTC. The Group stated that acquiring the additional BTC reinforced its Bitcoin accumulation approach. The company also said it will continue to support the operational activities of its subsidiaries. The Blockchain Group issues a new bond The Blockchain Group recently announced the issuance of a new bond worth $72 million. The company said the proceeds from the new bond will be used to acquire additional BTC. The Bitcoin Treasury firm explained that the bond issuance would be executed through its Luxembourg business unit. The firm added that the bond will be redeemable for company shares at the cost of $4.35 per share. The Group revealed that the initial realized amount of the reserved bond was $5.99 million. The company also reiterated that the bonds have a maturity period of five years. The Blockchain Group said the bonds may be convertible into ordinary company shares, clarifying that the conversion would rely on market performance. The firm clarified that it would consider converting the bonds into ordinary shares if the price of its shares hit $5.64. The Group explained that it had set the conditions for converting the bond into shares to avoid the key risk associated with declining share prices. The company also added the unknown risk for BTC as another reason it had set the condition. Blockchain Group revealed the realization of $66.36 million of a convertible bond. The firm added that this portion of the reserved convertible bond could be converted into ordinary shares at the cost of $0.80 per share. The Group also revealed it had converted Adam Back’s holdings at the price of $0.62 per share.

2025-06-03T16:20:14,"Binance Dominates Crypto Liquidity with Largest Stablecoin Reserves: CryptoQuant","The latest CryptoQuant data shows Binance holding the largest stash of stablecoins among major exchanges, giving it an edge in overall liquidity. Binance holds 59% of all stablecoin reserves, with $31B in USDT and USDC. It leads 2025 inflows with $180B and sees the highest average BTC deposits. pic.twitter.com/p0ipDA97tN — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 3, 2025 Binance’s wallets hold roughly $31 billion in USDT and USDC—more than any other centralized exchange. That stash makes up about 59% of all stablecoin reserves industry-wide, showing how much trading liquidity is parked on the platform. Traders use stablecoins much like ready cash, making them a vital part of an exchange’s liquidity, so Binance’s large share demonstrates how effectively it draws in capital that’s primed to trade. In May alone, Binance received $31 billion in USDT and USDC deposits, narrowly edging out Coinbase, which reported $30 billion in the same period. For the year so far, Binance has attracted $180 billion in cumulative stablecoin inflows, compared to Coinbase’s $195 billion, demonstrating the consistent magnetism of both platforms for institutional and retail capital. Transparency as a Strategic Advantage In total exchange reserves, Coinbase ranks first with $129 billion, followed by Binance with $110 billion. Combined, they account for 60% of total reserves across the top 20 centralized exchanges, with holdings spread across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major stablecoins, reports CryptoQuant. While both exchanges dominate in scale, they diverge in transparency. Binance sets itself apart by publishing comprehensive Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) reports, including wallet addresses that verify its on-chain holdings. This level of transparency enhances Binance’s credibility among crypto-native users who prioritize decentralization and verifiability. In contrast, Coinbase does not provide public PoR reports, instead relying on traditional financial disclosures to build institutional trust, reflecting a more regulated approach to exchange operations. Binance Attracts Larger Bitcoin Players Beyond stablecoins, Binance continues to demonstrate its appeal to large market participants through Bitcoin inflows. On May 22, when Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $112,000, the average Bitcoin deposit to Binance spiked to 7 BTC, the highest among all exchanges. For comparison, Bitfinex saw an average of 5 BTC, while OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase recorded lower figures—1.23, 0.7, and 0.8 BTC, respectively. These numbers suggest Binance is the preferred venue for whales and high-volume traders. The broader capital inflow trends for 2025 further reinforce the leadership of Binance and Coinbase. Binance has drawn $335 billion in cumulative USD inflows this year, slightly behind Coinbase’s $344 billion. These volumes are not only evidence of user trust but also serve as indicators of liquidity depth, platform stability, and the perceived security of each exchange, says CryptoQuant. In sum, Binance’s dominant position in stablecoin reserves, coupled with its public Proof-of-Reserves and appeal to large Bitcoin holders, positions it as a cornerstone of global crypto liquidity. While Coinbase maintains a lead in overall reserves and capital inflows, Binance’s transparency and consistent performance in attracting capital inflows suggest it remains a formidable leader in the competitive exchange sector.

According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, Tether has transferred 10,500 BTC, valued at approximately $1.1 billion, to an address linked to Japanese investment giant SoftBank as part of its upcoming investment into Twenty One Capital. Paolo Ardoino 🤖 @paoloardoino · Follow Tether Group is moving 10500 BTC to address bc1qpzt4m58zzqgp84ktyuj5tz8g8k8ssg2g2d5eeerwhx4gxulqq5mqjzm5gc as part of the pre-funding of SoftBank’s investment in Twenty One Capital (XXI) mempool.space/address/bc1qpz… 12:35 PM · Jun 3, 2025 756 Reply Copy link Read 49 replies Simultaneously, a separate transfer of 917 BTC , valued at around $96 million, was also made to an address associated with convertible equity investors in Twenty One Capital. Ardoino noted that this allocation was made to support investor options in the venture. Earlier, on June 2, Tether and its affiliates executed a combined transfer of 25,812 BTC, amounting to approximately $2.7 billion. That round included 14,000 BTC from Tether, 7,000 BTC from Bitfinex, and a 4,812 BTC portion designated for an equity raise. Together with the latest transactions, Twenty One Capital now holds over 42,000 BTC, making it the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, behind Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and MARA Holdings. The latest disclosure builds on an earlier investment made on May 9, when Tether acquired 4,812 BTC at an average price of $95,319 per token. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, those coins were transferred to an escrow wallet, lifting Twenty One Capital’s treasury to 36,312 BTC at the time. What is Twenty One Capital? Tether, along with Bitfinex and SoftBank, co-founded Twenty One Capital in April 2025, establishing it as a Bitcoin-first institutional platform designed to facilitate capital market services natively on Bitcoin, including custody, lending, and asset issuance. Twenty One Capital plans to build native infrastructure for custody, lending, and capital markets directly on Bitcoin, thereby acting as a foundational layer for institutional BTC adoption. Strike CEO Jack Mallers is leading the venture as it plans to go public via a SPAC merger with Cantor Fitzgerald’s Cantor Equity Partners. Under the terms of the business combination agreement, Tether agreed to contribute Bitcoin equivalent to proceeds from a PIPE investment, to be sold to Twenty One Capital at the time of the merger’s close. The new entity will list on Nasdaq under the ticker “XXI” and debut with more than 42,000 BTC in its treasury. As part of its commitment, Tether will add 23,950 BTC, while SoftBank and Bitfinex will contribute 10,500 BTC and 7,000 BTC, respectively. All allocations will be converted into shares priced at $10 each. Cantor Fitzgerald is also advising on the deal and securing additional capital. According to Mallers, upon launch, Twenty One Capital will become an investment vehicle “built by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners,” aiming to become the most successful company in Bitcoin. Contrary to the traditional approach, the firm will focus on “Bitcoin per share” as a core performance metric, shifting away from conventional measures such as earnings or revenue growth. Instead, its success will be gauged by how much Bitcoin it holds relative to its outstanding shares.

2025-06-03T15:54:07,"BlackRock Dumps $561 Million in Bitcoin to Buy Ethereum","The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is again making headlines in the crypto space, and this time for selling Bitcoin to buy Ethereum. Over the past few days, on-chain data has shown BlackRock gradually liquidating portions of its Bitcoin holdings via the Coinbase Prime institutional platform. The trend of BlackRock’s BTC sales picked up on June 2 at 10:56 UTC, when it moved 300 BTC worth $31.3 million to Coinbase. For context, prior to this transaction, the last outflow to Coinbase was three weeks ago.BlackRock went on to offload a total of 5,362 BTC through a series of transactions: multiple 300 BTC batches, one transaction of 212 BTC, and another of 49 BTC. Altogether, the prominent asset manager dumped Bitcoin worth $561 million.Interestingly, while offloading BTC on Coinbase, BlackRock was simultaneously acquiring Ethereum. During this period, the firm withdrew 27,241 ETH from Coinbase, valued at $69.25 million. Snapshot of BlackRock Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions Why Is BlackRock Selling Bitcoin?Notably, the amount of Bitcoin BlackRock sold aligns almost perfectly with the outflow figures recorded by its iShares Bitcoin Trust over the past two days. On Monday, BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF posted a $130.4 million outflow. On Friday, May 30, it recorded a $430.8 million outflow, bringing the two-day total to $561 million.During this same period, the overall U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF market experienced consecutive daily outflows starting last Thursday, totaling a $1.23 billion net drain.These negative trends followed ten consecutive days of positive flows into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs. The shift coincided with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of approximately $112,000 in May before undergoing a retracement.Amid this retrace, investors grew cautious and began offloading their positions, as evidenced by outflows from BlackRock and other ETF managers. Notably, BTC’s price dipped to around $103,000 before rebounding slightly to $106,600 at press time, up 2.5% over the past 24 hours.Despite BlackRock liquidating over half a billion dollars' worth of Bitcoin in two days, its total Bitcoin spot ETF flows since inception remain strong at $48.439 billion. Meanwhile, its entire BTC holdings stand at 661,142 tokens, worth approximately $70 billion.Ethereum ETFs Remain PositiveWhile the Bitcoin spot ETF market has recently seen heavy outflows, Ethereum ETFs have shown a different trend. Ethereum spot ETFs have now maintained 11 consecutive days of positive inflows, led entirely by BlackRock.Yesterday, total Ethereum ETF inflows stood at $78.2 million, with BlackRock contributing $48.4 million and Fidelity adding $29.8 million. All other Ethereum issuers reported zero flows. Historically, inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs have largely come from BlackRock and Fidelity, with occasional contributions from Bitwise and Grayscale.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/03/blackrock-dumps-561-million-in-bitcoin-to-buy-ethereum/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackrock-dumps-561-million-in-bitcoin-to-buy-ethereum,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET","Market|Trending Now|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T15:51:09,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Subdued As Risk-Off Sentiment Takes Hold","Bitcoin (BTC) registered a marginal decline during the ongoing session as it remained pinned under the 20-day SMA. The flagship cryptocurrency has started the new month shrouded in uncertainty, with market watchers unsure where the market will head. BTC had plunged to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and move to its current level of $105,980. Strategy To Raise $250M To Buy More Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s Strategy plans to raise $250 million through an initial public offering of a new class of perpetual preferred stock to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. The company will issue 2.5 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock at $100 per share. Proceeds from the raise will be used to fund future Bitcoin purchases and provide working capital. Perpetual preferred stocks pay fixed dividends indefinitely with no maturity date and typically get priority over common stock in payouts. Strategy released a statement announcing its decision, “Strategy (Nasdaq: MSTR; STRK; STRF) today announced that subject to market and other conditions, it intends to conduct an initial public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), of 2,500,000 shares of Strategy’s 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD). Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital.” The offering gives Strategy a new avenue to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. The company primarily funded Bitcoin acquisitions through common stock and convertible note offerings. Strategy has become the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 580,955 BTC worth over $67.7 billion. The $250 million from its latest offering will allow the firm to purchase 2,351.8 BTC at current prices. 21Shares Announces Share Split For Spot Bitcoin ETF 21Shares has announced a 3-for-1 share split for its flagship ARK 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB. The move aims to make the fund more accessible to retail investors and will take effect at market opening on June 16. The split will triple the number of shares available and reduce the price per share without impacting the fund’s value. ARKB will continue to trade under its current sticker. “21Shares US LLC (21Shares), an affiliate of 21Shares AG, one of the world’s largest issuers of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today announced a 3-for-1 share split for its flagship fund ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). This move is designed to make shares more accessible to a broader base of investors and enhance trading efficiency. The share split is expected to be effective at market open on June 16, 2025.” The fund is a physically backed spot Bitcoin ETF tracking the New York Variant of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CF Bitcoin Reference Data, providing investors with direct access to Bitcoin in a regulated investment environment. Matador Technologies Listed On The Frankfurt Stock Exchange Bitcoin-focused Matador Technologies has announced it will begin trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The listing adds a key European listing to its existing US and Canadian markets. The listing aligns with Matador’s goal of offering round-the-clock trading access to its shares, modeled on Bitcoin’s 24/7 trading schedule. Matador Technologies CEO Deven Soni stated, “This listing completes a key part of our global capital markets strategy. It enables European investors to participate more easily in our growth story.” Matador has branded itself as a Bitcoin ecosystem company focusing on building a Bitcoin-backed treasury and fintech platform. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally up during the ongoing session as it struggles to cross the 20-day SMA. The flagship cryptocurrency faces rejection around the $105,000 level, with subdued price action indicating risk-off sentiment. Markets are jittery thanks to renewed trade tensions between the US and China, geopolitical tensions, and continuous outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Risk-on sentiment took a beating as tensions escalated in the Middle East after Israeli soldiers opened fire on people who strayed from a designated route to a food distribution site. Apart from escalating tensions in the Middle East, the Russia-Ukraine war has also seen an increase in hostilities. Institutional demand has also weakened, with data from SoSoValue highlighting outflows of $267 million from spot Bitcoin ETFs on Monday. While the outflows are relatively lower compared to February, an increase could lead to a substantial decline in BTC’s price. Despite trading in positive territory, markets remain cautious, expecting more geopolitical volatility. According to the Kobeissi Letter, markets are pricing out the Ukraine-Russia peace deal, stating, “This is effectively the market pricing out the Russia-Ukraine peace deal that President Trump has been working on for 3+ months. However, we have yet to receive a single comment from the US or President Trump. Clearly, something is going on behind the scenes. How will the US respond?” BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday (May 23), falling nearly 4% to $107,356. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,103. The price continued to push higher on Monday, registering a marginal increase, but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.03% to $107,834. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Price action remained bearish on Friday as BTC fell 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. BTC fell to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure returned. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903. The current session sees BTC up almost 1%, trading around $106,743, as buyers look to build momentum and push towards $110,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Here Are the Details","On June 2, 2025, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a net outflow of $268 million. This development was recorded as the third consecutive day of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Continue Three-Day Streak of Highs, Ethereum ETFs Continue 11-Day Streak of Highs On the other hand, the picture is moving in the opposite direction for Ethereum spot ETFs. Ethereum ETFs, which recorded a net inflow of $78.17 million on the same day, recorded an inflow for the 11th day in a row. This shows that investors' interest in Ethereum continues and that it has caught a different momentum than Bitcoin. In the crypto market, ETFs play an important role in the buying and selling preferences of institutional investors, especially after receiving approval in the US. While outflows on the Bitcoin side are interpreted as a sign of profit taking or market uncertainty, uninterrupted inflows on the Ethereum side are associated with confidence in the network’s upgrades and potential use cases. This divergence between the two major cryptocurrencies in terms of investor interest could lead to further strategic repositioning in the coming days. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T15:38:22,"TRX Monthly Transfers Hit $121B — Can TRON Finally Enter the Top 10?","TRON (TRX) is gaining serious momentum, with its blockchain processing an impressive $121 billion in monthly transfers — a milestone that places it among the most active networks in the crypto space. This surge in transaction volume is reigniting speculation about TRON’s ability to break into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. As investors increasingly seek out high-utility, high-volume chains beyond Ethereum and Bitcoin, TRON is emerging as a top contender. In this article, we explore TRON's technical setup and its path to potentially joining the crypto elite, while also highlighting how its growing ecosystem might power its next big leap. TRON Price Stable with Potential for Growth Beyond Current Range Source: tradingview TRON (TRX) stands between $0.26 and $0.28, showing a stable path. The bulls are holding ground as the price sticks close to the 10-day and 100-day average of $0.27. The Relative Strength Index at nearly 58 points to moderate buying interest. Price could bounce past its nearest resistance at $0.29 and potentially reach $0.30. This would be an increase of almost 7% from the lower end of its current range. The Stochastic indicator at about 79 suggests a possible upward movement, but the 1-week decrease hints at recent struggles. Overall, TRON shows promise if it can break through resistance. Conclusion TRON's $121 billion monthly transfer volume is more than just a headline — it signals deep and growing user activity, real-world usage, and expanding investor confidence. As the 2024 bull market continues to unfold, TRON is well-positioned to challenge more established players and secure its place among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin and Ethereum maintaining dominance, and networks like Binance Chain and Cardano advancing steadily, TRON’s sheer scale of on-chain transactions makes it a serious contender. If it can maintain this momentum and break key resistance levels, TRX might not just rise in price — it could rise in rank, entering a new era of recognition and growth.

2025-06-03T15:32:59,"Thomas Kralow mastered the art of adaptation and seizing opportunities in every circumstance. Today, he is developing EVEDEX","Having overcome the difficulties of a challenging childhood and a life-changing move to the United States, Thomas Kralow mastered the art of adaptation and seizing opportunities in every circumstance. Today, he is developing EVEDEX , a platform embodying his principles of financial freedom and security, and is also the founder of two funds and one of the largest educational projects in the world. How Thomas Kralow Carved His Path to the Top of the Industry The Beginning of the Journey How His Mother's Resilience and Life Challenges Shaped Thomas Kralow Thomas Kralow was born in Riga, Latvia, and has frequently emphasized in interviews that he grew up in a hard-working family. From his early childhood, his mother had envisioned him moving to the United States to pursue higher education, viewing it as a gateway to a better life. She saw education as the key to success, and Thomas consistently trusted her judgment, following her guidance. For his family, higher education held special significance, especially since, as Thomas recalls, his mother herself had to abandon her university studies due to family hardships. When Thomas was only two years old, his father, influenced by a new religious movement, gave away the family's entire business, cars, and house to the religious organization. Thomas recalls how this decision plunged him and his mother into severe hardship, marking a dramatic shift from comfort to poverty. ""My mother heated baby food using a candle,"" he remembered, describing this period as critical and challenging. Thomas always speaks proudly of his mother and admires her resilience. Growing up, he watched her rebuild their lives, simultaneously fulfilling both parental roles. In interviews, he consistently credits his mother for instilling core life principles in him, most notably a deep understanding of responsibility. Thomas is dedicated to ensuring his family always feels supported and cared for, vowing never to allow another woman in his life to endure similar struggles to what his mother faced. Moving to the USA Thomas explains that his mother, aware of the difficulties of living in Latvia, set a goal for herself: to secure a future for her son in the United States. She believed he would have far better opportunities there, especially if he earned a college degree. She insisted that Thomas apply to law school, convinced that a law degree is always in demand and guarantees a stable income. In Thomas’s view, his mother believed that success could be achieved only through a traditional system, simply because she didn’t know any other ways. For her, a stable profession and a university education seemed like reliable paths to a secure future, and she always tried to pass that belief on to her son. However, looking back now, Thomas admits that this degree never yielded the results he had hoped for and wasn’t a decisive factor in his success. First Earnings to Pay for College in the US One of the reasons Thomas started looking for part-time jobs in the US was the cost of his education. When he enrolled in college, his mother urged him to focus solely on his studies and not to worry about finances. But once he began, it turned out the tuition was far higher than expected, which pushed Thomas to seek additional income. Thomas’s first job was at the campus library, where he made about $600 per month. He recalls that this wasn’t much, and local regulations limited him to a maximum of four hours per shift. After a while, he realized the money wouldn’t cover all of his needs, so he started looking for other opportunities that would offer opportunities to earn a larger income. Thomas explains that to pinpoint new income streams, he used a deductive method, a strategy he still relies on today. The core idea was to analyze the world around him, identify what people needed, and see how his own abilities could meet those needs. He remembered his long-standing passion for cars, which led him to consider that market as a potential source of income. His first deal was selling an old Mazda Protege. This specific dark-green 2001 model was in poor shape: the body was rusty, and the exhaust emitted suspiciously colored smoke. Thomas bought it from a girl in a neighboring town for just $550, even though the market price for such a car was around $2,300–$2,700. Thomas says that fixing up the car cost him about $200. He replaced the head gasket himself, which he picked up for $30 at a local store, and used a spray can of paint to make the exterior look more presentable. To sell the car, Thomas got creative and only showed it to buyers in the evening so the covered-up rust wouldn’t be as noticeable. In the end, he made over $1,000 in profit on that single transaction. That was when he realized that in the US, people are often willing to take a financial loss just to get rid of unwanted items, and there’s profit potential in that. It was his first taste of the concept of margin and its possibilities. Next, Thomas switched to buying and reselling electronics, as well as restoring and selling discarded furniture. To make this work, he bought a yellow van that had once been used by plumbers for $1,500, which allowed him to transport and store items in a small warehouse. This new way of making money earned 18-year-old Thomas between $5,000 and $8,000 per month. Over time, his approach evolved into a system that he says still works to this day: many people are willing to part with items for next to nothing just to avoid the hassle of selling them. Thomas realized he could often find items like old dining sets in a dump and easily sell them for $100–$200. This income helped him to cover his educational expenses. Development in Trading Getting into Trading In his interviews, Thomas mentions that he first tried his hand at trading when he was around 15 or 16, but he soon gave it up because it seemed far too complicated and he had neither proper training nor support. Everything changed when, thanks to his mother, he happened to meet someone who became his mentor. A “Swiss German” named Alf, described by Thomas as “a professional in asset management, retail trading, and futures”. Thomas was astounded by how much Alf was earning, sums that seemed enormous compared to Thomas’s own income at the time, barely enough to afford a one-dollar burger. Alf invited Thomas to come to Switzerland and learn under his guidance. For Thomas, it was a major life decision: accepting this offer meant leaving his life in the US behind, taking a risk, and sacrificing friends, his future, and even his education. Despite all of the risks, he chose to go for it, and that marked the beginning of his journey. On the Importance of the Right Perception of the Industry Thomas often recalls that his mentor painted a picture of apparent simplicity: “Take it slowly, manage your risks, and everything will be fine.” On one hand, this idea gave him confidence, but later Thomas realized that such images create false expectations. He observes that many trading coaches on social media today perpetuate an illusion, portraying trading as easy and guaranteed to be profitable, requiring no special effort. For newcomers, this illusion of simplicity leads to unrealistic expectations and a lack of understanding of the complexities and risks. Thomas believes this activity is quite risky, especially if you’re trading with your savings and have family commitments, amongst others. “Statistically, you’re more likely to scale Mount Everest than to earn a steady income from trading”, Thomas says in one of his interviews, talking about how difficult it is to make money in this field. He suggests imagining reading a book about climbing Everest, but emphasizes that the author is the key factor: someone who simply gives advice, or someone who has actually done the climb themselves. Thomas stresses that this is the difference between mere information and genuine execution, and it explains why many trading courses fail to meet expectations: they offer knowledge (which isn’t always high-quality or current) but don’t provide the practical experience needed. When Thomas first began trading, he had $15,000 to start with. He recalls serious psychological hurdles because that was his entire savings. Still, he had a dream, to reach a million, and that goal drove him to overcome his fears and take risks where necessary. Thomas remembers that even a 10% profit on his $15,000 wasn’t enough to cover basic everyday needs such as bills, food, relationships, and living expenses. With earnings like that, he says, he would have been treading water, unable to move forward or work toward his bigger goal. Thomas explains that he always strictly controlled his risk, never exceeding 1–2% per trade. He stuck to simple rules, setting the risk-to-reward ratio at at least 2:1 or 3:1. Though he had other strategies, he avoided what he calls “foolish trades” carrying, say, 30% risk, because he believed that these types of trades were almost guaranteed to result in losses. These rules helped him to limit his losses but also curbed his profit potential. Thomas acknowledges that some traders get lucky: they manage to turn $15,000 into $200,000 in just two weeks, especially in crypto during a bull market if they happen to jump in at exactly the right time. In cases like that, he notes, fortune simply “smiles on them”. Thomas points out that these success stories create an unrealistic view of trading, overshadowing the reality that genuine success is defined by hard work and learning from mistakes. When he was just starting out, his budget constraints forced him to limit his risk even more carefully. In his first month, he took major losses (nearly $10,000) primarily because he was trading too often. To prevent similar mistakes, Thomas introduced a rule to stop trading after three consecutive losses and began meticulously recording every trade, analyzing not just entry and exit times, but 15 different factors including trends and market conditions. That’s how he noticed that if he was trading against a certain trend on a specific time frame, his odds of losing were much higher. In those scenarios, he stopped trading altogether, thereby reducing his risk. Thomas also discovered that most of his losses happened on Fridays. He explains this by pointing out that Friday felt like a Saturday to him, after working twelve hours a day consecutively. He also set a rule to stop trading if he had more than three stop-outs in one day, because trying to continue after multiple losses usually led to even bigger losses, on average, up to seven losing trades in a single day. Thomas emphasizes that understanding how the “heart of the market” works is crucial, as countless factors can instantly derail even the most carefully planned strategies. Market panic triggers sudden price swings, and, in his words, “you feel like an idiot trying to keep up with it all”. In Thomas’s opinion, rules, insight, and the right perception of trading are key to coping with the market’s ups and downs. That’s exactly what he taught his students at the “University of Trading” and continues to teach in his Game Changer program. Beyond the necessary technical knowledge, he focuses on the psychological side of trading, helping his students to build resilience and manage their emotions amid market uncertainty. Thomas notes that this is the main problem with most trading courses today: they typically focus on creating an illusion of guaranteed success without giving students practical skills or teaching them how to handle the psychological challenges of trading. Reflections The Importance of Social Media In numerous interviews, Thomas is often asked what he would do if he had to start from scratch. His response is that, with his current level of knowledge, he would focus on social media, because in his view, people and the trust they place in you are the most valuable asset in the world. He believes that building an audience and earning trust through social platforms is the best way to launch a business today. Thomas sees people as a resource more valuable than money (or even Bitcoin) because, unlike other assets, people don’t simply disappear. Trust, genuine value, and the energy created within a community are, in his opinion, extraordinarily powerful. Thomas is convinced that if you manage to gather even a thousand dedicated followers, you already have a significant asset. Moreover, if you approach social media growth mindfully and base audience interactions on trust, expanding that audience becomes more natural and less difficult. Thomas is certain that if he had 1.5 million followers on Instagram, he could easily launch almost any business, which, if managed properly, would be both successful and profitable. He emphasizes that his own audience growth was largely organic. While he did invest considerable funds in advertising, he claims it played a secondary role to organic growth. The key factor, according to him, was high-quality content and building trusting relationships with his audience. Thomas credits his wife with encouraging him to realize his potential. At the time they met, she was already working as a blogger. She suggested he start his own venture, perhaps a hedge fund, and manage external capital. She recognized his untapped potential as a social figure, pointing out that he could use a social platform to grow and promote the hedge fund. This conversation, he says, was a crucial turning point in his journey. Thomas recalls replying to his wife, “Where am I going to find clients? I don’t know anyone”, and initially continued trading exclusively with his own funds. In response, she encouraged him to develop his social media presence. Taking her advice to heart, Thomas began putting serious effort into his online platforms. Over time, his work paid off: by the time he launched his own hedge fund, many people already knew who he was and trusted him, making it much easier to attract a significant number of investors. He says people want to invest in other people, not in “some random companies”. The Importance of Choosing the Right Partner In many interviews, Thomas stresses that meeting his wife, Sofia, had a profound impact on his life and personal growth. Thanks to her, he discovered the motivation and inner strength to evolve. He openly admits that at the start of their relationship, he behaved harshly and sometimes unfairly, which he attributes to his past experiences in failed relationships. He says he acted “like a jerk”, but Sofia continued to stand by him despite everything. Thomas recalls how he felt her genuine emotions and unwavering support and acknowledges that “it was something incredibly rare and beautiful”, something he was ready to do anything to hold onto. He’s endlessly grateful to Sofia not only for her role in his personal life, but also for the contributions she made to his professional development. Thomas points out that when choosing a life partner, it’s important to pay attention to her inner qualities, how she makes you feel, and how you feel around her. He remembers how Sofia supported him through the toughest times, staying by his side through his highs, lows, and difficult emotional challenges. On Fiat Money and the Banking System Thomas believes that fiat currencies and the traditional banking system have no future. He notes that Bitcoin tends to rise during every crisis, which he attributes to the public’s distrust of what he calls an outdated financial system. People begin to value truly scarce assets, and in his opinion, Bitcoin is the only asset that qualifies as genuinely scarce. Thomas also believes the global economy is on the brink of a severe recession that could be extremely challenging, one of the reasons he avoids investing in stocks, calling it a bad idea. Thomas advises keeping a close eye on Bitcoin’s movements, noting that it follows global liquidity trends. For example, if the U.S. withdraws liquidity from the market, but Japan and China inject it, the market still sees an influx. He references China, where citizens saved roughly $2.4–$2.6 trillion during lockdowns and can now invest in cryptocurrency again via Hong Kong. In countries hit by inflation and crises, such as Argentina, where interest rates reach 97%, Bitcoin is trading at historic highs with a significant premium. Thomas is sharply critical of fiat currencies, pointing out that none of them are backed by real assets. He calls the U.S. dollar “the biggest scam”, deeming it ironic that people call Bitcoin a scam, given that Bitcoin derives real value from its scarcity. Thomas says he has invested significant amounts in Bitcoin and is aware of the risks: if the cryptocurrency were to lose its value, he would face substantial losses. While he keeps a small portion of his funds in dollars, the majority of his capital is held in non-fiat assets, as he has no faith whatsoever in fiat currencies. Thomas notes that the U.S. dollar is losing ground as major nations (among them BRICS members as well as Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are distancing themselves from the United States. Many countries are beginning to use alternative currencies, recognizing the risks involved in relying on the dollar. For example, Saudi Arabia did not renew its agreement with the U.S. to exclusively sell oil in dollars, indicating a move toward de-dollarization. Moreover, BRICS countries are actively discussing the creation of a unified financial system that could reduce their dependence on the dollar. Thomas is convinced that Bitcoin and blockchain technology will play a huge role in the future of global finance. He adds that Ethereum is bound to become a key part of this transformation as well. Life in Dubai When asked about the advantages of living in Dubai, Thomas explains that he wants to live in a country where his money is truly at his disposal, rather than under the tight control of the banking system. He points to Europe as an example: if you transfer or withdraw more than 10,000 euros, banks ask you to explain how you plan to use the funds. In his view, this indicates a lack of liquidity in the system, stemming from the fact that banks simply don’t have the money and want to avoid a sudden outflow of deposits. He also highlights how Dubai’s economic system differs in that it’s more difficult to get mortgages and refinancing there than in the United States, which he believes makes the system more resilient. Thomas points out that, as of 2021, U.S. banks are allowed to hold 0% reserves, a practice he criticizes for weakening the banking sector. He takes issue with fractional-reserve banking, where a bank takes a customer’s million dollars, “multiplies” it by ten, and issues loans, effectively turning one million into ten million without any real backing. Thomas compares this system to a “biblical-level deception”, arguing that the money in such banks essentially “doesn’t exist”, it’s an artificial financial construct based on partial reserves and lacking true value. Initially, he encountered strict limitations from certain Dubai banks because of his cryptocurrency transactions, but he eventually found banks that handle this more flexibly. Now he can buy a Porsche GT3 RS or expensive watches with crypto, and when he sells large assets, he simply provides proof of sale and deposits the funds into the bank, without further scrutiny. In Europe, he notes, transactions of this nature could trigger serious consequences, up to and including arrest. Thomas believes this system puts financial freedom itself in jeopardy: in Europe and the U.S., both banks and governments monitor every step, from small transfers to very large ones, constraining even the wealthiest people. Thomas says he greatly enjoys living in Dubai because he sees plenty of opportunities for personal and professional growth there, and he feels the city provides a high level of security for his family. He contrasts this with Europe and the U.S., where, according to him, streets can feel far less safe. For instance, Thomas admits he wouldn’t feel comfortable letting his wife walk alone at night in London, whereas in Dubai he’s confident his loved ones are safe and secure. On the EVEDEX Project In his interviews, Thomas often brings up his project named “ EVEDEX ” (previously called Event Horizon), which he views as a crucial part of his growth and professional evolution. To him, this project isn’t just about business; it’s a means of putting his ideas into action and pushing himself to the next level, broadening his influence and sharing his knowledge. He describes EVEDEX as the product of a dedicated team that took the time to carefully analyze current user needs in this space. EVEDEX is a hybrid decentralized platform that combines the benefits of both centralized and decentralized exchanges, offering high levels of security, privacy, and transparency. It provides users with access to professional trading tools and strategies (such as futures contracts, copy trading, and P2P transactions) without requiring any KYC procedures. Thomas emphasizes that EVEDEX aims to offer equal opportunities to all market participants, regardless of their financial resources or geographic location. Thomas also mentions that the EVEDEX team actively engages with its community by hosting educational events, community calls, and AMA sessions with project representatives, partners, and industry experts. For example, through the Early Bird program, users can complete tasks and earn collectible Badges that grant access to the testnet. Additionally, EVEDEX features an educational center where people can learn about trading, cryptocurrencies, affiliate marketing, and more. According to Thomas, EVEDEX energizes him because he sees how important the team’s work is. He has invested millions of dollars in the project, noting that many of his partners have also committed funds. For him, it’s more than just a business, it's an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the crypto market by offering users valuable tools and educational resources. Thomas acknowledges that building a platform like EVEDEX poses a major challenge, especially when going up against large, established players in the market. It’s a demanding path that requires constant improvement and the pursuit of unique solutions. Yet, he says this challenge inspires him and his team to innovate and keep evolving so that they can deliver a product capable of competing at a high level. From a Difficult Start Thomas Kralow’s story is one of persistence, determination, and continuous self-improvement. He was raised in a tough family situation and moved to the United States, where he had to earn money to cover his tuition. That necessity taught him to adapt quickly and spot opportunities that others might overlook. These life lessons led him first to buy and resell cars and electronics, and eventually into the trading world, where he encountered significant hurdles but developed a disciplined, calculated approach. Now an experienced trader and entrepreneur, Thomas is focused on building EVEDEX, a platform tailored to user needs and founded on principles of decentralization and security. His belief in the value of cryptocurrency and blockchain, along with his conviction about the importance of financial freedom, resonates in both his work and his broader outlook on life. Thomas stresses the vital role of trust and community, building his social media presence and staying connected with his audience, an approach that helps him to attract like-minded individuals and investors. For him, EVEDEX isn’t just a business endeavor; it’s a challenge and an opportunity to make a lasting impact by delivering high-quality tools and education that people need to succeed in a rapidly evolving financial landscape.

2025-06-03T15:30:37,"Stablecoins Ignite Record-Breaking May, Supply Jumps To $244B – Data","A surge of stablecoin transactions marked May as a standout month for the crypto sector. It moved beyond mere token swaps. Lots of people and services turned to dollar-pegged coins for moving value. Activity hit fresh highs, hinting that stablecoins are now the main channel for on-chain payments. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Spike In Wallet Activity According to Artemis data, more than 33 million wallets sent or received stablecoins during May. That’s a big jump compared with earlier months. It shows more folks are leaning on these digital dollars than on native tokens. Many traders, DeFi users, and everyday people tapped stablecoins to keep their funds tied to the US dollar. This wave of usage also came as the wider market showed signs of life, with prices slowly rising and confidence climbing. Shift To Faster Networks Based on reports, BNB Smart Chain counted over 10 million active wallets for stablecoin moves early in May. TRON came very close, with a little over 9 million wallets during that same stretch. These two networks are cheap and quick. Folks want to dodge higher fees on older chains. By month’s end, both BNB Smart Chain and TRON could top those numbers again. That trend speaks to growing demand for fast, low-cost payments and DeFi deals. Ethereum simply can’t match these lower fees right now. Stablecoin Supply Growth Stablecoins also saw more tokens enter circulation. The total supply grew to $244 billion, up nearly 3% in just one month. But not all coins minted equally. Tether’s USDT remained the heavyweight champion. It added nearly $4 billion to its total supply in May alone. Most of that new USDT landed on TRON. Today, TRON holds nearly $78 billion in USDT, while Ethereum carries $73 billion. In sum, USDT’s overall supply now tops $153 billion and added tokens almost every day. USDC moved in the opposite direction. Its supply dipped slightly, thanks to outflows on Solana. Still, USDC keeps about $60 billion circulating across all its chains. Related Reading: Pepe Makes It To Trump’s Feed—Is A Crypto Endorsement Next? Payments And Bridges Overtake Cards Stablecoins didn’t just grow in supply and usage. They carried huge volumes of payments. Over the past 30 days, those coins moved over $2 trillion worth of value. That level beats what many debit and credit cards handled in the same span. For example, Visa’s volumes were lower than what stablecoins saw. Plus, USDC’s cross-chain moves spiked. The CCTP bridge saw $7.7 billion flow through it, up 83% month-on-month. That rush of bridging means more people are shuttling dollars between networks for trades, lending, or simple transfers.

2025-06-03T15:22:57,"BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Is the Youngest Top ETF and May Surpass Satoshi in BTC Holdings, Bloomberg Analyst","The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has emerged as the fastest-growing fund by assets, according to a recent disclosure by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Just 1.4 years since its launch, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed $72.4 billion in assets under management, making it the youngest ETF in the top 25 by a margin of over a decade. According to Balchunas, this development positions IBIT as the only fund under 10 years old on the list, and one that is nine times younger than the next-youngest ETF. https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1929872901479539068Notably, IBIT’s rise signals historic investor demand for direct Bitcoin exposure through a regulated ETF wrapper.Historic Asset Growth for a NewcomerAmong the top ETFs by asset size, longstanding funds such as Vanguard’s VOO, SPDR’s SPY, and iShares’ IVV each carry more than $580 billion in assets and have been active for at least 14 years. In stark contrast, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF ranks 23rd in size despite its short existence, with its 1.4-year age making it a significant statistical outlier. Other ETFs, such as VWO and IEMG, are over 12 years old, underscoring the unusual nature of IBIT’s ascent.In his analysis, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described IBIT’s position among the top ETFs as “like an infant hanging out with teenagers and twenty-somethings,” emphasizing the fund’s unusually young age relative to its peers. He added that this is possibly the most amazing stats pulled by IBIT. While older ETFs built scale over decades, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF accumulated assets at an accelerated rate. He also pointed out the role of structural advantages—such as liquidity, cost efficiency, and the trust associated with traditional ETF frameworks—as key drivers behind IBIT’s success in attracting inflows.BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Could Surpass Satoshi Nakamoto as Largest BTC HolderAlongside its asset growth, IBIT has also emerged as a leading custodian of Bitcoin. According to Balchunas, IBIT currently holds 660,842 BTC, ranking it as the second-largest holder globally. Only the balance belonging to Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, exceeds IBIT’s holdings. Estimates suggest Satoshi’s wallets contain approximately 1,123,500 BTC, though some analysts, such as London-based Farside Investors, have questioned the certainty of that figure.Meanwhile, Balchunas emphasized that even conservative estimates still place IBIT on track to become the largest holder of Bitcoin by late 2026. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has purchased around $50 billion worth of Bitcoin since its inception, surpassing major holders like Binance and Strategy, which hold 622,546 BTC and 580,955 BTC respectively.Long-Term ETF Market Impact DiscussedIn a separate development, Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in April predicted that IBIT could eventually overtake Vanguard’s VOO to become the largest ETF globally. At a Bitwise-hosted Bitcoin conference, Saylor outlined a potential path over the next decade where Bitcoin ETFs reshape traditional fund rankings. Balchunas later echoed this possibility, noting that while such an outcome remains speculative, IBIT’s trajectory is significant within the broader ETF industry.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/03/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-is-the-youngest-top-etf-and-may-surpass-satoshi-in-btc-holdings-bloomberg-analyst/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackrock-bitcoin-etf-is-the-youngest-top-etf-and-may-surpass-satoshi-in-btc-holdings-bloomberg-analyst,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB","Market|Bitcoin ETF|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T15:21:43,"Here’s Why Market Flushouts and Whale Moves Could Set the Stage for Bitcoin’s Next Rally","Bitcoin held firm above the $105,000 mark following a weekend dip, as rattled market participants assess whether the pullback signals a temporary breather. Ongoing shifts in sentiment and trader positioning hint at a broader market recalibration quietly unfolding. No Panic, No Euphoria Bitcoin’s derivatives and spot markets are undergoing a structural recalibration. On Binance, long positions continue to be liquidated in significant waves, at times surpassing $40 million per hour, as seen in the Liquidation Delta metric cited by CryptoQuant. These liquidations highlight heavy pressure on long positions, but notably, there is no corresponding surge in short liquidations. This indicates that while many leveraged long traders are being flushed out , there is little evidence of a counter-move or short squeeze. Meanwhile, Binance funding rates remain largely neutral as it hovers around zero, which suggests a lack of extreme directional bias in the perpetual futures market. Traders are neither aggressively betting on upside nor downside, indicating caution rather than fear or greed. “In simpler terms: the derivatives market is not signaling panic, nor euphoria, just cautious recalibration.” Bitcoin Whales Quietly Accumulate Whale behavior paints a more optimistic picture. Data from the Whale Screener shows that over $500 million in combined Bitcoin and Ethereum was withdrawn from spot exchanges on June 2nd. Most notably, crypto exchange Bitfinex recorded a single-day outflow of 20,000 BTC, worth over $1.3 billion at current prices. This represented the largest Bitcoin withdrawal from the exchange since August 2019. Such a significant movement off exchanges often points to long-term holding intentions by large entities, which could ease immediate selling pressure in the market. Together, these signals – neutral funding, liquidation of overleveraged longs, and strategic accumulation by large holders – depicts a market that is clearing excess leverage and preparing for a potential next leg upward. Although short-term volatility remains, the broader trend suggests Bitcoin may be in the early stages of a new bullish phase driven by healthier market structure and long-term investor confidence.

2025-06-03T15:14:11,"Donald Trump Jr Finally Reveals Why His Family Got Into Bitcoin","In a recent interview on CNBC's Squawk Box , Donald Trump Jr. shared that his family turned to Bitcoin and crypto out of necessity. Speaking with co-hosts Joe Kernen and Andrew Ross Sorkin, he presented why the Trumps got into crypto and what pushed them in that direction, insisting that it was not an attempt to chase the prevalent trend.Kernen asked Trump Jr. about the headlines tying Bitcoin to the Trump brand and the broader MAGA movement. He questioned whether it was appropriate for President Donald Trump to have a meme coin tied to his name.The Trump's Entered Bitcoin and Crypto Out of NecessityIn response, Trump Jr. explained that their turn to crypto started after his family entered politics. Before that, banks in New York returned his calls and approved loans for real estate projects without hesitation. https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1929895962408861834However, once his father became president, those same institutions stopped answering. The Trumps found themselves shut out of the banking scene . According to him, the financial system turned on them overnight, and they couldn't get basic financing even with solid business records and assets.He said that was when he and his brother realized something important: the system was not built to be fair. Before politics, they had access to everything because of their name and resources. Afterward, they experienced the kind of financial roadblocks that everyday Americans face all the time. This opened their eyes. Notably, they saw crypto as a way to work around a system that suddenly turned against them.Blockchain Has Some Real BenefitsSpeaking further, he added that blockchain technology also has real advantages. As a real estate developer, he questioned why basic processes like title insurance still cost so much and take so long. He saw clear ways crypto could make those transactions faster and cheaper. For him, the decision wasn't about jumping on a trend, it was about survival and innovation. He described it as a necessary pivot after getting locked out of traditional finance.Sorkin then asked whether the Trump-linked meme coin could let foreign or domestic actors secretly send money to those in power. Responding, Trump Jr. distanced himself from the coin, saying he wasn't part of that project and instead focused on more serious areas like stablecoins and Bitcoin mining.Trump Jr: TRUMP Meme Coin a ""Proof of Concept""Still, he defended the meme coin as a ""proof of concept,"" arguing it shows how the crypto world recognizes that traditional finance doesn't treat everyone equally.Interestingly, Kernen compared the meme coin controversy to past scandals involving Hunter Biden's art and the Clinton Foundation. He suggested that, like those cases, the meme coin could open the door to influence buying. Trump Jr. acknowledged those concerns but pointed out the anonymous nature of crypto makes it hard to link transactions directly to political power. He said the coin proves how quickly the public is losing trust in traditional systems.When asked about criticisms from crypto insiders, Trump Jr. insisted that no one he spoke to had voiced any concerns. Instead, many thanked him for helping bring attention and credibility to the space. He said crypto attracts a wide range of people, including libertarians, conservatives, and those simply looking for more financial freedom, and that the support hasn't come from just one side of the political aisle.To wrap up, Sorkin asked if crypto could one day threaten the U.S. dollar. Trump Jr. said he believes the opposite. He pointed out that stablecoins like USD1 actually support the dollar's dominance. He explained that these coins now buy more Treasuries than many foreign governments do, helping maintain U.S. borrowing power. In his view, stablecoins might end up being the key to keeping the dollar strong in the long run.The Trump Family's Involvement in CryptoNotably, the Trump family has made major moves in crypto. In Q4 2024, World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform inspired by Trump Sr., launched, raising $550 million through token sales. In mid-January 2025, just before the inauguration, Donald Trump launched the TRUMP meme coin while Melania Trump launched MELANIA . Reports say Trump-affiliated groups hold 80% of both coins. At the end of March, Trump Jr. and Eric Trump revealed they had taken a minority stake in American Bitcoin, a mining company created with Hut 8. Also, WLFI introduced the USD1 stablecoin , backed by a $2 billion investment from an Abu Dhabi firm through Binance. Then last month, Trump Media and Technology Group announced a $2.5 billion plan to build a Bitcoin treasury.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/03/donald-trump-jr-finally-reveals-why-his-family-got-into-bitcoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=donald-trump-jr-finally-reveals-why-his-family-got-into-bitcoin,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TOKEN SALE","Market|Trending Now|Latest Donald Trump News",cryptocompare
