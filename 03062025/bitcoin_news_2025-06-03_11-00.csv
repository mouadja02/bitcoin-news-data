As BTC hovers above $105,000, firms are racing to embrace it not just as a store of value but as a key pillar of financial strategy. And the latest player to jump in to the crypto game is Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX), which triggered markets on June 2 with a bold Bitcoin treasury announcement that sent its shares soaring by 138%. Starting with a low profile Norway is quietly getting started with their Bitcoin buying plans. NBX Buys BTC, Stock Erupts NBX kicked off its treasury strategy with the purchase of 6 BTC, worth around $633,700, with plans to increase that to 10 BTC by month’s end. But the move wasn’t just symbolic, NBX outlined plans to use its Bitcoin to issue USDM, a stablecoin on Cardano, and unlock yield within the Cardano ecosystem. Investors loved the idea. NBX shares skyrocketed 138.5% in a single trading day, closing at €0.033 ($0.038), signaling strong confidence in BTC-backed innovation. Crypto Banking Next? NBX isn’t stopping at Bitcoin reserves. The company hinted at ambitions to turn into a full-fledged digital asset bank. By leveraging BTC as collateral, NBX aims to offer Bitcoin-backed loans and boost operational efficiency, potentially drawing institutional capital from firms now warming up to crypto. However, in the journey NBX isn’t alone. Norway’s Aker ASA already holds 1,170 BTC via its crypto subsidiary, Seetee , while brokerage firm K33 raised $6.2 million for its own Bitcoin play. Even Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund holds indirect exposure to nearly 3,821 BTC through equity holdings. Bitcoin Treasury Trend Spreads Its massively trending worldwide, Companies from France’s Blockchain Group to Indonesia’s DigiAsia Corp have seen similar stock boosts after announcing Bitcoin purchases. It’s part of a broader corporate shift, publicly listed companies now hold over 3 million BTC, valued at more than $342 billion. Overall, Bitcoin isn’t just digital gold anymore, it’s turning into a corporate growth engine. With altcoins like Cardano getting involved through stablecoins like USDM, the line between crypto reserve and DeFi innovation is blurring fast.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/norways-nbx-joins-bitcoin-treasury-trend-stock-jumps-138/,"ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T08:40:01,"Altcoin Season Index Signals Crucial Shift: Bitcoin Season is Here for the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Signals Crucial Shift: Bitcoin Season is Here for the Crypto Market Are you watching the crypto market closely? If so, you might have noticed a shift in momentum. A key metric, the Altcoin Season Index , is signaling that the market is currently firmly in Bitcoin Season . Understanding what this means is crucial for navigating the coming weeks and months. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is designed to give investors a snapshot of which part of the market cycle we are in – Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season . It’s a simple yet powerful tool based on historical performance. Here’s how it generally works: It looks at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens). It compares the performance of these altcoins against Bitcoin over a specific period, typically the last 90 days. The index ranges from 1 to 100. According to the metric, as of 00:28 UTC on June 3, the index registered 26. This specific number falls squarely into the definition of Bitcoin Season . How Does the Index Define Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season? The thresholds are quite clear-cut: Altcoin Season: This occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. An index score typically above 75 would indicate this phase. Bitcoin Season: This occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. An index score below 25 would indicate this phase. Scores between 25 and 75 might indicate a transitional or undefined phase, sometimes referred to as ‘Neither’ season. With the index at 26, it indicates that only a small percentage of the top 100 altcoins have managed to perform better than Bitcoin over the last three months. This firmly places the current crypto market state in Bitcoin Season . What Does Being in Bitcoin Season Mean for Your Portfolio? Entering or being in Bitcoin Season has several implications for participants in the crypto market . It doesn’t mean altcoins will necessarily crash, but it suggests a specific dynamic is at play. Challenges During Bitcoin Season: Potential Altcoin Underperformance: The most direct implication is that many altcoins are likely to underperform compared to Bitcoin . If Bitcoin goes up, altcoins might go up less, stay flat, or even go down. If Bitcoin goes down, altcoins often go down harder. Reduced Speculative Frenzy: The widespread, rapid pumps seen across a broad range of altcoins during peak Altcoin Season are less common. Focus Shifts to Bitcoin: Media attention, retail interest, and even institutional flows tend to focus more heavily on Bitcoin during this time. Potential Opportunities During Bitcoin Season: Strong Bitcoin Performance: Historically, Bitcoin Season can coincide with periods of significant gains for Bitcoin itself, potentially driven by factors like halving events, institutional adoption news, or macroeconomic shifts. Accumulation Opportunities: If altcoins are consolidating or pulling back, it can present opportunities for investors to accumulate positions in promising projects at potentially lower prices in anticipation of the next Altcoin Season. Clearer Market Leader: With Bitcoin often dictating the pace, the overall market direction can sometimes feel less chaotic than during peak Altcoin Season when dozens of narratives are simultaneously driving different tokens. Why Might the Crypto Market Be in Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors can contribute to the market shifting into Bitcoin Season . While the index is based purely on relative price performance over 90 days, this performance is driven by underlying market dynamics. Possible contributing factors include: Post-Halving Dynamics: The Bitcoin halving event often precedes periods where Bitcoin shows strength as the supply issuance decreases, and attention is drawn to its scarcity model. Institutional Interest: Large institutional investors often start with Bitcoin due to its size, liquidity, and regulatory clarity (especially with products like spot Bitcoin ETFs). Increased institutional flows into Bitcoin can cause it to outperform other assets in the short to medium term. Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of broader economic uncertainty, investors might rotate out of more speculative assets (like many altcoins ) and into the perceived relative safety of Bitcoin within the crypto space. Early Cycle Phase: Historically, Bitcoin often leads the initial stages of a bull run, with altcoins catching up and eventually outperforming later in the cycle. Being in Bitcoin Season could indicate we are still in an earlier phase of a larger potential upward trend. Actionable Insights for Navigating Bitcoin Season So, the Altcoin Season Index says it’s Bitcoin Season . What should you do? Here are some strategies to consider: Review Your Allocation: Assess your portfolio’s current split between Bitcoin and altcoins . Does it align with your risk tolerance and expectations for a Bitcoin Season environment? You might consider increasing your Bitcoin exposure or trimming positions in underperforming altcoins that don’t fit your long-term thesis. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: If you are bullish on Bitcoin ‘s long-term prospects, continuing or starting a DCA strategy can be effective during this phase. Research Altcoins for the Next Cycle: Use this period to research promising altcoin projects. Look for strong fundamentals, active development, clear use cases, and engaged communities. Building a watchlist now can position you well when the market eventually shifts back towards altcoins . Be Patient with Altcoins: If you hold altcoins you believe in long-term, understand that they may underperform Bitcoin for a while. Avoid panic selling based solely on the index reading. Focus on the project’s fundamentals. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, economic indicators, and on-chain data for both Bitcoin and your chosen altcoins . Market conditions can change rapidly. Remember, the Altcoin Season Index is a historical look (90 days) and an indicator, not a crystal ball. It tells us the current state based on recent performance, but it doesn’t predict the future with certainty. Market cycles are fluid. Is This Normal? Understanding Crypto Market Cycles Absolutely. The crypto market is well-known for its cyclical nature. Periods where Bitcoin leads are typically followed by periods where altcoins have their turn to shine, and vice versa. Think of it like seasons in nature. We have Bitcoin Season (perhaps like winter or early spring, where the foundation strengthens) and Altcoin Season (like summer, where everything grows rapidly). The index simply helps us identify which season we are currently experiencing based on recent performance trends. Past cycles have shown distinct periods of Bitcoin dominance followed by explosive growth in altcoins . The fact that the index is currently low is not a sign of a broken market, but rather a reflection of the current phase of the cycle. When Might Altcoin Season Return? Predicting the exact timing is impossible, but historical patterns and potential catalysts can offer clues: Bitcoin Consolidation: Often, after a significant run-up, Bitcoin may enter a period of consolidation. This sideways movement can free up capital and investor attention, allowing focus to shift towards promising altcoins . Emergence of New Narratives: Strong performance in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions, or gaming can sometimes kickstart broader interest in altcoins . Improved Market Sentiment: A general increase in risk appetite across global financial markets can flow into the crypto space, benefiting altcoins which are generally considered higher risk than Bitcoin . Significant Altcoin Developments: Major mainnet launches, protocol upgrades, or widespread adoption news for specific large-cap altcoins can also contribute to a shift. Watching the Altcoin Season Index , alongside other market indicators and news, can help you anticipate potential shifts. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Season Ahead The Altcoin Season Index, currently sitting at 26, provides a clear signal: the crypto market is in Bitcoin Season . This means that over the last 90 days, Bitcoin has largely outperformed the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins . While this phase can present challenges for pure altcoin holders, it’s a normal part of the market cycle and can offer opportunities, particularly for those focused on Bitcoin or looking to accumulate quality altcoins at potentially favorable prices. Understanding this dynamic, adjusting your strategy if necessary, and remaining patient are key to navigating the current crypto market landscape.

With a 10.00% non-cumulative fixed dividend and perpetual duration, STRD aims to provide long-term, high-yield exposure positioned between the firm's senior preferred (STRF) and convertible preferred (STRK) offerings. Unlike STRF, which offers a senior claim and is designed to be overcollateralized with lower volatility—comparable to investment-grade securities STRD is junior in seniority but delivers the highest yield of Strategy’s preferred offerings. STRK, by contrast, sits between the two in both risk and return, offering an 8% fixed dividend and convertibility. At the base of the capital stack lies MSTR, the firm’s common stock and primary vehicle for leveraged bitcoin exposure. According to Strategy, STRD is non-callable under normal conditions, but may be repurchased upon a “fundamental change” or select tax events. Its quarterly dividends are discretionary and paid in cash only when declared by the board. In the broader market, STRD compares favorably against other preferred equity and high-yield bond funds. With a 10% yield and zero management fees, STRD offers a compelling alternative to ETFs like PFF (7% yield, 0.46% fee) and USHY (8% yield, 0.08% fee), while maintaining comparable volatility levels. The STRD offering supports Strategy’s broader initiative to offer diversified, structured exposures that span from stable yield to high-conviction digital asset plays anchoring a new approach to capital structuring in the digital era.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/03/strategy-expands-capital-stack-with-launch-of-high-yield-strd-preferred-shares,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|STRK","Markets|MicroStrategy|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

The surge comes right after as the Federal Reserve hints at a possible change in its strict money policy later this year. Therefore, traders are bullish on the bitcoin surge. Powell Hints at Softer Money Policy Speaking at an event for the Fed’s International Finance (IF) Division, Powell said their work helps understand the world’s economy and all the risks. He didn’t mention interest rates directly, but he did say that global data matters a lot now.. Powell’s comments didn’t go unnoticed. Investors saw them as a quiet sign that the Fed is starting to think about changing its current tight money approach if economic trends keep heading in the right direction. Why This Could Be Good News for Bitcoin This talk of a softer policy shift is good news for Bitcoin and other riskier assets. Eventually, the inflation is slowing down, and jobs are steady. Currently, inflation is at 2.3% , close to the Fed’s 2% goal. Meanwhile, the Unemployment rate is also around 4.2%, showing that people are still working and the economy is okay. Even though Powell didn’t say there will be cuts soon, he said that global data is very important. Traders think this could mean the Fed might lower rates later if inflation keeps falling and jobs stay strong. Lower rates make it easier to borrow money, which usually helps things like Bitcoin go up. Cautious Approach, But Market’s Ready For now, the Fed is being careful. Most traders think rates will stay steady at the June meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool shows a 95.3% chance of no change in rates next month. Only a small chance of a cut is expected. This careful but open approach has traders hopeful that Bitcoin and other cryptos will see more gains soon. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $105,253, reflecting a slight drop seen in the last 24 hours.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/fed-chair-powell-hints-at-softer-monetary-policy-bitcoin-back-to-106k/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T08:30:57,"Crypto Fear Greed Index: Navigate Market Greed Wisely","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear Greed Index: Navigate Market Greed Wisely Are you watching the markets and wondering how others are feeling? The Crypto Fear Greed Index is a popular tool designed to answer just that, giving you a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment . Recently, this index, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 64, holding steady from the previous day. This number firmly places the market sentiment in the territory known as ‘Greed’. But what exactly does this mean for your approach to crypto investing ? Understanding the Crypto Fear Greed Index At its core, the Crypto Fear Greed Index aims to quantify the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market participants. Emotions like fear and greed can significantly influence investment decisions. When the market is experiencing extreme fear, it often signals that investors are panic-selling, potentially creating buying opportunities. Conversely, when extreme greed takes over, it might suggest the market is due for a correction as assets become overvalued. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed A reading of 64, as we see currently, falls comfortably within the ‘Greed’ zone. This suggests that market participants are feeling optimistic and are potentially buying aggressively, perhaps driven by positive price movements or general enthusiasm. Understanding this kind of market psychology is crucial. How Does the Index Calculate Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear Greed Index isn’t based on just one factor. It aggregates data from several different sources to provide a holistic view. Here are the components the index typically considers, along with their weightings: Factor Weighting Description Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum / Volume 25% Compares the current market volume and momentum to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market indicates greedy/bullish behavior. Social Media 15% Analyzes tweets and posts from various platforms, looking at specific hashtags, sentiment analysis, and how fast conversations are happening. High engagement around positive topics can signal greed. Surveys 15% Polls conducted weekly asking investors about their market sentiment. (Note: As mentioned in the source, surveys are currently paused, meaning this factor’s weight might be temporarily redistributed or excluded from the calculation). Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear (as investors move from altcoins to BTC, seen as safer) or greed (if BTC is strongly rallying). The index interprets this nuancedly. Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might signal fear, while terms like “buy crypto” during a rally could indicate greed. By combining these diverse factors, the index attempts to capture the overall feeling in the market beyond just looking at the Bitcoin price or trading volume in isolation. What Does ‘Greed’ at 64 Signal for Investors? A reading of 64 suggests that market participants are generally bullish and confident. This isn’t yet ‘Extreme Greed’ (75+), which is often seen as a strong warning sign of an impending correction. However, being in the ‘Greed’ zone still warrants caution. Historically, periods of high greed have preceded market downturns. This is based on the principle of ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ or simply that markets tend to revert to the mean. When everyone is euphoric and buying, there are fewer potential buyers left, and any negative news or catalyst can trigger a wave of selling. For someone engaged in crypto investing , a 64 reading could imply: Prices might be getting stretched and potentially overvalued in the short term. There’s a higher risk of a pullback or correction compared to times of fear. New investments might carry more risk if not carefully considered. It might be a time to consider taking some profits, rebalancing your portfolio, or setting stricter stop-losses. It’s essential to remember that the index is an indicator of sentiment, not a crystal ball predicting exact price movements or timing. Is the Crypto Fear Greed Index a Reliable Tool? The index is a valuable tool for understanding market psychology , but it has its benefits and challenges. Benefits: Quantifies Emotion: Provides a simple, numerical representation of market feelings. Counter-Trading Signal: Can sometimes offer contrarian signals (e.g., extreme fear might be a buy signal, extreme greed a sell signal). Historical Context: Allows comparison of current sentiment to past market cycles. Quick Snapshot: Offers a fast way to gauge the overall mood without deep analysis of every factor individually. Challenges: Not a Sole Indicator: Should not be used in isolation for making investment decisions. Doesn’t Predict Price: Indicates feeling, not guaranteed future price action. The market can remain irrational longer than you expect. Factor Weighting: The exact impact of each factor can change, and the temporary pausing of surveys shows it’s dynamic. Lagging vs. Leading: It’s often a reflection of recent price action rather than a predictor of future moves. Using the index effectively means integrating it into a broader analysis framework that includes technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and understanding the specific dynamics of the Bitcoin price and other assets you’re interested in. Using Market Psychology in Your Crypto Investing Strategy Understanding market psychology , as reflected by the Crypto Fear Greed Index, can be a powerful addition to your crypto investing strategy. When the index is high (Greed), it’s a reminder to: Be Cautious: Avoid making impulsive decisions driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk exposure. Are you comfortable with your current holdings if a correction occurs? Plan Your Exits: Consider setting profit targets or stop-losses to protect gains. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Stick to a DCA plan if you have one, rather than putting large sums in when sentiment is high. Look for Undervalued Assets: Sometimes, even in a generally greedy market, specific assets might be lagging or undervalued. Conversely, when the index drops into ‘Fear’ or ‘Extreme Fear’, it might signal a time to look for potential buying opportunities, assuming your fundamental analysis supports the assets. The current reading of 64 is a prompt to be mindful. The market feels good, but that’s precisely when complacency can set in. Smart investors use sentiment indicators like this to temper their own emotions and make more rational decisions, rather than being swept up in the prevailing mood. Conclusion: Navigating Greed in the Crypto Market The Crypto Fear Greed Index holding at 64 signifies that ‘Greed’ remains the dominant crypto market sentiment . While not yet in the extreme zone, this reading serves as a valuable signal for anyone involved in crypto investing . It highlights the current bullish market psychology but also reminds us that periods of high optimism often carry increased risk of pullbacks. Understanding the factors behind the index, from volatility and momentum to social media and Bitcoin price trends, helps paint a clearer picture. The index is not a standalone predictor but a crucial tool for gauging the emotional temperature of the market. Use this insight to inform your strategy, manage risk, and avoid making decisions driven solely by emotion. Staying disciplined and informed is key to navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency.

2025-06-03T08:30:48,"Another Proof Says Ripple CTO Is Satoshi Bitcoin Creator","Another proof that Ripple CTO David Schwartz is a Satoshi Nakamoto, the group of developers that created Bitcoin, has emerged. Vandell, the co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, has revived a long-circulating theory tying early digital currency development to U.S. intelligence agencies, specifically the National Security Agency (NSA). In a recent tweet, Vandell revisits a 1996 NSA publication titled “How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash” and raises questions about the timing of David Schwartz’s involvement with the NSA. Schwartz, one of the original architects behind the XRP Ledger, filed a patent for distributed ledger technology the same year the NSA paper was released. This 1996 NSA article “How to Make a Mint” Coincidence David Shwartz, one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger began work with the NSA the same year his patent was accepted? Reference Line 11. “ Tatsuaki Okamoto” David Shwartz is a Satoshi Nakamoto. Hidden in plain… pic.twitter.com/rOOWLzH54j — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) June 1, 2025 The 1996 NSA Paper and Cryptographic Foundations The NSA’s How to Make a Mint outlines the technical requirements for creating anonymous digital cash. Among the references cited in the document is a 1995 paper by Tatsuaki Okamoto titled An Efficient Divisible Electronic Cash Scheme (reference #11 in the bibliography of the image Vandell shared). Vandell draws attention to this citation to highlight a potential connection between foundational digital cash concepts and the eventual creation of Bitcoin. Okamoto’s work has long been recognized in the cryptographic community as pioneering and influential in the development of electronic money protocols. The Schwartz Timeline and Patent Filing What Vandell emphasizes is the convergence of events in 1996: the NSA’s publication of the anonymous digital cash paper and the acceptance of David Schwartz’s patent for distributed computer systems. Schwartz reportedly began working with the NSA the same year. Vandell implies that this timeline is not coincidental but indicative of a coordinated effort involving government agencies and select technologists. The patent in question, filed by Schwartz, outlines a method for securely managing distributed computer systems—technology that resembles early blockchain concepts. This technological overlap is central to Vandell’s thesis: that both Bitcoin and XRP may share common developmental roots traceable to work done within or influenced by NSA research. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications Regarding Satoshi Nakamoto Vandell further escalates the claim by suggesting that David Schwartz is, in fact, Satoshi Nakamoto —the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. He argues that the parallels between Schwartz’s early government work, his technical contributions to distributed ledger systems, and the timing of Bitcoin’s conceptual development form a compelling case. According to Vandell, these data points are not random but deliberately connected, pointing to Schwartz as a likely identity behind Satoshi. While no direct evidence is provided to confirm this assertion, the alignment of events and technologies is presented as circumstantial proof. Vandell states that Bitcoin and XRP both trace back to NSA labs and that this origin has been “hidden in plain sight.” He also claims that the creation of Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems may have occurred under the oversight of intelligence agencies and powerful technology interests. Vandell’s tweet reinforces a long-running narrative suggesting that the genesis of blockchain technology was not solely the product of anonymous developers or decentralized communities, but instead may involve state-level research and coordination. By referencing the NSA’s 1996 paper, David Schwartz’s patent, and foundational cryptographic research by Tatsuaki Okamoto, Vandell outlines what he believes to be a credible timeline that repositions Schwartz not only as a key figure in the XRP ecosystem but potentially as the creator of Bitcoin itself. These claims remain speculative, but they reflect ongoing curiosity and skepticism about the true origins of digital currency.

Leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency monero (XMR) has outperformed bitcoin BTC this year, and the trend is likely to continue in the coming weeks. That's the message from the XMR-BTC ratio trading on Poloniex. The ratio representing XMR's bitcoin-denominated price recently rose to the highest since January 2024, confirming a ""double-bottom"" breakout on the weekly time frame. The double bottom comprises two consecutive peaks with lows at about the same price, representing an exhaustion of the preceding downtrend. It also includes a horizontal line, called the neckline resistance, drawn connecting the temporary recovery between the two troughs. A move past the neckline is said to confirm the breakout or a bearish-bullish shift in the market trend. The ratio carved out two troughs at around 0.00165 early this year and recently broke above the neckline resistance, indicating a double-bottom bullish reversal. In other words, XMR has likely begun a new bull run relative to bitcoin. The pair's move above the Ichimoku cloud also suggests the same. The bullish outlook risks invalidation in case of a renewed dip below the double top support (former resistance). Monero has surged 86% this year, outperforming Bitcoin's 12% rise by a significant margin, according to CoinDesk data.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/03/monero-bull-run-impending-xmr-btc-price-chart-signals,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XMR","Markets|XMR|Monero|Bitcoin|Markets|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T08:27:08,"Best Crypto to Buy Now: Ignore the Price — This Metric Screams Accumulation","If you’re still waiting for the perfect price, you might already be late. In 2025, the smartest traders aren’t focused on candles—they’re watching wallet activity. One behavioral metric has quietly appeared before every major rally in cryptocurrency history. It has nothing to do with hype and everything to do with conviction. When long-term holders begin accumulating and social mentions spike at the same time, something’s happening. This was true in 2017, again in 2021, and it’s beginning to resurface now. If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy now, this data matters more than headlines ever will. Let’s break down the pattern—and the top cryptocurrencies and a presale coin ( Dawgz AI ) flashing the signal today. The One Metric That Keeps Predicting Bull Runs Wallet accumulation combined with rising community engagement. That’s the metric. Platforms like Santiment, DefiLlama, and Glassnode track wallet growth, exchange outflows, and social sentiment. When those metrics converge, it signals quiet market conviction—investors buying without announcing it. Right now, these signs are flashing again. Not just for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but for emerging projects. That’s why this April, many are watching Dawgz AI, Ethereum, and one other token with mounting long-term holder interest. If you’re scanning for the best crypto to buy now , this signal should be your first filter—not price. Dawgz AI – Behavioral Signals Backed by Growth Dawgz AI isn’t trending for its memes. It’s trending because real money is moving in. This Ethereum-based project blends meme culture with serious AI-powered utility. At a current presale price of just $0.00438, it’s caught early attention thanks to its trading bots, blockchain staking tools, and real-time analytics built for user growth. It’s not hype—it’s data. Wallet accumulation is up. Social mentions are increasing. And over $3.6 million has already been raised. Why Dawgz AI May Be the Best Crypto to Buy Now: AI-Powered Trading: Bots trade markets 24/7, built to grow your holdings. Day-One Staking: Hold and earn from the start—staking is live from presale. Multi-Chain Vision: Ethereum native, expanding to blockchain platforms like Solana. SolidProof Audit : Complete audit transparency, a rarity in meme-backed tokens. Community Momentum: Daily growth in holders, mentions, and investor engagement. This metric isn’t just appearing—it’s accelerating. If you're searching for a crypto to buy this April, Dawgz AI stands out as one of the top opportunities. Ethereum – Still the Smart Money Favorite Ethereum is more than just the OG smart contract layer. It remains a backbone for the cryptocurrency economy. Now trading at $2,720.97, with a $301.57 billion market cap, Ethereum is still seeing growth in active wallets. That’s not price chasing—that’s conviction. After the 2022 merge to proof-of-stake, Ethereum slashed its energy usage by 99.98%. It now powers thousands of DeFi apps, blockchain games, NFT protocols, and DAOs. All while maintaining dominance across exchanges and dev networks. If you’re looking for a crypto for long term hold, Ethereum remains a foundation—respected by institutions and sought after by individual traders alike. Wallet inflows, rising validator counts, and consistent market traction show that Ethereum is far from done. Bitcoin – Watch the Reserve, Not Just the Chart Still leading the cryptocurrency sector, Bitcoin has evolved into a macro asset. Currently priced at $108,462 with a $2.13 trillion cap, BTC is again the focus of serious capital. Why? U.S. regulators have announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, triggering a new round of institutional accumulation. But here’s what matters most—the outflows. Exchange withdrawals are rising. On-chain wallets holding BTC long-term are increasing. This is the same signal that appeared pre-2017 and pre-2021 rallies. If you’re still wondering about the best crypto to buy now, Bitcoin might not be cheap, but it's still a foundational hold for many. The long-term signals are flashing green. Why This Metric Could Define 2025’s Bull Run Price is noisy. But data? Data is direction. Wallet activity, staking behaviors, and social engagement all reveal where serious investors are focusing. Platforms like Glassnode have shown these same behavioral trends in every major crypto rally—and they’re showing up again. In 2025, invest based on what wallets are doing, not what influencers are saying. This month, Dawgz AI is tracking similar patterns to early-stage stars like SHIB and PEPE before they ran. But unlike those tokens, Dawgz brings actual utility with AI systems, blockchain staking, and an audited framework. So if you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, focus on the data that actually moves the needle. 3 Reasons These Coins Top the List Right Now Here’s why Dawgz AI, Ethereum, and Bitcoin stand out as the best cryptocurrencies to watch this month: Early Accumulation Patterns: Wallet growth is rising before price jumps. Real-World Utility: Whether it’s Ethereum’s smart contracts or Dawgz AI’s trading tools, these coins have something functional. Community Momentum: Social and wallet data align—indicating strong conviction, not just short-term hype. This is what investors should be watching—not just candlesticks or price pumps. Final Thoughts: Stay Ahead by Watching Behavior, Not Buzz In 2025, the game has changed. Those chasing quick pumps are getting left behind. Long-term success comes from reading the blockchain, not just the charts. Behavioral data like wallet inflows and social volume shows what the smart money is doing before the rest of the market catches on. And right now? Dawgz AI is showing the best mix of momentum, traction, and accumulation. It’s an early-stage crypto to buy now—not because of hype, but because the metrics say so. Don’t wait for headlines.

2025-06-03T08:22:57,"What are the hottest crypto payment cards this cycle, and how to get them?","Crypto payment cards have become increasingly popular in recent years as a means of spending digital assets in everyday scenarios. Once seen solely as an investment, cryptocurrencies in 2025 are widely being used for payments, particularly by younger, tech-savvy users who seek convenience without sacrificing control over their finances. A recent study by Coupon Follow reveals that 42% of U.S. millennials have used cryptocurrency for purchases in the past year, marking a 12% increase since 2022. With more people looking to spend their crypto, several new payment cards now make the leap from wallet to checkout much easier. Here are five widely used options for spending crypto: Crypto.com Visa card Launched in 2018 following a partnership between crypto exchange Crypto.com and payments giant Visa, the Crypto.com Visa Card was one of the first mainstream offerings to connect digital assets with real-world spending. It allows users to top up using cryptocurrencies held in their Crypto.com wallet, which are then automatically converted into fiat at the time of purchase. What sets it apart is its tiered rewards structure based on the amount of CRO, Crypto.com’s native token, that a user stakes. Depending on the tier, cardholders can earn up to 5% cash back in CRO on everyday purchases, along with benefits such as free subscriptions to Spotify and Netflix, as well as airport lounge access for premium users. Further, there are no annual fees, and the card works anywhere Visa is accepted. The Crypto.com Visa Card is available across the U.S., U.K., European Economic Area (EEA), Canada, Singapore, and several Asia-Pacific markets. Users can apply directly through the Crypto.com app by completing identity verification and choosing their preferred card tier. Once approved, a physical card is mailed out, and a virtual card is immediately accessible for online use.

Wirex is a London-based fintech company that offers a crypto-friendly alternative to conventional banking through its multi-currency accounts and mobile app. Issued in partnership with Mastercard , the card supports multiple cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies through a single, borderless payment system. Users can link their Wirex app to the card and instantly convert crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDC into fiat at the point of sale. The card offers up to 8% cashback in WXT, Wirex’s native token, on eligible purchases, with no monthly maintenance or exchange fees. The Wirex Card is currently available across the U.K., EEA, and parts of the Asia-Pacific region. It can be ordered directly through the Wirex app following standard identity verification, and users receive both a physical card and a virtual version for online transactions. RedotPay card The RedotPay Card supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, with the option to automatically convert to fiat currency at checkout. Backed by Visa, the card can be used at over 130 million merchants globally and is compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay in select regions. It also allows ATM withdrawals and online purchases without the need to manually pre-convert crypto balances. The card works in real time through the RedotPay app and doesn’t require advance deposits. It is currently available in most major markets, including the U.S., U.K., and several countries across Asia and Europe. Users can apply through the RedotPay website after completing basic KYC verification. Coinbase card The Coinbase card was also launched in partnership with Visa, allowing direct crypto spending from a user’s Coinbase account with the option of automatic conversion to fiat at the point of sale. One of the card’s notable features is its rotating crypto rewards program, which is currently limited to users in the United States . Users there can earn up to 4% back in various cryptocurrencies on eligible purchases. It is accepted at over 40 million merchants worldwide that accept Visa, and supports integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay for contactless payments. To obtain the Coinbase Card, users must have a verified Coinbase account. After completing identity verification, they can apply for the card through the Coinbase app or website. Once approved, a virtual card is available for immediate use, and a physical card is mailed to the user. Burner card As opposed to standard crypto payment cards, the Burner Card has been positioned as a lightweight tool for gifting or using it as a portable cold storage. Developed by Burner.pro, it functions as a tap-to-use self-custody wallet embedded in an NFC-enabled smart card. Each Burner Card is configured for a specific blockchain, with current options supporting Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Base. Users can currently store assets, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, or the gasless stablecoin USD II, directly on the cards, which can be accessed via a smartphone. It requires no app installation and operates via a secure, browser-based interface. The card can be purchased at the official burner.pro website.

The move reflects a growing trend among Nordic companies to incorporate Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. Initial Purchase and Future Plans On June 2, NBX confirmed the acquisition of 6 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $633,700. The firm aims to increase its holdings to 10 BTC before the end of June. The company is also in talks to raise additional capital to expand its Bitcoin position. By the close of June 2’s trading day, NBX shares had surged by 138.5%, ending at 0.033 euros ($0.038), according to Google Finance. Despite this jump, the stock remains far below its all-time high of 0.93 euros ($1.06), which it reached in January 2022. Bitcoin as Collateral and Operational Tool NBX plans to use its newly acquired Bitcoin to support the issuance of USDM, a stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain. The Bitcoin will also generate yield within the Cardano ecosystem. The platform stated, “Bitcoin is becoming an important part of the global financial infrastructure.” NBX believes the holdings will enhance “operational efficiency” and attract capital from crypto-curious businesses. The company also revealed ambitions to explore Bitcoin-backed loans as part of a broader effort to evolve into a digital asset bank. Growing Bitcoin Adoption in Norway NBX is not alone in embracing Bitcoin. Norwegian industrial giant Aker ASA entered the space in 2021 by creating a crypto-focused subsidiary, Seetee, which now holds 1,170 BTC. According to Bitcointreasuries.net, Aker bought its Bitcoin at an average cost of $50,200, with current holdings valued at approximately $123 million. Another Norwegian brokerage, K33, has raised 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) to begin purchasing Bitcoin, signaling wider interest among regional firms. Even Norway’s central wealth fund is indirectly exposed—Norges Bank held 3,821 BTC via equity investments by the end of 2024. Global Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries NBX’s stock rally mirrors other cases where firms gained after announcing Bitcoin investments. France’s Blockchain Group revealed its Bitcoin buy in November 2023 and saw its stock rise 225% to 0.48 euros. In Indonesia, DigiAsia Corp announced a $100 million Bitcoin investment plan, prompting a 91% increase in its stock price. Collectively, corporate Bitcoin treasuries now hold over 3 million BTC, valued at more than $342 billion, according to Bitbo.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/norwegian-exchange-stock-soars-138-after-bitcoin-purchase-announcement/,"ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

As of writing, Bitcoin price is hovering near $105,470, recovering slightly from intraday lows around $105,168. This cautious rebound follows recent rejections near the $106,000–$106,500 supply zone, keeping BTC trapped between key trendlines. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Looking at the 4-hour and daily charts, Bitcoin price action appears to be caught between opposing pressures. While BTC has reclaimed higher lows since the May rebound from $93,232, the $106,000–$106,500 region remains a firm ceiling. Sellers have stepped in aggressively near that red supply zone, halting attempts to revisit the $108,000–$112,000 range. BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, BTC remains supported above the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $103,145, but the price is struggling to hold momentum above the 20-EMA and 50-EMA cluster around $105,160–$105,940.

2025-06-03T08:00:35,"Bitcoin Price Crash To $104,000: What You Need To Know In June","Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has risen in fame for making multiple near-perfect calls for the Bitcoin price. He had predicted the Bitcoin decline from $109,000 back down and then called a bottom at $77,000, predicting the BTC price would bounce to new all-time highs, which it did. Now, with the Bitcoin price recoiling from hitting a new all-time high above $111,000, the crypto analyst is back with next steps and where the cryptocurrency could be headed from here. Why The Bitcoin Price Golden Cross Matters In his X post, Doctor Profit starts out by explaining the psychology of the current market, calling out those who continue to call out for a bear market. He refers to these people as ‘exit liquidity’ for the real players, hinting that they’re wrong for their stance. Rather, he points out an important formation in the Bitcoin price chart and that is the Golden Cross, which appeared last week. Related Reading: 312 Million Dogecoin Moved To Coinbase – What’s Going On? The analyst calls the appearance of this Golden Cross “a macro-level signal with historic accuracy.” He explains that since this signal is so rare, but has been right every time, there is no reason to deviate from it. Also, he further explains that the Golden Cross has always been a long-game signal. Hence, results are not expected to start showing so early. The Golden Cross pattern had appeared on the weekly chart, and the crypto analyst highlights its historical accuracy. Each time that the Bitcoin price has formed this Golden Cross, it has usually led to a multi-month rally. If this is the case this cycle, then it suggests that the Bitcoin bull run is far from over. Don’t Worry About The Bears After the Golden Cross pattern appeared, another concerning development had taken place on the Bitcoin price chart and that is a bearish divergence on the weekly timeframe. Normally, this means an end to the rally and that the price could start to plummet. However, the crypto analyst seems unfazed by this. He refers to a similar bearish divergence appearing when the Bitcoin price was trading at $80,000 and nothing happened. Since the cryptocurrency had continued its bullish run at that point, the analyst takes this as a hint that the bearish divergence is lagging and only appeared due to Donald Trump’s tariff announcement last week. “No actionable value here,” Doctor Profit said. Things To Watch Out For So far, Doctor Profit attributes the drawdown in the Bitcoin price to “standard cycle behavior.” This includes profit-taking from short-term holders who bought in the last six months, while long-term holders remain unmoved. Another bullish factor includes the fact that BlackRock’s outflows remain low despite Trump’s renewed tariff war. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still Bullish, But $200,000 Off The Table And $137,000 In Sight Formations on the Bitcoin price chart that show bullish tendencies include a Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart that puts the breakout zone between $113,000 and $115,000. Also, the Bitcoin price has been recording higher highs and higher lows after recording its bottom at $74,000, which shows trend support remains strong. The Bitcoin price is also trading above all major moving averages (MAs), including the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages. Last but not least, Doctor Profit also pointed out that the MACD line has crossed above the signal line on the weekly chart. This means that momentum remains in favor of the bulls. Given this, the analyst believes “there is no reason to be scared at all.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-to-104000/,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|analyst|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news",cryptocompare

On June 2, the company revealed plans to launch an initial public offering (IPO) for 2.5 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock. This isn’t just standard corporate financing; the stated purpose directly ties back to Strategy’s core identity in the crypto space: funding additional Bitcoin purchases. This announcement immediately captured the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike, highlighting the company’s continued commitment to its unique corporate Bitcoin strategy . What Exactly is Strategy Planning with These Preferred Shares ? Let’s break down the technical details. Strategy intends to offer 2.5 million shares of a specific type of stock. This isn’t the common stock you’d typically trade on the open market. It’s classified as 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock. What does that mean for potential investors and for Strategy? Preferred Stock: This type of stock has certain advantages over common stock, often including priority in receiving dividends and assets in the event of liquidation. However, preferred shareholders typically don’t have voting rights. 10.00% Series A: This indicates a specific class of preferred stock, likely with a fixed dividend rate of 10.00% per annum based on its liquidation preference (the value at which it would be redeemed). Perpetual: This suggests the stock does not have a maturity date; the company is not obligated to buy it back at a specific time, although it may have call options (the right to redeem it). Stride: This term might refer to specific features or terms outlined in the stock’s prospectus, unique to this particular series issued by Strategy. The offering is structured as an IPO, meaning it’s the first time this specific class of preferred shares is being offered to the public. This allows Strategy to raise a substantial amount of capital directly from investors interested in this specific financial instrument. Why is Strategy Doubling Down on its Corporate Bitcoin Strategy ? For years, Strategy , under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has been one of the most prominent corporate advocates for Bitcoin. Their strategy is straightforward: accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible and hold it as a primary treasury reserve asset. They view BTC as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies, offering a hedge against inflation and a potential for significant long-term appreciation. This latest offering is a clear signal that their conviction hasn’t wavered. Despite market volatility, Strategy continues to find ways to leverage its financial structure to increase its BTC holdings. Their existing substantial holdings are a testament to this strategy, and this new funding initiative aims to add even more digital gold to their balance sheet. It reinforces their position as a leading example of a company fully embracing a corporate Bitcoin strategy on a large scale. The Mechanics: How Does This Funding Work for BTC Acquisition ? According to the press release, the net proceeds from the offering will be used for “general corporate purposes.” While this is a broad term, the release specifically highlights two key areas: Bitcoin Acquisitions: This is the most exciting part for the crypto community. A significant portion of the funds raised will be directly allocated to purchasing additional Bitcoin on the open market. This increases Strategy’s overall exposure to the digital asset and further solidifies its position as a major corporate whale. Working Capital: Funds will also be used for general working capital needs. This is standard for any company, covering operational expenses, potential investments in their core business intelligence software, and other day-to-day costs. However, the explicit mention of BTC acquisitions alongside working capital leaves little doubt about the primary driver behind this financing round. By issuing preferred shares, Strategy can raise capital without diluting the voting power of its common shareholders. This financing method provides a stream of funding specifically intended to fuel their ongoing BTC acquisition efforts, demonstrating a creative approach to treasury management in the digital age. What Does Strategy’s Move Mean for the Bitcoin Market? Strategy is already one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. When they announce plans to buy more, it sends a ripple through the market. Here’s what their continued accumulation could imply: Increased Buying Pressure: Direct purchases by a large entity like Strategy add demand to the market, which can potentially support the price of Bitcoin . Market Sentiment: Strategy’s actions are often seen as a bullish signal by the crypto community. It reinforces the narrative of institutional adoption and confidence in BTC as a long-term asset. Validation of Corporate Strategy: Other companies considering adding BTC to their balance sheets might look to Strategy’s ongoing efforts as a model or validation of the concept. While the exact amount of BTC Strategy will purchase with the proceeds depends on the final amount raised and the market price of Bitcoin at the time of purchase, the intention itself is a notable event for the market. Preferred Shares vs. Common Stock: A Quick Comparison Understanding the difference between the shares being offered and the common stock traded under the ticker MSTR is crucial. Here’s a simplified look: Feature Preferred Stock (Series A Perpetual Stride) Common Stock (MSTR) Ownership Type Senior claim on assets/earnings over common stock Basic ownership stake in the company Dividends Fixed rate (10.00% per annum) with priority payment Variable, declared by the board (Strategy does not currently pay common dividends) Voting Rights Typically none Usually one vote per share Potential for Appreciation Less direct correlation to company’s operational growth; tied to dividend yield and redemption value Directly tied to company’s performance and market perception (including BTC holdings) Risk Profile Lower risk than common stock in liquidation; dividend payments are more predictable (if paid) Higher risk than preferred stock; price is more volatile This offering provides investors with a different way to gain exposure to Strategy, primarily through a fixed-income-like instrument, rather than the direct equity exposure of common stock, which is more volatile and closely tracks the value of Strategy’s underlying assets, including its significant Bitcoin holdings. Key Takeaways and What to Watch Strategy’s plan to issue preferred shares for BTC acquisition is a significant development. Here are some key points and things to keep an eye on: Execution of the Offering: The success and terms of the IPO will determine the exact amount of capital raised. Amount of BTC Purchased: Monitor Strategy’s future announcements regarding their Bitcoin holdings to see how much BTC they acquire with the proceeds. Market Reaction: Observe how the market responds to both the offering itself and Strategy’s subsequent BTC purchases. Future Funding Rounds: Will Strategy continue to use similar financing methods to fund further BTC accumulation? This move highlights Strategy’s aggressive approach to leveraging financial markets to build its Bitcoin treasury, reinforcing its unique position at the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset economy. Concluding Thoughts Strategy’s planned offering of 2.5 million preferred shares is a bold statement of intent. By specifically earmarking proceeds for BTC acquisition , the company is not only reinforcing its long-held corporate Bitcoin strategy but also demonstrating innovative ways for public companies to gain and increase exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. This development is crucial for anyone following Bitcoin ‘s journey towards mainstream and institutional adoption, showcasing how a major player continues to find avenues to grow its digital asset reserves. It’s a clear signal that Strategy remains committed to its vision of Bitcoin as a foundational asset for the future.

2025-06-03T07:40:23,"MicroStrategy Adds Another 705 BTC, Extends Lead as Largest Corporate Holder","MicroStrategy , the enterprise software giant that has turned into a Bitcoin bull, has made a fresh Bitcoin purchase. Last week, it announced that it had bought 705 more BTC, valued at $75.1 million, at an average price of $106,495 per BTC. Company CEO Michael Saylor said that MicroStrategy now holds a total of 580,955 BTC, which are worth about $60.5 billion at today’s prices, making them, by a country mile, the largest corporate Bitcoin holders. MicroStrategy’s BTC strategy has become one of the most financially successful decisions ever taken by a corporation. It now has an unrealized profit of $19.83 billion—a figure that could change at any second, since it’s based on the numbers coming from the Bitcoin network. MicroStrategy( @Strategy ) bought another 705 $BTC ($75.1M) at an average price of $106,495 last week. #Strategy currently holds 580,955 $BTC ($60.5B), with an average buying price of $70,023 and an unrealized profit of $19.83B. https://t.co/tIy3luAAqa pic.twitter.com/DFRv8R87SX — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 2, 2025 Not the Biggest Whale, But the Biggest Corporation Even though it currently holds more Bitcoin than any other public company in the world, MicroStrategy is still not even close to being the top holder of Bitcoin. In fact, the company that has the most Bitcoin in the world is actually a pseudonymous figure who may or may not be a single person: Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto’s original mining wallet holds approximately 1.096 million BTC, worth about $112.2 billion at the current market price of $103,792. That’s nearly double MicroStrategy’s stash. Despite this, MicroStrategy holds the title of the largest publicly traded company with BTC on its balance sheet. Since August 2020, the company has adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset—a move that was both unprecedented and widely scrutinized at the time. Fast-forward nearly five years, and the decision appears visionary. The company’s Bitcoin holdings have appreciated massively, and its stock price has surged over 7x since its initial BTC buy. Although Satoshi is unassailable in terms of sheer BTC possession, MicroStrategy heads up the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. It and a growing number of companies are considering digital assets, like Bitcoin, as part of their treasury strategy. Institutional Buying Gains Momentum MicroStrategy is not the only one wagering substantially on Bitcoin. Per the most recent info from SosoValue and its BTC Treasuries Dashboard, 14 different firms that are publicly listed now hold the crypto asset, and these companies together own 637,000 BTC—worth around $66.1 billion. Of these 14 companies, 10 are U.S.-based, with the other four across the Pacific in Japan—all of which is to say that momentum toward Bitcoin’s institutional adoption appears to be building regionally. Tesla and the Japanese company Metaplanet are notable Bitcoin holders but trail behind MicroStrategy. Yet MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings are not just notable; they’re an astonishing 50 times larger than Tesla’s—not to mention they’re held at a cost BTC price of around $24,000, which is low in the world of corporate-held BTC prices. Nano Labs Ltd, the company with whom Elon Musk’s space travel interests are in touch, holds the highest average cost basis for its BItcoin: $99,500. Blockchain Inc. holds its BItcoin at the lowest average price: $30,405. Every company that has gone public and disclosed purchasing Bitcoin is currently sitting in the green, thanks to the current market price of $103,792. This profitability could well spark additional interest from firms that haven’t already bought in and could lead even more companies to scoop up some Bitcoin, especially as the cryptocurrency keeps proving itself as a long-term value play. 微策略是目前比特币的最大持有者吗？ —— 不是，中本聪才是 Satoshi Nakamoto 公开账户目前持有 109.6 万枚 BTC，总价值 1122 亿美元，而微策略的 BTC 持有量为 58 万枚（602 亿美元），想成为「比特币最大庄家」还得再买近一倍的量哈哈 自 2020 年 8… pic.twitter.com/8verivv2bo — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) June 2, 2025 Market Watches Whale Activity Closely Bitcoin is the sole digital asset that demonstrates consistent institutional faith during this market cycle. Corporate treasury strategies today are concentrated, almost exclusively, on Bitcoin. Profits are impressive; floating profits are through the roof. New entrants into this market are piling into this digital gold. And so analysts have turned their sights not just to the price of Bitcoin but also to the behavior of the Bitcoin whales—first and foremost, the corporate treasurers that have committed to holding this asset in their vaults. For institutional investors, the cost basis of $70,023 per BTC for MicroStrategy is presently regarded as a critical benchmark. It stands as both a financial floor and a psychological threshold. With MicroStrategy, even last week, buying above that average—like with last week’s purchase at $106,495, for example—it sends a powerful message about long-term, steadfast conviction. Market focus on the whale cost basis highlights the powerful influence that big, strategic Bitcoin holders have in molding both sentiment and technical support for the cryptocurrency. These corporate players, often referred to as Plus-edition whales, are handfuls of ELPs—they’re not even in the top 10. Yet, these quasigovernmental types are enough to keep buying. And because they can keep buying, they keep providing a level of price stability that our couldn’t-even-attempt society of Bitcoin retail investors doesn’t provide. Conclusion: MicroStrategy’s Strategy Pays Off Big Bitcoin’s price at the heart of MicroStrategy’s financial strategy, in 2020, is a thank-you note, written in profitable contractually-obliged software, to the half-dozen or so MicroStrategy employees who, back in 2013, connected their employer to the virtually wonk-tastic world of cryptocurrency. Even better, this seems to be a decision that Saylor himself couldn’t have predicted would end up as the most lauded corporate investment since the ill-fated AOL Time Warner merger. Despite the massive, overshadowing profile of Satoshi Nakamoto, MicroStrategy plays an undeniable role in legitimizing Bitcoin as a legitimate corporate asset—and everyone else seems ready to follow its lead.

2025-06-03T07:30:55,"Bitcoin Hashrate Breaks Record Even As Mining Gets Harder Than Ever","On-chain data shows the 7-day average of the Bitcoin Hashrate has just set a new record, despite network difficulty being at an all-time high. Bitcoin Hashrate Has Observed A Sharp Surge Recently The “ Hashrate ” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. The metric is traditionally measured in terms of hashes per second (H/s), but today a much more massive exahashes per second (TH/s) is used instead. When the value of this metric goes up, it means new miners are joining the network and/or old ones are expanding their farms. Such a trend implies the chain is appearing an attractive venture to these validators. On the other hand, the indicator registering a decline suggests some of the miners have decided to disconnect, potentially because they are no longer finding BTC mining profitable. Now, here is a chart from Blockchain.com that shows the trend in the 7-day average of the Bitcoin Hashrate over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate has observed a sharp increase recently, which suggests the miners have added more computing power to the network. The indicator has now hit a value of 942.6 EH/s, which is a new record. This high has come despite a couple of factors going against the miners recently. First, the price has been following a bearish trajectory since its ATH near $112,000. Miners make their income in BTC terms, but their bills are in a fiat currency like the USD, so the converted value of their revenue is what’s relevant to them. Naturally, whenever the price goes up, so does their income, which can incentivize them to upgrade their facilities. So it’s interesting that the uptrend in the metric has continued even with the price decline. That said, this is still just a 7-day average, so it remains to be seen how the trend will develop in the near future. It’s possible that a decline will be reflected with some delay. The other factor that has gone against the miners is the increase in the mining Difficulty , a metric built into the Bitcoin blockchain that controls how hard the miners would find it to mine blocks on the network right now. The Difficulty automatically fluctuates about every two weeks. These adjustments change the metric in such a way so as to neutralize the change in the Hashrate. The feature exists to constrain miner income, making it so that these validators always receive the block reward at a consistent pace. This means that no matter how much computing power Bitcoin miners add, they still earn the same amount. If new miners are joining, it means the competition just got fiercer for the same reward pool and if upgrades are happening, then profit margins just got lower (both would only be when the price remains the same, of course). Given this, spikes in the Difficulty can often price out the miners already just getting by. The latest adjustment, which went through on Friday, caused the indicator to hit a new all-time high. But so far, it seems miners haven’t pulled back on their expansions yet.

While MicroStrategy is drawing attention with its Bitcoin strategy, giant companies are making Solana (SOL) moves one after another. At this point, Canadian investment firm SOL Strategies continues to buy large amounts of Solana, while Nasdaq-listed company Classover also announced its $500 million move to buy Solana. According to the announcement, Classover has signed an agreement with Solana Growth Ventures to issue up to $500 million in senior secured convertible notes to establish Solana’s treasury reserves. The deal reportedly includes initial financing of $11 million, and 80 percent of the net proceeds will be used for SOL acquisitions. Classover CEO Stephanie Luo said: “This agreement represents a significant milestone in the Company’s strategic initiative to establish a Solana-based treasury reserve. “By entering into this agreement, Classover reaffirms its strong commitment to being a leader in blockchain-compatible financial strategy and being among the first public companies to directly integrate SOL into its treasury operations.” Classover previously initiated its SOL reserve strategy by purchasing 6,472 SOLs for approximately $1.05 million. The company’s current $500 million move reflects its long-term strategy for Solana.

The leading cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high of $111,784, as its most recent price chart summarily dismissed any worries about a global trade war, and as the S&P 500 and other traditional equity markets have shown renewed life. One of the most bullish months in recent history for Bitcoin occurred when its price skyrocketed. The renewed confidence among both retail and institutional investors was evident. The risk-on sentiment was back, and those looser macro economic concerns definitely allowed capital to flood back in to risk assets, with Bitcoin enjoying a tip from those broader trends. Bitcoin Gained 11.1% in May May was a bullish month for #Bitcoin , driven by easing concerns over a global trade war and strong performance from the S&P 500. Supported by these favorable conditions, Bitcoin managed to reach a new all-time high of $111,784 during the month. pic.twitter.com/ekNcfgHsHO — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 2, 2025 Even though Bitcoin’s price performance grabbed the headlines, other developments also took place beneath the surface— notable ones that involve the behavior of long-term holders of BTC. In my view, this group of holders—some of whom have had their Bitcoin for a period of three to five years— is a crucial cohort in the near-term assessment of Bitcoin’s supply dynamics and long-term market cycle performance. Long-Term Holders Begin to Shift On-chain analytics often designate the 3–5 year holding cohort as one of Bitcoin’s most strategic investor segments. They certainly act like it. After all, for historical data that we have on this group, the holding cohort just hit an all-time low last reached back in March 2017—on November 9, 2024, to be exact—in terms of a peak supply control level. Still, the holders in question resumed selling in April 2025—when Bitcoin’s price was again rising—that is, they resumed selling portions of their total holdings, which had been reduced in earlier rounds of profit-taking and had, to my mind, earlier looked set to become a set of longer-term HODLers. As of the time of this writing, holders in this group only represent 11.9% of the total Bitcoin supply. 3–5y $BTC holders reached an ATH of 15.7% of supply on Nov 9, 2024 – the highest since Mar 2017. They began selling soon after, paused, then resumed in Apr 2025. Now at 11.9%, their supply share remains well above the ~3% cycle low – still a major overhang. pic.twitter.com/UOu1KevBsE — glassnode (@glassnode) June 2, 2025 Even after this decrease, the level is still well above the roughly 3% lows seen during previous market cycles. This indicates that, while some long-term holders have taken profits, a good number of them still seems to be holding out for higher prices. This group carries a strong influence. They possess nearly 12% of Bitcoin’s total supply, a hefty sum that constitutes a large overhang likely to pressure the market if the holders decide to go in the same direction as the other large-scale sellers. The good news is that these folks seem content to sit on their Bitcoin. Either they’re not inclined to sell en masse, or they have other Bitcoin plans that entail not selling their Bitcoin anytime soon. And that suggests that if they have plans to hold their Bitcoin, it likely bodes well for the future price of Bitcoin. Because if it takes a certain price level to entice these holders to sell, and they haven’t sold yet, then Bitcoin is likely to trend upward until it reaches that certain price level. Reading the Realized Cap HODL Waves To understand this dynamic more deeply, analysts commonly use tools such as Realized Cap HODL Waves to track the held value among different age cohorts of Bitcoin holders. Using these metrics allows us to glean some understanding of when it might be that our long-term investors are entering or exiting the market. Even better, it gives us a view of how their price correlation might be aligning with the recent movements we’ve seen. The most recent activity reduction on the part of holders of 3-5 years indicates what could be an exhausting phase. These holders, having withstood past bear markets and price consolidation events, typically sell into market strength and reap the rewards of several years’ worth of gains and what they perceive to be high valuations. The not-so-recent uptick in the price of Bitcoin may have coaxed a few more of these holders to liquidate and take profits, but the uptick has not brought out a full-scale selling on the part of these holders. Nevertheless, the 11.9% of the total supply that these holders control means they can still influence prices pretty might as well talk about maintaining significant influence over price direction. The coming months will see this segment of the holder base confronted with a choice: stay absolutely immobile in the face of a price uptick, or get bearish. This segment undoubtedly re-owns enough Bitcoin to make either of those choices not too hard to maintain. Market players will keep a close eye on potential macroeconomic policy shift indicators, institutional demand, and on-chain trend data. Although the rally in May was certainly an encouraging sign for bulls, the supply overhang from long-term holders remains a wild card that could inject some volatility into the price of Bitcoin as it seeks to establish a base above $110,000 and push into new all-time high territory.

Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin Strategy Accelerates After Initial Small-Scale Entries The announcement comes just weeks after the firm shared plans to expand its crypto treasury. Since then, it has made several key purchases. These include 227 BTC on May 22 and 580 BTC on March 26. Earlier, the group made smaller acquisitions in November and December 2024. The Bitcoin investment strategy began modestly. In Nov. 2024, the firm bought 15 BTC for $1.08m. The following month, it added 25 BTC. With each round of buying, the group’s average cost basis has steadily increased. This trend reflects a calculated scaling approach aligned with its long-term treasury vision. The most recent purchase of 624 BTC marks its largest single-day acquisition to date. According to the company, the value of its Bitcoin reserves has appreciated significantly since acquisition. As of May 31, the group reported an unrealized gain of $47.88m. Treasury Strategy Tied to Increasing Bitcoin Holdings Per Share This aggressive treasury approach is supported by the firm’s broader financial strategy. Earlier this year, it completed a $9.8m capital raise to strengthen liquidity and scale up operations. The group said the combined moves help reinforce its long-term commitment to Bitcoin as a core treasury asset.

2025-06-03T07:23:43,"Crypto Market Sentiment Wavers as BlackRock ETF Outflows and Stablecoin Declines Raise Red Flags","The cryptocurrency market is indicating a move in sentiment, with some mineral activity in exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock raising eyebrows. For the past week, both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have undergone meaningful changes in fund balances, seemingly the result of large-scale repositioning or some kind of short-term, dial-it-back profit-taking. Between May 27 and June 2, the Ethereum ETF saw its balance decline from 2.47 billion dollars to 2.29 billion dollars, reflecting a moderate withdrawal by investors. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ETF experienced a more significant drop, with holdings falling from 66.51 billion dollars to 63.98 billion dollars. The timing of this movement aligns with the seasonal trading pattern commonly referred to as “Sell in May and go away,” implying that investors may be reducing risk exposure ahead of the historically slower summer trading season. The net inflow for Bitcoin ETFs over the past six weeks had been extremely positive. But on the list of Bitcoin ETFs that experienced the most recent outflows, the one that definitely stood out was the spot Bitcoin ETF. What makes the situation even more interesting is that the outflow from the spot Bitcoin ETF over the past three days was larger than the outflow from the Bitcoin futures ETF over the same period. Like the recent outflow from the spot ETF, the situation isn’t just interesting per se, but it also raises some flags concerning the overall health of demand for the ETFs in question. Ethereum ETFs Buck the Trend While Bitcoin’s recent ETF outflows have been seen, Ethereum continues to attract capital in ETF inflows. Over this same recent time period, Ethereum-based spot ETFs have recorded a net inflow of 286 million dollars. This marks the third consecutive week of positive net flows for these Ethereum ETFs. This is all quite the opposite Bitcoin ETF situation going on. This relentless inflow could be sustained by hope surrounding Ethereum’s development path, new ecosystem prospects, or perception of a near-term price pop. Or it might just indicate that, after Bitcoin, Ethereum is the next digital asset to target for a concentrated portfolio. Panic selling on @BlackRock 's ETFs and Negative stablecoin flow these 3 months? Let's look on data provided by @nansen_ai From 27 May, ETF balance changed from $2.47B to 02 June $2.29B on Ethereum ETF and from $66.51B to $63.98B on Bitcoin ETF (Sell in May and go away?)… pic.twitter.com/WGkjWjuCzM — Kunst1er (@kunst13r) June 2, 2025 Even with Ethereum’s robustness, the overall scenario still looks murky. The changes in ETF balances—most dramatically seen in the plummeting Bitcoin ETF holdings—suggest a segment of the investment community is not feeling great about the short- to medium-term prospects for these assets. It’s not clear if this is happening for the same reasons across the board. Some speculate ETF investors are concerned with possible upcoming regulatory changes. Others think these ETF sell-offs are a response to the much-feared economic “contraction” that’s been weighing on the markets. Stablecoin Flows Show Underlying Weakness A more basic worry stems from the latest movement of stablecoins, which perfectly encapsulates the investor caution theme. According to Nansen, between March 28 and the start of June, exchanges experienced constant negative flow from stablecoins, with a net total outflow of roughly $8.92 billion. Crypto market participants might be withdrawing from the space, as shown by the lack of stablecoin deposits on exchanges. From May 27 to May 30 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $157 million for the week, ending a six-week streak of net inflows. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a weekly net inflow of $286 million, marking their third consecutive week of inflows.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 2, 2025 Stablecoins are a crucial source of liquidity across crypto. When you see them being deposited on exchanges, it’s a pretty clear signal that a lot of market participants are keen to buy up some digital assets. And when you see them flowing back out of the exchanges, it’s a pretty clear signal that a lot of market participants are either done with crypto for now or are keen to buy in at lower prices. The fact that funds continue to flow out of the market adds even more heft to the interpretation that the market is recalibrating. It is now two months since the outflow started. ETFs have also been net sellers of late. Their recent trades have resulted in a picture of a market that is not fully bearish but seems to have shifted away from the exuberance of early 2025. The next few weeks could be a critical time for the market. Investors will be observing to see if Bitcoin ETFs can regain positive inflow momentum, if Ethereum can hold onto its relative strength, and if the flow of stablecoins can reverse. In the meantime, the overall feeling seems to be one of caution as the crypto market reflects and maybe consolidates. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Data Says the Next Big Crypto Rally is Near! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s been almost two weeks since Bitcoin hit an all-time high price. Meanwhile, the crypto market is at an important moment right now, and many traders are wondering what will happen next. Data from Alphractal, a trusted crypto data platform, shows some interesting trends that suggest altcoins could be about to steal the show. Interesting, Bitcoin dominance has just peaked at 64%. In the past, whenever Bitcoin dominance dropped from this level, altcoins had a huge rally, sometimes even 50x. Altcoin Dominance Near Strong Support Alphractal’s data shows that altcoin dominance, which excludes stablecoins like USDT and USDC, has dropped to 28.4%. This is getting close to a very important support area that’s been significant many times in the past. Usually, when altcoin dominance sits around 24% to 25.3%, it’s a sign that altcoins are getting ready to rise again. These levels have always appeared at times when Bitcoin and stablecoins were leading the market and altcoins seemed forgotten. But as soon as altcoin dominance reached this zone, altcoins quickly bounced back and took the spotlight. Now that we’re approaching this support level again, it looks like altcoins could be ready for another big moment. Excluding Ethereum Changes the Picture There’s another chart that removes not only stablecoins but also Ethereum. This chart shows that altcoin dominance (without ETH and stablecoins) is at 18.92%. That’s very close to 18%, which has been a strong support level for years. In the past, when this level was reached, Bitcoin’s dominance often fell, and altcoins started to grow again. This level has held strong even though there are now thousands of new altcoins on the market. Bitcoin Hits 64% – Could Altcoins Be Next to Rise? Bitcoin’s dominance just hit 64%, a level that has stopped it before. Crypto analyst CryptoElites has shared a chart showing that this resistance has always been a tough barrier for Bitcoin. In both 2019 and 2021, Bitcoin’s dominance peaked and then dropped sharply. What followed was a wave of explosive altcoin rallies, with some coins gaining 50x or more. Analyst chart suggests a similar setup is happening now, hinting that the next big altcoin season could be right around the corner. Meanwhile, the altocin index currently sits at 22 , reflecting a long way to go before the altcoin season begins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-is-coming-data-says-the-next-big-crypto-rally-is-near/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","News|Altcoins",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T07:17:24,"Classover Shares Soar 40% on $500M Solana-Based Treasury Plan","Key Takeaways: Classover plans to raise $500M for a Solana-based corporate treasury. Up to 80% of the funds will be allocated to purchasing SOL tokens. Corporate interest in crypto reserves is rising, with firms like VivoPower and Trump Media also entering the space. Shares of Nasdaq-listed educational technology firm Classover Holdings surged nearly 40% on Monday after unveiling a plan to raise up to $500 million for a Solana (SOL)-based corporate treasury. The New York-headquartered company announced it had signed a securities purchase agreement with Solana Growth Ventures LLC, aiming to issue up to $500 million in senior secured convertible notes. An initial $11 million funding is expected soon, pending customary closing conditions. Classover to Allocate 80% of New Funding to Solana Purchases Under the agreement, Classover is required to allocate up to 80% of net proceeds toward purchasing SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain. “This agreement marks a significant milestone in the company’s strategic initiative to build a SOL-based treasury reserve,” said Classover CEO Stephanie Luo. “By entering into this agreement, Classover reaffirms its strong commitment to becoming a leader in blockchain-aligned financial strategy.” The latest deal adds to Classover’s previously announced $400 million equity purchase agreement, bringing its combined potential financing for SOL purchases to $900 million. NASDAQ: KIDZW Update: New Solana Treasury Strategy corporation SOLANA GROWTH VENTURES – currently trading as Classover Completes Initial $SOL Purchase and Enters into New Purchase Agreement to Sell up to $500 Million of Notes to Accelerate SOL Treasury Strategy Ms. Luo, Chief… pic.twitter.com/d2ofFxFnA6 — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) June 3, 2025 Following the announcement, Classover shares jumped 39.85% to close at $3.72 on Monday, though they dipped 1.88% in after-hours trading, according to Yahoo Finance data. The stock remains down 48.19% over the past month and 7.23% year-to-date. Founded in 2020, Classover provides live online education for K-12 students. The company began its SOL treasury initiative last month, positioning the blockchain token as a key asset in its balance sheet. Classover’s move reflects a broader trend of corporate Solana adoption. Firms such as SOL Strategies , DeFi Development Corp., Upexi, and Janover have also begun accumulating SOL, either to complement existing operations or to pivot toward blockchain-focused strategies. Interest in Cryptocurrencies as Reserve Rises Last month, the publicly listed energy company VivoPower revealed that it is investing $121 million in XRP as a strategic reserve, making it the first company in the world with an XRP-focused treasury. The number of public companies holding Bitcoin also continues to grow. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 116 public firms have now added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Recent additions include GameStop and Swedish health tech company H100. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. Last week, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint.

While the Bitcoin dominance has hit 64% since May, it signals a reversal is on the way for altcoins. This period of consolidation has many investors watching closely, not just for Bitcoin’s next move but for signs that altcoin season may be near. According to Altcoin Daily analyst, this is the perfect setup: when Bitcoin stabilizes and dominance shows signs of reversing, altcoins historically begin to take off. In their latest video , the analyst boldly claims that now is “your last chance” to become a crypto millionaire in 2025. The cycle is playing out predictably, and history suggests we’re nearing another explosive move. Altcoin Season Coming: Here Are Top 5 Cryptocurrencies VeChain (VET) Analyst is highly bullish on VeChain due to its real-world use cases and partnerships in logistics and supply chain sectors. He emphasizes that VET remains undervalued and is still flying under the radar for many investors. With continued development and growing enterprise adoption, VET could experience explosive upside when the altcoin market heats up. Solana (SOL) The analyst sees Solana as a top-tier altcoin that is ready to break out. Despite previous setbacks, Solana has shown strong resilience , with growing network activity, NFT traction, and developer engagement. He believes SOL could be one of the best performers in the next altcoin wave. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa stands out for its unique architecture, offering high-speed proof-of-work transactions with rapid confirmation times. Analyst notes that Kaspa’s community is expanding fast, and the tech behind it makes it a compelling play as demand for scalable and decentralized solutions grows. Render (RNDR) With the rise of AI and decentralized computing, Render Network is getting noticed . RNDR allows GPU power to be rented out in a decentralized way. Analyst sees this as a game-changing project, especially as AI and metaverse applications require immense compute resources. Stacks (STX) Stacks is leading the Bitcoin Layer 2 narrative. Analyst highlights its ability to bring smart contracts to Bitcoin, a feature that could unlock massive value. As Bitcoin adoption grows , STX could emerge as a critical layer for building dApps and DeFi on BTC. As Bitcoin steadies, these altcoins could be gearing up for a major breakout. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Robert Kiyosaki says on the social media platform X that he thinks billions of investors will seek refuge in three store-of-value assets in the coming months. According to Kiyosaki, the move will be triggered by his predicted collapse in the US stock and bond markets. “Do not say I didn’t warn anyone. As predicted in my book Rich Dad’s Prophecy (2013), the biggest crash in history is coming. I am afraid that crash time is now and through this summer. Unfortunately, millions, especially my generation of boomers, will be wiped out when the stock and bond markets crash. The good news is that millions who are proactive may become extremely rich… and as you know….I want you to be one of those who become very rich. Over this summer, as stock, bond, and real estate markets crash… billions will rush into gold, silver, and Bitcoin.” Among the three assets mentioned, Kiyosaki believes that silver holds the most potential for upside. The personal finance author believes that silver will shatter its all-time high of nearly $50 this year. “The biggest bargain today is silver. In 2025, silver may 3x. The better news is silver is still 60% under all-time highs… still about $35… while gold and Bitcoin are at or near all-time highs. Tomorrow I am going to my local gold and silver dealer and trading fake money for real silver… no ETFs (exchange-traded funds)… the biggest bargain today. Silver is priced around $35 an ounce, which means almost everyone anywhere in the world….has a chance to grow richer…while millions grow poorer. What are you going to do tomorrow….grow richer or grow poorer? Please choose to get richer. Take care.” At time of writing, silver (XAG) is worth $34.6.

2025-06-03T07:00:38,"Strategy Latest Bitcoin Purchase: 705 BTC Bought For $75 Million","Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the Bitcoin (BTC) proxy firm led by Michael Saylor, has made headlines again with its latest acquisition of the market’s leading cryptocurrency. In a Monday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company revealed that it purchased an additional 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1, bringing its total holdings to 580,955 coins. Strategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Spree This recent acquisition was made at an aggregate cost of $75.1 million, translating to approximately $106,495 per Bitcoin. Overall, Strategy’s Bitcoin investments now amount to around $40.68 billion, averaging about $70,023 for each token. Following the announcement, Strategy’s stock, MSTR, rose 0.9% to $372.72, while the broader market showed mixed results, with the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively. Related Reading: $3 XRP Dream Delayed—No Bull Run Before November, Says Top Analyst Though the latest purchase is significant, it is not among the largest on record for the company, which has typically acquired thousands of Bitcoin in a single transaction. The smallest acquisition to date occurred in March, when MicroStrategy purchased just 130 tokens as the price of BTC remained below $85,000. Strategy’s recent buying spree comes amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties that have affected cryptocurrency prices. Despite Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,8000 last week, the cryptocurrency has retraced nearly 6% from its record. Nevertheless, the company has consistently taken advantage of the cryptocurrency’s price dips, marking its eighth consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases, ignoring any price fluctuation. Arkham Tracks 97% Of Saylor’s Holdings In a social media update on Sunday, Saylor hinted at the impending announcement, and on Monday, he shared details about the latest acquisition, stating that Strategy has achieved a Bitcoin yield of 16.9% year-to-date as of June 1, 2025. However, according to blockchain analysis platform Arkham Intelligence, Strategy’s holdings may be even larger than reported, estimating them at nearly 625,000 BTC, valued at approximately $59.92 billion. This estimate includes 70,816 BTC identified by Arkham, which highlights the significant assets held by the company.

They clarified that 87.5% of Strategy’s reported holdings consist of Bitcoin, with a portion held in Fidelity Digital’s omnibus custody. Previously, the firm identified about 107,000 BTC that were sent to Fidelity deposits, which are not listed under the Strategy entity due to Fidelity’s custody practices. In total, more than 327,000 BTC are held by Saylor’s Bitcoin proxy firm in segregated custody within the Strategy entity, further solidifying the company’s position as a significant player in the cryptocurrency market.

2025-06-03T06:59:48,"South Korea Lenders See Political Transition as Chance to Revamp Crypto Sector","Leading banks in South Korea are urging the incoming administration to revamp financial regulations that limit their role in the virtual asset sector. The call reflects a broader ambition among lenders to compete more effectively with tech firms and gain entry into fast-evolving nonbanking markets. The Korea Federation of Banks revealed Tuesday that it had recently held a strategy meeting with senior leaders from major banks, a local outlet reported. The session resulted in a proposal calling for regulatory changes that would allow traditional financial institutions to participate more directly in the digital asset economy. “Regulatory revisions are necessary to enable banks, backed by their credibility, accessibility and strong consumer protection standards, to enter the virtual asset business,” the federation said. All three major presidential hopefuls in South Korea have endorsed allowing Bitcoin ETFs and institutional crypto investment ahead of the 3 June vote, marking a potential policy shift. #BitcoinETF #Crypto @cryptoquant_com @YonhapNews https://t.co/63NbHMsIfe — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 As South Korea Votes, Banks Eye Regulatory Overhaul Opportunities The timing aligns with South Korea’s presidential transition. Voters cast ballots on Tuesday to elect a new leader after months of political uncertainty and the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. The banking industry sees this leadership change as a chance to push for long-stalled reforms. It is currently unclear when the result will emerge. The crypto market is already undergoing shifts. In May, South Korean authorities introduced new rules to govern digital asset transactions, part of a broader move to prepare for institutional participation in the sector. These regulations, which take effect in June, allow both nonprofit groups and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies. However, they must comply with tighter disclosure standards and meet enhanced listing requirements. Regulatory Clarity Urged As Banks Push To Expand Beyond Traditional Sectors Despite South Korea’s ranking as the world’s third-largest crypto market by trading volume, the country has yet to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework. Around one-third of the population holds digital assets, and crypto-related policies featured prominently in recent campaign pledges, including promises to legalize spot crypto ETFs and regulate stablecoins. Banks are stepping up efforts to position themselves within the space, exploring services such as stablecoin issuance and digital asset trusts. However, they remain constrained by existing rules that block entry into non-financial sectors. In contrast, tech firms face fewer restrictions and can integrate financial services into broader business operations, which banks argue creates a competitive imbalance. To address this, the federation called for broader permissions across sectors like retail, logistics, and ICT. It also urged a shift toward principle-based regulation, allowing more flexibility for both core banking and subsidiary functions. The report criticized vague provisions in the Banking Act that make enforcement unpredictable and called for clearer definitions and time-bound regulatory actions. Banks intend to gather more feedback and present a final set of proposals once the new government is in place. As South Korea looks to stabilize its economy and tech sector, lenders hope to play a stronger role in shaping the country’s financial trajectory.

2025-06-03T06:53:34,"POPCAT, WIF, and MUBARAK surge over 10% — which memecoin looks the most bullish?","Memecoins POPCAT, WIF, and MUBARAK have each posted double-digit gains in the past 24 hours, continuing their bounces from recent pullbacks. Which one of them shows the highest bullish potential? Popcat ( POPCAT ) price is up 15% in the past 24 hours, currently trading around $0.42, with 24-hour trading volume surging over 80% to $70 million. After the steep pullback from $0.60, the price recently bounced from the key support level at around $0.35 and is now continuing this recovery as it tests its 20 EMA, which acts as a dynamic resistance. However, it’s important to note the recent shift in market structure. Before the pullback, POPCAT’s price failed to make a new high higher, forming a lower high. This was followed by the break of the neckline of a double top pattern and then the formation of a lower low at $0.33. How the price reacts to the 20 EMA resistance will be critical in determining whether the recent break in structure signals the start of a broader downtrend or if the pullback was just a liquidity grab at a lower support level. Momentum is neutral, with the RSI at 47. However, it’s pointing upwards and just about to break above its moving average, potentially forming a golden cross – a bullish signal. Source: TradingView You might also like: James Wynn offloads $4.12M HYPE and takes another $100M 40x-leveraged long bet on Bitcoin Dogwifhat ( WIF ) price is up 12%, currently trading at $0.96, with the 24-hour trading volume surging over 80% to $428 million. Similarly to POPCAT, WIF price has recently broken the uptrend structure, forming a lower low at $0.80. However, three days ago, the price strongly rebounded from that level and is now continuing its recovery, having just wicked above the 20 EMA. With the continuation of the bounce from $0.80, the memecoin ‘s price has now reclaimed the previous higher low at around $0.95. If WIF maintains this upward momentum and closes above the 20 EMA, it could signal the resumption of an uptrend. On the momentum side, MACD bearish crossover is still in place. However, histogram is negative but showing decreasing red bars, suggesting bearish momentum is weakening. RSI is 52, recovering from neutral territory, but still way below its moving average.

Since breaking out of its previous range on May 9, MUBARAK price has been consolidating in the $0.04 – $0.07 range. Recently, the price dipped below $0.04, but then bounced and reclaimed the $0.0430 support level. However, volume is still weak, and the price has yet to break above the EMA 20, which is acting as its dynamic resistance. Despite this, bearish momentum is fading, as indicated by the declining MACD histogram and an upward-sloping RSI. A break above the 20 EMA with strong volume would likely confirm bullish momentum and open the path toward a retest of the $0.06 – $0.07 resistance at the top of the range.

While Lee maintained his year-end target for the S&P 500 at 6,600 points, his most notable statements were about Bitcoin. Tom Lee described Bitcoin's current movement as “consolidation” and stated that the market has already reacted to the increase in global liquidity and the expectation of a more dovish FED in 2025. Stating that this situation creates strong support for BTC, Lee said, “Bitcoin is an asset that is sensitive to liquidity. Liquidity is increasing in the world right now and this is an upward signal for Bitcoin.” Lee also made the following striking statement, citing Bitwise’s statistics: “95% of the Bitcoin supply has already been mined. However, 95% of the world's population does not yet own BTC. This creates a huge demand-supply imbalance for the next 10 years.” Related News: Massive XRP Move from Chinese Company - “300 Million Dollar Treasury...” Lee stated that Bitcoin could reach levels of $150,000 to $250,000 this year. Tom Lee thinks that Bitcoin is a more valuable asset compared to gold. The market value of gold is around $23 trillion. If this value is reflected in Bitcoin, Lee calculated that a single Bitcoin could reach $1.2 million, and went further and said: “I think BTC, in the long run, can go up to $2 million or even $3 million. Even higher.” *This is not investment advice.
