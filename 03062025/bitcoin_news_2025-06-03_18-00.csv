2025-06-03T15:54:07,"BlackRock Dumps $561 Million in Bitcoin to Buy Ethereum","The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is again making headlines in the crypto space, and this time for selling Bitcoin to buy Ethereum. Over the past few days, on-chain data has shown BlackRock gradually liquidating portions of its Bitcoin holdings via the Coinbase Prime institutional platform. The trend of BlackRock’s BTC sales picked up on June 2 at 10:56 UTC, when it moved 300 BTC worth $31.3 million to Coinbase. For context, prior to this transaction, the last outflow to Coinbase was three weeks ago.BlackRock went on to offload a total of 5,362 BTC through a series of transactions: multiple 300 BTC batches, one transaction of 212 BTC, and another of 49 BTC. Altogether, the prominent asset manager dumped Bitcoin worth $561 million.Interestingly, while offloading BTC on Coinbase, BlackRock was simultaneously acquiring Ethereum. During this period, the firm withdrew 27,241 ETH from Coinbase, valued at $69.25 million. Snapshot of BlackRock Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions Why Is BlackRock Selling Bitcoin?Notably, the amount of Bitcoin BlackRock sold aligns almost perfectly with the outflow figures recorded by its iShares Bitcoin Trust over the past two days. On Monday, BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF posted a $130.4 million outflow. On Friday, May 30, it recorded a $430.8 million outflow, bringing the two-day total to $561 million.During this same period, the overall U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF market experienced consecutive daily outflows starting last Thursday, totaling a $1.23 billion net drain.These negative trends followed ten consecutive days of positive flows into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs. The shift coincided with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of approximately $112,000 in May before undergoing a retracement.Amid this retrace, investors grew cautious and began offloading their positions, as evidenced by outflows from BlackRock and other ETF managers. Notably, BTC’s price dipped to around $103,000 before rebounding slightly to $106,600 at press time, up 2.5% over the past 24 hours.Despite BlackRock liquidating over half a billion dollars' worth of Bitcoin in two days, its total Bitcoin spot ETF flows since inception remain strong at $48.439 billion. Meanwhile, its entire BTC holdings stand at 661,142 tokens, worth approximately $70 billion.Ethereum ETFs Remain PositiveWhile the Bitcoin spot ETF market has recently seen heavy outflows, Ethereum ETFs have shown a different trend. Ethereum spot ETFs have now maintained 11 consecutive days of positive inflows, led entirely by BlackRock.Yesterday, total Ethereum ETF inflows stood at $78.2 million, with BlackRock contributing $48.4 million and Fidelity adding $29.8 million. All other Ethereum issuers reported zero flows. Historically, inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs have largely come from BlackRock and Fidelity, with occasional contributions from Bitwise and Grayscale.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/03/blackrock-dumps-561-million-in-bitcoin-to-buy-ethereum/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackrock-dumps-561-million-in-bitcoin-to-buy-ethereum,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET","Market|Trending Now|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T15:51:09,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Subdued As Risk-Off Sentiment Takes Hold","Bitcoin (BTC) registered a marginal decline during the ongoing session as it remained pinned under the 20-day SMA. The flagship cryptocurrency has started the new month shrouded in uncertainty, with market watchers unsure where the market will head. BTC had plunged to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and move to its current level of $105,980. Strategy To Raise $250M To Buy More Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s Strategy plans to raise $250 million through an initial public offering of a new class of perpetual preferred stock to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. The company will issue 2.5 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock at $100 per share. Proceeds from the raise will be used to fund future Bitcoin purchases and provide working capital. Perpetual preferred stocks pay fixed dividends indefinitely with no maturity date and typically get priority over common stock in payouts. Strategy released a statement announcing its decision, “Strategy (Nasdaq: MSTR; STRK; STRF) today announced that subject to market and other conditions, it intends to conduct an initial public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), of 2,500,000 shares of Strategy’s 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD). Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital.” The offering gives Strategy a new avenue to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. The company primarily funded Bitcoin acquisitions through common stock and convertible note offerings. Strategy has become the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 580,955 BTC worth over $67.7 billion. The $250 million from its latest offering will allow the firm to purchase 2,351.8 BTC at current prices. 21Shares Announces Share Split For Spot Bitcoin ETF 21Shares has announced a 3-for-1 share split for its flagship ARK 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB. The move aims to make the fund more accessible to retail investors and will take effect at market opening on June 16. The split will triple the number of shares available and reduce the price per share without impacting the fund’s value. ARKB will continue to trade under its current sticker. “21Shares US LLC (21Shares), an affiliate of 21Shares AG, one of the world’s largest issuers of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today announced a 3-for-1 share split for its flagship fund ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). This move is designed to make shares more accessible to a broader base of investors and enhance trading efficiency. The share split is expected to be effective at market open on June 16, 2025.” The fund is a physically backed spot Bitcoin ETF tracking the New York Variant of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CF Bitcoin Reference Data, providing investors with direct access to Bitcoin in a regulated investment environment. Matador Technologies Listed On The Frankfurt Stock Exchange Bitcoin-focused Matador Technologies has announced it will begin trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The listing adds a key European listing to its existing US and Canadian markets. The listing aligns with Matador’s goal of offering round-the-clock trading access to its shares, modeled on Bitcoin’s 24/7 trading schedule. Matador Technologies CEO Deven Soni stated, “This listing completes a key part of our global capital markets strategy. It enables European investors to participate more easily in our growth story.” Matador has branded itself as a Bitcoin ecosystem company focusing on building a Bitcoin-backed treasury and fintech platform. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally up during the ongoing session as it struggles to cross the 20-day SMA. The flagship cryptocurrency faces rejection around the $105,000 level, with subdued price action indicating risk-off sentiment. Markets are jittery thanks to renewed trade tensions between the US and China, geopolitical tensions, and continuous outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Risk-on sentiment took a beating as tensions escalated in the Middle East after Israeli soldiers opened fire on people who strayed from a designated route to a food distribution site. Apart from escalating tensions in the Middle East, the Russia-Ukraine war has also seen an increase in hostilities. Institutional demand has also weakened, with data from SoSoValue highlighting outflows of $267 million from spot Bitcoin ETFs on Monday. While the outflows are relatively lower compared to February, an increase could lead to a substantial decline in BTC’s price. Despite trading in positive territory, markets remain cautious, expecting more geopolitical volatility. According to the Kobeissi Letter, markets are pricing out the Ukraine-Russia peace deal, stating, “This is effectively the market pricing out the Russia-Ukraine peace deal that President Trump has been working on for 3+ months. However, we have yet to receive a single comment from the US or President Trump. Clearly, something is going on behind the scenes. How will the US respond?” BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday (May 23), falling nearly 4% to $107,356. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,103. The price continued to push higher on Monday, registering a marginal increase, but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.03% to $107,834. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Price action remained bearish on Friday as BTC fell 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. BTC fell to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure returned. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903. The current session sees BTC up almost 1%, trading around $106,743, as buyers look to build momentum and push towards $110,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-03T15:47:07,"Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Shifted in Ethereum's Favorite Way! 11-Day Entry Series Recorded! Here Are the Details","On June 2, 2025, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a net outflow of $268 million. This development was recorded as the third consecutive day of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Continue Three-Day Streak of Highs, Ethereum ETFs Continue 11-Day Streak of Highs On the other hand, the picture is moving in the opposite direction for Ethereum spot ETFs. Ethereum ETFs, which recorded a net inflow of $78.17 million on the same day, recorded an inflow for the 11th day in a row. This shows that investors' interest in Ethereum continues and that it has caught a different momentum than Bitcoin. In the crypto market, ETFs play an important role in the buying and selling preferences of institutional investors, especially after receiving approval in the US. While outflows on the Bitcoin side are interpreted as a sign of profit taking or market uncertainty, uninterrupted inflows on the Ethereum side are associated with confidence in the network’s upgrades and potential use cases. This divergence between the two major cryptocurrencies in terms of investor interest could lead to further strategic repositioning in the coming days. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T15:32:59,"Thomas Kralow mastered the art of adaptation and seizing opportunities in every circumstance. Today, he is developing EVEDEX","Having overcome the difficulties of a challenging childhood and a life-changing move to the United States, Thomas Kralow mastered the art of adaptation and seizing opportunities in every circumstance. Today, he is developing EVEDEX , a platform embodying his principles of financial freedom and security, and is also the founder of two funds and one of the largest educational projects in the world. How Thomas Kralow Carved His Path to the Top of the Industry The Beginning of the Journey How His Mother's Resilience and Life Challenges Shaped Thomas Kralow Thomas Kralow was born in Riga, Latvia, and has frequently emphasized in interviews that he grew up in a hard-working family. From his early childhood, his mother had envisioned him moving to the United States to pursue higher education, viewing it as a gateway to a better life. She saw education as the key to success, and Thomas consistently trusted her judgment, following her guidance. For his family, higher education held special significance, especially since, as Thomas recalls, his mother herself had to abandon her university studies due to family hardships. When Thomas was only two years old, his father, influenced by a new religious movement, gave away the family's entire business, cars, and house to the religious organization. Thomas recalls how this decision plunged him and his mother into severe hardship, marking a dramatic shift from comfort to poverty. ""My mother heated baby food using a candle,"" he remembered, describing this period as critical and challenging. Thomas always speaks proudly of his mother and admires her resilience. Growing up, he watched her rebuild their lives, simultaneously fulfilling both parental roles. In interviews, he consistently credits his mother for instilling core life principles in him, most notably a deep understanding of responsibility. Thomas is dedicated to ensuring his family always feels supported and cared for, vowing never to allow another woman in his life to endure similar struggles to what his mother faced. Moving to the USA Thomas explains that his mother, aware of the difficulties of living in Latvia, set a goal for herself: to secure a future for her son in the United States. She believed he would have far better opportunities there, especially if he earned a college degree. She insisted that Thomas apply to law school, convinced that a law degree is always in demand and guarantees a stable income. In Thomas’s view, his mother believed that success could be achieved only through a traditional system, simply because she didn’t know any other ways. For her, a stable profession and a university education seemed like reliable paths to a secure future, and she always tried to pass that belief on to her son. However, looking back now, Thomas admits that this degree never yielded the results he had hoped for and wasn’t a decisive factor in his success. First Earnings to Pay for College in the US One of the reasons Thomas started looking for part-time jobs in the US was the cost of his education. When he enrolled in college, his mother urged him to focus solely on his studies and not to worry about finances. But once he began, it turned out the tuition was far higher than expected, which pushed Thomas to seek additional income. Thomas’s first job was at the campus library, where he made about $600 per month. He recalls that this wasn’t much, and local regulations limited him to a maximum of four hours per shift. After a while, he realized the money wouldn’t cover all of his needs, so he started looking for other opportunities that would offer opportunities to earn a larger income. Thomas explains that to pinpoint new income streams, he used a deductive method, a strategy he still relies on today. The core idea was to analyze the world around him, identify what people needed, and see how his own abilities could meet those needs. He remembered his long-standing passion for cars, which led him to consider that market as a potential source of income. His first deal was selling an old Mazda Protege. This specific dark-green 2001 model was in poor shape: the body was rusty, and the exhaust emitted suspiciously colored smoke. Thomas bought it from a girl in a neighboring town for just $550, even though the market price for such a car was around $2,300–$2,700. Thomas says that fixing up the car cost him about $200. He replaced the head gasket himself, which he picked up for $30 at a local store, and used a spray can of paint to make the exterior look more presentable. To sell the car, Thomas got creative and only showed it to buyers in the evening so the covered-up rust wouldn’t be as noticeable. In the end, he made over $1,000 in profit on that single transaction. That was when he realized that in the US, people are often willing to take a financial loss just to get rid of unwanted items, and there’s profit potential in that. It was his first taste of the concept of margin and its possibilities. Next, Thomas switched to buying and reselling electronics, as well as restoring and selling discarded furniture. To make this work, he bought a yellow van that had once been used by plumbers for $1,500, which allowed him to transport and store items in a small warehouse. This new way of making money earned 18-year-old Thomas between $5,000 and $8,000 per month. Over time, his approach evolved into a system that he says still works to this day: many people are willing to part with items for next to nothing just to avoid the hassle of selling them. Thomas realized he could often find items like old dining sets in a dump and easily sell them for $100–$200. This income helped him to cover his educational expenses. Development in Trading Getting into Trading In his interviews, Thomas mentions that he first tried his hand at trading when he was around 15 or 16, but he soon gave it up because it seemed far too complicated and he had neither proper training nor support. Everything changed when, thanks to his mother, he happened to meet someone who became his mentor. A “Swiss German” named Alf, described by Thomas as “a professional in asset management, retail trading, and futures”. Thomas was astounded by how much Alf was earning, sums that seemed enormous compared to Thomas’s own income at the time, barely enough to afford a one-dollar burger. Alf invited Thomas to come to Switzerland and learn under his guidance. For Thomas, it was a major life decision: accepting this offer meant leaving his life in the US behind, taking a risk, and sacrificing friends, his future, and even his education. Despite all of the risks, he chose to go for it, and that marked the beginning of his journey. On the Importance of the Right Perception of the Industry Thomas often recalls that his mentor painted a picture of apparent simplicity: “Take it slowly, manage your risks, and everything will be fine.” On one hand, this idea gave him confidence, but later Thomas realized that such images create false expectations. He observes that many trading coaches on social media today perpetuate an illusion, portraying trading as easy and guaranteed to be profitable, requiring no special effort. For newcomers, this illusion of simplicity leads to unrealistic expectations and a lack of understanding of the complexities and risks. Thomas believes this activity is quite risky, especially if you’re trading with your savings and have family commitments, amongst others. “Statistically, you’re more likely to scale Mount Everest than to earn a steady income from trading”, Thomas says in one of his interviews, talking about how difficult it is to make money in this field. He suggests imagining reading a book about climbing Everest, but emphasizes that the author is the key factor: someone who simply gives advice, or someone who has actually done the climb themselves. Thomas stresses that this is the difference between mere information and genuine execution, and it explains why many trading courses fail to meet expectations: they offer knowledge (which isn’t always high-quality or current) but don’t provide the practical experience needed. When Thomas first began trading, he had $15,000 to start with. He recalls serious psychological hurdles because that was his entire savings. Still, he had a dream, to reach a million, and that goal drove him to overcome his fears and take risks where necessary. Thomas remembers that even a 10% profit on his $15,000 wasn’t enough to cover basic everyday needs such as bills, food, relationships, and living expenses. With earnings like that, he says, he would have been treading water, unable to move forward or work toward his bigger goal. Thomas explains that he always strictly controlled his risk, never exceeding 1–2% per trade. He stuck to simple rules, setting the risk-to-reward ratio at at least 2:1 or 3:1. Though he had other strategies, he avoided what he calls “foolish trades” carrying, say, 30% risk, because he believed that these types of trades were almost guaranteed to result in losses. These rules helped him to limit his losses but also curbed his profit potential. Thomas acknowledges that some traders get lucky: they manage to turn $15,000 into $200,000 in just two weeks, especially in crypto during a bull market if they happen to jump in at exactly the right time. In cases like that, he notes, fortune simply “smiles on them”. Thomas points out that these success stories create an unrealistic view of trading, overshadowing the reality that genuine success is defined by hard work and learning from mistakes. When he was just starting out, his budget constraints forced him to limit his risk even more carefully. In his first month, he took major losses (nearly $10,000) primarily because he was trading too often. To prevent similar mistakes, Thomas introduced a rule to stop trading after three consecutive losses and began meticulously recording every trade, analyzing not just entry and exit times, but 15 different factors including trends and market conditions. That’s how he noticed that if he was trading against a certain trend on a specific time frame, his odds of losing were much higher. In those scenarios, he stopped trading altogether, thereby reducing his risk. Thomas also discovered that most of his losses happened on Fridays. He explains this by pointing out that Friday felt like a Saturday to him, after working twelve hours a day consecutively. He also set a rule to stop trading if he had more than three stop-outs in one day, because trying to continue after multiple losses usually led to even bigger losses, on average, up to seven losing trades in a single day. Thomas emphasizes that understanding how the “heart of the market” works is crucial, as countless factors can instantly derail even the most carefully planned strategies. Market panic triggers sudden price swings, and, in his words, “you feel like an idiot trying to keep up with it all”. In Thomas’s opinion, rules, insight, and the right perception of trading are key to coping with the market’s ups and downs. That’s exactly what he taught his students at the “University of Trading” and continues to teach in his Game Changer program. Beyond the necessary technical knowledge, he focuses on the psychological side of trading, helping his students to build resilience and manage their emotions amid market uncertainty. Thomas notes that this is the main problem with most trading courses today: they typically focus on creating an illusion of guaranteed success without giving students practical skills or teaching them how to handle the psychological challenges of trading. Reflections The Importance of Social Media In numerous interviews, Thomas is often asked what he would do if he had to start from scratch. His response is that, with his current level of knowledge, he would focus on social media, because in his view, people and the trust they place in you are the most valuable asset in the world. He believes that building an audience and earning trust through social platforms is the best way to launch a business today. Thomas sees people as a resource more valuable than money (or even Bitcoin) because, unlike other assets, people don’t simply disappear. Trust, genuine value, and the energy created within a community are, in his opinion, extraordinarily powerful. Thomas is convinced that if you manage to gather even a thousand dedicated followers, you already have a significant asset. Moreover, if you approach social media growth mindfully and base audience interactions on trust, expanding that audience becomes more natural and less difficult. Thomas is certain that if he had 1.5 million followers on Instagram, he could easily launch almost any business, which, if managed properly, would be both successful and profitable. He emphasizes that his own audience growth was largely organic. While he did invest considerable funds in advertising, he claims it played a secondary role to organic growth. The key factor, according to him, was high-quality content and building trusting relationships with his audience. Thomas credits his wife with encouraging him to realize his potential. At the time they met, she was already working as a blogger. She suggested he start his own venture, perhaps a hedge fund, and manage external capital. She recognized his untapped potential as a social figure, pointing out that he could use a social platform to grow and promote the hedge fund. This conversation, he says, was a crucial turning point in his journey. Thomas recalls replying to his wife, “Where am I going to find clients? I don’t know anyone”, and initially continued trading exclusively with his own funds. In response, she encouraged him to develop his social media presence. Taking her advice to heart, Thomas began putting serious effort into his online platforms. Over time, his work paid off: by the time he launched his own hedge fund, many people already knew who he was and trusted him, making it much easier to attract a significant number of investors. He says people want to invest in other people, not in “some random companies”. The Importance of Choosing the Right Partner In many interviews, Thomas stresses that meeting his wife, Sofia, had a profound impact on his life and personal growth. Thanks to her, he discovered the motivation and inner strength to evolve. He openly admits that at the start of their relationship, he behaved harshly and sometimes unfairly, which he attributes to his past experiences in failed relationships. He says he acted “like a jerk”, but Sofia continued to stand by him despite everything. Thomas recalls how he felt her genuine emotions and unwavering support and acknowledges that “it was something incredibly rare and beautiful”, something he was ready to do anything to hold onto. He’s endlessly grateful to Sofia not only for her role in his personal life, but also for the contributions she made to his professional development. Thomas points out that when choosing a life partner, it’s important to pay attention to her inner qualities, how she makes you feel, and how you feel around her. He remembers how Sofia supported him through the toughest times, staying by his side through his highs, lows, and difficult emotional challenges. On Fiat Money and the Banking System Thomas believes that fiat currencies and the traditional banking system have no future. He notes that Bitcoin tends to rise during every crisis, which he attributes to the public’s distrust of what he calls an outdated financial system. People begin to value truly scarce assets, and in his opinion, Bitcoin is the only asset that qualifies as genuinely scarce. Thomas also believes the global economy is on the brink of a severe recession that could be extremely challenging, one of the reasons he avoids investing in stocks, calling it a bad idea. Thomas advises keeping a close eye on Bitcoin’s movements, noting that it follows global liquidity trends. For example, if the U.S. withdraws liquidity from the market, but Japan and China inject it, the market still sees an influx. He references China, where citizens saved roughly $2.4–$2.6 trillion during lockdowns and can now invest in cryptocurrency again via Hong Kong. In countries hit by inflation and crises, such as Argentina, where interest rates reach 97%, Bitcoin is trading at historic highs with a significant premium. Thomas is sharply critical of fiat currencies, pointing out that none of them are backed by real assets. He calls the U.S. dollar “the biggest scam”, deeming it ironic that people call Bitcoin a scam, given that Bitcoin derives real value from its scarcity. Thomas says he has invested significant amounts in Bitcoin and is aware of the risks: if the cryptocurrency were to lose its value, he would face substantial losses. While he keeps a small portion of his funds in dollars, the majority of his capital is held in non-fiat assets, as he has no faith whatsoever in fiat currencies. Thomas notes that the U.S. dollar is losing ground as major nations (among them BRICS members as well as Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are distancing themselves from the United States. Many countries are beginning to use alternative currencies, recognizing the risks involved in relying on the dollar. For example, Saudi Arabia did not renew its agreement with the U.S. to exclusively sell oil in dollars, indicating a move toward de-dollarization. Moreover, BRICS countries are actively discussing the creation of a unified financial system that could reduce their dependence on the dollar. Thomas is convinced that Bitcoin and blockchain technology will play a huge role in the future of global finance. He adds that Ethereum is bound to become a key part of this transformation as well. Life in Dubai When asked about the advantages of living in Dubai, Thomas explains that he wants to live in a country where his money is truly at his disposal, rather than under the tight control of the banking system. He points to Europe as an example: if you transfer or withdraw more than 10,000 euros, banks ask you to explain how you plan to use the funds. In his view, this indicates a lack of liquidity in the system, stemming from the fact that banks simply don’t have the money and want to avoid a sudden outflow of deposits. He also highlights how Dubai’s economic system differs in that it’s more difficult to get mortgages and refinancing there than in the United States, which he believes makes the system more resilient. Thomas points out that, as of 2021, U.S. banks are allowed to hold 0% reserves, a practice he criticizes for weakening the banking sector. He takes issue with fractional-reserve banking, where a bank takes a customer’s million dollars, “multiplies” it by ten, and issues loans, effectively turning one million into ten million without any real backing. Thomas compares this system to a “biblical-level deception”, arguing that the money in such banks essentially “doesn’t exist”, it’s an artificial financial construct based on partial reserves and lacking true value. Initially, he encountered strict limitations from certain Dubai banks because of his cryptocurrency transactions, but he eventually found banks that handle this more flexibly. Now he can buy a Porsche GT3 RS or expensive watches with crypto, and when he sells large assets, he simply provides proof of sale and deposits the funds into the bank, without further scrutiny. In Europe, he notes, transactions of this nature could trigger serious consequences, up to and including arrest. Thomas believes this system puts financial freedom itself in jeopardy: in Europe and the U.S., both banks and governments monitor every step, from small transfers to very large ones, constraining even the wealthiest people. Thomas says he greatly enjoys living in Dubai because he sees plenty of opportunities for personal and professional growth there, and he feels the city provides a high level of security for his family. He contrasts this with Europe and the U.S., where, according to him, streets can feel far less safe. For instance, Thomas admits he wouldn’t feel comfortable letting his wife walk alone at night in London, whereas in Dubai he’s confident his loved ones are safe and secure. On the EVEDEX Project In his interviews, Thomas often brings up his project named “ EVEDEX ” (previously called Event Horizon), which he views as a crucial part of his growth and professional evolution. To him, this project isn’t just about business; it’s a means of putting his ideas into action and pushing himself to the next level, broadening his influence and sharing his knowledge. He describes EVEDEX as the product of a dedicated team that took the time to carefully analyze current user needs in this space. EVEDEX is a hybrid decentralized platform that combines the benefits of both centralized and decentralized exchanges, offering high levels of security, privacy, and transparency. It provides users with access to professional trading tools and strategies (such as futures contracts, copy trading, and P2P transactions) without requiring any KYC procedures. Thomas emphasizes that EVEDEX aims to offer equal opportunities to all market participants, regardless of their financial resources or geographic location. Thomas also mentions that the EVEDEX team actively engages with its community by hosting educational events, community calls, and AMA sessions with project representatives, partners, and industry experts. For example, through the Early Bird program, users can complete tasks and earn collectible Badges that grant access to the testnet. Additionally, EVEDEX features an educational center where people can learn about trading, cryptocurrencies, affiliate marketing, and more. According to Thomas, EVEDEX energizes him because he sees how important the team’s work is. He has invested millions of dollars in the project, noting that many of his partners have also committed funds. For him, it’s more than just a business, it's an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the crypto market by offering users valuable tools and educational resources. Thomas acknowledges that building a platform like EVEDEX poses a major challenge, especially when going up against large, established players in the market. It’s a demanding path that requires constant improvement and the pursuit of unique solutions. Yet, he says this challenge inspires him and his team to innovate and keep evolving so that they can deliver a product capable of competing at a high level. From a Difficult Start Thomas Kralow’s story is one of persistence, determination, and continuous self-improvement. He was raised in a tough family situation and moved to the United States, where he had to earn money to cover his tuition. That necessity taught him to adapt quickly and spot opportunities that others might overlook. These life lessons led him first to buy and resell cars and electronics, and eventually into the trading world, where he encountered significant hurdles but developed a disciplined, calculated approach. Now an experienced trader and entrepreneur, Thomas is focused on building EVEDEX, a platform tailored to user needs and founded on principles of decentralization and security. His belief in the value of cryptocurrency and blockchain, along with his conviction about the importance of financial freedom, resonates in both his work and his broader outlook on life. Thomas stresses the vital role of trust and community, building his social media presence and staying connected with his audience, an approach that helps him to attract like-minded individuals and investors. For him, EVEDEX isn’t just a business endeavor; it’s a challenge and an opportunity to make a lasting impact by delivering high-quality tools and education that people need to succeed in a rapidly evolving financial landscape.

2025-06-03T15:30:37,"Stablecoins Ignite Record-Breaking May, Supply Jumps To $244B – Data","A surge of stablecoin transactions marked May as a standout month for the crypto sector. It moved beyond mere token swaps. Lots of people and services turned to dollar-pegged coins for moving value. Activity hit fresh highs, hinting that stablecoins are now the main channel for on-chain payments. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Spike In Wallet Activity According to Artemis data, more than 33 million wallets sent or received stablecoins during May. That’s a big jump compared with earlier months. It shows more folks are leaning on these digital dollars than on native tokens. Many traders, DeFi users, and everyday people tapped stablecoins to keep their funds tied to the US dollar. This wave of usage also came as the wider market showed signs of life, with prices slowly rising and confidence climbing. Shift To Faster Networks Based on reports, BNB Smart Chain counted over 10 million active wallets for stablecoin moves early in May. TRON came very close, with a little over 9 million wallets during that same stretch. These two networks are cheap and quick. Folks want to dodge higher fees on older chains. By month’s end, both BNB Smart Chain and TRON could top those numbers again. That trend speaks to growing demand for fast, low-cost payments and DeFi deals. Ethereum simply can’t match these lower fees right now. Stablecoin Supply Growth Stablecoins also saw more tokens enter circulation. The total supply grew to $244 billion, up nearly 3% in just one month. But not all coins minted equally. Tether’s USDT remained the heavyweight champion. It added nearly $4 billion to its total supply in May alone. Most of that new USDT landed on TRON. Today, TRON holds nearly $78 billion in USDT, while Ethereum carries $73 billion. In sum, USDT’s overall supply now tops $153 billion and added tokens almost every day. USDC moved in the opposite direction. Its supply dipped slightly, thanks to outflows on Solana. Still, USDC keeps about $60 billion circulating across all its chains. Related Reading: Pepe Makes It To Trump’s Feed—Is A Crypto Endorsement Next? Payments And Bridges Overtake Cards Stablecoins didn’t just grow in supply and usage. They carried huge volumes of payments. Over the past 30 days, those coins moved over $2 trillion worth of value. That level beats what many debit and credit cards handled in the same span. For example, Visa’s volumes were lower than what stablecoins saw. Plus, USDC’s cross-chain moves spiked. The CCTP bridge saw $7.7 billion flow through it, up 83% month-on-month. That rush of bridging means more people are shuttling dollars between networks for trades, lending, or simple transfers.

2025-06-03T15:22:57,"BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Is the Youngest Top ETF and May Surpass Satoshi in BTC Holdings, Bloomberg Analyst","The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has emerged as the fastest-growing fund by assets, according to a recent disclosure by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Just 1.4 years since its launch, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed $72.4 billion in assets under management, making it the youngest ETF in the top 25 by a margin of over a decade. According to Balchunas, this development positions IBIT as the only fund under 10 years old on the list, and one that is nine times younger than the next-youngest ETF. https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1929872901479539068Notably, IBIT’s rise signals historic investor demand for direct Bitcoin exposure through a regulated ETF wrapper.Historic Asset Growth for a NewcomerAmong the top ETFs by asset size, longstanding funds such as Vanguard’s VOO, SPDR’s SPY, and iShares’ IVV each carry more than $580 billion in assets and have been active for at least 14 years. In stark contrast, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF ranks 23rd in size despite its short existence, with its 1.4-year age making it a significant statistical outlier. Other ETFs, such as VWO and IEMG, are over 12 years old, underscoring the unusual nature of IBIT’s ascent.In his analysis, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described IBIT’s position among the top ETFs as “like an infant hanging out with teenagers and twenty-somethings,” emphasizing the fund’s unusually young age relative to its peers. He added that this is possibly the most amazing stats pulled by IBIT. While older ETFs built scale over decades, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF accumulated assets at an accelerated rate. He also pointed out the role of structural advantages—such as liquidity, cost efficiency, and the trust associated with traditional ETF frameworks—as key drivers behind IBIT’s success in attracting inflows.BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Could Surpass Satoshi Nakamoto as Largest BTC HolderAlongside its asset growth, IBIT has also emerged as a leading custodian of Bitcoin. According to Balchunas, IBIT currently holds 660,842 BTC, ranking it as the second-largest holder globally. Only the balance belonging to Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, exceeds IBIT’s holdings. Estimates suggest Satoshi’s wallets contain approximately 1,123,500 BTC, though some analysts, such as London-based Farside Investors, have questioned the certainty of that figure.Meanwhile, Balchunas emphasized that even conservative estimates still place IBIT on track to become the largest holder of Bitcoin by late 2026. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has purchased around $50 billion worth of Bitcoin since its inception, surpassing major holders like Binance and Strategy, which hold 622,546 BTC and 580,955 BTC respectively.Long-Term ETF Market Impact DiscussedIn a separate development, Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in April predicted that IBIT could eventually overtake Vanguard’s VOO to become the largest ETF globally. At a Bitwise-hosted Bitcoin conference, Saylor outlined a potential path over the next decade where Bitcoin ETFs reshape traditional fund rankings. Balchunas later echoed this possibility, noting that while such an outcome remains speculative, IBIT’s trajectory is significant within the broader ETF industry.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/03/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-is-the-youngest-top-etf-and-may-surpass-satoshi-in-btc-holdings-bloomberg-analyst/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackrock-bitcoin-etf-is-the-youngest-top-etf-and-may-surpass-satoshi-in-btc-holdings-bloomberg-analyst,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB","Market|Bitcoin ETF|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T15:21:43,"Here’s Why Market Flushouts and Whale Moves Could Set the Stage for Bitcoin’s Next Rally","Bitcoin held firm above the $105,000 mark following a weekend dip, as rattled market participants assess whether the pullback signals a temporary breather. Ongoing shifts in sentiment and trader positioning hint at a broader market recalibration quietly unfolding. No Panic, No Euphoria Bitcoin’s derivatives and spot markets are undergoing a structural recalibration. On Binance, long positions continue to be liquidated in significant waves, at times surpassing $40 million per hour, as seen in the Liquidation Delta metric cited by CryptoQuant. These liquidations highlight heavy pressure on long positions, but notably, there is no corresponding surge in short liquidations. This indicates that while many leveraged long traders are being flushed out , there is little evidence of a counter-move or short squeeze. Meanwhile, Binance funding rates remain largely neutral as it hovers around zero, which suggests a lack of extreme directional bias in the perpetual futures market. Traders are neither aggressively betting on upside nor downside, indicating caution rather than fear or greed. “In simpler terms: the derivatives market is not signaling panic, nor euphoria, just cautious recalibration.” Bitcoin Whales Quietly Accumulate Whale behavior paints a more optimistic picture. Data from the Whale Screener shows that over $500 million in combined Bitcoin and Ethereum was withdrawn from spot exchanges on June 2nd. Most notably, crypto exchange Bitfinex recorded a single-day outflow of 20,000 BTC, worth over $1.3 billion at current prices. This represented the largest Bitcoin withdrawal from the exchange since August 2019. Such a significant movement off exchanges often points to long-term holding intentions by large entities, which could ease immediate selling pressure in the market. Together, these signals – neutral funding, liquidation of overleveraged longs, and strategic accumulation by large holders – depicts a market that is clearing excess leverage and preparing for a potential next leg upward. Although short-term volatility remains, the broader trend suggests Bitcoin may be in the early stages of a new bullish phase driven by healthier market structure and long-term investor confidence.

2025-06-03T15:14:11,"Donald Trump Jr Finally Reveals Why His Family Got Into Bitcoin","In a recent interview on CNBC's Squawk Box , Donald Trump Jr. shared that his family turned to Bitcoin and crypto out of necessity. Speaking with co-hosts Joe Kernen and Andrew Ross Sorkin, he presented why the Trumps got into crypto and what pushed them in that direction, insisting that it was not an attempt to chase the prevalent trend.Kernen asked Trump Jr. about the headlines tying Bitcoin to the Trump brand and the broader MAGA movement. He questioned whether it was appropriate for President Donald Trump to have a meme coin tied to his name.The Trump's Entered Bitcoin and Crypto Out of NecessityIn response, Trump Jr. explained that their turn to crypto started after his family entered politics. Before that, banks in New York returned his calls and approved loans for real estate projects without hesitation. https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1929895962408861834However, once his father became president, those same institutions stopped answering. The Trumps found themselves shut out of the banking scene . According to him, the financial system turned on them overnight, and they couldn't get basic financing even with solid business records and assets.He said that was when he and his brother realized something important: the system was not built to be fair. Before politics, they had access to everything because of their name and resources. Afterward, they experienced the kind of financial roadblocks that everyday Americans face all the time. This opened their eyes. Notably, they saw crypto as a way to work around a system that suddenly turned against them.Blockchain Has Some Real BenefitsSpeaking further, he added that blockchain technology also has real advantages. As a real estate developer, he questioned why basic processes like title insurance still cost so much and take so long. He saw clear ways crypto could make those transactions faster and cheaper. For him, the decision wasn't about jumping on a trend, it was about survival and innovation. He described it as a necessary pivot after getting locked out of traditional finance.Sorkin then asked whether the Trump-linked meme coin could let foreign or domestic actors secretly send money to those in power. Responding, Trump Jr. distanced himself from the coin, saying he wasn't part of that project and instead focused on more serious areas like stablecoins and Bitcoin mining.Trump Jr: TRUMP Meme Coin a ""Proof of Concept""Still, he defended the meme coin as a ""proof of concept,"" arguing it shows how the crypto world recognizes that traditional finance doesn't treat everyone equally.Interestingly, Kernen compared the meme coin controversy to past scandals involving Hunter Biden's art and the Clinton Foundation. He suggested that, like those cases, the meme coin could open the door to influence buying. Trump Jr. acknowledged those concerns but pointed out the anonymous nature of crypto makes it hard to link transactions directly to political power. He said the coin proves how quickly the public is losing trust in traditional systems.When asked about criticisms from crypto insiders, Trump Jr. insisted that no one he spoke to had voiced any concerns. Instead, many thanked him for helping bring attention and credibility to the space. He said crypto attracts a wide range of people, including libertarians, conservatives, and those simply looking for more financial freedom, and that the support hasn't come from just one side of the political aisle.To wrap up, Sorkin asked if crypto could one day threaten the U.S. dollar. Trump Jr. said he believes the opposite. He pointed out that stablecoins like USD1 actually support the dollar's dominance. He explained that these coins now buy more Treasuries than many foreign governments do, helping maintain U.S. borrowing power. In his view, stablecoins might end up being the key to keeping the dollar strong in the long run.The Trump Family's Involvement in CryptoNotably, the Trump family has made major moves in crypto. In Q4 2024, World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform inspired by Trump Sr., launched, raising $550 million through token sales. In mid-January 2025, just before the inauguration, Donald Trump launched the TRUMP meme coin while Melania Trump launched MELANIA . Reports say Trump-affiliated groups hold 80% of both coins. At the end of March, Trump Jr. and Eric Trump revealed they had taken a minority stake in American Bitcoin, a mining company created with Hut 8. Also, WLFI introduced the USD1 stablecoin , backed by a $2 billion investment from an Abu Dhabi firm through Binance. Then last month, Trump Media and Technology Group announced a $2.5 billion plan to build a Bitcoin treasury.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/03/donald-trump-jr-finally-reveals-why-his-family-got-into-bitcoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=donald-trump-jr-finally-reveals-why-his-family-got-into-bitcoin,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TOKEN SALE","Market|Trending Now|Latest Donald Trump News",cryptocompare

The rise has been bolstered by substantial inflows of ETFs, marking the largest weekly inflow of 2025. This suggests the institutional interest is fueling the bullish momentum. On the other hand, the US SEC has recently approved staking programs for Ethereum, enhancing investors’ confidence and contributing to increased demand. Besides, the ETH price is heading towards a breakout zone of a bullish pattern, suggesting a potential reversal and signalling positive market sentiment. Meanwhile, the drop in the ETH reserves in the CEXs points towards self-custody and accumulation. The key resistance was breached at $2550 with nearly 288K in trading volume, due to which the overall trend remains bullish as higher lows continue to hold. Meanwhile, the token has formed a bullish morning star pattern in the monthly charts, pointing towards a long-term reversal to the upside. On the other hand, the Open Interest and volume are both rising, substantiating the bullish claim. What’s next? When will the ETH price breakout from the accumulation and reach $3000? The daily chart shows the price accumulating within a bullish, ascending triangle while the range between $2691 and $2712 is acting as a strong resistance zone. Meanwhile, the CMF has rebounded after testing the average range at 0, hinting towards a significant influx of liquidity that may help the price to remain elevated. Besides, the MACD displays a drop in the selling pressure, which may further promote a bullish crossover. This could help the price rise beyond the pattern that may further validate the beginning of a fresh bullish trend. Therefore, until the Ethereum price remains above $2550, the bullish structure could continue to prevail, with the upper target between $2700 and $3000 being the key resistance. However, a confirmation at $2800 could be pivotal as a downside risk arises if the support is broken. On the other hand, ETH/BTC is also showing signs of reversal, implying possible Ethereum outperformance vs. Bitcoin and a broader altseason.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/money-flooding-into-ethereum-is-the-momentum-building-for-the-eth-price-rally-to-4000/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

This brings the number of BTC ATM installations from 1,385 on January 1, 2025 to 1,821 as of June 3 as per data from CoinATMradar . The statistics solidify Australia’s position as the third-largest crypto ATM market in the world, behind only the United States and Canada. BTC ATM installations growth in Australia. Source: CoinATMRadar.com Crypto ATM regulations in Australia There’s been a lot of drama surrounding cryptocurrency ATMs in Australia, as scams using the machines have resulted in losses amounting to AU$3.1 million (~US$2 million) over a 12-month period. Today, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) introduced new rules to prevent crypto ATM misuse, including a new AU$5,000 (~US$3,250) limit on cash transactions. While the limits apply directly to ATM operators, AUSTRAC implores digital currency exchanges to follow suit, especially if they also accept physical cash. With around 150,000 transactions annually, crypto ATMs are clearly the preferred entry point for many residents, particularly those aged 60 to 70 (i.e., those most vulnerable to scams), according to AUSTRAC. Still, the Australian Bitcoin ATM market continues to grow, as evidenced by the expanding ATM infrastructure. The primary challenge for the regulatory bodies will lie in ensuring that growth continues in a safe environment.

Ethereum’s recent surge hints at a broader altcoin rotation gaining momentum. Market data shows rising altcoin interest as Bitcoin gains modestly stall. Altcoins have spent a good part of 2025 playing catch-up, often trailing both Bitcoin (BTC) and major stablecoins. With Bitcoin’s dominance recently surging to 64%, it’s certainly raised some concerns across the broader crypto market. Now, however, new analysis points to a shift developing. Data from Alphractal indicates that recent patterns in market indicators point towards a possible turning point. If history is any guide, current conditions could be setting the stage for a new altcoin rally. With Bitcoin showing only modest gains and Ethereum beginning to rise sharply, conditions appear ripe for a broader altcoin surge. These signals, while not guarantees, have previously coincided with strong altcoin momentum . Consequently, investors are watching closely for signs of a full-fledged Altcoin Season.

2025-06-03T14:34:42,"Cardano to $1.50, XRP to $3, Bitcoin to $110K if June ETF Buzz Holds Up","Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing with excitement as key players like Cardano , XRP , and Bitcoin show signs of promising gains . Predictions suggest impressive price surges—Cardano aiming for $1.50, XRP seeking $3, and Bitcoin potentially hitting $110K. Looking into the factors that could drive these coins higher, this article delves into the latest market dynamics and trends. Cardano Price Insights: Analyzing Recent Performance and Current Levels Cardano experienced a slight decline of about 0.43% over the past month, reflecting minimal fluctuations in short-term price actions. However, the last six months showed a more significant drop of nearly 41.46%, indicating a sustained bearish trend. Price movements during this period demonstrated limited recovery, with market sentiment remaining cautious amidst wider negative trends. The contrast between the monthly and half-year performances reveals underlying vulnerabilities in market confidence that have become apparent over time. Current prices are trading between a low of $0.597 and a high of $0.819, with nearest resistance at $0.95 and a secondary point at $1.17. Downside support is noted at $0.51, with an additional cushion at $0.29. With bears dominating based on indicators like the Awesome Oscillator at -0.055 and an RSI of 42.09, the outlook appears negative. Traders should watch for potential buying opportunities if prices rally above $0.95. Conversely, a drop below $0.51 could indicate further bearish momentum, warranting close attention to shifts within these levels. XRP Price Patterns: Modest Gains Amid Long-Term Decline XRP experienced a modest increase of 0.75% in the last month while facing a 6.67% drop over the past six months. Price oscillated within a $1.95 to $2.53 range, reflecting a brief recovery despite ongoing downward pressure. Recent behavior shows that short-term gains are overshadowed by longer-term trends that remain negative. Trading activity highlights mixed signals, with temporary stabilization often yielding to broader weakness. Indicators suggest potential for short-term rebounds, but sustained factors continue to suggest a bearish outlook. XRP currently trades within a range of roughly $1.95 to $2.53, with important levels for traders. Resistance is near $2.88, and support holds at about $1.73. Additional resistance around $3.45 and secondary support near $1.15 may influence price actions. Indicators show slight downward momentum; the Awesome Oscillator at -0.133 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.125 indicate seller impact. The RSI at 43.52 suggests a lack of overbought conditions, yet bears maintain a visible advantage. The absence of a clear trend means oscillation around key levels is likely. Traders might consider short-term trades near support while being cautious of resistance levels, where selling pressure could rise. Bitcoin Price Trends and Current Market Dynamics Bitcoin experienced a rise of nearly 10% over the past month while displaying a 7% growth over the last six months. A slight dip over the past week indicates minor short-term weakness amid the overall upward movement. Price fluctuations during this period highlight a balance between gradual gains and intermittent pullbacks. Previous trading sessions saw improvement in price levels that suggest growing buyer interest despite occasional downturns, making the historical trend one of cautious recovery and steady advancement. The current price holds between $95,000 and $113,000, with key support at about $85,000 and resistance near $122,000. A secondary support around $66,000 and additional resistance close to $140,000 provide crucial zones to monitor. The market sentiment shows bulls and bears in near equilibrium with no strong directional trend. Traders can consider entering positions near the support if the price dips or setting stops around the resistance if buyers push higher, allowing for strategic, risk-managed trades. Conclusion If the excitement around the June ETF persists, ADA might reach $1.50, XRP could hit $3, and BTC might climb to $110K. The outcomes depend heavily on the ETF's impact. Investors are closely watching how these predictions unfold in the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-03T14:32:16,"Riot Platforms Boosts Bitcoin Output to 514 BTC as Hashrate and Expansion Plans Ramp Higher","Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) reported on Tuesday strong production growth in May, mining 514 BTC — an 11% increase from April and a 139% jump compared to the year-ago level. The company sold nearly all the new bitcoin, generating $51.3 million in proceeds at an average price of $102,591 per token. Riot’s hashrate also climbed, with total deployed computing power reaching 35.4 exahashes per second, a 5% increase over April and 142% higher than the previous year. Operating efficiency improved as well, with the fleet running at 21.2 joules per terahash — down from 28 J/TH last May. Beyond mining, Riot is positioning itself for growth in the AI and high-performance computing (HPC) sectors. In May, the company closed the acquisition of 355 acres of land near its Corsicana facility in Texas. CEO Jason Les said the site will support the development of data centers tailored for enterprise and hyperscale clients, noting that these centers require significantly larger footprints than traditional mining operations. To lead this effort, Riot hired industry veteran Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer. The move signals Riot’s ambition to diversify beyond bitcoin and into the fast-growing market for AI-ready infrastructure.

In an interview with Barron’s, Moynihan says four reasons contribute to the exceptionalism of the US as a place to invest and do business. “What’s fundamentally strong about the United States is the rule of law. The ability to have a flexible workforce, the ability to bring people into the country, even under different sets of rules over time. But the ability to have innovation… from research all the way through the process into commercialization at a level no one else has. And that capital markets’ capability, that innovation from pure science all the way through to the commercialization of it. Those are things America’s had. And then the other thing that makes America important is the final demand. [At] the end of the day, the biggest economy in the world, two-thirds of it driven by consumer activity. That is a place that if I’m selling consumer goods of any kind in the world, or machines to make consumer goods or whatever, I’ve got to think about the United States as a market. Because even though other places have more population, the size of spending and the GDP per capita are not close.” According to the Bank of America CEO, sentiment on the US could change over the short term, but the fundamental advantages the world’s largest economy enjoys will persist. “I think there will be ebbs and flows in the views of what to do for the next six months, year, two years. But across long periods of time, America’s the best place to invest.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Tensions escalated over the weekend after President Trump accused China of violating the Geneva Trade Pact, a charge the Asian giant rejected and accused the US of discriminatory and restrictive trade policies, highlighting the country’s decision to limit AI chip exports. While markets were rattled, crypto traded in positive territory, with Bitcoin (BTC) reclaiming $105,000 and moving to its current level around $105,411. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has rebounded strongly to cross $2,600. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up over 4%, trading at around $2,605. Ripple (XRP) is up over 1%, while Solana (SOL) is up over 2% and on the verge of reclaiming $160. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. Robinhood Completes Bitstamp Acquisition Robinhood has completed the acquisition of Luxembourg-based crypto exchange Bitstamp. The acquisition allows the company to add over 50 licenses and registrations and an established institutional client base to its crypto arm. Robinhood acquired Bitstamp in a $200 million deal, agreed upon in June 2024, and was completed entirely in cash. Bitstamp has over 50,000 retail customers and 5,000 institutional clients, with most of its trading driven by its institutional base. The acquisition allows Robinhood to expand its crypto footprint beyond the US and into the European, UK, and Asian markets. Bitstamp reported $95 million in revenue for the last 12 months, while Robinhood made $252 million in the first quarter of 2025. The exchange posted about the acquisition on X, stating, “Bitstamp is now part of @RobinhoodApp. Together, we’re combining 14 years of trusted crypto expertise with Robinhood’s global vision - expanding access and building the future of crypto together.” Robinhood is expanding its global footprint through acquisitions. On May 13, the company agreed to acquire Canadian crypto firm WonderFi for $179 million. The move was part of Robinhood’s strategy to expand its presence in the Canadian market. Robinhood general manager Johann Kerbat said the firm has not ruled out future acquisitions. “If we can find a way to accelerate by at least 18 months or two years — and we have a lot of great reason to believe this is a great acquisition — it’s something that we’ll definitely look at.” FalconX Acquires Majority Stake In Monarq Crypto broker FalconX has acquired a majority stake in Monarq Asset Management’s parent company. According to reports, the move helps expand FalconX’s institutional client base and asset management services. Monarq Asset Management is a Cayman Islands-registered fund. FalconX has moved to expand its footprint in recent months, completing the acquisition of derivatives startup Arbelos Markets and announcing a partnership with Standard Chartered to scale institutional crypto banking. FalconX’s acquisition of Monarq expands its institutional client base beyond hedge funds, firms, and asset managers, allowing it to scale quantitative models and grow the firm’s team. FalconX claims to be the world’s largest digital asset prime brokerage, executing $1.5 trillion worth of trading with access to 94% of global digital asset liquidity. The company had settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for $1.8 million in penalties and disgorgement for failing to register with the agency. Australia Rolls Out New Crypto ATM Rules Australia’s national financial intelligence agency has rolled out new operating roles and transaction limits for crypto ATMs, citing growing scams. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) has enforced a 5,000 Australian Dollar ($3,250) limit on cash deposits and withdrawals on crypto ATMs, scam warning signs, robust transaction monitoring, and enhanced customer due diligence obligations. Currently, the limits only apply to crypto ATM providers. However, AUSTRAC also wants crypto exchanges in Australia to consider imposing limits if they accept cash for crypto transactions. However, AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas has said the new rules are not binding and will remain under review, allowing them to be adjusted when needed. “The conditions are designed to help protect individuals from scams by deterring criminals from directing them to a crypto ATM, as well as to protect businesses from criminal exploitation. In light of the risks and harms, we consider it necessary to ensure the sector meets minimum standards and reduces the criminal misuse of crypto ATMs.” The crackdown began after an AUSTRAC task force investigated data from nine crypto ATM providers and found that most users were over 50 years of age, accounting for 72% of transactions. Dow Rises Despite Renewed Trade Tensions US stocks ended Monday on a high despite rising trade tensions between the US, China, and the EU. The Nasdaq Composite registered an increase of 0.7%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.4%. On the other hand, the Dow Jones could only register a marginal gain of 0.1%. The increase came after China pushed back against President Trump’s accusation that it had violated the trade terms struck earlier this year. China hit back, accusing the US of escalating tensions by tightening export controls on AI chips and restricting visas for Chinese students and nationals. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will resume talks soon. EU officials were also critical of the US over plans to double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% from Wednesday and warned of retaliatory duties. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) sluggish price action continued as it struggled to cross the 20-day SMA. The flagship cryptocurrency dipped below $105,000 on Monday as it started the week facing selling pressure and volatility, giving up early gains and registering only a marginal increase. Despite increased trade tensions and an unfavorable macroeconomic environment, BTC remained close to its all-time high. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a notable decline last week after reaching a new all-time high on May 22, plunging below key levels and moving averages. Despite recovering over the weekend, BTC has remained sluggish as it faces renewed selling pressure around $105,000, a level it has struggled to cross in recent sessions. Despite trading in positive territory, markets remain cautious, expecting more geopolitical volatility. According to the Kobeissi Letter, markets are pricing out the Ukraine-Russia peace deal, stating, “This is effectively the market pricing out the Russia-Ukraine peace deal that President Trump has been working on for 3+ months. However, we have yet to receive a single comment from the US or President Trump. Clearly, something is going on behind the scenes. How will the US respond?” An independent analyst echoed similar concerns, stating, “Markets look like they are struggling to me, with gold looking strong & tensions with Russia escalating lead me to suspect selling today on the cards & for the start of June.” The analyst predicted that if markets find momentum, BTC would probably outperform other assets, adding that sentiment around the asset remains bullish. Most analysts agree that BTC will trade sideways for the foreseeable future. Analysts for QCP Capital stated in a note to traders, “Despite the volatility, BTC continues to hover above $102k, a testament to underlying support. Volatility on the frontend has steadily compressed, and risk reversals have begun to normalize across tenors. This signals expectations for muted price action in the near term.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday (May 23), dropping nearly 4% to $107,356. Despite the substantial drop, the price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,103. BTC continued to push higher on Monday, registering a marginal increase, but was back in the red on Tuesday, falling 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.03% and settled at $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Source: TradingView Selling pressure persisted on Friday as the price fell 1.51%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. BTC fell to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure returned. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903. The current session sees the price down nearly 1%, as BTC struggles to build momentum and push above the 20-day SMA. A break above this level could see BTC retest $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is looking to rebound after dipping below $2,500 on Saturday, with the price on an upward trajectory over the past few sessions. ETH’s recovery comes amid significant upheaval behind the scenes at the Ethereum Foundation. The foundation announced a restructuring of its Research and Development (R&D) efforts. Under the new structure, all R&D teams will operate under a new branded “Protocol” division focused on scaling the Ethereum base layer, improving roll-up capacity, and streamlining the user experience. The reorganization also includes strategic layoffs. The move comes after stinging criticism from developers and users after Ethereum’s slow progress and fragmented roadmap. ETH’s price action seems to be aligning with the Ethereum Foundation's newfound strategic clarity. According to analysts, ETH is forming a bull pennant pattern, often seen before strong price jumps.
