2025-06-03T11:56:26,"Bitcoin Still Bullish Despite Dump: BTC Bull Token to Explode in 2025?","Bitcoin rose 50% in 45 days from April into May, before reaching a new all-time-high just shy of $112K. Since then, it’s fallen 6% , sitting now right at $105K. Was the ATH a rare surge, and have Bitcoin’s fundamentals returned to something more pessimistic? Or is this a temporary pullback with strong support underneath? Evidence points more to the latter, especially with news that Bitcoin miners in Nigeria are addressing one of the longest-standing objections to crypto. And that could set Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin meme coin BTC Bull token, up for big moves in the weeks to come. Bitcoin Goes Green in Nigeria, Answers Longstanding Criticism Nigerian startup Green Flare aims to take environmentally-damaging natural gas flares (burn-offs) and turn them into Bitcoin . Specifically, they’ll use the energy generated by burning off the natural gas to power large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. Once the three-stage project is completed, it will generate 53MW of energy for Bitcoin mining rigs. Burning off gas from oil production is a leading producer of greenhouse gases, including methane. And Nigeria ranks in the top 10 for gas flaring emissions , accounting for 75% of global flaring, according to World Bank’s 2023 data. At the same time, producing Bitcoin required so much energy that, in 2023, total global Bitcoin mining operations would have ranked 27th in the world in energy consumption . According to the same UN report, 66% of the energy used to mine Bitcoin came from fossil fuels. In light of this data, Green Flare’s plan makes perfect sense. Offsetting Bitcoin’s emissions footprint by capturing and using energy that would otherwise have been wasted? A great plan, if we’ve ever seen one Two of the three sites should be live by Q4 of 2025. The investment shows the increasing maturity of the crypto and Bitcoin economies. Despite Pullback, Bitcoin Remains ‘Structurally Strong’ According to the experts at Bitfinex, Bitcoin is undergoing its first meaningful correction since the April lows, cooling off after a relentless 50 percent surge that took the asset from $74,501 to a new All-Time High of $111,880. The current pullback reflects a change in tempo, following nearly 50 days of uninterrupted upside marked by minimal retracements. — Bitfinex, Bitfinex Alpha The pullback is more than a technical correction; the ‘TACO’ phenomenon – for ‘Trump Always Chickens Out – continues to keep tariffs and the trade economy in a state of uncertainty and volatility. That impacts Bitcoin directly and indirectly. More disposable income encourages retail traders, while higher Treasury rates often cause risk-adverse investors to shift towards T-bills and away from Bitcoin. But despite the external and internal factors leading to the correction, Bitfinex reports: We believe Bitcoin remains structurally strong. This correction appears to be a healthy reset rather than a breakdown —Bitfinex, Bitfinex Alpha Trump’s TACO moves might be a sign of instability, or galaxy-brained chess moves; either way, Bitcoin looks strong beneath the surface, and poised for future growth. When it does head back up, will it take BTC Bull Token with it? BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – First-Ever Bitcoin Meme Coin with $BTC Airdrop BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) comes loaded with features designed to keep Bitcoin and its bullish buddy moving in tandem up the crypto charts: Regular token burns to incentivise $BTCBULL price increase (at $125K, $175K, and $225K) Token airdrops – including $BTC airdrops – to rewards project participants 14-day ‘cooling-off’ period during the presale when investors can return tokens (think of it as a ‘money-back guarantee’) It’s all designed to encourage participation in one of the most innovative crypto presales currently available. Buy $BTCBULL , hold it on the Best Wallet app , and you’ll be eligible to earn free $BTC when Bitcoin’s price reaches $150K and $200K. The team also says there might be a tiered airdrop event with optional participation in social media tasks once the presale ends. BTC Bull Token provides four ways to earn: Presale $BTCBULL staking (61%) $BTCBULL price increase post-launch $BTC airdrop for token holders in the Best Wallet app $BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K Investors keen to capitalize on $BTCBULL’s meme coin momentum can track the token’s price upward as Bitcoin climbs, while others looking for a way to double-down on $BTC’s gains can use the BTC Bull Token presale as a way to diversify exposure. $BTCBULL currently costs just $0.002545, but our price prediction shows the potential for the token to increase 230% to reach $0.0084 by year’s end.

2025-06-03T11:51:57,"Google Gemini Predicts Cardano (ADA) Price for June 30, 2025","Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.6965, reflecting a 0.16% decrease from the previous day. In light of current market trends and blockchain developments, we’ve asked Google Gemini AI about the direction it thinks the digital asset will go and its potential price by June 30, 2025. According to Gemini, the projected Cardano (ADA) is projected to trade between $1.1 and $1.8 by the end of June. The AI’s prediction is based on a combination of market momentum, Cardano’s technical and ecosystem progress, and broader cryptocurrency sector dynamics. Factors Supporting This Forecast Gemini outlines five core factors behind its forecast: Market Momentum and Bitcoin Performance: The AI notes that historically, altcoins like Cardano tend to perform better after Bitcoin enters the later stages of a bull market. Gemini points out that BTC set a favorable backdrop already, and as its dominance weakens , altcoins often experience notable price surges. Ecosystem Development : While acknowledging that Cardano has grown slowly, Gemini recognizes the gradual development and upgrades. Despite these developments, it notes that ADA “still lags behind Ethereum and Solana” in terms of DeFi and NFT utilization, which could limit its short-term upside. Regulatory Landscape and Institutional Adoption : Gemini considers regulatory clarity an influential factor. Not all assets share XRP’s regulatory clarity , and the AI states that Cardano may perform better under moderate regulatory conditions. However, stricter regulations could reduce speculative inflows and dampen growth. Community and Governance Factors: Cardano’s decentralized governance , especially with the Voltaire phase, is viewed positively by Gemini. It suggests this governance shift could stimulate renewed interest in the network. Nonetheless, the AI cautions that reliance on formal methods and peer-reviewed development may hinder its competitive pace relative to more agile platforms. Competitive Pressure and Risks: Gemini highlights the intense competition Cardano faces from other Layer 1 blockchains. Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Avalanche continue to attract more developer activity and capital. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Potential Targets for Cardano (ADA) In addition to the forecasted price range, Gemini also provides a probability distribution for ADA’s price outcomes by June 30. The chatbot listed a 20% chance of remaining below $1, a 60% chance of trading between $1 and $1.8, a 15% chance of trading between $1.8 and $3, and a 5% chance of rising above $3. The most probable scenario, according to the AI, is that Cardano will trade between $1 and $1.8. However, the recent increase in whale activity suggests that the asset may shock investors and aim for higher targets.

After attending the XRP Las Vegas event, King shared a bold prediction that’s making waves across the industry: “The next two years will change crypto forever.” From clear regulations to rising institutional interest, King believes we’re entering a turning point that will push crypto into its next major chapter. XRP Las Vegas confirmed one thing: the next 2 years will change crypto forever. Regulatory clarity is coming. Institutions are leaning in. Adoption and growth are about to accelerate substantially. For those who missed it, here's an overview — first off, the most important… pic.twitter.com/UBn0pzvg5h — Austin King (@OnchainAustin) June 2, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Is Almost Here According to King, the U.S. government is finally getting closer to providing clear crypto regulations. This could be a major breakthrough for the industry, which has spent years operating under uncertainty. He sees this aligning with the growing involvement of major financial players. Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have already launched Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy continues to gain traction. King believes this shift will help legitimize crypto in a way that unlocks long-term growth and adoption. Institutions Are Changing Their Tune King also reflected on how much has changed in the past decade. He noted that for years, crypto had to defend itself against criticism from central banks, regulators, and traditional financial institutions that didn’t believe in it. Now, many of those same institutions are investing. Tesla’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in 2021, followed by some selling, and involvement from companies like SpaceX show how institutional interest is growing fast. King called it a “stunning pivot,” and said this shift is creating some of the biggest opportunities he’s ever seen in his eight years in crypto. Real Projects Will Lead the Next Wave King also pointed out that a major change is happening within the industry itself. For years, many crypto companies focused heavily on marketing without delivering real value. But now, that’s starting to shift. King believes we’ll soon see a big move of capital away from hype-based projects and into those creating real-world impact. “Over the next 2 years, you’ll see a significant amount of liquidity rotate from marketing-based companies to projects driving real-world impact,” he predicted. This gives forward-thinking networks a huge edge. Crypto Has a Big Role to Play King is hopeful about the future of cryptocurrency as he sees it as a reconstruction of the global financial system. The sector is expected to grow at an exceptional rate as adoption picks up speed and stability approaches. He thinks that the function of cryptocurrency in the world will be redefined in the next two years. Will his predictions come true? Time will tell.

2025-06-03T11:45:03,"Matter of Time Before Altcoins Take Big Dive Against Bitcoin, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen","Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that altcoins may collapse in their Bitcoin ( BTC ) pairs any moment now. In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 900,000 YouTube subscribers that the TOTAL 3 chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins, remains in a downtrend against the flagship crypto asset and has yet to find a market bottom. “I don’t care how great you think your altcoin community is. I don’t care if your developers that you follow have not yet rugged you. Altcoins, in my opinion, are oscillators at best against Bitcoin, and many of them just bleed to Bitcoin. So if individually altcoins will bleed to Bitcoin, then collectively they should as well, and that’s the reason why I think alt/Bitcoin pairs will eventually find themselves down here [at 0.25]. I think it’s just a matter of time.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube A move toward the support area highlighted by Cowen would signal that altcoins are significantly underperforming Bitcoin. Cowen also points out that altcoins are in a multi-year downtrend against Bitcoin with no signs of reversing the trend anytime soon. “I don’t know exactly when alt/Bitcoin pairs are going to go to the range lows. I can’t tell you that, but what I can say is what you’re witnessing is basically the slow conversion of people holding alts and then they are just converting them to Bitcoin… The chart tells you what’s happening. Alts put in a new low against Bitcoin [on June 1st]. So any prior altseason that was called for, any prior call for a low by alt/Bitcoin pairs up until today was wrong.” TOTAL3/BTC is currently hovering at 0.33.

2025-06-03T11:30:48,"Brandon Gill’s Late Bitcoin Disclosure Sparks Congressional Transparency Concerns","BitcoinWorld Brandon Gill’s Late Bitcoin Disclosure Sparks Congressional Transparency Concerns The world of cryptocurrency often intersects with the corridors of power, and sometimes, those intersections reveal bumps in the road. A recent instance involving Texas Representative Brandon Gill has brought the spotlight onto lawmaker financial disclosures, specifically concerning digital assets like Bitcoin. News surfaced that Rep. Gill failed to report significant Bitcoin purchases within the required timeframe under a key transparency law, sparking debate and raising questions about adherence to regulations designed to prevent conflicts of interest. Who is Brandon Gill and What Happened with His Bitcoin Disclosure? Representative Brandon Gill , a Republican from Texas, recently drew attention not for his legislative work, but for his financial dealings. Reports indicate that Rep. Gill purchased a substantial amount of Bitcoin, potentially valued at up to $500,000. While members of Congress are permitted to buy and sell assets, they are mandated by law to disclose these transactions publicly and promptly. In this case, the issue wasn’t the purchase itself, but the timing of the required disclosure. According to reports from Decrypt and other sources, Rep. Gill’s filing for these Bitcoin purchases came significantly later than the 45-day window stipulated by federal law. This late Bitcoin disclosure immediately raised eyebrows, particularly given the increasing focus on financial transparency among elected officials and the growing interest in cryptocurrency within political circles. Understanding the STOCK Act: The Rules of the Game The law at the heart of this matter is the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, commonly known as the STOCK Act . Enacted in 2012 and later amended, this bipartisan law was designed to combat insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees by requiring timely reporting of stock, bond, and commodity futures transactions, and later expanded to include other securities and assets. Key requirements of the STOCK Act include: Timely Disclosure: Members of Congress and certain employees must publicly disclose any purchase, sale, or exchange of stocks, bonds, commodity futures, and other securities exceeding $1,000 within 45 days of the transaction. Public Availability: These disclosures must be made available to the public in an easily searchable, sortable, and downloadable format (typically online). Purpose: The primary goal is to increase transparency and deter lawmakers from trading based on non-public information they might obtain through their official duties. The intent is clear: to allow the public and watchdog groups to monitor lawmakers’ financial activities and identify potential conflicts of interest. Rep. Gill’s late filing directly contravenes the timely disclosure requirement of the STOCK Act . Why Timely Disclosure Matters for Congressional Transparency At its core, the requirement for timely financial disclosure is about fostering Congressional transparency . The public has a right to know if their representatives are making investment decisions that could be influenced by, or could influence, their legislative actions. This is particularly crucial in rapidly evolving sectors like cryptocurrency, where government policy can have a dramatic impact on asset values. When disclosures are delayed, it creates a cloud of suspicion. It makes it harder for the public and ethics watchdogs to connect potential dots between a lawmaker’s votes, committee assignments, or public statements and their personal financial gains or losses. Late disclosures, like the one concerning Rep. Gill’s Bitcoin, undermine trust in the integrity of the legislative process and fuel concerns that lawmakers might be prioritizing personal wealth over public service. The challenges with the STOCK Act ‘s enforcement also come into sharp focus here. While the law mandates disclosure, the penalty for a late filing is a mere $200 fine. Furthermore, this fine is often waived by ethics committees, especially for first-time offenders or if the filing is eventually made. Critics argue that such a negligible penalty does little to incentivize strict adherence to the rules, effectively making the 45-day deadline more of a suggestion than a strict requirement for those who can afford the minor fee or expect it to be waived. The Position of Crypto Lawmakers and Potential Conflicts The case of Rep. Gill also highlights the unique position of Crypto lawmakers – those who are actively involved in discussions or legislation concerning digital assets while also holding significant personal investments in them. There’s an ongoing debate about whether lawmakers should hold individual stocks or assets in industries they oversee. For Crypto lawmakers , this is particularly sensitive. As Congress grapples with how to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the policy decisions made on Capitol Hill can profoundly impact the value of these assets. A lawmaker holding a large amount of Bitcoin who then votes on legislation that benefits Bitcoin could face accusations of a conflict of interest, even if their vote was based on genuine policy beliefs. While owning an asset class isn’t inherently wrong, the potential for perceived or actual conflicts necessitates strict adherence to transparency rules. Timely disclosure allows the public to assess these potential conflicts for themselves. Delays, especially from Crypto lawmakers , can erode confidence and fuel narratives that personal financial interests are influencing policy decisions. Beyond the Fine: Broader Implications and the Push for Stricter Rules Rep. Gill’s late Bitcoin disclosure is not an isolated incident; numerous lawmakers from both parties have faced scrutiny for late or incomplete financial disclosures over the years, involving various types of assets. However, the focus on cryptocurrency adds a modern dimension to this persistent issue. This incident reignites the broader discussion about strengthening congressional ethics rules. Many advocacy groups and some lawmakers are pushing for more stringent measures, such as: Increased Penalties: Raising the fine for late disclosures significantly to provide a real deterrent. Mandatory Blind Trusts: Requiring lawmakers to place their assets into a blind trust managed by a third party, preventing them from having direct control or knowledge of specific trades. Outright Ban on Individual Stock Trading: Prohibiting members of Congress from trading individual stocks altogether, allowing them only to invest in diversified mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While a complete ban or mandatory blind trusts face political hurdles, incidents like the late Bitcoin disclosure by Rep. Gill provide further ammunition for those arguing that the current rules, particularly the minimal penalties under the STOCK Act , are insufficient to ensure true Congressional transparency and prevent potential conflicts among Crypto lawmakers and others. Conclusion: The Need for Punctuality in Congressional Finance The case of Texas Representative Brandon Gill and his late Bitcoin disclosure serves as a timely reminder of the importance of the STOCK Act and the ongoing need for robust Congressional transparency . While the specific amount of the fine may be small, the principle at stake is significant: maintaining public trust by ensuring lawmakers are open about their financial dealings, especially in areas like cryptocurrency that intersect with their legislative responsibilities. As the world of digital assets continues to grow, the scrutiny on Crypto lawmakers ‘ holdings and disclosures will only intensify. Adhering strictly to the 45-day deadline isn’t just a bureaucratic step; it’s a fundamental requirement for ethical governance and preserving confidence in the institutions that shape our laws.

2025-06-03T11:30:07,"Norway’s NBX Stock Rockets 138% After Surprise Bitcoin Treasury Buy — What’s Next for the BTC Price?","Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) shares surged over 138% in a single day after the Oslo-based crypto exchange revealed it had begun adding Bitcoin to its treasury. Key Takeaways: NBX stock surged 138% after announcing its first Bitcoin treasury purchase. The exchange plans to use BTC reserves to back a Cardano-based stablecoin and expand crypto lending. Bitcoin is consolidating above $105K, with a potential breakout target near $108K if momentum builds. On June 2, NBX announced the purchase of 6 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at roughly $633,700 at current prices, with plans to increase its holdings to 10 BTC by the end of June. The company said it is also in discussions to raise additional capital to expand its Bitcoin position further. NBX Shares Soar 138.5% After Bitcoin Treasury Move Following the news, NBX shares jumped 138.5%, closing at €0.033 ($0.038), according to Google Finance. Though still far below its all-time high of €0.93 ($1.06), reached in January 2022, the stock’s sharp rally reflects renewed investor appetite for Bitcoin-aligned firms. NBX said its Bitcoin reserves will be used as collateral to issue USDM, a stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain, while generating yield within the Cardano ecosystem. The company added that Bitcoin is becoming “an important part of the global financial infrastructure” and that it aims to leverage the holdings to enhance operational efficiency and attract institutional capital. The firm also plans to offer Bitcoin-backed loans, as part of a broader strategy to establish itself as a leading digital asset bank. NBX is not the first Norwegian company to embrace Bitcoin. In 2021, Norwegian industrial giant Aker ASA launched Seetee, a Bitcoin-focused subsidiary. JUST IN: Norwegian Block Exchange becomes the first publicly traded #Bitcoin treasury company in the country pic.twitter.com/kY9KK2VbFi — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 2, 2025 Aker holds 1,170 BTC, purchased at an average cost of $50,200, now valued at around $123 million, according to Bitcointreasuries.net. Elsewhere in Norway, crypto brokerage K33 recently raised 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) to acquire Bitcoin for its own balance sheet. Meanwhile, Norges Bank, Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund, indirectly holds 3,821 BTC through its equity investments. Globally, companies adding Bitcoin to their treasuries have often seen strong stock market reactions. Paris-based Blockchain Group’s stock soared 225% after it began accumulating Bitcoin in November, while Indonesian fintech DigiAsia Corp shares climbed 91% after unveiling a $100 million Bitcoin buying plan. Overall, corporate Bitcoin treasuries now hold more than 3 million BTC, valued at over $342 billion, according to Bitbo data. BTC Consolidates Above $105K as Bulls Eye Breakout Bitcoin is trading steady around $105,300, showing resilience above key support levels after a volatile week. On the 2-hour chart, BTC remains range-bound between $103,800 and $106,300, with Bollinger Bands tightening. RSI at 52.94 suggests a neutral stance, while the MACD is turning slightly bullish, hinting at potential upside momentum. The 30-minute chart paints a similar picture. BTC continues to consolidate between $104,600 and $106,200, with RSI hovering around 51.11 — signaling indecision. MACD remains flat, indicating that neither buyers nor sellers are in control in the short term. Zooming into the 1-minute chart, BTC has recovered from early session lows, climbing steadily back toward $105,360. RSI is currently elevated at 60.29, suggesting slight bullish pressure, while MACD has crossed into positive territory, confirming short-term upward momentum. Overall, BTC’s near-term outlook remains constructive as long as it holds above the $104,600–$105,000 range. A break above $106,300 could open the door toward $108,000. On the downside, losing $104,600 could trigger a retest of $103,000 support.

2025-06-03T11:23:03,"Strategy: The Bitcoin-Treasury Flywheel Is Spinning Into Overdrive","Summary MicroStrategy's aggressive bitcoin accumulation, now over 580,000 BTC, transforms it into a leveraged, regulated ETF on digital scarcity with significant upside potential. Subscription software revenue is accelerating, driven by AI integration, supporting a dual-engine growth model of software and bitcoin appreciation. Capital-raising prowess enables ongoing bitcoin purchases, with dilution risks mitigated as long as bitcoin per share outpaces share growth. Despite headline valuation multiples, I see MSTR as undervalued for investors bullish on bitcoin and AI, with 50% upside over the cycle. Introduction MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has spent the past four years transforming itself from a midsized business-intelligence vendor into the world's largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin, and its first-quarter 2025 results show that the pivot is accelerating rather than stalling. During the quarter the company added 301,335 coins, lifting total holdings to 553,555 BTC and then, in early June, to 580,955 BTC at an average purchase price of roughly $70,000 per coin . At a spot price hovering near $105,000, that trove is worth about $61 billion, dwarfing MicroStrategy's legacy software revenue base and anchoring a balance sheet that now looks more like a sovereign wealth fund than a traditional tech company. Yet, the software engine that once defined MicroStrategy still matters. Subscription services revenue jumped 62% year over year to $37 million even as total revenue slipped 3.6% to $111 million, indicating that the shift to cloud analytics is gaining traction in spite of headline volatility tied to digital-asset accounting. Management is plainly leaning into the model: a new $21 billion at-the-market equity program and $7.7 billion of gross capital raised in Q1 provide the financial firepower to keep buying bitcoin while incrementally funding R&D that embeds AI functionality into the firm's analytics suite. Thesis AI is ushering in an age of digital abundance, driving down the marginal cost of knowledge work and tempting central banks to monetize faster productivity by expanding the money supply. As real yields compress, investors are seeking scarce, hard-coded stores of value. Bitcoin, with its fixed 21 million-coin cap, stands out as the only digital asset offering built-in monetary discipline. Against that backdrop, MicroStrategy's decision to convert cash flows, balance-sheet liquidity and even fresh capital raises into bitcoin is radical but coherent: the company is effectively a leveraged, regulated ETF on a deflationary reserve asset, wrapped inside a still-profitable software vendor. The strategy gives shareholders two engines of compounding of organic software growth and externally financed bitcoin appreciation, each reinforcing the other in a world where AI lifts GDP but erodes the purchasing power of fiat savings. Strategy Bitcoin as Treasury Alpha MicroStrategy now controls approximately 2.8% of all bitcoin that will ever exist, compared with 0.9% just two years ago. Because the company capitalizes these purchases primarily through equity and convertible-debt issuance, the effective cost of carrying the position is the discount between its share price and intrinsic bitcoin value. With BTC at $105,000, MicroStrategy's $101.8 billion market capitalization trades at a roughly 1.7x multiple of coin value, which is far below the 8x EV/revenue multiples that cloud-software peers command. This implies that investors are paying a modest premium for the embedded analytics franchise and future coin accretion. Equally important, MicroStrategy's proprietary ""BTC Yield"" metric (bitcoin earned through active treasury management such as futures basis trades) reached 13.7% year-to-date, prompting management to lift its 2025 target to 25%. In effect, the company is monetizing financial expertise to compound holdings faster than simple buy-and-hold investors, creating a positive feedback loop: the more coins it owns, the more optionality it has to generate incremental yield without risking principal. Strategy Software Resilience in an AI-First Era While bitcoin dominates headlines, the core analytics platform is quietly re-accelerating. Subscription services revenue rose to $37.1 million, accounting for a record 33% of total sales, as enterprises adopt cloud-native versions of the MicroStrategy One platform to embed generative AI into dashboards and mobile workflows. Management highlighted new AI governance modules allowing customers to watermark LLM outputs and audit data lineage, differentiating the product in a crowded BI field now chasing ChatGPT-style features. Gross margin slipped to 69% from 74% a year ago as the firm scaled cloud infrastructure and absorbed higher AI inference costs, yet remains comfortably above the 60% level typical of BI peers. That elasticity suggests room for margin expansion once AI features mature and pricing tiers adjust. Even after the bitcoin pivot, R&D intensity stayed near 18% of revenue, underscoring a commitment to product relevance that supports the bullish case of ""software plus scarce asset"" rather than ""bitcoin shell."" Capital Markets Execution Access to deep capital pools is the flywheel powering MicroStrategy's accumulation strategy. The company raised $4.4 billion via common-stock issuance in Q1 and a further $2.2 billion in April, bringing total net proceeds since January to $7.7 billion. The newly filed $21 billion ATM ensures that every rally in the share price can be opportunistically tapped for fresh bitcoin dry powder, effectively turning equity volatility into treasury alpha. Critics argue that dilution erodes per-share value, but so long as the incremental coins purchased with each dollar of issuance outpace share growth, existing holders capture net bitcoin per share. Q1 data confirm the math: shares outstanding rose 49% year over year, yet bitcoin holdings jumped 119% over the same period, lifting coin-per-share by roughly 47% . Few corporate-finance strategies deliver that kind of asymmetric scaling. Strategy Financials Total Q1 revenue declined 3.6% to $111.1 million as legacy product support continued its predictable slide, but subscription growth more than offset license softness, keeping software ARR flat sequentially. Gross profit of $77.1 million produced a 69% margin, down 460 basis points from last year, primarily on cloud transition expenses rather than competitive pricing pressure. On the balance sheet, cash rose to $60.3 million from $38.1 million at year-end thanks to equity sales, while free cash flow was a manageable negative $11.1 million given heavy AI R&D spend. Enterprise value sits near $110 billion against trailing-twelve-month EBITDA of -$7.6 billion, rendering EV/EBITDA optically meaningless; however, strip out non-cash digital-asset valuation swings and core software EBITDA remains positive, suggesting that traditional multiples understate operating optionality. Guidance is qualitative but aggressive: management expects ""BTC Yield"" to reach 25% and ""BTC $ Gain"" to hit $15 billion by year-end if macro liquidity stays supportive. Even if subscription revenue merely grows in mid-single digits, the embedded leverage to bitcoin price could drive book-value expansion far exceeding software peers' growth rates. Risks Bitcoin's price path remains the single largest swing factor. A steep drawdown, like a 50% retracement toward $50,000, would inflict mark-to-market losses approaching $30 billion and amplify the GAAP net-loss optics that already spooked investors this quarter. Although new FASB fair-value rules allow upward revaluation in bull markets, they also force quarterly impairments in bear cycles, potentially pressuring sentiment even if cash flow stays intact. Dilution is a second-order concern. If the share price underperforms bitcoin for an extended period, raising equity to buy coins could actually decrease bitcoin per share, reversing the current virtuous cycle. The firm must therefore maintain precise timing discipline in its ATM program. Regulatory headwinds also loom: the SEC's evolving stance on spot-bitcoin ETFs and corporate crypto disclosures could impose higher compliance costs or limit future capital raises. Finally, software execution cannot be ignored. Should the analytics platform fail to keep pace with AI-native competitors, the non-bitcoin segment could slip into structural decline, depriving MicroStrategy of an operating hedge against crypto volatility. Conclusion At roughly $372 per share, MicroStrategy trades at 1.7x the market value of its 581 thousand bitcoins, meaning investors are paying about $40 billion for a cash-generating BI franchise, active treasury yield, and a management team that has repeatedly demonstrated capital-markets agility. Traditional valuation lenses paint a premium picture: EV/revenue of 258x dwarfs Coinbase's 8.2x and Riot Platforms' 7.1x. Price/sales shows a similar gap, while P/E is not meaningful given bitcoin-driven accounting losses. Yet, the comparison is incomplete because neither peer owns an asset base whose dollar value alone covers a majority of enterprise value. If bitcoin merely matches the post-halving trajectories of prior cycles and reaches $150,000 within two years, MicroStrategy's holdings would be worth $87 billion, enough to cover the current market cap even before further accumulation or software cash flows are considered. In that scenario, the equity would offer embedded optionality on both BTC upside and a potential re-rating of the subscription business toward the 10-12x sales typical of AI-enabled analytics vendors. Given the asymmetric payoff profile, MicroStrategy looks undervalued on a sum-of-parts basis despite headline multiples. For investors who accept bitcoin's long-term scarcity thesis and see AI-induced monetary expansion as a tailwind rather than a threat, owning MSTR provides operational leverage to both trends. I remain bullish and expect the shares to outperform pure-play miners and exchanges over a full bitcoin cycle, with 50% upside possible if management continues to grow bitcoin per share faster than share count while nurturing subscription growth above 10% annually.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791921-strategy-the-bitcoin-treasury-flywheel-is-spinning-into-overdrive?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","MSTR",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T11:22:36,"Pakistan Makes Another Big Move: New Draft on Crypto Regulation","The post Pakistan Makes Another Big Move: New Draft on Crypto Regulation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pakistan is taking a big leap toward regulating the crypto space—despite cryptocurrency still being illegal in the country. On June 2, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) held a high-level meeting in Islamabad to draft a regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets, marking a major shift in the nation’s crypto policy direction. Crypto Regulation Draft Underway in Pakistan The meeting was chaired by Finance and Revenue Minister Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb. Key stakeholders, including the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) , SECP Chairperson , and law and IT ministry officials , joined to outline a path forward for digital assets. The goal? To create a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly crypto ecosystem that also addresses investor protection and financial inclusion. “Members of the Council provided valuable input to ensure a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment, with the goal of promoting responsible blockchain adoption, safeguarding investors, and advancing financial inclusion,” stated the finance division . What the Crypto Draft Aims to Solve The regulatory draft aims to: Formalize the crypto sector , currently operating in a legal grey area Establish clear licensing rules and compliance mechanisms Protect retail investors from fraud and manipulation Encourage financial innovation through responsible blockchain adoption Build a future-ready digital financial infrastructure These measures are expected to bring digital assets into Pakistan’s financial mainstream while aligning with international best practices.

2025-06-03T11:21:06,"Exploring Bitcoin's Market Dynamics and Future Predictions Amidst Challenges","The Current State of Bitcoin's Market Bitcoin is currently undergoing significant fluctuations, trading near $105,000 after a spike to $106,450. Market experts like Willy Woo are cautioning investors about the potential risks associated with high leverage in the derivatives market. Such conditions may lead to ""liquidation hunts"" where large market players capitalize on overstretched positions to cause price dips. Market analyst Willy Woo warns traders about the perilous state of high leverage in Bitcoin's market, which could lead to severe price volatility due to orchestrated liquidations. Open interest in BTC futures remains alarmingly high, according to Coinglass, with figures recently peaking at $80 billion in May and later dropping slightly to $72 billion. Bitcoin and the Influence of External Markets Amidst the internal market dynamics, Bitcoin is also experiencing pressure from broader economic factors. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat, on a recent CNBC's Squawk Box episode, shared an optimistic forecast for Bitcoin, projecting its price could reach between $150,000 to $250,000 this year. He attributes this potential growth to global liquidity surges and a lenient Federal Reserve outlook, which positions BTC as a liquidity-sensitive asset. Integration Efforts from Cardano While Bitcoin faces challenges, other cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) are making significant strides. Cardano's founder, Charles Hoskinson, is focusing on enhancing Bitcoin's utility in the DeFi sector without interfering with its core functionalities. This initiative aims to assert Cardano's position in the decentralized finance ecosystem by incorporating Bitcoin and other currencies like XRP into its network. Price Trends and Future Outlook Although short-term market trends show a decrease, Bitcoin still shows a potential upward trajectory in long-term evaluations. Presently, Bitcoin is oscillating between $102,408 and $109,936, nearing a critical resistance level which, if breached, may lead to further gains. Further supporting the optimistic outlook, technical indicators suggest a slight bullish trend. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is above the 100-day average, and the Relative Strength Index indicates a balanced market state, neither overbought nor oversold. If Bitcoin can surpass the current resistance, there's a possibility for reaching new highs, continuing the trend observed over the past months.

Source -X Ethereum’s Petra made improvements, but Kaanch’s ability to process transactions at incredible speed, at practically no cost and with strong decentralization gives it a strong edge. Kaanch is catching the interest of investors, especially since Bitcoin ETFs lost $346.8 million while Ethereum ETFs gained $91.9 million in recent weeks. Top analysts are predicting a massive 28,130% rise for Kaanch in the next few weeks which highlights the project’s rising popularity. JUST IN: YESTERDAY, BTC ETF SAW AN OUTFLOW OF $346.8M, WHILE ETH ETF SAW AN INFLOW OF $91.9M Source: @FarsideUK https://t.co/ahCGedpczM pic.twitter.com/TCezzkp5Ju — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) May 30, 2025 Presale Momentum Accelerates with Attractive Pricing Right now, Kaanch is on stage 6 of its presale, where it offers tokens for $0.32 and the next stage will price them at $0.64. The presale has so far collected more than $1,817,362 million which shows that investors are very confident. Because there will only be 58 million tokens in total, the presale offers a strong opportunity for those who join early. Anyone wanting to get involved in the Kaanch presale should go to the official website to buy their tokens before the price goes up. Upcoming BitMart Listing Fuels Market Anticipation Kaanch will be added to the major cryptocurrency exchange Bitmart soon. The new listing is anticipated to provide better access to more investors and traders by making the market more liquid. Followers should look at Kaanch’s social media accounts for updates about when the listing will happen and how to trade. Unmatched Performance Metrics Set Kaanch Apart The technology behind Kaanch allows for a throughput of 1.4 million TPS and for finality to be reached in just 0.8 seconds, helping trades and smart contracts happen in near real time. The performance is much higher than what Ethereum’s Petra upgrade can handle, so Kaanch is a good fit for dApps, small transactions and tokenizing real assets. More than 3,600 decentralized nodes work together to maintain the network’s security. Because of very low gas fees, Kaanch is an affordable choice for developers and users. Robust Security and Community Governance Strengthen Ecosystem Thanks to audits by SpyWolf and VerifyLab, Kaanch’s protocol has been confirmed as secure by both investors and developers.

2025-06-03T11:18:38,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Weakness Fails to Stop Corporate Adoption Wave","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The cryptocurrency bull run has stalled since bitcoin (BTC) hit a record high above $110,000 last month. However, corporate adoption continues at a brisk pace. Shares in Norway-based crypto exchange Norwegian Block Exchange surged over 100% early today after the company disclosed the purchase of six BTC, worth $633K at current prices, with plans to boost holdings to 10 BTC by the end of the month. The Nasdaq-listed Classover Holdings Inc, an educational technology company with a current market capitalization of $63 million, has entered into a securities purchase agreement with Solana Growth Ventures LLC for up to $500 million in senior secured convertible notes. According to Investing.com, up to 80% of the proceeds will be allocated to purchase Solana's native token SOL.

Those depositors are are currently receiving 16.48% APY on their deposits although the figure was at 38.3% in the hours after launch. Yields are rewarded in the USDS stablecoins and are based on the performances of the protocol. Yield is also tied to the Sky Savings Rate (SSR), which reflects the protocol's operational income. The SKY token also experienced a period of upside, rising 16% from $0.065 to $0.074 in the past 24 hours. Trading volume, however, remains fairly muted at $7 million -- indicating that a large portion of holders are staking and not trading, paving the way for a lack of sell pressure. Derivatives Positioning HYPE, PEPE, ETH, BNB and TON have seen the most increase in the perpetual futures open interest in the past 24 hours. BTC's late Friday upswing from $103,600 to over $106k was marked by a decline in perpetual futures open interest. The divergence, coupled with low spot volumes, raises question mark on the sustainability of gains. Open interest in the CME futures has dropped to 153.6K BTC from the recent high of 162K BTC, with the annualized one-month basis pulling back to 6.5% in a sign of pause in institutional demand. ETH basis has also pulled back to 8.7% from recent highs over 10%. On Deribit, a clear call or bullish options bias is seen only in the March 2021 expiry, according to risk reversals tracked by Amberdata. ETH options are slightly more optimistic about price prospects.

2025-06-03T11:10:38,"U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs See Promising $78.2M Inflows","BitcoinWorld U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs See Promising $78.2M Inflows The world of cryptocurrency investing is constantly evolving, and the recent developments surrounding U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs are certainly capturing attention. On June 2, these newly approved investment vehicles saw a notable milestone: significant net inflows totaling $78.2 million. This movement indicates growing investor interest and positioning ahead of their anticipated trading launch. What Are U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs and Why Are They Significant? Understanding Ethereum ETFs is key to appreciating the significance of these inflows. Unlike futures ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts, spot ETFs aim to track the direct price of the underlying asset – in this case, Ethereum (ETH). The approval of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC marks a pivotal moment for the crypto market, potentially opening doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH through regulated brokerage accounts. Here’s why this is important: Increased Accessibility: ETFs make it easier for investors to add Ethereum to their portfolios without the complexities of buying and storing the actual cryptocurrency. Institutional Interest: The involvement of major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity signals growing institutional acceptance and confidence in Ethereum as an asset class. Regulatory Clarity: While the approval process had its hurdles, the launch of spot ETFs provides a more regulated pathway for investment compared to some direct crypto purchases. Breaking Down the $78.2 Million ETH ETF Inflows According to data compiled by Farside Investors, the collective ETH ETFs recorded $78.2 million in net inflows on June 2. This figure represents the total amount of money flowing into these funds, minus any money flowing out, over that specific day. It’s a strong indicator of demand building up before these products are available for public trading on exchanges. The inflows were primarily concentrated in funds managed by established financial giants: BlackRock’s ETHA: Led the pack with a substantial $48.4 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FETH: Followed closely with a robust $29.8 million in net inflows. Other ETFs: The remaining spot Ethereum ETFs tracked showed no change in their holdings for the day, suggesting initial positioning was focused on these two major players. These early flows into ETH ETFs are seen by many as a positive sign, mirroring the initial interest seen in spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. How Do These Flows Impact Spot Ethereum? While these are pre-trading inflows, they are directly linked to the underlying asset, Spot Ethereum. For an ETF provider to launch shares, they typically need to acquire the corresponding amount of the underlying asset. Therefore, these inflows suggest that the issuers of these U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs are accumulating ETH in preparation for their products going live. This accumulation process can create buying pressure on the Spot Ethereum market. As more money flows into the ETFs, the issuers need to buy more ETH, which can potentially influence its price. While $78.2 million might seem modest compared to the overall market cap of Ethereum, it represents significant direct buying pressure stemming from new, regulated investment products. Comparing Ethereum ETF Flows to Other Crypto ETFs The launch and performance of Crypto ETFs have been a major theme in the digital asset space. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was met with immense investor enthusiasm, leading to billions of dollars in inflows within weeks and significantly impacting Bitcoin’s price action. While the initial $78.2 million inflow into Ethereum ETFs is smaller than the opening day figures for Bitcoin ETFs, it’s still a solid start, especially considering these products aren’t even trading yet. Market observers will be closely watching whether Crypto ETFs based on Ethereum can replicate the success and market impact seen with their Bitcoin counterparts. Benefits of Investing in Ethereum via ETFs For many traditional investors, accessing Ethereum through a spot ETF offers several compelling advantages: Ease of Trading: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, making them as easy to buy and sell as stocks through existing brokerage accounts. Security & Custody: Investors don’t have to worry about managing private keys, wallets, or the security risks associated with holding actual cryptocurrency. The ETF provider handles custody. Regulatory Oversight: Trading through regulated exchanges and financial institutions provides a layer of oversight and investor protection not always present in direct crypto markets. Portfolio Diversification: ETFs allow investors to easily add exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem within a diversified investment portfolio structure. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the arrival of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs is positive, investors should be aware of potential challenges: Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) which can erode returns over time compared to direct ownership (though direct ownership has its own costs and risks). Tracking Error: While spot ETFs aim to track the price of the underlying asset closely, minor deviations can occur. Market Volatility: The price of Ethereum itself remains highly volatile, and the ETF’s value will reflect this volatility. Regulatory Landscape: While approved, the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies continues to evolve. Actionable Insights for Investors What should you take away from this news? Monitor Inflows: Keep an eye on daily and weekly inflow data once the ETFs begin trading. Sustained positive inflows could signal strong demand and potentially impact the Spot Ethereum price. Evaluate the Product: If considering investment, compare the different Ethereum ETFs available, paying attention to fees and the reputation of the issuer. Understand the Risks: Remember that investing in Crypto ETFs carries significant risk due to the underlying asset’s volatility. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Looking Ahead: The Future of Ethereum ETFs The $78.2 million in early inflows is just the beginning. The real test will come when these U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs go live for public trading. The market will be watching closely to see if they can attract similar levels of capital as the Bitcoin ETFs did. The success of ETH ETFs could pave the way for other single-asset Crypto ETFs in the future, further integrating digital assets into traditional finance. Summary The $78.2 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on June 2, dominated by BlackRock and Fidelity, represents a significant early vote of confidence from institutional players. These pre-trading flows highlight building demand and suggest that issuers are actively acquiring Spot Ethereum. While it’s early days, the performance of these Ethereum ETFs will be a key indicator of broader investor appetite for ETH via regulated products and could have notable implications for the wider Crypto ETFs market.

2025-06-03T11:09:31,"Bitcoin Derivatives Market Shows Signs of Overheating, Further Pain Incoming? (Bitfinex)","Over the last almost two weeks, bitcoin has been experiencing its first meaningful correction since the recovery from April lows. The asset has dropped about 8% from its all-time high (ATH), marking a cool-off period from what analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex called one of the sharpest recovery rallies in recent history. While the cryptocurrency continues to retrace its steps, the Bitcoin derivatives market is showing signs of overheating. This implies that the market is expecting heightened volatility and, possibly, deeper correction ahead, triggered by macro headwinds and structural profit-taking. Overheating in the Bitcoin Derivatives Market According to a report by Bitfinex, open interest in the options market surged to an all-time high of $49.4 billion last week, adding $25.8 billion within a few weeks. At some point, the figure was $6 billion higher than the ATH set in January. The open interest of Bitcoin perpetuals also rallied as BTC hit a new all-time high. “The point here is that the notable uptick in derivatives activity signals expanding institutional participation, and, as it comes in the wake of Bitcoinʼs recent rally to new all-time highs, indicates that market participants are increasingly positioned for elevated volatility,” Bitfinex analysts stated. Currently, options open interest has plummeted to $39 billion, although mostly due to the May 29 options expiry . However, the high open interest still highlights rising institutional activity and increased hedging following Bitcoin’s recent price peak. Investors are speculating about BTC’s next move, wondering whether it will continue its bullish trajectory or undergo a further correction. Bitfinex stated that the open interest in Bitcoin perpetuals is one of the catalysts leading to the plunge in prices, as several long positions have been liquidated. Another reason is the aggressive profit-taking by investors over the past week. Short-Term Turbulence Despite the level of profit-taking observed, the unrealized profit in the Bitcoin market is currently higher than average, as indicated by the Relative Unrealized Profit metric. This indicator measures the scale of paper profits across the network relative to market capitalization. The Relative Unrealised Profit metric is in a region that has marked the onset of euphoric but short-lived phases in past cycles. The metric suggests that while BTC could see more upside in the short term, investors are likely to lock in profits by selling, triggering significant volatility. This increases the possibility of short-term turbulence, according to Bitfinex analysts, which can only be offset by sustained demand. Regardless of the market’s state, BTC remains structurally strong, with significant momentum. The post Bitcoin Derivatives Market Shows Signs of Overheating, Further Pain Incoming?

2025-06-03T11:06:58,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – June 3, 2025","After several days of consecutive slight decreases, the crypto market has turned green. The majority of the top 100 coins are up over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 1% to $3.43 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $101 billion. TLDR: Crypto market cap sees a small drop, while most coins turn green; BTC may drop below $100,000 but the broader structure remains bullish; Market sentiment shifts towards greed again; Capital is rotating toward decentralized stores of value; US spot BTC ETFs record outflows again, spot ETH ETFs continue the inflow streak; The rally still seams sustainable. Why Is Crypto Up Today? Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, of the top 10 coins per market capitalization, nine are green. Only one has seen a decrease, but so minor that the price is practically unchanged. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 0.2% to the price of $105,224. Notably, this is higher than yesterday’s $104,884. Ethereum (ETH) appreciated the most in this category. It’s up 4%, now trading at $2,610. The rest of the green list is up between 1% and 3%. The Ethereum Foundation announced on Monday that it laid off members of its research and development team and restructured its Protocol Research and Development division, rebranding it to ‘Protocol’. It stated that “Protocol is now a more united and leaner organization with more focused teams.” Announcing Protocol https://t.co/LMANvhQ0X3 — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) June 2, 2025 Of the top 100 coins, while 20 have seen their prices rise yesterday, 20 have seen their prices drop today. Bittensor (TAO) decreased the most in this category. It’s down 5% to $392. On the other side, Dogwifhat (WIF) is the day’s best performer and the only one with a double-digit increase. The coin is up 12.3%, now trading at $0.975. It’s followed by Ethena (ENA) , which increased by 8.7%, changing hands at $0.3385. Meanwhile, trading platform PrimeXBT argues that despite last week’s bearish close, the broader structure remains bullish. There are consistent higher highs and higher lows still defining the trend. “If the green range continues to hold, the bias remains bullish with caution. However, a clean breakdown below 100,700 could signal further weakness and possibly a move towards the 96,000 zone,” the analysts said. Pullback in motion, trend still intact. #Bitcoin rejected near ATHs, but the uptrend remains strong unless $96K breaks. Are the bulls still in control? BTC breakdown: https://t.co/u19sZU8ICB Trade the action: https://t.co/IDZGPpb8cq #PrimeXBT $BTC pic.twitter.com/zUEyjkJi3G — PrimeXBT (@PrimeXBT) June 2, 2025 Why is Crypto Up Today: Strategic Diversification Tool, Not High-Beta Asset According to James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , digital assets are not immune to macro shocks, but investors increasingly see BTC as a hedge against macroeconomic turmoil. Bitcoin “may initially echo” the response to the US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “reciprocal tariff” strategy in April. The coin plunged 7% before stabilizing. Investor behavior data for $BTC shows a drop in Momentum Buyers (RSI ↓ to ~20) alongside a sharp rise in Profit Takers (RSI ↑ to ~77) around May 28. This trend often shows near local tops, as traders begin locking in gains instead of building exposure: https://t.co/vHqbU4gTZV pic.twitter.com/TBpUb95xm1 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 2, 2025 However, Bitcoin’s drawdown during previous tariff episodes was “relatively contained compared to broader asset classes.” Per the COO, traders are “increasingly interpreting such tariffs more as negotiation tools than enduring economic policy, tempering the shock factor.” “Tariffs may intensify volatility, but Bitcoin is increasingly positioned as a strategic diversification tool rather than a high-beta asset.” Moreover, compared to April, Toledano argues, “today’s market reflects more disciplined investor behavior and stronger institutional foundations.” He noted that there are clear signs of a move towards alternative assets. Global equities declined, US Treasury yields climbed, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dropped for a fifth consecutive month, the dollar weakened, Brent crude approached $65 per barrel, and gold rose nearly 2%. Therefore, “capital seems to rotate toward decentralized stores of value. Bitcoin’s ability to hold ground in this environment points to its growing maturity and acceptance as a strategic store-of-value asset — especially amid the erosion of confidence in fiat-backed instruments and geopolitical uncertainty,” Toledano argues. Though lower than the prior week, last week's inflow of 6,148 $BTC into US spot ETFs marks the 7th consecutive week of net inflows – highlighting consistent demand despite cooling momentum. pic.twitter.com/77P6mQx8nR — glassnode (@glassnode) June 2, 2025 Alexei Zamyatin, Co-Founder of Layer 2 BOB, added that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is accelerating. However, institutions are not just accumulating the coin but are looking to put it to work as well “The US’s plan to acquire 1 million BTC over five years reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a financial asset,” Zamyatin says. “This recognition will drive demand for yield-generating Bitcoin products, making DeFi the natural next step. With governments and institutions now actively driving Bitcoin’s future, Bitcoin DeFi is positioned to scale faster than before.” Levels & Events to Watch Next BTC currently trades at $105,224. This is down from the intraday high of $106,415. Compared to its all-time high of $111,814, the coin is down 5.9%. It decreased by 4% in a week and rose by 9.6% in a month. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Per PrimeXBT, the key level to monitor is $107,000, which aligns with the previous ATH support zone. If price fails to hold above this area, the next key support is around $95,000-$96,000, A pullback at the first support level “should not be seen as a concern from a high time frame perspective.

Both the crypto market and the stock market are up today, though it doesn’t appear they’ve risen in tandem. The S&P 500 has increased by 0.41%, the Nasdaq-100 is up 0.71%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.084%. The stock market improved as it overcame repeated tariff threats by US President Donald Trump and trade tensions between the US and China. Is this rally sustainable?

What does June have in store for both? $ETH successfully retests $2,500 support yet again Source: TradingView The daily chart for $ETH shows that the price dropped out of the bottom of the bullish ascending triangle pattern. However, after testing the $2,500 major support level, the price has bounced back again. With the daily Stochastic RSI starting to rebound from the bottom, the chances are that the bulls could finally push the price above the top of the triangle and guide it towards the next resistance at $2,850. Bullish or bearish move next for $SOL? Source: TradingView The $SOL price is at an interesting point on the daily chart. The bulls are either going to force the price up through the major $160 resistance, or the bears are allowing a retest of the breakdown before bringing the price down, at least to the support at $137, and possibly down to $130 which is the measured move of the M pattern. If $SOL can continue this relatively recent uptrend, making a local higher high above $188, also key resistance, this would augur well for a potential return to the January all-time high. However, with seemingly endless selling pressure coming from Binance, via Wintermute, a subjugation of the price is still ongoing. $ETH or $SOL going into Q3? Source: TradingView Especially given Ethereum’s bounce from the bottom, traders and investors may be eyeing the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization as a decent position to take for the rest of this bull market. Solana also bounced a similar amount from its bottom, but the SOL/USDT chart does not look as good as it does for ETH/USDT. The weekly SOL/ETH chart above shows the general uptrend for $SOL over $ETH. Nevertheless, $SOL has fallen through the ascending trendline and is perhaps now seeing a hold above the 0.059 ETH support level. Also, unless $SOL falls below the next major support at 0.055 ETH, and makes a lower low, the trend is still up. The Stochastic RSI indicators on this high time frame are coming to the bottom. Once they turn back up, the momentum should swing back to $SOL. With this in mind, the possibilities are that $SOL moves back into the ascendency into Q3.

He pointed out that focusing only on getting XRP to $10,000 misses the point. Instead, he urged people to look at returns and real uses. This shift in perspective could change how investors see the token’s potential. Related Reading: Pepe Makes It To Trump’s Feed—Is A Crypto Endorsement Next? Emphasis On ROI Based on reports, Pantoja noted that wanting XRP at $10,000 is unrealistic. He said you can get the same gains without waiting for that sky-high price. For example, Bitcoin would need to hit over $300,000 to triple your stake if you bought it at today’s levels. But XRP only needs to reach about $8 from its current trading price near $2.30 to yield the same ROI. That’s a big gap. If you bought XRP at $2.30, a move to $8 feels more achievable—for some, at least. While Bitcoin’s market cap towers over others, XRP’s total value is around 7% of that of Bitcoin’s. This smaller size means it could swing more on positive news. Should I sell all my $XRP for $BTC Just got back from #bitcoinconference2025 pic.twitter.com/CobVAasjbC — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) May 30, 2025 Comparing Market Caps And Gains Bitcoin recently touched a new all-time high near $112,000. Meanwhile, XRP held around $2.30 in value. Investors pointed to this gap as proof that XRP had no momentum. But Pantoja reminded his audience that XRP climbed over 300% over the past year, while Bitcoin rose by 50% over the same period. Those figures show that past performance for XRP has outpaced Bitcoin’s in percentage terms. This is based on reports that track prices from June last year to now. Still, the wider market’s focus tends to follow Bitcoin’s chart. When BTC booms, altcoins often run too. But sometimes they trail behind or fall back harder. XRP’s Payment Use Case Based on reports around its network, XRP stands out for speed and cost. It can settle a payment in a matter of seconds and handle up to 1,500 transactions per second. That’s fast, especially when compared to the SWIFT network used by banks. Fees are low enough that moving funds across borders can cost mere pennies. Pantoja said this real-world utility is more valuable than hype. He urged investors to think about banks or money-service companies adopting XRP for cross-border transfers. Such adoption could drive demand more than price rumors ever will. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Max Keiser Isn’t Buying The Hype Around New Crypto Holding Companies Investor Perspective And Risks Meanwhile, investors shouldn’t ignore risks.

2025-06-03T11:00:34,"Shocking Coinbase Data Breach: Customer Data Compromised Since January","BitcoinWorld Shocking Coinbase Data Breach: Customer Data Compromised Since January Alarming news surfaces regarding the security of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. A significant Coinbase data breach reportedly occurred much earlier than previously disclosed, raising serious questions about transparency and customer protection in the crypto space. When Did Coinbase Know About the Data Breach? According to a Reuters report, citing sources familiar with the situation, crypto exchange Coinbase was allegedly informed about a leak of its Coinbase customer data as far back as January. This timeline is significantly earlier than the exchange’s public disclosures suggested. The incident reportedly involved an employee of TaskUs, a U.S.-based outsourcing firm that provides services for Coinbase. The employee, based in India, is suspected of secretly filming their work computer screen and subsequently providing customer information to hackers in exchange for payments. This discovery was reportedly communicated to Coinbase immediately upon detection. In response to the incident, Coinbase has since terminated the employment of hundreds of individuals believed to be connected to the security lapse. Understanding the Discrepancy: January Awareness vs. May Disclosure Coinbase’s own filings offer a different perspective on the timeline, at least in terms of the perceived scope of the issue. In a disclosure submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May, Coinbase acknowledged awareness of contractors accessing employee data “without business need” in recent months. However, Coinbase’s filing indicated that the exchange did not recognize this activity as part of a larger, coordinated hack until it received an extortion demand on May 11. This creates a notable gap between the reported January awareness of a specific data leak involving an outsourcing partner and the May date when the company acknowledged a broader hack linked to an extortion attempt. This discrepancy highlights the challenges large organizations face in identifying isolated security incidents versus recognizing a systemic compromise. It also raises questions about reporting protocols and the threshold for public or regulatory disclosure when potential Coinbase security vulnerabilities are identified through third parties. The Risks of Outsourcing for Crypto Exchange Security The incident underscores the inherent risks associated with outsourcing sensitive operations, particularly for platforms handling valuable digital assets and confidential Coinbase customer data . While outsourcing can offer cost efficiencies and scalability, it introduces external vectors for potential security breaches. Ensuring robust crypto exchange security requires extending stringent security protocols and oversight to third-party vendors and their employees who handle sensitive data. This includes comprehensive background checks, strict access controls, continuous monitoring, and clear protocols for reporting and responding to security incidents. The alleged TaskUs data leak serves as a stark reminder that the security perimeter of a major financial platform is only as strong as its weakest link, which can often reside within its network of service providers. What Does This Mean for Coinbase Users? For users, news of a data breach involving an outsourcing partner can be unsettling. While the full extent of the compromised data and the number of affected users are not explicitly detailed in the initial reports, any leak of customer information is a serious concern. Users should remain vigilant about potential phishing attempts or suspicious communications that might leverage leaked information. It is always recommended practice to enable strong security measures on your Coinbase account, including two-factor authentication (2FA), using strong, unique passwords, and being cautious of unsolicited requests for personal information. This event also puts pressure on Coinbase to provide clearer communication to its users about the incident, the data potentially affected, and the steps being taken to mitigate risks and prevent future occurrences. Conclusion: A Challenge for Trust in Crypto The report that Coinbase was aware of a data leak involving Coinbase customer data through an outsourcing firm employee as early as January, contrasting with their later public disclosures, presents a significant challenge for the exchange’s reputation and user trust. It highlights the complexities of maintaining robust crypto exchange security in a distributed operational model and the critical importance of timely and transparent communication regarding security incidents. While Coinbase has taken steps like terminating employees, the timeline of awareness versus disclosure will likely be a subject of continued scrutiny by regulators and the public. This incident serves as a vital case study for the entire cryptocurrency industry on the essential need for ironclad security protocols that extend to all third parties handling sensitive information.

2025-06-03T11:00:00,"Tether Backs $2.7B BTC Transfer and Launches Gold Token Across Chains","Tether is advancing its position in the real asset economy with two major strategic moves this week. The company transferred 25,812 BTC—valued at nearly $2.7 billion—to support Twenty One Capital, a new Bitcoin treasury firm founded by Strike CEO Jack Mallers. Simultaneously, Tether announced the launch of XAUt0, an omnichain version of its gold-backed stablecoin, in partnership with the TON Foundation. Tether and Bitfinex Transfer $2.7 Billion in Bitcoin to Twenty One Capital as Bold Treasury Strategy Unfolds In a headline-making transaction that’s setting the tone for the next era of corporate Bitcoin adoption, crypto powerhouses Tether and Bitfinex have transferred 25,812 BTC — worth nearly $2.7 billion — to a wallet publicly linked to Twenty One Capital, the new Bitcoin treasury venture spearheaded by Strike founder Jack Mallers. The transfer, now fully visible on blockchain explorers, represents a high-stakes pre-funding move as Twenty One Capital prepares for its official launch and equity raise. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether and CTO of Bitfinex, confirmed the transfer on X, describing it as part of the company’s pre-launch capital deployment strategy. With Bitcoin trading near $105,000 at the time of the transfer, the sheer size of the transaction cements Twenty One Capital’s entrance into the scene as not just ambitious, but institutionally backed at the highest level. At its core, Twenty One Capital is Mallers’ latest attempt to fuse Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos with the structured machinery of traditional capital markets. Drawing inspiration from Michael Saylor’s corporate playbook at MicroStrategy, Mallers envisions a company that holds up to 42,000 BTC, which would place it among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. Already, the firm has raised a staggering $685 million in equity and convertible notes from a consortium of backers that includes Tether, Bitfinex, and financial heavyweight SoftBank. And that’s just the beginning. The company plans to issue another $100 million in convertible notes, with proceeds earmarked specifically for Bitcoin acquisitions. Mallers emphasized that all purchased Bitcoin will be publicly tracked through wallet addresses, pushing for a new standard of transparency in corporate Bitcoin holdings. The goal is not only to accumulate BTC, but to do so in a way that is fully visible, verifiable, and immune to the obfuscation that has haunted the industry post-FTX. SPAC Merger to Take Twenty One Capital Public In a bold parallel move, Twenty One Capital is also preparing to go public via a merger with Cantor Equity Partners (CEP), a special purpose acquisition company. The merged entity is set to debut on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “XXI.” According to the official announcement, the valuation of the merger, $3.6 billion, is anchored to the average Bitcoin price of $84,863.57 at the time of the funding round. CEP’s shares rallied on the news, climbing 7% to $43 on Monday before spiking as high as $59.75, reflecting intense investor optimism around Bitcoin treasury models. This surge suggests a growing belief in Bitcoin's role as a strategic corporate asset, and faith in Mallers' execution capabilities. Whereas other crypto firms have been burned by accusations of opaque asset management, Mallers is betting big on visibility. As part of the announcement, Twenty One Capital has published a public Bitcoin wallet containing 4,812 BTC, a move designed to build early trust and reinforce the legitimacy of its reserve claims. Mallers confirmed that additional wallets will soon be revealed, including those holding Bitcoin for Tether, Bitfinex, and one on behalf of SoftBank. A Bet on Bitcoin—and Accountability While many institutional players cautiously test the waters, Twenty One Capital is diving in headfirst. Its strategy is not only bold in size, but also in structure. The firm intends to use a mix of equity financing and convertible debt to grow its BTC position, similar to Saylor’s MicroStrategy, but with one key difference: total on-chain transparency. The initiative also suggests a growing institutional appetite to back Bitcoin -native strategies with real-world capital. With the support of Bitfinex, Tether, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald-linked entities, Twenty One Capital is positioning itself not just as a treasury vehicle, but as a flagship for the Bitcoin-centric future of corporate finance. Tether Launches Omnichain Gold Token ”XAUt0” on TON to Expand Stablecoin Innovation In related news, Tether has unveiled a groundbreaking omnichain version of its gold-backed stablecoin, XAUt, through a new partnership with the TON Foundation. The token, dubbed “XAUt0,” has been launched on The Open Network (TON) and is designed to function across multiple blockchains using the Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard from interoperability protocol LayerZero. This strategic expansion positions Tether’s gold-backed token to compete not only in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space but also against traditional gold investment vehicles such as ETFs. It also mirrors the company’s recent approach with its omnichain dollar stablecoin, USDT0, which is already live across Optimism’s Superchain. Tether Brings Gold to the Multichain Era With over $829 million in market capitalization, XAUt is currently the largest gold-backed stablecoin in the world, slightly ahead of Paxos’s Pax Gold (PAXG), which holds a market cap of $809 million, according to CoinGecko . However, XAUt has thus far only existed on Ethereum, limiting its accessibility across rapidly growing blockchain ecosystems. Top gold-backed stablecoins by market cap (Source: GoinGecko) The launch of XAUt0 marks a new phase. By adopting the LayerZero OFT standard, Tether can now deploy its gold token to multiple chains without relying on bridging mechanisms or wrapping processes, which often raise security and transparency concerns. This allows holders of XAUt0 to transfer the token seamlessly across supported networks, beginning with TON, and likely expanding to others in the near future. Tether’s April 2024 deployment of USDt on TON set the stage for this deeper integration. Now, with XAUt0, the company is anchoring even harder assets into this expanding Layer-1 blockchain, which is natively integrated with Telegram and has seen rapid growth in user adoption. According to Tether’s Q1 2025 attestation report , the original XAUt token is backed by 7.7 tons of physical gold, all securely stored in a Swiss vault. Each token is backed by one troy ounce of gold, reflecting Tether’s commitment to full backing and transparency—an increasingly important differentiator in today’s volatile market environment. With XAUt0, Tether is expected to maintain the same underlying physical reserves while enabling broader accessibility and use across blockchain networks. While Ethereum has been the mainstay for stablecoins and tokenized assets, this new omnichain model may allow XAUt0 to be used in applications across emerging ecosystems, from gaming and NFT marketplaces on TON to DeFi protocols on Optimism and beyond. Parallels with USDT0 and Alloy Tether has already deployed its omnichain stablecoin USDT0, a bridged and interoperable version of USDt, across at least eight chains within Optimism’s Superchain ecosystem. The company is now applying the same crosschain logic to gold with XAUt0, representing a broader strategic vision: bring real-world assets to every corner of the multichain internet. The launch also follows the announcement of Alloy, Tether’s new synthetic stablecoin that’s backed by gold and pegged to the US dollar. Alloy represents a hybridization of two core value systems—fiat stability and hard-asset backing—while XAUt0 doubles down on physical backing with modern interoperability. XAUt0 is launching at a time when gold is experiencing a dramatic resurgence. Global macroeconomic instability, trade wars, and inflationary concerns have sent investors running to the oldest safe-haven asset in history. Competing with ETFs in the Digital Age Unlike gold ETFs, which require brokerage accounts and operate within market hours, XAUt0 can be traded 24/7 on any participating blockchain, and potentially integrated into smart contracts and DeFi applications. It also offers fractional ownership, borderless access, and seamless conversion via DEXs or CEXs supporting omnichain assets. Still, the challenge remains in convincing traditional investors that gold in tokenized form is secure, compliant, and trustworthy. Tether’s approach—backing the token with real, auditable reserves in Switzerland and publishing regular attestations—aims to bridge that gap.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9410/tether-backs-2-7-b-btc-transfer-and-launches-gold-token-across-chains,"BTC|FIAT|USDT|TON|XAUT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

According to popular crypto analyst Captain Faibik, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Faibik calls this a “make-or-break” moment for risky assets, mainly for Bitcoin & Gold. Let’s find out why! Crucial Support Zone For DXY In a recent tweet, Faibik shared a monthly chart of the DXY, showing the dollar stuck at the lower edge of an ascending channel that’s been in place since 2009. This critical support zone, ranging between 98.50 and 99.00 , has historically been tested multiple times before, often triggering a bounce. For Bitcoin investors, this is a major signal since the dollar’s strength or weakness often dictates Bitcoin’s price action. Meanwhile, Faibik calls this a “make-or-break” moment, if the dollar holds, Bitcoin could face continued headwinds; if it breaks, Bitcoin may see a strong bullish run. Possible Scenarios Ahead Looking at the possible scenarios, Faibik says that if the dollar holds this support and rebounds, it expects a move back to the 104–106 range in the coming months. That would mean renewed dollar strength, which typically adds pressure to assets like Bitcoin and gold. But, if the dollar closes below the channel, Faibik warns this could shatter the dollar’s long-term bullish momentum. A falling dollar to the 92–94 range would likely add fresh buying interest in Bitcoin. Fed’s Softening Monetary Policy On top of that, speaking at an event for the Fed’s International Finance (IF) Division, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed might slow down its strict money policies later this year. This is good news for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because less strict money rules often mean more money flows into riskier assets like crypto.

2025-06-03T10:58:27,"How to Do Cloud Mining in 2025: HashFly Review & Beginner’s Guide to Bitcoin Mining","Discover how to mine Bitcoin in 2025 with HashFly, the world’s leading cloud mining platform. Learn how to get started, earn daily crypto rewards, and explore flexible, eco-friendly mining contracts. Cloud mining has emerged as a compelling alternative for individuals seeking to profit from digital assets like Bitcoin without the complexities associated with traditional mining or trading. Platforms such as HashFly are at the forefront, offering accessible and potentially lucrative avenues for both novices and seasoned investors.​ The Appeal of Cloud Mining Cloud mining involves renting computing power from remote data centers to mine cryptocurrencies. This model eliminates the need for personal mining equipment, thereby reducing concerns related to hardware costs, maintenance, and energy consumption. In 2025, cloud mining has become particularly appealing due to several factors:​ Lower Upfront Costs: Traditional mining requires significant investment in hardware and infrastructure. Cloud mining allows users to participate without these substantial initial expenses. ​ Operational Efficiency: By outsourcing the technical aspects of mining to specialized providers, individuals can avoid the complexities of hardware setup and maintenance. ​ Accessibility: Cloud mining opens the door for those who may lack the technical expertise or resources to engage in traditional mining, democratizing access to cryptocurrency profits. ​ Regular Passive Income: Participants can earn a consistent stream of cryptocurrency rewards, providing a potential source of passive income. ​ Positive Outlook for the Cryptocurrency Market The cryptocurrency market in 2025 is experiencing transformative growth, bolstered by increased institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Analysts predict that Bitcoin could reach between $190,000 and $210,000 by the end of the year, driven by its finite supply and rising institutional demand. Additionally, the global market for cryptocurrency trends is projected to grow from $2.1 billion in 2024 to $5 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4%. ​ Cloud Mining vs. Traditional Trading While traditional cryptocurrency trading involves buying and selling digital assets to capitalize on price fluctuations, it requires a deep understanding of market dynamics and can be highly volatile. Cloud mining offers a more stable and predictable alternative:​ Predictable Returns: Cloud mining contracts often provide fixed returns, offering a level of predictability not typically found in trading. ​ Reduced Risk Exposure: By participating in mining, individuals can earn cryptocurrency rewards without being directly exposed to market volatility. ​ Diversification: Engaging in cloud mining allows investors to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolio, balancing the risks associated with trading. Comparing Cloud Mining to Other Crypto Income Models In the broader context of earning through crypto, cloud mining offers an attractive alternative to other models like staking, yield farming, or day trading. Each method has its own risk-reward dynamics: Staking requires locking up assets for a period of time and is generally limited to proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. While it’s relatively low-risk, the returns can be modest compared to cloud mining. Yield Farming, largely driven by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, is highly volatile and often exposed to smart contract risks, rug pulls, and impermanent loss. Day Trading, while potentially lucrative, demands constant monitoring, technical expertise, and a high tolerance for market volatility. Cloud mining , by contrast, provides a more passive and predictable income stream, especially for those who want exposure to the crypto economy without devoting full-time effort or technical know-how. And with platforms like HashFlyoffering contracts starting as low as $50, it also opens the door for low-risk experimentation. ​ HashFly: Leading the Way in Cloud Mining Founded in 2013, HashFly has established itself as a prominent player in the cloud mining industry, offering services for major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).

2025-06-03T10:54:38,"Bitcoin Fee Shock: $2 for $1.5B Transfer – Tether’s Twenty One Capital Revealed","The post Bitcoin Fee Shock: $2 for $1.5B Transfer – Tether’s Twenty One Capital Revealed appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A massive Bitcoin transfer earlier today turned heads across the crypto space. But what looked like an unexplained move is now part of a much bigger story. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has confirmed the 10,500 BTC, worth over $1.1 billion, was part of pre-funding for a new institutional Bitcoin fund called Twenty One Capital . Tether Group is moving 10500 BTC to address bc1qpzt4m58zzqgp84ktyuj5tz8g8k8ssg2g2d5eeerwhx4gxulqq5mqjzm5gc as part of the pre-funding of SoftBank's investment in Twenty One Capital (XXI) https://t.co/5PmG7w9TQ2 — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) June 3, 2025 More Than One Big Transfer The 10,500 BTC was just one of many large transactions. Over the last 48 hours, around 37,229 BTC have moved to new wallets. These include several transactions in the range of 14,000 BTC, 4,812 BTC, 7,000 BTC, and 917 BTC. All are reportedly linked to the same project, bringing the total value close to $4 billion based on today’s price. Inside Twenty One Capital Twenty One Capital is a new kind of fund focused on holding Bitcoin as its base asset. Instead of trading or speculation, the fund is designed to preserve value in BTC and then use it to expand into equities and debt markets. It follows a similar blueprint to MicroStrategy’s strategy but is launching before any IPO and is already backed by big names. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Norway’s NBX Joins Bitcoin Treasury Trend, Stock Jumps 138% , Backed by Big Players The fund has strong backing from Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank. Cantor Fitzgerald is also said to be involved, supporting the capital structure. Leading the initiative is Brandon Lutnick, who has been identified in investor materials as the son of the US Secretary of Commerce. Tether is committing $1.5 billion worth of BTC, while SoftBank is adding $900 million and Bitfinex is in for $600 million. An extra $550 million is expected to come from convertible debt and private placements. Why This Matters This is one of the clearest signs yet that Bitcoin is gaining momentum as a foundation for institutional finance. Tether’s deep involvement and SoftBank’s entry bring a new level of credibility and capital to the table. With real money already moving and big players behind it, Twenty One Capital could mark the beginning of a new wave of Bitcoin-based financial products. However, on the flip side, Crypto analyst Bit Paine highlighted that Tether paid just $2 in fees to move $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. He pointed out that this amounts to a fee of just 0.000000001 percent, likely the lowest ever seen in traditional or digital finance. Paine called it a clear sign that the Bitcoin blockchain is still massively underpriced. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-03T10:46:09,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Remittix, Pepe and XRP price predictions for 2025","Outstanding crypto price hikes make 2025 a standout year for investors. Bitcoin hit new all-time highs, kickstarting an altcoin season where one can make a killing if they invest in the right coins. This article examines the possible Bitcoin price trajectory as well as the profitability of these promising crypto projects for the rest of 2025. 1. Bitcoin (BTC) 2. Ethereum (ETH) 3. Solana (SOL) 4. Cardano (ADA) 5. Ripple (XRP) 6. Pepe Coin (PEPE) 7. Remittix (RTX) 1 – Bitcoin (BTC): institutional interest picks up The Bitcoin price has been sturdy and resilient for most parts of 2025. Even when most coins dipped following economic headwinds caused by Trump’s tariff wars, the Bitcoin price remained solid. Without any doubt, BTC has established itself as a dominant asset in the world of international finance. Source: Ecoinemetrics That is why institutional funds are flowing into Bitcoin. Corporate Bitcoin accumulation is already outpacing Bitcoin ETF inflows, and sovereign states like El Salvador are making Bitcoin a treasury currency. This is a game changer and it could propel Bitcoin price to as high as $200K this year. 2 – Ethereum (ETH): exciting developments to boost ETH price Ethereum’s Achilles Heel has been slow transaction speeds. To remain competitive and avoid being overtaken by the likes of Solana, ETH needs to scale. That is why Vitalik Buterin, ETH’s core co-founder, has decided to increase ETH’s throughput by 10x in the next year. The goal here is to boost Ethereum’s L1 capacity whilst maintaining its decentralization and other core qualities. After having such a tedious Q1, this bit of development could bolster ETH tremendously. Ethereum price over the last 3 months. Source: CoinGecko Ethereum currently trades around $2,500. As this development catches on and a new Ethereum network upgrade draws nearer, investors can expect ETH to break $3,000 or even higher as it enters a new era of speedy transactions. 3- Solana (SOL): surging momentum slows down, but long-term prospects remain solid Solana dipped slightly in the last fortnight, breaking key trend lines as the US tariff fears shake markets. Open interest in SOL is down; there’s been about $30 million in long liquidations, and the buy volume is weak. In essence, the SOL price chart points to a fading SOL momentum. Source: Tradingview However, Solana’s long-term fundamentals remain strong. The Firedancer upgrade will likely turbocharge the SOL price. Circle just minted an additional $250m USDC on Solana, and Solana processes 34% of all the stablecoin’s volume. Solana’s short-term momentum might be weak, but it’s got long-term potential. SOL could easily visit $200 before the year ends. 4 – Cardano (ADA): Hoskinson throws hints of new ADA era Cardano’s co-creator Charles Hoskinson has released a passionate statement that suggests a new era is on the way. Apart from denouncing Cardano’s toxic past, he also stated that ADA plans to bridge BTC without centralized exchanges. The goal is to lead the next wave of blockchain innovation and decentralized governance. Source: X New ADA projects like Midnight, Leios, and Midgard are expected to boost privacy and L1 performance. This could help Cardano dominate the Bitcoin DeFi space for the next couple of years and push the ADA price to new heights. But in the meantime, Cardano’s price chart hasn’t been very impressive. ADA has started bleeding on the monthly scene and is down by 50% year-to-date. 5 – XRP price prediction: Ripple awaits key bullish catalyst XRP price predictions aren’t as bullish as they were after investors realized the SEC would be less tough on it. Having failed to test $2.5, Ripple is trading just below the mid-Bollinger Band, with momentum indicators suggesting that things are cooling down for XRP. Source: Tradingview RSI stands around 38, which is near oversold territory. MACD is flat, and Bollinger bands are relatively narrow, which indicates low volatility. At the same time, though, it could mean that a solid XRP breakout could be brewing. XRP price predictions only need a big positive development, like the final resolution of its case with the SEC, to tip the odds in its favor. An event like that could send XRP price to $3 and potentially set a new ATH above $5. 6 – Pepe Coin (PEPE): vulnerability to crypto market whims remains a concern PEPE defied expectations in 2024 with its parabolic rise, but its 2025 outlook is split down the middle. CoinCodex sees a 25% dip to $0.000008866 by July, urging short-term caution. Yet by December, PEPE could rebound 21% to $0.00001364. Over the last month, PEPE is up by 35%, but high volatility means some turbulence lies ahead. The best-case scenario? A PEPE surge past $0.00001894, but only possible if meme-mania reignites. It pays to approach PEPE with caution, as it is a meme coin that lacks utility and dances to the whims of crypto speculations. 7 – Remittix (RTX): riding bullish market sentiments to $1 Remittix is an upcoming but exciting crypto project that directly addresses gaps in the global remittances market. Its “PayFi” protocol enables instant, low-cost crypto-to-fiat conversions, allowing users to send funds directly to bank accounts worldwide. This real-world utility differentiates it from many speculative tokens, including meme coins. As a result, crypto analysts are incredibly bullish on Remittix , with some projecting a remarkable 13,000% gain by 2025. The project’s presale currently goes for $0.0781 and has raised over $15 million, underscores strong investor confidence in its disruptive potential. When Remittix secures tier-1 exchange listings and expands its network, a price target of $1 to $5 in 2025 is possible. Potentially, the coin could hit $10 in the long term, given its massive target market.

2025-06-03T10:30:01,"Buterin Says Ethereum Will Explode in 2026 – The Best ERC-20 Tokens to Buy Before Ethereum Goes 10x","This may be the perfect time to look into the best ERC-20 tokens to buy before Ethereum goes 10x, which is what Vitalik Buterin hinted at recently. Buterin took the mic during the ETHGlobal Prague conference on May 30 to address some of Ethereum’s problems, which led to $ETH plummeting in the charts even when the rest of the altcoins were surging. One of the main problems? Network congestion during high-traffic periods, which results in subpar speeds and steep fees. According to Buterin, 2026 will be Ethereum’s year. What Will Change for Ethereum? Buterin believes that Ethereum is at a turning point to increase its performance and productivity tenfold, and that its native token could surge in 2026: ‘In general, I do think there’s a lot of room to scale safely. My view is that generally we should scale L1 by about 10x over the next year and a bit.’ —Vitalik Buterin, ETHGlobal Prague Conference Such an achievement could propel Ethereum into the best-performing blockchains league, allowing it to compete with the likes of Solana, which is getting an upgrade of its own in the form of the upcoming Layer-2 Solaxy ($SOLX) , in terms of speed and scalability. But while a Layer-2 upgrade could do Ethereum a lot of good in terms of performance, it would also come with a major downfall in the network’s projected market capitalization. According to Matthew Sigel, Ethereum could lose trillions in market cap if, when adopting its Layer-2 upgrade, it fails to balance its fundamentals. This could cause the projected $ETH price of $22K by 2030 to fall more in the ballpark of $7.3K, a cut of 67%. That being said, Sigel does recognize that changes are needed: ‘But I do agree that the changing fundamentals suggest a model update is in order. However, our original model assumed a 90:10 split on transaction revenue between Ethereum and L2s. The actuals are currently 10:90 in favor of L2s (past 4 months of data). This is a major change and shows L2s are taking more value from Ethereum.’ —Matthew Sigel, X Post But the gears are already in motion, as Ethereum has already announced its new Protocol R&D meant to upgrade the L1’s block space, scale blobs, and UX. This announcement comes in the context of Ethereum laying off staff during the restructuring of its Research and Development department to address criticism linked to the network’s poor performance. Buterin announced these changes back in January 2025 , with an ominous ‘We are indeed currently in the process of large changes to EF leadership structure.’ With Ethereum making big steps in the right direction, we’re already seeing increased investor confidence and interest, as $ETH has been in recovery mode over the past month. At the same time, some of the best altcoins today could also experience sustained growth, particularly, ERC-20 tokens. Here are three of the most promising crypto projects in 2025. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Layer-2 Upgrade Promising to Improve Solana’s Performance Solaxy ($SOLX) is Solana’s Layer-2 upgrade that promises to fix the network’s core issues: slow speeds, failed transactions, and steep network fees during peak activity times. Solaxy aims to achieve that via off-chain transaction processing, delivering ultra-low latency, infinite scalability, and near-instant execution, even in high-traffic environments. The project is under development, with the devs posting regular updates on the official website and social media, including the Testnet Bridge , Block Explorer , and the upcoming DEX. $SOLX’s presale is nearing the end, with a little over 13 days left until completion. This means the window for buying $SOLX at its presale price of $0.001744 is closing fast. With over $43M raised since its start, a clear roadmap, and explicit utility, Solaxy promises to hit the charts hard post-release. Our analysts predict a price point for $SOLX of $0.032 by the end of 2025. This amounts for an ROI of 1,734% if you buy at the current price. 2026 could see even more growth thanks to the increased adoption and Layer 2’s upgraded performance, taking $SOLX to $0.2 for an ROI of 11,367%. With the presale in its final stages, you can buy your $SOLX right now to take advantage of the early bird-exclusive price and the 93% dynamic APY. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Holders Will Receive $BTC Airdrops Based on Bitcoin’s Performance BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) rewards holders with $BTC airdrops as Bitcoin reaches key price points ($150K and $200K). An additional $BTCBULL airdrop, consisting of 10% of the total token supply, awaits holders when Bitcoin reaches the $250K threshold. BTC Bull Token is one of 2025’s most promising meme coins , born out of the idea that Bitcoin is destined for greatness. The whitepaper is based on the philosophy that $BTC will reach and exceed the $250K mark and even race towards a $1M valuation. With upcoming airdrops and a token burn mechanism detailed in its roadmap, BTC Bull Token shows great long-term potential. The presale is hot, having accumulated over $6.7M since its start, and is currently in its final 27 days. Based on our post-launch predictions, $BTCBULL could reach a price point of $0.006467 by the end of 2025, bringing you an ROI of 154% if you invest at the current price of $0.002545. With widespread community support, the token could witness even more push, taking it up to $0.0497 for an ROI of 1,852%. If you don’t want to miss the hype train, you can secure your $BTCBULL right now , before the presale ends, to potentially maximize your gains. Remember, you need to hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet if you want to qualify for the coming airdrops. 3. Cedar ($CDR) – Community-Driven Token Aiming to Reshape Solana’s Ecosystem Cedar ($CDR) is a community-driven token that aims to bring much-needed utility and innovation to the Solana network. The project relies on a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for governance, allowing investors to decide the project’s development route. The $CDR token is as hot as they come, after hitting the public charts today , June 3. The token price currently sits at $0.01699, but, because the listing is brand new, we don’t yet have essential data like a market cap or 24-hour trading volume. This means that $CDR could represent a great find for opportunistic investors who want to capitalize on the post-launch surge that many new listings experience. What Should We Expect from Ethereum in 2025? While Buterin predicts a 10x for Ethereum by the end of 2026, 2025 may not be a bad year either. $ETH is already up in charts by roughly 42% over the past month, showing sustained growth and consolidation. As expected, this will drive investor interest, which will also reflect onto the crypto market as a whole and the best ERC-20 tokens. Projects like Solaxy ($SOLX) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) could, then, witness positive post-launch chart performance, which makes investing in their presales a juicy opportunity. Remember, this isn’t financial advice. Always DYOR (Do Your Own Research), invest wisely, and protect your capital with good risk management strategies.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/best-erc-20-tokens-to-buy-before-ethereum-10x/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T10:29:40,"Bitcoin SV Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will BSV Price Hit $100?","The post Bitcoin SV Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will BSV Price Hit $100? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Market sentiment remains cautious as BSV struggles to gain traction. BSV has traded under the 200-day EMA band since early 2025, indicating a bearish trend. Analysts predict a gradual price increase, with potential highs reaching $175 by 2030. Bitcoin SV price (BSV) has been on muted growth trajectory compared to other altcoins. Since the beginning of the year, signaling prolonged bearish sentiment, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has consistently traded below its 200-day EMA band. Despite attempts to gain traction, the asset has failed to show any long-term bullish reversal, raising doubts among investors and traders about its recovery potential. Even it’s a non-profit organization, BSV association, optimistic activities like successful collaboration and hackathon events are not manifesting on the BSV price chartMany ask: “Can BSV Price break bearish trend above 200-day EMA?, “Is BSV a hidden gem waiting for its breakout, or just another risky bet?”. In this Bitcoin SV price prediction 2025 article, we’ll explore the future for BSV Price from 2025 through 2030. Table of Contents Overview Coinpedia’s Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2025 BSV Price Prediction 2025 Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2026-2030 BSV Coin Price Prediction 2026 Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2027 Bitcoin SV (BSV) Price Prediction 2028 BSV Crypto Price Prediction 2029 Bitcoin SV (BSV) Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV Token BSV Price $ 34.24172989 3.64% Market cap $ 680,512,435.5295 Circulating Supply 19,873,775.00 Trading Volume $ 115,487,786.8785 All-time high $491.64 on 16th April 2021 All-time low $23.30 on 10th June 2024 Coinpedia’s Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2025 Based on the historical data, price analysis, and broader market sentiments, the BSV price is expected to surge by the end of 2025. With an average of $86 , the BSV token price can hit a high of $117 and a low of $55. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 BSV Price Prediction 2025 A strong movement witnessed in Q4 2024 is now sorely missed by BSV investors. Despite several optimistic factors in Q2 2025, they weren’t enough to lift the crypto’s performance. Many had anticipated that BSV would reach the round number of $50, but it failed to meet that target by the end of April, dampening investor morale. In April, BSV reached as high as $47 but faced rejection at the resistance block and proceeded to form lower lows. The recent bearish crossover between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA signals increasing bearish pressure in the short term. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high and is consolidating above the $100K mark. In contrast, BSV continues to decline within a downward wedge, indicating that bears are gaining dominance over the bulls. If the current trend continues, BSV’s price could drop further toward the $30 level. However, there’s a key turning point—if BSV manages to flip the 200-day EMA band or break above the $42 price level, the trend could shift bullish. A decisive move above the 200-day EMA band might give BSV the momentum it needs to retest the $50 mark by the end of June. Furthermore, if this breakout is supported by increased adoption and BSV successfully clears the $50 resistance, the crypto could gain the momentum required to target $65 by the end of 2025.
