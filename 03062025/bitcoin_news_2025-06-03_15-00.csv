2025-06-03T12:55:09,"Chainlink Price Prediction Expert Confession: ‘I’ve Invested 30% of My Portfolio in Bitcoin Solaris – Here’s Why’","The post Chainlink Price Prediction Expert Confession: ‘I’ve Invested 30% of My Portfolio in Bitcoin Solaris – Here’s Why’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As someone who’s made a career out of crypto analysis, I’ve always kept a close eye on macro signals. Chainlink (LINK) was no exception. With strong institutional momentum, backed by SWIFT, JPMorgan, and the rollout of CCIP across Solana, its fundamentals looked promising. But when LINK stalled around the $14 mark and failed to decisively break resistance, I realized something was off. Institutional adoption was there, but the growth potential felt… limited. That’s when I started paying attention to Bitcoin Solaris. Chainlink Is Solid—But Bitcoin Solaris Hits Different Chainlink’s CCIP update is a major leap forward, unlocking billions in cross-chain liquidity. But from a pure investor standpoint, it’s a late-stage play. It’s established, it’s respected—but it’s no longer “early.” That’s where Bitcoin Solaris flipped the script for me. It didn’t just look promising—it felt like discovering Ethereum in 2016 or Solana in 2020. It wasn’t on everyone’s radar yet, but it had the structure, scalability, and momentum to redefine what an early-stage investment looks like. Why I Moved 30% of My Crypto Portfolio into BTC-S Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just another altcoin with a cool name. It’s engineered from the ground up to correct everything that’s broken with bloated chains, overhyped tokens, and zero-utility ecosystems. Here’s what made me shift a third of my portfolio: Hybrid Consensus System: The Base Layer leverages Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) for decentralized security, while the Application Layer utilizes Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) for blazing-fast speed. 10,000+ TPS Throughput: This is not a theoretical claim. It’s achieved using its layered structure, and finality hits in just 2 seconds. Mobile Mining Ready: With the upcoming Solaris Nova App, anyone can mine BTC-S right from their phone. Not “someday”—it’s already in rollout plans. Built-In Scarcity: Fixed supply of 21 million tokens. No inflationary nonsense. Just clean, transparent economics. Real Utility: BTC-S supports smart contracts, on-chain apps, and real-world use cases beyond hype. Add to that the fact that it’s been fully audited by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and with a KYC-verified team, I had no reason not to trust it. What Bitcoin Solaris Does That Chainlink Can’t (Yet) To give you context, here’s how I stack them side-by-side: Feature Chainlink Bitcoin Solaris Institutional Adoption Strong (SWIFT, JPMorgan, etc.) Emerging with grassroots credibility Speed & Scalability Moderate TPS 10,000+ TPS with 2-second finality Mining & Participation None Mobile, desktop & browser mining Consensus Mechanism Not applicable (oracle network) Dual-consensus: PoW + PoC & PoH + PoT Token Supply 1 billion LINK Fixed 21 million BTC-S Retail Accessibility Moderate Designed for everyday users Chainlink is an oracle. Bitcoin Solaris is an ecosystem. That’s the difference. The Presale Momentum Is Too Strong to Ignore Right now, BTC-S is in Phase 6 of its presale. Price: $6. Next stop? $7. With a launch price of $20 on the horizon, and only around 8 weeks left in one of crypto’s shortest presales ever, the momentum is unmistakable. Over 11,000+ users have already joined. More than $1.8M has been raised. If you’re reading this, you’re still early—but the window is closing. The Blockchain Revolution Just Went Mobile—Explore BTC-S Now My Personal Bet—and Why It’s Not Too Late for You I’ve analyzed hundreds of projects. Most fail not because of tech, but because of execution. Bitcoin Solaris is executing. From its architecture to its mobile-first accessibility, everything screams readiness. And that’s why 30% of my portfolio is now parked here. It’s not an emotional decision. It’s math, logic, and timing. If you’ve ever looked back and thought, “I should’ve bought Bitcoin under $100,” or “I missed Ethereum at $5,” this might be your chance to reset the clock. Final Thought: Don’t Let Familiarity Be Your Enemy Crypto loves to reward the early. It’s not always about what’s popular. It’s about what’s next. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a competitor to Chainlink—it’s a next-stage opportunity. A new playbook for wealth building, designed for those who missed the first waves. Don’t let the noise distract you from the quiet rise happening right now.

2025-06-03T12:54:28,"Here’s how Bitcoin will drop to $40,000, according to commodity strategist","Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone has warned that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could potentially fall to $40,000 despite currently trading above $100,000. McGlone tied his bearish outlook to broader macroeconomic trends, particularly the risk of deflation and a long-delayed recession that could weigh heavily on risk assets like Bitcoin, he said in an X post on June 3. He pointed to a recent peak in the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio in May, suggesting it may have topped out, especially if U.S. equity markets begin to decline. Bitcoin to gold ratio. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence “Bitcoin $40,000, Gold $4,000; Inflation vs. Deflation, Recession – The languishing price of Bitcoin vs. gold in 2025 may reflect anticipation of a typical cycle where deflation follows inflation,” he said. The ratio, which recently hovered around 33, could narrow significantly if gold strengthens and Bitcoin weakens, a scenario McGlone views as increasingly likely. While markets largely shrugged off recession fears in 2023, McGlone believes the economic downturn was postponed. Gold and S&P 500 price target In this case, investors may turn to traditional safe havens like gold if the economy contracts and the S&P 500 falls toward the 4,000 level. Therefore, gold could surge to $4,000 an ounce, and the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio could drop to around 10, implying a BTC price near $40,000. Such a decline would mark a 62% drop from its current price of $105,387. Bitcoin one-day price chart. Source: Finbold As Finbold reported , McGlone has emphasized the evolving relationship between Bitcoin and gold. He noted that gold’s recent outperformance of the S&P 500, despite competition from Bitcoin, could signal the early stages of a broader market correction. Notably, amid ongoing market uncertainty, including President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, gold has reached new highs while the stock market has experienced significant volatility. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has remained in consolidation above $100,000, recently hitting a record high of over $111,000.

2025-06-03T12:47:56,"Red alert: Cardano price at risk of crashing despite hitting transaction milestone","Cardano price remained in a tight range on Tuesday, June 3, even after the layer-1 network crossed a 110 million transaction milestone. Cardano ( ADA ) was trading at $0.6920, down 20% from its highest point in May. It is also hovering near its lowest level since May 8. ADA price wavered even as on-chain data shows that the network finally crossed the 110 million milestone in total transactions since inception. It handled over 31,000 transactions on Monday, up from 27,000 a day earlier. The rising transactions are a sign that the network is becoming more active, which is typically seen as bullish. Separate data from Santiment shows that the number of Cardano holders has jumped to 4.49 million, up from 4.46 million in May and 4.4 million in January. You might also like: Tether allocates 10,500 BTC for SoftBank’s investment into Twenty One Capital The daily active address count surged to over 60,000 in May and then moderated to over 30,000 in the past few days. These numbers suggest that Cardano is attracting users ahead of the NIGHT and DUSK airdrops. However, additional data shows that Cardano has lagged behind other layer-1 and layer-2 chains. For example, while Cardano has just crossed the 110 million transaction level, the recently launched Unichain has already processed 73.4 million. Berachain, another recently launched chain, has handled 117 million transactions in the past 12 months. Cardano also trails other chains on additional metrics. For instance, DEX protocols on its network have handled over $109.3 million in the past 30 days, while Unichain and Sonic have processed $12 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, over the same period. Cardano price technical analysis points to a deeper dive ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ADA price has dropped significantly in the past few weeks. This decline followed the formation of a double-top pattern at $0.8405. It has since fallen below the neckline at $0.7110, its lowest level on May 19. The coin has also formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have crossed each other, typically a strong bearish signal. Cardano has also formed a bearish flag chart pattern, consisting of a vertical line and a rectangle. Therefore, the coin will likely break lower, potentially retesting the key support at $0.5100, its lowest point in April.

2025-06-03T12:45:42,"Ethereum takes off as Bitcoin ETFs extend slide with $268M outflow","US Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) saw a $268 million outflow, while Ethereum-linked ETFs picked up the pace. Institutional appetite for Bitcoin cooled on Monday as BTC ETFs marked the third straight day of capital pullback. This drawdown signals a short-term dip in confidence among large players. The global digital assets market recorded a marginal surge over the last day as Bitcoin consolidated around the $105,000 level, stuck in a tight range that has dulled bullish momentum. The fear and greed index depicts that investors’ sentiment stood “Neutral” for now after being greedy for a couple of months. Wall Street swaps Bitcoin for Ether According to data , BlackRock’s IBIT led the way in withdrawals, posting $130.4 million of outflows, while ARK’s ARKB remained second in line with almost $74 million in outflows. However, IBIT’s cumulative inflow still stands strong at $48.44 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC saw $50.11 million and $16.47 million withdrawn from the funds, respectively. BTC ETFs recorded a net outflow of over $616.22 million on May 30. This fallback in ETF flows can be seen as a textbook response to price stagnation. Institutions often rotate capital during these consolidation phases, either into altcoins or risk-off assets. Bitcoin price surged marginally over the past day, meanwhile, it is still down by 4% over the past 7 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $105,269 at the press time with a trading volume of $43.88 billion. But while Bitcoin stalls, Ethereum is catching fire. 🚨 Institutional outflows persist — but is the tide turning? A third consecutive day of outflows was recorded, totaling $267.5M — slightly lower than the previous two days. Could this signal a slowdown in selling pressure? 👀 pic.twitter.com/y3p999Szg3 — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) June 3, 2025 ETH ETFs reported $78.17 million in net inflows on Monday. This extends their green streak to 11 consecutive trading days. Over the past week, Ether-linked investment products have attracted $321 million, their biggest haul since December. Data shows that BlackRock’s ETHA recorded $48.40 million of inflow in the last trading session. Its cumulative inflow stood at $4.65 billion. Fidelity’s FETH was the only other ETH-linked ETF that saw inflow. It posted an inflow of almost $30 million for the day. Ethereum price surged by more than 5% in the last 24 hours, leading the way for the altcoins. ETH surged to $2,650.18 before retracing slightly to around $2,600. Ether is trading at an average price of $2,607 as of press time. ARKB slashes share price The diverging flows between BTC and ETH ETFs are reflecting a shifting institutional narrative. As Bitcoin consolidates under heavy resistance, Ethereum is being viewed as a high-conviction bet. Amid all the uncertainty. ARK 21Shares US announced that it will execute a 3-for-1 share split of its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). This will be done to make shares more affordable and accessible, especially for retail investors. It will come into effect from June 16 at market opening. It added that the share split won’t affect the ETF’s NAV, ticker, or investment strategy, but it will reduce the per-share price to a third of its current level. ARKB closed Monday at $104.25, up nearly 27% this quarter. With Bitcoin ETFs pulling in $5.25 billion in May alone, and gold ETFs bleeding out, ARKB’s move could further solidify its position as a vehicle for both retail and institutional exposure to digital gold.

2025-06-03T12:36:27,"Bitcoin: Record Chase Will Continue","Summary Bitcoin surged from $74,434 to $112,000 by May 21, 2025, but pulled back to $103,127. Weekly charts target $125,000–130,000; daily charts show consolidation with support at $97,500–103,000. The global bond crisis and U.S. debt boost Bitcoin's appeal; sentiment and seasonality favor gains until mid-June. MicroStrategy's $84B Bitcoin plan drives prices but risks future losses. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) together with all those Bitcoin spot ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , BITO , ARKB , BITB , HODL , BRRR , EZBC , BITX and BTCW as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) has staged a stunning recovery since its April 6th, 2025, low of USD 74,434, surging past the USD 100,000 milestone to hit a new all-time high of USD 112,000 by May 21st. Driven by strong inflows into Bitcoin Spot ETFs, increasing institutional acceptance, and a supportive U.S. political climate under Donald Trump, the rally has been impressive. However, over the last few days, momentum has slowed down and Bitcoin has pulled back to around USD 103,000ish. Overall, Bitcoin is still holding comfortably above the important USD 100,000 mark, though. Review Since the panic low on April 6th, 2025, at USD 74,434, Bitcoin initially surged to around USD 86,000. This was followed by a week of sideways movement before another upward push propelled prices into the USD 93,000 to USD 97,000 range. A subsequent week-long consolidation preceded Bitcoin breaking through the psychological USD 100,000 barrier. Over the next 12 days, prices stabilized well above this level. Finally, on Wednesday, May 21st, Bitcoin broke out to a new all-time high. The upward momentum continued steadily, with the new peak now at USD 112,000. Due to the temporarily declining stock markets, Bitcoin lost its upward trajectory, however. Even though still trading comfortably above the psychological level of USD 100,000, Bitcoin has dropped back to USD 103,127 over the last 10 days. This well-deserved rest should lay the foundation for the next advance towards new all time-highs. Overall, the two-and-a-half-month correction in early April, when Bitcoin briefly fell below USD 75,000 amid collapsing stock markets, appears in hindsight to have been a healthy breather, as anticipated. The current rally is fueled by strong capital inflows into Bitcoin Spot ETFs, growing institutional adoption, and positive political signals, particularly from the crypto-friendly stance of the U.S. government under Donald Trump. Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US Dollar Weekly Chart: Price Target Around USD 125,000 to USD 130,000 Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of June 1st, 2025. (TradingView) The return to the neckline at approximately USD 75,000 and the strong rally over the past seven weeks have reaffirmed the large cup-and-handle formation on the weekly chart. This suggests Bitcoin is on track to reach our second price target for this formation, in the range of approximately USD 125,000 to USD 130,000. Given the recent dynamic upward movement and new all-time highs, this target could be achieved within the next four weeks already. However, we do not expect significant further price increases before the summer lull. Should Bitcoin have topped out already, your price target has to be postponed towards the 3rd or 4th quarter, though. The weekly Stochastic indicator is already in overbought territory, while the bulls still need to push the upper Bollinger Band (currently at USD 111,294) higher. Short-term consolidations or sharp but temporary pullbacks remain possible, as the bulls still have considerable work ahead. Overall, the weekly chart remains bullish despite being overbought. In fact, it is still pointing to a continuation of the upward trend toward USD 125,000 to USD 130,000. Only if the stock markets, which are closely correlated with Bitcoin, weaken again would a sustained drop below the psychological USD 100,000 mark call our optimistic outlook into question. Daily Chart: Short-Lived Consolidation above USD 100,000 Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of June 1st, 2025. (TradingView) On the daily chart, once the Stochastic oscillator had lost its embedded status on Friday 23rd of May, a short-term pullback started. So far, Bitcoin has pulled back towards USD 103,127. Our maximum price target for this healthy but probably short-lived pullback lies between approximately USD 103,000 and USD 97,500, as the rapidly rising 50-day moving average (USD 98,580) is already nearing current price levels. The lower daily Bollinger Band (USD 101,466) might stop the bears soon. Below that, the next strong support is the rising 200-day moving average (USD 94,814). Downside risk should thus remain very manageable. Overall, the daily chart is bearish in the short term, but the Stochastic oscillator is nearing oversold territory. Once the turning has been achieved, the probabilities for a rise to around USD 125,000 by early summer remain strong. Bitcoin Sentiment - Slightly Too Optimistic Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of June 1st, 2025. (Bitcoin Magazine Pro) The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently stands at 56 out of 100. Compared to the lows of 15 to 18 in early April, market sentiment has completely reversed. In hindsight, the contrarian setup assumed six weeks ago proved ideal. While the current sentiment is not yet excessively euphoric, it is somewhat overly optimistic. CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of May 22nd, 2025. (Coinmarketcap) The CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index from CoinMarketCap also indicates slightly elevated optimism. Overall, sentiment is on the path to euphoria, but there is still room before it becomes clearly excessive. Bitcoin Seasonality - Extremely Positive Until Mid-June Bitcoin Seasonality as of May 22nd, 2025. (Seasonax) This year, Bitcoin is following its seasonal pattern. As expected, the next upward move began in April. Based on the statistical price behavior of the past 15 years, this could continue into the second or third week of June. By mid- to end-June, we expect a potential top formation and a gradual transition into the weaker summer phase. Altcoins may continue to rise slightly longer than Bitcoin. However, if U.S. stock markets follow their classic ""Sell in May"" pattern, momentum could begin to wane rather soon. In summary, the seasonal outlook remains green until around mid-June. The next two to four weeks could bring strong Bitcoin price gains. Sound Money - Bitcoin vs. Gold (Bitcoin/Gold Ratio) Bitcoin/Gold-ratio, daily chart as of June 1st, 2025. (TradingView) With Bitcoin at around USD 105,000 and gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) at approximately USD3,301050 per troy ounce, one Bitcoin currently buys about 31.8 ounces of gold. Conversely, one ounce of gold costs about 0.031 Bitcoin. The last few weeks brought a significant recovery of over +35% for Bitcoin against gold since April 11th. From a low of around 25, the Bitcoin/Gold ratio has risen sharply to currently 32 over the past seven weeks. While gold prices consolidated sideways at a high level, Bitcoin's strong price surge drove the trend reversal in the ratio. After breaking out of a falling wedge, the ratio swiftly reclaimed its rising 200-day line (33). With this widely observed average acting as a barrier and probably soon as support, the ratio should start attempting to push higher. The next resistance zone awaits at around 35. If this is breached, a rise to the 39-40 range in the coming weeks is quite realistic. In summary, the Bitcoin/Gold ratio has clearly shifted in favor of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's outperformance against gold is likely to continue despite elevated volatility. If gold prices remain roughly at USD 3,300 and Bitcoin reaches our price target of around USD 125,000, a Bitcoin/Gold ratio of approximately 39-40 would be achieved. Macro Update - Japan as a Warning Sign of the Global Bond Crisis The global sovereign debt crisis is unfolding gradually before our eyes. Japanese Wholesale Rice Prices as of May 25th, 2025. (The Kobeissi Letter) In Japan, prices are rising sharply: wholesale rice prices surged by 98.4% year-over-year in April, the highest increase since 1971. Energy prices also rose by 9.3% after government subsidies ended in March. As a result, inflation (CPI excluding fresh food) climbed to 3.5% in April, marking the fifth consecutive month above 3%. Meanwhile, Japan's economy contracted by 0.7% in Q1 2025, the first decline in a year. Japan was the first developed nation to experiment with Quantitative Easing (QE) and Yield Curve Control (YCC) to keep interest rates low after the economic crash of the 1980s. With a debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 250%, Japan has been mired in economic stagnation for decades, akin to a patient on life support sustained by zero or negative interest rate policies (NIRP). The global money supply surge in response to the COVID-19 pandemic triggered inflation again, but attempts to raise interest rates led to the collapse of the Yen carry trade in August 2024, shaking global markets. On August 5th, 2024, Japan's stock market suffered its worst loss since 1987. New challenges, such as Trump's tariffs and negative GDP growth, show Japan remains trapped in crisis. Japan's Economic Crisis: Loss of Interest Rate Control and Rising Debt Burden Yield on 40-Year Japanese Government Bonds as of May 26th, 2025. (TradingView) The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasingly losing control, torn between fighting inflation and recession. Yield Curve Control, Japan's last trump card, which involves buying its own government bonds, is no longer effective, as long-term interest rates are becoming unmanageable. Nevertheless, the Japanese government plans to continue repurchasing 30- and 40-year government bonds, as their prices have plummeted in recent weeks, driving yields (and thus debt servicing costs) higher. The yield on 30-year Japanese government bonds surged by 100 basis points in just 45 days. Over USD 500 billion in 40-year bonds lost more than 20% of their value in six weeks. No one wants to hold these long-term bonds due to Japan's exorbitant debt levels and unfavorable demographics (a shrinking working-age population). Japan's Dilemma Bank of Japan Holds Over 50% of Japanese Government Bonds as of May 26th, 2025. (The Kobeissi Letter) These factors make productive debt repayment impossible; the only option would be to print more money, which would significantly devalue the Yen. Due to uncertainty, inflation risks, and systemic dangers, investors are avoiding these long-term bonds. The BoJ already holds 52% of all Japanese government bonds and has been the primary buyer of newly issued debt for decades due to lack of market demand. Amid the current crisis, Japan's Finance Ministry plans to reduce the issuance of long-term bonds and repurchase existing ones to prevent further price declines. However, this blocks genuine price discovery and violates free market principles. The funds for repurchasing are provided through additional money printing, further accelerating the yen devaluation. Japan faces a choice: accept falling bond prices and higher yields or print more Yen to repurchase bonds and support the market. Historically, governments sacrifice the currency to save the bond market, leading to inflation. This dynamic, visible in the world's fifth-largest economy, exposes the weaknesses of the global fiat system. U.S. Sovereign Debt Has Risen by 50% U.S. Sovereign Debt Costs as of April 9th, 2025. (Holger Zschäpitz) Japan serves as a serious warning signal, as all G7 nations may soon face similar challenges. For instance, U.S. sovereign debt has surged dramatically from USD 23 trillion in 2019 to over USD 36 trillion, a 50% increase. With a persistent deficit of approximately USD 2 trillion, the notion of a ""U.S. debt ceiling"" is a farce. Experts expect the ceiling to be raised soon, potentially pushing debt to USD 37 trillion. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. recently lost its last AAA credit rating after Moody's downgraded it from Aaa to Aa1 due to rising sovereign debt and higher interest burdens. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has posted one of its strongest recoveries, rising over 24% since April 7th. However, while the crack-up boom (a catastrophic rally driven by money supply expansion and loss of confidence) has regained momentum, numerous sectors of the U.S. economy are showing concerning signals. Over 6.5% of auto loan borrowers are at least 60 days delinquent, a historical high. Serious delinquencies (90+ days overdue) are also rising for mortgages, home equity loans, auto loans, credit cards, and student loans. Global Bond Crisis Global bond markets are gradually recognizing that yield curve control is increasingly failing. The illusion of debt sustainability is fading. Without yield curve control as a safeguard, the psychology of long-term debt security collapses, as the ""just do it like Japan"" strategy no longer works. This creates a dangerous cycle: rising interest rates exacerbate deficits, requiring more bond issuance, which in turn drives rates higher. The impact of this crisis extends far beyond Japan, as the country plays a key role in the global U.S. dollar system through the massive Yen carry trade. Stopping this vicious cycle would require political will on a scale never seen before. The Rise of Alternative Assets Unsurprisingly, gold, Bitcoin, and bond yields are rising independently of traditional financial indicators like rate cuts, inflation, or risk sentiment. For a few days, Bitcoin had recently surpassed Google (Alphabet, GOOGL ) in market capitalization. This underscores Bitcoin's growing significance as an asset class and shows markets are increasingly decoupling from traditional valuation metrics. Michael Saylor's Risky Bitcoin Bet A key driver of the Bitcoin boom is the aggressive strategy of Michael Saylor and his company, Strategy ( MSTR ) (formerly MicroStrategy), along with its imitators. Through the ""42/42 Plan,"" Saylor aims to raise USD 84 billion by 2027 via stock issuances and convertible bonds to buy more Bitcoin. This relies on risky financial instruments, including mispriced convertible bonds with unrealistically low volatility assumptions and yield-generating stocks that lack sustainable returns. Hedge funds exploit this mispricing through volatility arbitrage, buying the bonds, shorting the stock, and profiting without direct interest in Bitcoin. Saylor's model resembles a Ponzi scheme in parts, as the promised stock returns are funded by new investor capital rather than operational profits or sustainable revenue. As long as Bitcoin's price keeps rising, this structure holds; however, a price drop could lead to significant losses and instability. Instead of a solid Bitcoin reserve, this creates a highly speculative financial system based on arbitrage, speculative inflows, and a sustained price rally. The growing number of imitators drawn by this model's success suggests the next Bitcoin bear market could be particularly painful. Nevertheless, this artificial demand (leveraged buying) is likely to drive Bitcoin prices higher for now. The end of the rally is not yet in sight, and a full-blown buying panic is likely still to come. We currently expect this in the fall or Q4 2025. Conclusion: Bitcoin - Record Chase Will Continue Since the panic low of around USD 74,400 on April 6th, 2025, Bitcoin has staged an impressive recovery, decisively breaking through the psychologically significant USD 100,000 mark after a dynamic rally. On May 21st, it reached a new all-time high of USD 112,000 before the current pullback to USD 103,127 started. Technical analysis confirms the bullish momentum: the cup-and-handle formation on the weekly chart points to a price target of around USD 125,000 to USD 130,000, while the ongoing short-term consolidation should hold above USD 101,000. Sentiment is not yet overheated, and seasonality suggests continued positive momentum until mid- to end-June. Macro-economically, the global bond crisis, particularly Japan's Yen weakness and high inflation, as well as the U.S.'s record debt levels, enhance Bitcoin's appeal as an alternative asset. Michael Saylor's aggressive 42/42 Plan, aiming to raise USD 84 billion for Bitcoin purchases via convertible bonds and stock issuances, further fuels the rally but carries significant long-term risks. However, should the Bitcoin market turn, MicroStrategy and its imitators could face dramatic losses, potentially deepening the next bear market. Geopolitical and Other Risks to Bitcoin's Ascent Of course, the bullish thesis projecting Bitcoin to reach USD 150,000 by the end of 2025, driven by institutional adoption and its role as an inflation hedge, faces certain risks, with geopolitical instability posing a particularly acute threat. Severe geopolitical events, such as escalating conflicts like in Ukraine and the trade war, or a collapse in global economic stability, could disrupt Bitcoin's upward trajectory. While one could assume that global uncertainties may drive Bitcoin adoption, extreme scenarios, like a severe recession or credit market collapse, could trigger widespread liquidations of risk assets, including and especially Bitcoin, as investors prioritize liquidity. Macroeconomic pressures, such as rising bond yields (e.g., the 10-year Treasury yield above 4.75%), which could exacerbate selling pressure during geopolitical turmoil, may potentially push Bitcoin lower. While Bitcoin's fundamentals remain strong, these risks, particularly the unpredictable impact of geopolitical instability, demand careful monitoring to navigate the volatile path to USD 125,000 and USD 150,000. Overall, the short- to medium-term environment remains highly constructive, and we expect Bitcoin prices to continue rising in the coming weeks.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791943-bitcoin-record-chase-will-continue?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","IBIT|FBTC|BITO|ARKB|BITB|HODL|BRRR|EZBC|BITX|BTCW|GBTC|BTC-USD",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T12:35:32,"Ripple Price Analysis: XRP Risks Dumping to $1.6 as Bullish Momentum Lacks","XRP continues to show relative weakness in a recovering crypto market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum held key levels and bounced modestly, Ripple’s token remains in a corrective phase. Both the USDT and BTC pairs have broken key support trendlines, signaling potential for further downside if broader sentiment doesn’t improve. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair The XRP/USDT pair recently broke below its rising wedge formation after failing to reclaim the $2.80 resistance zone. The breakdown occurred with expanding sell-side pressure, driving the price toward the next demand zone around $2. This area aligns with the midline of the larger descending channel, making it a critical level to hold. If the price fails to rise back above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages around $2.40, the bearish structure remains intact. Moreover, the asset is now consolidating just under the wedge’s lower boundary, with no convincing bullish momentum showing up. The RSI sits around 40, reflecting weakening bullish momentum. If sellers continue to dominate, an even lower move toward the $1.60 support range is likely, where liquidity from previous accumulation exists. The BTC Pair In the BTC pair, XRP has broken below the key 2,100 SAT support area with low momentum. A potential breakdown from the falling wedge pattern and the earlier rejection from both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, located around the 2,500 SAT mark, suggests sellers are still in control. There is also no bullish divergence on RSI, which has dipped below 40, showing persistent weakness. The next major area of interest lies around the 1,900–1,700 SAT zone. This level marks the range of a prior imbalance (fair value gap), where a reaction could occur. If XRP fails to find support here, it risks slipping much lower toward 1,100 SAT, especially if Bitcoin dominance continues to rise.

In an interview with CNBC TV-18 , Ben Powell, chief of Middle East & APAC at BlackRock Investment Institute, says he’s looking at other regions to invest in as uncertainty builds in the US due to a weakening dollar and trade tensions. Says Powell, “Having all your eggs in one basket, even a beautiful basket like the US, feels a bit riskier.” The analyst says BlackRock is looking at emerging markets like India as potential candidates to outperform the US, noting strong labor force growth, technology gains, heightened geopolitical relevance and favorable demographic trends. “We like India, yes. We think India is the right side of a lot of these huge tectonic shifts that we’re seeing. So India, in terms of the geopolitics… Clearly, India is of course a kind of continent-sized country and economy, and everyone wants to be friends with India. It’s neck and neck at the moment but potentially India’s GDP will be overtaking Japan’s relatively soon in the next few quarters… And I still think, if I can say so, what some of the foreigners still fail to understand is the amazing technological productivity advances we’ve seen in India over the last years.” However, Powell also concedes that BlackRock is still overweight US equities and doesn’t discount the possibility that the American stock market can rip higher from here, noting that artificial intelligence (AI) can be the “megaforce” that can act as a tailwind that offsets other concerns in the market.

2025-06-03T12:31:22,"Crypto Regulations In Pakistan 2025","The post Crypto Regulations In Pakistan 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2025, Pakistan made a historic pivot from crypto skepticism to proactive regulation, marking a strategic shift in its digital finance landscape. The government introduced a legal framework aimed at embracing blockchain innovation, attracting foreign investments, and driving digital inclusion.

With established legal bodies like the PCC and PDAA , progressive tax policies, and the advisory leadership of Binance founder CZ , the country is now poised to lead in the global crypto movement. Millions of Pakistanis are embracing crypto through P2P transactions , stablecoins, and Bitcoin.

2025-06-03T12:30:20,"Bitcoin Price Crash: Why $107,500 And $103,500 Are The Levels To Watch","The Bitcoin price crash is in focus following the flagship crypto’s recent drop to as low as $103,700. Crypto analyst Captain Faibik has commented on why $107,500 and $103,500 are the most important levels to watch as BTC looks to decide its next move. Why $107,500 & $103,500 Are Key For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Captain Faibik explained that $107,500 and $103,500 are key as the bulls and bears battle to dictate the next move for the Bitcoin price. The analyst noted that later this week, BTC bulls will attempt to reclaim the $107,500 resistance and regain momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Break Down To $92,000 As It Enters Accumulation Phase He predicted that a clean break and hold above $107,500 could trigger a bullish leg toward the $117,000 level, which would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship crypto. Meanwhile, on the other hand, $103,500 is an important support level which the bulls must defend as the Bitcoin price eyes new highs. Captain Faibik warned that a breakdown below could shift momentum back in favor of the bears. The Bitcoin price had surged above $106,000 on May 2 following news about the US decision to extend its pause of tariffs on some Chinese goods to August. This provided a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto after Donald Trump stated last week that China had violated the trade deal with the US. Trump and China’s president are set to have a call later this week, which could further boost the Bitcoin price if both sides could resolve any dispute regarding the current trade deal. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell failed to discuss the economy during his speech at the International Finance Division Anniversary Conference, which also continues to fuel market uncertainty. First Step For BTC Is To Get Back Above $106,500 In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital indicated that the first step is for the Bitcoin price to successfully reclaim $106,500. He noted that BTC had recorded a weekly close below this level, which puts the flagship crypto back in the danger zone. The analyst further remarked that BTC needs to get back above this level in the coming days or things can get “sketchy looking.” Kevin Capital added that this has been a key level for months, and nothing has changed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rise To $111,000 ATH Doesn’t Mean The Market Is Bullish, Certified Expert Says Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto revealed that a Katana is forming on the weekly chart for the Bitcoin price. He explained that in Ichimoku analysis, a Katana forms when Tenkan and Kijun overlap. This signals low momentum and market equilibrium. He added that this development also precedes strong directional moves, with an expansion or pullback on the horizon. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,435, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Each of these could have a big impact on the crypto market, especially Bitcoin and altcoins. 6th June: Non-Farm Payrolls & Unemployment Rate On June 6th, all eyes will be on the Non-Farm Payrolls report and the updated unemployment rate. In April, the US added 177,000 jobs and kept unemployment steady at 4.2%. This time, economists expect a smaller gain of 130,000 jobs. If job growth slows more than expected, the Federal Reserve might decide to ease up on its strict money policies. A weaker dollar could then make Bitcoin more attractive for those seeking safe havens during market uncertainty 11th June — CPI Inflation Report Next up, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May will be released on June 11th. This report is one of the most important inflation indicators in the US. In April, inflation cooled to 2.3%, slightly below the 2.4% forecast. For May, analysts expect inflation to rise back to 2.4%. If inflation stays in check or falls, the Fed may consider cutting interest rates, creating a more positive environment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies 12th June – PPI Inflation Report The next day, June 12th, brings the Producer Price Index (PPI) report. This report tracks how much manufacturers charge for goods. In April, PPI inflation was at 2.4%, slightly below forecasts. For June, analysts expect a small rise to 2.5% 17th June – FOMC Minutes June 17th is a big day. As it brings the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes. Investors will look closely at these notes for hints about future policy. Current possibilty suggest a 95% chance that the Fed will leave rates unchanged in June. However, any sign that the Fed is considering easier policies later this year could be bullish for Bitcoin. 17th June — U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes Also on June 17, the US will release the Import and Export Price Indexes. These indexes measure changes in prices of goods traded internationally. In April, the Import Price Index was steady at 0.1%.

2025-06-03T12:14:31,"Why BTC whales are quietly moving to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for 25x returns","Today, Bitcoin (BTC) whales and large institutional holders are increasingly seeking smarter ways to generate passive income without sacrificing their core holdings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol, has quietly emerged as a preferred destination for these smart investors. Offering a combination of secure, flexible lending and borrowing options with a highly innovative token utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to deliver substantial returns and unparalleled asset control. Unlocking liquidity without selling Bitcoin (BTC) One of the most attractive features for Bitcoin (BTC) holders migrating to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the ability to borrow against their BTC holdings rather than sell them. This strategy allows whales to access liquidity for new investments or operational expenses without triggering taxable events or losing exposure to future price appreciation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates through a unique non-custodial smart contract system where users lock their crypto assets as collateral and receive over-collateralized loans in stablecoins or other supported tokens. The power of mtTokens: passive Income on locked assets When lenders deposit assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or DAI into Mutuum’s liquidity pools, they receive tokenized representations called mtTokens. These mtTokens are not just proof of deposit — they continuously accrue interest, allowing holders to watch their investments grow passively over time. For example, depositing $10,000 worth of ETH into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s pools yields a dynamic annual interest rate based on real-time market utilization. As demand for borrowing rises, the yield on deposited funds increases, making it a highly rewarding option for long-term holders. Whales appreciate this system because it provides a liquid stake in the platform without losing control over their funds. When lenders decide to withdraw, they redeem their mtTokens for their principal plus accrued interest, assuming sufficient liquidity in the pool. This setup removes typical liquidity risks associated with centralized lending. Diverse lending models: P2C and P2P Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers both pool-based (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models. While P2C allows users to lend and borrow from shared liquidity pools with dynamically adjusted interest rates, P2P lending enables users to negotiate custom loan terms directly with other participants. This flexibility is critical for institutions looking to lend or borrow rare or volatile tokens that may not be available in general pools. Significantly, P2P loans often include popular memecoins such as PEPE, DOGE, or SHIB—assets typically excluded from P2C pools due to their high volatility. This broadens earning opportunities and allows whales to diversify their lending strategies, balancing risk and reward effectively. MUTM token: the heart of the ecosystem At the center of this ecosystem is the MUTM token, with a total supply capped at 4 billion tokens. Currently priced at $0.03 during Phase 5 of its presale, MUTM has already generated approximately $9.8 million in value, boasting over 11,500 holders. This remarkable growth is a clear signal that the market recognizes Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s potential. Beyond trading and staking, the token plays a vital role in the protocol’s revenue-sharing mechanism. A portion of platform fees is used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them as passive dividends to users staking mtTokens in designated contracts. This creates a powerful feedback loop where loyal participants receive continuous rewards simply by engaging with the protocol. Moreover, the upcoming beta launch promises to unlock more functionalities tied directly to MUTM. The ongoing $100K giveaway further energizes the community, attracting new users and fostering deeper engagement. Security and transparency: CertiK audit and decentralized custody Institutional investors demand the highest security standards, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers. The platform’s smart contracts have undergone a rigorous audit by CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm, including manual reviews and static analysis. Mutuum earned a respectable Token Scan Score of 70.00, reflecting a strong security posture with ongoing improvement plans. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a fully non-custodial protocol. This means user funds are stored on-chain in decentralized smart contracts, eliminating counterparty risks often found in centralized lending platforms. Users retain full control over their collateral and lending positions, reducing the threat of hacks or mismanagement. This trustless environment is a critical factor attracting large-scale Bitcoin (BTC) holders and institutions who prioritize asset safety. Roadmap and future developments: building a scalable DeFi powerhouse By the time the MUTM token goes live, users can expect the beta version of the Mutuum platform, providing early access to lending, borrowing, and staking features. Subsequent phases will include exchange listings, platform launch, bug bounty programs, and expansion across multiple blockchain networks, opening new opportunities for cross-chain liquidity. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is actively developing a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin designed to offer users a low-volatility borrowing option backed entirely by on-chain assets within the protocol. Unlike traditional stablecoins relying on fiat reserves or centralized issuers, this stablecoin will use transparent algorithmic mechanisms to maintain its peg and enhance platform sustainability by funneling interest payments back into the ecosystem. Complementing this, Mutuum’s integration of Layer 2 solutions aims to significantly reduce transaction fees and increase speed, addressing common DeFi pain points like network congestion and high gas costs. Together, these innovations will improve usability and scalability, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a more efficient and accessible platform for everyday users and advanced traders alike. Why now is the time to get in With Phase 5 MUTM tokens priced at $0.03 and a phase one token price of $0.01, early investors have already seen a 200% gain on their initial entry. This rapid growth, combined with the substantial $9.8 million generated so far, highlights the momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built. Waiting until later presale phases means buying tokens at a higher price, reducing potential upside and diluting early-mover advantages. For Bitcoin (BTC) whales, locking up BTC in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a rare blend of capital preservation, tax efficiency, and compelling yield generation. Add the benefits of tokenized liquidity through mtTokens and ongoing passive MUTM dividends, and you have a formula for outsized returns in a secure, decentralized environment.

A new tax law will significantly impact capital gains, especially for high-net-worth individuals , and is expected to reshape how investors manage both traditional and digital assets. Australia Crypto Tax Law Targets Unrealized Gains A major policy shift, dubbed “landmark” by analyst Fred Krueger , introduces a capital gains tax on unrealized gains for the 2025–2026 fiscal year. This new rule will apply to assets exceeding 3 million AUD (about US$2 million ), including stocks, real estate, and digital assets like Bitcoin . The tax— up to 15% —will apply even if the gains exist only on paper and have not been realized by selling the assets. The rationale? Officials argue these taxes are essential to fill budget gaps . Ripple CTO David Schwartz offered a long-term strategy, suggesting that investors could use their appreciated assets as loan collateral rather than liquidating them. Backlash From Experts The move has not gone unchallenged. Critics warn it may reduce investor confidence and harm Australia’s economic appeal.

2025-06-03T12:05:04,"Does This Bitcoin Price Dump Signal The End Of The Bull Market? Whale Wallets Are Still Accumulating These XRP Rivals","The Bitcoin price drop has prompted many people to ask if it marks the end of the bull market or if it is simply pausing for a while. While most investors are panicking, whale wallets are still acting discreetly but taking action. Their targets? Sui Crypto and Remittix, two promising tokens that want to rival XRP, gaining attention despite the drop in the market. Whales appear to be betting against the instability of the Bitcoin price, watching Sui Crypto’s rising DEX volumes alongside Remittix’s promising remittance technology. Bitcoin Price Dip Sparks Panic Bitcoin’s decline to $104,910 as of June 1, 2025, has caused doubts about the bull market. According to experts, several factors, including geopolitical issues and economic problems are responsible for this, even though Bitcoin price still boasts 50% annual growth. Source: CoinMarketCap Traders holding the asset have been selling, which indicates that the cycle is mature. As the Bitcoin price looks to rise above $107,000, short-term holders are looking to cut their exposure, showing that the bull market is at its peak. Analysts have also predicted a drop before the asset hits another high, noting that the bull market may be postponed. There is also the issue of regulatory changes. The SEC recently dropped its complaint against Binance, showing that they intend to cooperate with these platforms under the Trump administration. The House of Representatives also introduced the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act to regulate digital assets, with analysts noting that it could be a big win for the crypto market, especially the Bitcoin price. Despite reports of a recent Bitcoin price drop, previous trends and current data have shown that the bulls may have temporarily paused their activities for now. Why Smart Money Is Flowing Into Sui Crypto Whale wallets are buying Sui Crypto, a token that is rivaling XRP, indicating trust from investors. Sui’s 80% price jump in the past month, touching around $3.27 as of June 1, 2025, and DEX volumes rising above that of other big companies drove the rise. Source: TradingView The fundamentals of Sui Crypto remain strong despite the asset seeing a 16% price fall after the $223 million Cetus Protocol hack. The Sui Foundation’s assistance and its community’s belief have kept the price of the token up, with technical indicators showing it could hit a record high. As institutional interest grows, Canary Capital filed an ETF linked to Sui, showing a belief in the regulatory approval under the new United States administration. Analysts believe this will help Sui Crypto’s legitimacy with traditional investors. Sui Crypto is starting to show that it can be stronger than XRP as whales have been buying a lot of the tokens. Technical indicators, institutional interest, and increasing usage show that Sui Crypto can grow in the crypto industry. Remittix: The XRP Rival Turning Simplicity into Global Crypto Utility Remittix, a new XRP rival, is quietly making its way up in the crypto market by showing its practical value, while the market is being dominated by established tokens like the Bitcoin price. It enables users to send more than 100 digital assets to bank accounts globally, converting them into fiat currencies. There are no hidden fee charges, wallet confusion, or intermediate stages. The platform makes it easy for businesses to accept digital assets and settle them in fiat using Remittix’s API, which works for both fiat and crypto pairs. The process is easy to use and has been attracting early fiat investors. With almost $15.5 million raised and the token still in presale, RTX has a good chance of becoming a major player in the cross-border payments market and eventually surpassing XRP. Conclusion The market is presently on alert due to the issues surrounding the Bitcoin price. Whales are turning to projects like Sui Crypto and Remittix, XRP rivals, for hope in the market. Remittix, with its $0.0781 entry price and aim to simplify crypto conversions, is attracting the most whales. This has caused some analysts to call it the next breakout token in the market. In a few days, over 66% of the tokens have been sold out in its current presale round, showing that new and experienced traders are bullish about the token.

2025-06-03T12:04:08,"What to Expect for XRP Price in the Coming Days? Pump or Dump? Analyst Explains All Possibilities!","Following US President Donald Trump's victory in November 2024, the rally in XRP, one of the altcoins that rose the most along with Bitcoin )=, has slowed down. XRP, which rose to over $3 with a big rise, fell below $2 due to tariff tensions in April. After gaining $2, XRP continued to stay above this level, while the XRP open interest approached $5 billion. While this indicates increased speculative activity in the derivatives market, it is also seen as a sign that strong volatility may be experienced in XRP. Speaking to CoinDesk, Bitget Chief Market Analyst Ryan Lee stated that XRP open interest has risen to around $5 billion. Ryan Lee warned investors who are short, stating that if the increase in XRP open interest is combined with a possible XRP price increase, a short squeeze could occur. “Over the weekend, XRP open interest rose to nearly $5 billion. This means that investors engaged in significant speculative activity in the derivatives market. “Such a rapid increase in open interest is indicative of strong potential momentum as market participants prepare for decisive moves.” In contrast, the analyst said that long positions could be in danger if there is no clear catalyst to push the XRP price higher, and that long positions could be liquidated en masse. This is also likely to increase downward pressure on the XRP price. “Without a clear catalyst for XRP, open interest could be liquidated in either direction. If long positions are liquidated, downside pressure could intensify,” Lee said. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What to Expect for XRP Price in the Coming Days? Pump or Dump?

After an upcoming rally in June, the self-proclaimed best memecoin is back in the spotlight, proving that it’s far from a passing fad. But while Pepe dominates headlines, Unilabs is redefining what smart crypto investing looks like. It is bringing the power of AI in the world of assets management, providing game-changing features to even retail traders. Continue reading this article to find out more about it. Pepe Coin Price Analysis: A Surprising 40% Rally in June Pepe coin price has regained popularity following a swift revival from a brief drop. The currently best meme coin is trading over $0.000013 after a 40% surge in the last month. Pepe coin price recently dipped close to $0.000012, but straight recovered owing to heavy buying activity at key support levels. This recovery could point toward a bigger market surge for this best meme coin. A famous analyst predicts that the Pepe coin price will skyrocket after Bitcoin surpasses $120,000. During the recent massive Bitcoin surge, Pepe’s market capitalization skyrocketed from $400 million to $4 billion, providing investors with a 10x return in just one month. The analyst thinks that PEPE, the best meme coin, which has a market capitalization of $5 billion, would rise by a lesser but still significant 3x. Assuming this trend continues, the Pepe coin price might reach $0.000045. The forecast sees Pepe as tightly linked to Bitcoin and forecasts that the best meme coin will gain significantly in the coming weeks. Over a 4-hour period, the Pepe coin price is currently trading at about $0.00001439. The Pepe coin price remains below important resistance levels of $0.000015 and $0.000017, which are crucial for confirming an upward trend. However, the MACD indicator recently generated a bullish signal when the MACD line crossed over the signal line. Based on this, it appears that buyers are building momentum, which might lead to price spikes soon. The AI-Powered Assets Management Era: Unilabs Finance With the Pepe coin price riding high, Unilabs is smartly positioning itself as a stronger, more utility-packed contender. Unilabs is the world’s first AI-backed hedge fund manager. As of Q2 of 2025, Unilabs already has over $30 million in Assets Under Management (AUM), which shows the high investor interest in its ecosystem, despite being a fresh project. The platform’s highlighted features include a proprietary AI tool called EASS (Early Access Scoring System). It analyzes new crypto tokens using metrics like team credibility, market momentum, and profit potential. With it, investors can find promising projects before they surge parabolically. This helps them stay ahead of the market with early access to hidden gems. Another leading feature is its breakthrough Memecoin Identification Tool. It will scan blockchain data and social signals to detect trending meme coins before they take a ride to the moon. This feature allows retail investors to get a rare edge in spotting early-stage meme coins that could deliver 50x or even 100x ROI. The best part about UNIL is its four AI-powered specialized funds: the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund. Investors get a broad exposure via this and can invest in any one of these according to their risk level and diversify their portfolio for higher returns. PEPE vs Unilabs: Next Market Leader? Even though the Pepe coin price is bullish in recent weeks, Unilabs offers something meaningful with real-world utility and multi-strategy income tools. While PEPE remains a speculative token that is boosted by internet trends only, Unilabs is built for active and profitable investment options with tools for retail traders that were once reserved for institutional traders only. Unilabs blends DeFi tokens with traditional asset logic. This way, investors who want crypto growth can have a hybrid portfolio without leaving conventional investment strategies behind. Its native token UNIL is currently in its presale phase. The presale is a super-hit as its total funding nears the $2M mark in only 2 presale rounds. Each UNIL token is currently priced at $0.0051 only, a highly discounted price for this high-potential project.

2025-06-03T12:00:35,"XRP Ledger Payments Count Falls to Lowest Since October as XRP Fails to Keep With Bitcoin","Activity on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized public blockchain designed for quick, cost-effective real-time transfer of XRP, fiat currencies and other digital assets, has slowed considerably since the first quarter. The number of payment transactions, representing the transfer of value from one account to another, dropped to 320,747 at press time, the lowest since October and significantly down from the average of over 1 million observed through March, April, and early May, according to data source XRPScan . The number of active addresses also fell under 10,000, also the lowest since October. Meanwhile, the number of XRP burned as fees dropped to a multi-month low of 1,500 XRP, coinciding with a slowdown in the creation of new accounts. Account creators need to deposit 1 XRP, which can be reclaimed following the deletion of the account. The slowdown follows an impressive first quarter during which payment transactions surged by an impressive 36% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, according to data tracked by Messari. Meanwhile, active addresses registered a 142% growth. Positive outlook The Messari report was optimistic about XRP Ledger's prospects, citing an increase in institutional adoption through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. In April, Ripple, which leverages the XRP Ledger to provide payment solutions, Hidden Road, making it the first crypto company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker. Early today, Ripple's enterprise-grade RLUSD stablecoin received the green light from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), opening doors for its use in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). More announcements could hit the wires next week during Ripple's XRP Ledger Apex 2025 event, which will take place in Singapore from June 10 to 12. XRP struggles to keep pace with bitcoin Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, recently rose to new lifetime highs above $110,000, marking a surge of over 40% from its early April lows near $75,000. The stellar recovery also lifted the broader market higher, with XRP jumping from $1.60 to $2.60, a 62% increase, according to CoinDesk data. However, the rally in the payments-focused token has stalled since then, falling well short of its peak of around $3.40 registered in January when BTC set its then-lifetime peak of $109K. The divergence indicates that XRP is not benefitting from bitcoin's new highs the same way it did earlier this year. It could be a sign of waning demand for XRP, suggesting caution, as a potential downturn in Bitcoin could weigh heavily on XRP's price.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/03/xrp-ledger-payments-count-crashes-to-lowest-since-october-as-xrp-fails-to-keep-with-bitcoin,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP","Markets|XRP Ledger|XRP|Bitcoin|Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T12:00:32,"$162M of the $257M hackers stole in May was either frozen or recovered","Hackers ramped up their activity in May, stealing a total of $257M in several high-profile attacks. About $162M of the stolen funds were intercepted, with the potential of reimbursing holders. SlowMist counted 15 major hacking incidents in May, with a total haul of $257M. The major hack for the month was the Cetus Protocol DEX exploit, losing $230M due to flawed smart contracts. The hack also led to a fast vote to freeze over $160M on the SUI blockchain, then claw back the funds from the hacker wallets. The SlowMist report counted a higher end sum for all exploits, compared to PeckShield’s estimates of $244M for the past month. Cork Protocol lost $12M due to flawed validation of user-supplied data, allowing the hacker to make use of flawed pricing. The third-biggest hack was added at the last moment. The Taiwanese BitoPro exchange admitted outflows of $11.5M in a multi-chain hack, with ongoing transactions. However, BitoPro did not announce the hacks immediately, and only admitted the losses when ZachXBT noted the suspicious transactions. DPRK hackers join the attack on r etail and small wallets Two smaller hacks involved Demex, with a loss of $950K due to oracle manipulation, and Zunami Protocol, losing $500K from a still unclear exploit. According to SlowMist , smart contract flaws were the main cause of losses in 95% of hacking cases. For the past month, a total of six social media accounts were compromised, leading to losses from meme token shilling or social engineering. Hijacked X accounts have slowed down lately, but are still a vector for reaching potential targets. Individual phishing scams were also active in the past month. A total of $9.6M was stolen from 7,164 victims. According to SlowMist, Lazarus Group is now targeting individuals with large wallets, taking up to $5.2M from a single victim through malware. The exploit targeted a merchant with a notable crypto wallet. SlowMist issued a warning to merchants accepting crypto to avoid exposure of their main wallets. The other potential victim class are retail buyers involved with on-chain merchants. Marinade Finance led to SOL reward losses Although not explicitly a hack, Marinade Finance was also a source of losses in May, due to protocol flaws. The project allowed validators to only bid with dust amounts of SOL while receiving disproportionate rewards. As a result, validators took more SOL than they deposited, leading to losses for mSOL holders that staked with Marinade Finance. Marinade Finance allowed validators to bid high for block production, but then drop their bid and only deposit dust. Despite this, Marinade Finance still allowed the release of rewards for security and block production. This meant that malicious validators could gain significant passive income with minimal investments. Based on rough estimates, those validators took as much as 3.4M SOL, which was once again staked and received additional rewards. The main reason was that the Marinade Finance code did not in fact remove low bidders as promised. The exploit ran for 126 Solana epochs, or more than three months, before the potential for unfair gains was noticed.

2025-06-03T11:56:26,"Bitcoin Still Bullish Despite Dump: BTC Bull Token to Explode in 2025?","Bitcoin rose 50% in 45 days from April into May, before reaching a new all-time-high just shy of $112K. Since then, it’s fallen 6% , sitting now right at $105K. Was the ATH a rare surge, and have Bitcoin’s fundamentals returned to something more pessimistic? Or is this a temporary pullback with strong support underneath? Evidence points more to the latter, especially with news that Bitcoin miners in Nigeria are addressing one of the longest-standing objections to crypto. And that could set Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin meme coin BTC Bull token, up for big moves in the weeks to come. Bitcoin Goes Green in Nigeria, Answers Longstanding Criticism Nigerian startup Green Flare aims to take environmentally-damaging natural gas flares (burn-offs) and turn them into Bitcoin . Specifically, they’ll use the energy generated by burning off the natural gas to power large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. Once the three-stage project is completed, it will generate 53MW of energy for Bitcoin mining rigs. Burning off gas from oil production is a leading producer of greenhouse gases, including methane. And Nigeria ranks in the top 10 for gas flaring emissions , accounting for 75% of global flaring, according to World Bank’s 2023 data. At the same time, producing Bitcoin required so much energy that, in 2023, total global Bitcoin mining operations would have ranked 27th in the world in energy consumption . According to the same UN report, 66% of the energy used to mine Bitcoin came from fossil fuels. In light of this data, Green Flare’s plan makes perfect sense. Offsetting Bitcoin’s emissions footprint by capturing and using energy that would otherwise have been wasted? A great plan, if we’ve ever seen one Two of the three sites should be live by Q4 of 2025. The investment shows the increasing maturity of the crypto and Bitcoin economies. Despite Pullback, Bitcoin Remains ‘Structurally Strong’ According to the experts at Bitfinex, Bitcoin is undergoing its first meaningful correction since the April lows, cooling off after a relentless 50 percent surge that took the asset from $74,501 to a new All-Time High of $111,880. The current pullback reflects a change in tempo, following nearly 50 days of uninterrupted upside marked by minimal retracements. — Bitfinex, Bitfinex Alpha The pullback is more than a technical correction; the ‘TACO’ phenomenon – for ‘Trump Always Chickens Out – continues to keep tariffs and the trade economy in a state of uncertainty and volatility. That impacts Bitcoin directly and indirectly. More disposable income encourages retail traders, while higher Treasury rates often cause risk-adverse investors to shift towards T-bills and away from Bitcoin. But despite the external and internal factors leading to the correction, Bitfinex reports: We believe Bitcoin remains structurally strong. This correction appears to be a healthy reset rather than a breakdown —Bitfinex, Bitfinex Alpha Trump’s TACO moves might be a sign of instability, or galaxy-brained chess moves; either way, Bitcoin looks strong beneath the surface, and poised for future growth. When it does head back up, will it take BTC Bull Token with it? BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – First-Ever Bitcoin Meme Coin with $BTC Airdrop BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) comes loaded with features designed to keep Bitcoin and its bullish buddy moving in tandem up the crypto charts: Regular token burns to incentivise $BTCBULL price increase (at $125K, $175K, and $225K) Token airdrops – including $BTC airdrops – to rewards project participants 14-day ‘cooling-off’ period during the presale when investors can return tokens (think of it as a ‘money-back guarantee’) It’s all designed to encourage participation in one of the most innovative crypto presales currently available.

In light of current market trends and blockchain developments, we’ve asked Google Gemini AI about the direction it thinks the digital asset will go and its potential price by June 30, 2025. According to Gemini, the projected Cardano (ADA) is projected to trade between $1.1 and $1.8 by the end of June. The AI’s prediction is based on a combination of market momentum, Cardano’s technical and ecosystem progress, and broader cryptocurrency sector dynamics. Factors Supporting This Forecast Gemini outlines five core factors behind its forecast: Market Momentum and Bitcoin Performance: The AI notes that historically, altcoins like Cardano tend to perform better after Bitcoin enters the later stages of a bull market. Gemini points out that BTC set a favorable backdrop already, and as its dominance weakens , altcoins often experience notable price surges. Ecosystem Development : While acknowledging that Cardano has grown slowly, Gemini recognizes the gradual development and upgrades. Despite these developments, it notes that ADA “still lags behind Ethereum and Solana” in terms of DeFi and NFT utilization, which could limit its short-term upside. Regulatory Landscape and Institutional Adoption : Gemini considers regulatory clarity an influential factor. Not all assets share XRP’s regulatory clarity , and the AI states that Cardano may perform better under moderate regulatory conditions. However, stricter regulations could reduce speculative inflows and dampen growth. Community and Governance Factors: Cardano’s decentralized governance , especially with the Voltaire phase, is viewed positively by Gemini. It suggests this governance shift could stimulate renewed interest in the network. Nonetheless, the AI cautions that reliance on formal methods and peer-reviewed development may hinder its competitive pace relative to more agile platforms. Competitive Pressure and Risks: Gemini highlights the intense competition Cardano faces from other Layer 1 blockchains. Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Avalanche continue to attract more developer activity and capital. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Potential Targets for Cardano (ADA) In addition to the forecasted price range, Gemini also provides a probability distribution for ADA’s price outcomes by June 30. The chatbot listed a 20% chance of remaining below $1, a 60% chance of trading between $1 and $1.8, a 15% chance of trading between $1.8 and $3, and a 5% chance of rising above $3. The most probable scenario, according to the AI, is that Cardano will trade between $1 and $1.8. However, the recent increase in whale activity suggests that the asset may shock investors and aim for higher targets.

After attending the XRP Las Vegas event, King shared a bold prediction that’s making waves across the industry: “The next two years will change crypto forever.” From clear regulations to rising institutional interest, King believes we’re entering a turning point that will push crypto into its next major chapter. XRP Las Vegas confirmed one thing: the next 2 years will change crypto forever. Regulatory clarity is coming. Institutions are leaning in. Adoption and growth are about to accelerate substantially. For those who missed it, here's an overview — first off, the most important… pic.twitter.com/UBn0pzvg5h — Austin King (@OnchainAustin) June 2, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Is Almost Here According to King, the U.S. government is finally getting closer to providing clear crypto regulations. This could be a major breakthrough for the industry, which has spent years operating under uncertainty. He sees this aligning with the growing involvement of major financial players. Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have already launched Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy continues to gain traction. King believes this shift will help legitimize crypto in a way that unlocks long-term growth and adoption. Institutions Are Changing Their Tune King also reflected on how much has changed in the past decade. He noted that for years, crypto had to defend itself against criticism from central banks, regulators, and traditional financial institutions that didn’t believe in it. Now, many of those same institutions are investing. Tesla’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in 2021, followed by some selling, and involvement from companies like SpaceX show how institutional interest is growing fast. King called it a “stunning pivot,” and said this shift is creating some of the biggest opportunities he’s ever seen in his eight years in crypto. Real Projects Will Lead the Next Wave King also pointed out that a major change is happening within the industry itself. For years, many crypto companies focused heavily on marketing without delivering real value. But now, that’s starting to shift. King believes we’ll soon see a big move of capital away from hype-based projects and into those creating real-world impact. “Over the next 2 years, you’ll see a significant amount of liquidity rotate from marketing-based companies to projects driving real-world impact,” he predicted. This gives forward-thinking networks a huge edge. Crypto Has a Big Role to Play King is hopeful about the future of cryptocurrency as he sees it as a reconstruction of the global financial system. The sector is expected to grow at an exceptional rate as adoption picks up speed and stability approaches.

So if individually altcoins will bleed to Bitcoin, then collectively they should as well, and that’s the reason why I think alt/Bitcoin pairs will eventually find themselves down here [at 0.25]. I think it’s just a matter of time.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube A move toward the support area highlighted by Cowen would signal that altcoins are significantly underperforming Bitcoin. Cowen also points out that altcoins are in a multi-year downtrend against Bitcoin with no signs of reversing the trend anytime soon. “I don’t know exactly when alt/Bitcoin pairs are going to go to the range lows. I can’t tell you that, but what I can say is what you’re witnessing is basically the slow conversion of people holding alts and then they are just converting them to Bitcoin… The chart tells you what’s happening. Alts put in a new low against Bitcoin [on June 1st]. So any prior altseason that was called for, any prior call for a low by alt/Bitcoin pairs up until today was wrong.” TOTAL3/BTC is currently hovering at 0.33.

2025-06-03T11:30:48,"Brandon Gill’s Late Bitcoin Disclosure Sparks Congressional Transparency Concerns","BitcoinWorld Brandon Gill’s Late Bitcoin Disclosure Sparks Congressional Transparency Concerns The world of cryptocurrency often intersects with the corridors of power, and sometimes, those intersections reveal bumps in the road. A recent instance involving Texas Representative Brandon Gill has brought the spotlight onto lawmaker financial disclosures, specifically concerning digital assets like Bitcoin. News surfaced that Rep. Gill failed to report significant Bitcoin purchases within the required timeframe under a key transparency law, sparking debate and raising questions about adherence to regulations designed to prevent conflicts of interest. Who is Brandon Gill and What Happened with His Bitcoin Disclosure? Representative Brandon Gill , a Republican from Texas, recently drew attention not for his legislative work, but for his financial dealings. Reports indicate that Rep. Gill purchased a substantial amount of Bitcoin, potentially valued at up to $500,000. While members of Congress are permitted to buy and sell assets, they are mandated by law to disclose these transactions publicly and promptly. In this case, the issue wasn’t the purchase itself, but the timing of the required disclosure. According to reports from Decrypt and other sources, Rep. Gill’s filing for these Bitcoin purchases came significantly later than the 45-day window stipulated by federal law. This late Bitcoin disclosure immediately raised eyebrows, particularly given the increasing focus on financial transparency among elected officials and the growing interest in cryptocurrency within political circles. Understanding the STOCK Act: The Rules of the Game The law at the heart of this matter is the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, commonly known as the STOCK Act . Enacted in 2012 and later amended, this bipartisan law was designed to combat insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees by requiring timely reporting of stock, bond, and commodity futures transactions, and later expanded to include other securities and assets. Key requirements of the STOCK Act include: Timely Disclosure: Members of Congress and certain employees must publicly disclose any purchase, sale, or exchange of stocks, bonds, commodity futures, and other securities exceeding $1,000 within 45 days of the transaction. Public Availability: These disclosures must be made available to the public in an easily searchable, sortable, and downloadable format (typically online). Purpose: The primary goal is to increase transparency and deter lawmakers from trading based on non-public information they might obtain through their official duties. The intent is clear: to allow the public and watchdog groups to monitor lawmakers’ financial activities and identify potential conflicts of interest. Rep. Gill’s late filing directly contravenes the timely disclosure requirement of the STOCK Act . Why Timely Disclosure Matters for Congressional Transparency At its core, the requirement for timely financial disclosure is about fostering Congressional transparency . The public has a right to know if their representatives are making investment decisions that could be influenced by, or could influence, their legislative actions. This is particularly crucial in rapidly evolving sectors like cryptocurrency, where government policy can have a dramatic impact on asset values. When disclosures are delayed, it creates a cloud of suspicion. It makes it harder for the public and ethics watchdogs to connect potential dots between a lawmaker’s votes, committee assignments, or public statements and their personal financial gains or losses. Late disclosures, like the one concerning Rep. Gill’s Bitcoin, undermine trust in the integrity of the legislative process and fuel concerns that lawmakers might be prioritizing personal wealth over public service. The challenges with the STOCK Act ‘s enforcement also come into sharp focus here. While the law mandates disclosure, the penalty for a late filing is a mere $200 fine. Furthermore, this fine is often waived by ethics committees, especially for first-time offenders or if the filing is eventually made. Critics argue that such a negligible penalty does little to incentivize strict adherence to the rules, effectively making the 45-day deadline more of a suggestion than a strict requirement for those who can afford the minor fee or expect it to be waived. The Position of Crypto Lawmakers and Potential Conflicts The case of Rep. Gill also highlights the unique position of Crypto lawmakers – those who are actively involved in discussions or legislation concerning digital assets while also holding significant personal investments in them. There’s an ongoing debate about whether lawmakers should hold individual stocks or assets in industries they oversee. For Crypto lawmakers , this is particularly sensitive. As Congress grapples with how to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the policy decisions made on Capitol Hill can profoundly impact the value of these assets. A lawmaker holding a large amount of Bitcoin who then votes on legislation that benefits Bitcoin could face accusations of a conflict of interest, even if their vote was based on genuine policy beliefs. While owning an asset class isn’t inherently wrong, the potential for perceived or actual conflicts necessitates strict adherence to transparency rules. Timely disclosure allows the public to assess these potential conflicts for themselves. Delays, especially from Crypto lawmakers , can erode confidence and fuel narratives that personal financial interests are influencing policy decisions. Beyond the Fine: Broader Implications and the Push for Stricter Rules Rep. Gill’s late Bitcoin disclosure is not an isolated incident; numerous lawmakers from both parties have faced scrutiny for late or incomplete financial disclosures over the years, involving various types of assets. However, the focus on cryptocurrency adds a modern dimension to this persistent issue. This incident reignites the broader discussion about strengthening congressional ethics rules. Many advocacy groups and some lawmakers are pushing for more stringent measures, such as: Increased Penalties: Raising the fine for late disclosures significantly to provide a real deterrent. Mandatory Blind Trusts: Requiring lawmakers to place their assets into a blind trust managed by a third party, preventing them from having direct control or knowledge of specific trades. Outright Ban on Individual Stock Trading: Prohibiting members of Congress from trading individual stocks altogether, allowing them only to invest in diversified mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While a complete ban or mandatory blind trusts face political hurdles, incidents like the late Bitcoin disclosure by Rep. Gill provide further ammunition for those arguing that the current rules, particularly the minimal penalties under the STOCK Act , are insufficient to ensure true Congressional transparency and prevent potential conflicts among Crypto lawmakers and others. Conclusion: The Need for Punctuality in Congressional Finance The case of Texas Representative Brandon Gill and his late Bitcoin disclosure serves as a timely reminder of the importance of the STOCK Act and the ongoing need for robust Congressional transparency . While the specific amount of the fine may be small, the principle at stake is significant: maintaining public trust by ensuring lawmakers are open about their financial dealings, especially in areas like cryptocurrency that intersect with their legislative responsibilities. As the world of digital assets continues to grow, the scrutiny on Crypto lawmakers ‘ holdings and disclosures will only intensify. Adhering strictly to the 45-day deadline isn’t just a bureaucratic step; it’s a fundamental requirement for ethical governance and preserving confidence in the institutions that shape our laws.

2025-06-03T11:30:07,"Norway’s NBX Stock Rockets 138% After Surprise Bitcoin Treasury Buy — What’s Next for the BTC Price?","Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) shares surged over 138% in a single day after the Oslo-based crypto exchange revealed it had begun adding Bitcoin to its treasury. Key Takeaways: NBX stock surged 138% after announcing its first Bitcoin treasury purchase. The exchange plans to use BTC reserves to back a Cardano-based stablecoin and expand crypto lending. Bitcoin is consolidating above $105K, with a potential breakout target near $108K if momentum builds. On June 2, NBX announced the purchase of 6 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at roughly $633,700 at current prices, with plans to increase its holdings to 10 BTC by the end of June. The company said it is also in discussions to raise additional capital to expand its Bitcoin position further. NBX Shares Soar 138.5% After Bitcoin Treasury Move Following the news, NBX shares jumped 138.5%, closing at €0.033 ($0.038), according to Google Finance. Though still far below its all-time high of €0.93 ($1.06), reached in January 2022, the stock’s sharp rally reflects renewed investor appetite for Bitcoin-aligned firms. NBX said its Bitcoin reserves will be used as collateral to issue USDM, a stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain, while generating yield within the Cardano ecosystem. The company added that Bitcoin is becoming “an important part of the global financial infrastructure” and that it aims to leverage the holdings to enhance operational efficiency and attract institutional capital. The firm also plans to offer Bitcoin-backed loans, as part of a broader strategy to establish itself as a leading digital asset bank. NBX is not the first Norwegian company to embrace Bitcoin. In 2021, Norwegian industrial giant Aker ASA launched Seetee, a Bitcoin-focused subsidiary. JUST IN: Norwegian Block Exchange becomes the first publicly traded #Bitcoin treasury company in the country pic.twitter.com/kY9KK2VbFi — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 2, 2025 Aker holds 1,170 BTC, purchased at an average cost of $50,200, now valued at around $123 million, according to Bitcointreasuries.net. Elsewhere in Norway, crypto brokerage K33 recently raised 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) to acquire Bitcoin for its own balance sheet. Meanwhile, Norges Bank, Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund, indirectly holds 3,821 BTC through its equity investments. Globally, companies adding Bitcoin to their treasuries have often seen strong stock market reactions. Paris-based Blockchain Group’s stock soared 225% after it began accumulating Bitcoin in November, while Indonesian fintech DigiAsia Corp shares climbed 91% after unveiling a $100 million Bitcoin buying plan. Overall, corporate Bitcoin treasuries now hold more than 3 million BTC, valued at over $342 billion, according to Bitbo data. BTC Consolidates Above $105K as Bulls Eye Breakout Bitcoin is trading steady around $105,300, showing resilience above key support levels after a volatile week. On the 2-hour chart, BTC remains range-bound between $103,800 and $106,300, with Bollinger Bands tightening. RSI at 52.94 suggests a neutral stance, while the MACD is turning slightly bullish, hinting at potential upside momentum. The 30-minute chart paints a similar picture. BTC continues to consolidate between $104,600 and $106,200, with RSI hovering around 51.11 — signaling indecision. MACD remains flat, indicating that neither buyers nor sellers are in control in the short term. Zooming into the 1-minute chart, BTC has recovered from early session lows, climbing steadily back toward $105,360. RSI is currently elevated at 60.29, suggesting slight bullish pressure, while MACD has crossed into positive territory, confirming short-term upward momentum. Overall, BTC’s near-term outlook remains constructive as long as it holds above the $104,600–$105,000 range. A break above $106,300 could open the door toward $108,000. On the downside, losing $104,600 could trigger a retest of $103,000 support.

2025-06-03T11:23:03,"Strategy: The Bitcoin-Treasury Flywheel Is Spinning Into Overdrive","Summary MicroStrategy's aggressive bitcoin accumulation, now over 580,000 BTC, transforms it into a leveraged, regulated ETF on digital scarcity with significant upside potential. Subscription software revenue is accelerating, driven by AI integration, supporting a dual-engine growth model of software and bitcoin appreciation. Capital-raising prowess enables ongoing bitcoin purchases, with dilution risks mitigated as long as bitcoin per share outpaces share growth. Despite headline valuation multiples, I see MSTR as undervalued for investors bullish on bitcoin and AI, with 50% upside over the cycle. Introduction MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has spent the past four years transforming itself from a midsized business-intelligence vendor into the world's largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin, and its first-quarter 2025 results show that the pivot is accelerating rather than stalling. During the quarter the company added 301,335 coins, lifting total holdings to 553,555 BTC and then, in early June, to 580,955 BTC at an average purchase price of roughly $70,000 per coin . At a spot price hovering near $105,000, that trove is worth about $61 billion, dwarfing MicroStrategy's legacy software revenue base and anchoring a balance sheet that now looks more like a sovereign wealth fund than a traditional tech company. Yet, the software engine that once defined MicroStrategy still matters. Subscription services revenue jumped 62% year over year to $37 million even as total revenue slipped 3.6% to $111 million, indicating that the shift to cloud analytics is gaining traction in spite of headline volatility tied to digital-asset accounting. Management is plainly leaning into the model: a new $21 billion at-the-market equity program and $7.7 billion of gross capital raised in Q1 provide the financial firepower to keep buying bitcoin while incrementally funding R&D that embeds AI functionality into the firm's analytics suite. Thesis AI is ushering in an age of digital abundance, driving down the marginal cost of knowledge work and tempting central banks to monetize faster productivity by expanding the money supply. As real yields compress, investors are seeking scarce, hard-coded stores of value. Bitcoin, with its fixed 21 million-coin cap, stands out as the only digital asset offering built-in monetary discipline. Against that backdrop, MicroStrategy's decision to convert cash flows, balance-sheet liquidity and even fresh capital raises into bitcoin is radical but coherent: the company is effectively a leveraged, regulated ETF on a deflationary reserve asset, wrapped inside a still-profitable software vendor. The strategy gives shareholders two engines of compounding of organic software growth and externally financed bitcoin appreciation, each reinforcing the other in a world where AI lifts GDP but erodes the purchasing power of fiat savings. Strategy Bitcoin as Treasury Alpha MicroStrategy now controls approximately 2.8% of all bitcoin that will ever exist, compared with 0.9% just two years ago. Because the company capitalizes these purchases primarily through equity and convertible-debt issuance, the effective cost of carrying the position is the discount between its share price and intrinsic bitcoin value. With BTC at $105,000, MicroStrategy's $101.8 billion market capitalization trades at a roughly 1.7x multiple of coin value, which is far below the 8x EV/revenue multiples that cloud-software peers command. This implies that investors are paying a modest premium for the embedded analytics franchise and future coin accretion. Equally important, MicroStrategy's proprietary ""BTC Yield"" metric (bitcoin earned through active treasury management such as futures basis trades) reached 13.7% year-to-date, prompting management to lift its 2025 target to 25%. In effect, the company is monetizing financial expertise to compound holdings faster than simple buy-and-hold investors, creating a positive feedback loop: the more coins it owns, the more optionality it has to generate incremental yield without risking principal. Strategy Software Resilience in an AI-First Era While bitcoin dominates headlines, the core analytics platform is quietly re-accelerating. Subscription services revenue rose to $37.1 million, accounting for a record 33% of total sales, as enterprises adopt cloud-native versions of the MicroStrategy One platform to embed generative AI into dashboards and mobile workflows. Management highlighted new AI governance modules allowing customers to watermark LLM outputs and audit data lineage, differentiating the product in a crowded BI field now chasing ChatGPT-style features. Gross margin slipped to 69% from 74% a year ago as the firm scaled cloud infrastructure and absorbed higher AI inference costs, yet remains comfortably above the 60% level typical of BI peers. That elasticity suggests room for margin expansion once AI features mature and pricing tiers adjust. Even after the bitcoin pivot, R&D intensity stayed near 18% of revenue, underscoring a commitment to product relevance that supports the bullish case of ""software plus scarce asset"" rather than ""bitcoin shell."" Capital Markets Execution Access to deep capital pools is the flywheel powering MicroStrategy's accumulation strategy. The company raised $4.4 billion via common-stock issuance in Q1 and a further $2.2 billion in April, bringing total net proceeds since January to $7.7 billion. The newly filed $21 billion ATM ensures that every rally in the share price can be opportunistically tapped for fresh bitcoin dry powder, effectively turning equity volatility into treasury alpha. Critics argue that dilution erodes per-share value, but so long as the incremental coins purchased with each dollar of issuance outpace share growth, existing holders capture net bitcoin per share. Q1 data confirm the math: shares outstanding rose 49% year over year, yet bitcoin holdings jumped 119% over the same period, lifting coin-per-share by roughly 47% . Few corporate-finance strategies deliver that kind of asymmetric scaling. Strategy Financials Total Q1 revenue declined 3.6% to $111.1 million as legacy product support continued its predictable slide, but subscription growth more than offset license softness, keeping software ARR flat sequentially. Gross profit of $77.1 million produced a 69% margin, down 460 basis points from last year, primarily on cloud transition expenses rather than competitive pricing pressure. On the balance sheet, cash rose to $60.3 million from $38.1 million at year-end thanks to equity sales, while free cash flow was a manageable negative $11.1 million given heavy AI R&D spend. Enterprise value sits near $110 billion against trailing-twelve-month EBITDA of -$7.6 billion, rendering EV/EBITDA optically meaningless; however, strip out non-cash digital-asset valuation swings and core software EBITDA remains positive, suggesting that traditional multiples understate operating optionality. Guidance is qualitative but aggressive: management expects ""BTC Yield"" to reach 25% and ""BTC $ Gain"" to hit $15 billion by year-end if macro liquidity stays supportive. Even if subscription revenue merely grows in mid-single digits, the embedded leverage to bitcoin price could drive book-value expansion far exceeding software peers' growth rates. Risks Bitcoin's price path remains the single largest swing factor. A steep drawdown, like a 50% retracement toward $50,000, would inflict mark-to-market losses approaching $30 billion and amplify the GAAP net-loss optics that already spooked investors this quarter. Although new FASB fair-value rules allow upward revaluation in bull markets, they also force quarterly impairments in bear cycles, potentially pressuring sentiment even if cash flow stays intact. Dilution is a second-order concern. If the share price underperforms bitcoin for an extended period, raising equity to buy coins could actually decrease bitcoin per share, reversing the current virtuous cycle. The firm must therefore maintain precise timing discipline in its ATM program. Regulatory headwinds also loom: the SEC's evolving stance on spot-bitcoin ETFs and corporate crypto disclosures could impose higher compliance costs or limit future capital raises. Finally, software execution cannot be ignored. Should the analytics platform fail to keep pace with AI-native competitors, the non-bitcoin segment could slip into structural decline, depriving MicroStrategy of an operating hedge against crypto volatility. Conclusion At roughly $372 per share, MicroStrategy trades at 1.7x the market value of its 581 thousand bitcoins, meaning investors are paying about $40 billion for a cash-generating BI franchise, active treasury yield, and a management team that has repeatedly demonstrated capital-markets agility. Traditional valuation lenses paint a premium picture: EV/revenue of 258x dwarfs Coinbase's 8.2x and Riot Platforms' 7.1x. Price/sales shows a similar gap, while P/E is not meaningful given bitcoin-driven accounting losses. Yet, the comparison is incomplete because neither peer owns an asset base whose dollar value alone covers a majority of enterprise value. If bitcoin merely matches the post-halving trajectories of prior cycles and reaches $150,000 within two years, MicroStrategy's holdings would be worth $87 billion, enough to cover the current market cap even before further accumulation or software cash flows are considered. In that scenario, the equity would offer embedded optionality on both BTC upside and a potential re-rating of the subscription business toward the 10-12x sales typical of AI-enabled analytics vendors. Given the asymmetric payoff profile, MicroStrategy looks undervalued on a sum-of-parts basis despite headline multiples. For investors who accept bitcoin's long-term scarcity thesis and see AI-induced monetary expansion as a tailwind rather than a threat, owning MSTR provides operational leverage to both trends. I remain bullish and expect the shares to outperform pure-play miners and exchanges over a full bitcoin cycle, with 50% upside possible if management continues to grow bitcoin per share faster than share count while nurturing subscription growth above 10% annually.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791921-strategy-the-bitcoin-treasury-flywheel-is-spinning-into-overdrive?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","MSTR",cryptocompare
