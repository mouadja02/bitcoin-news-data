2025-06-03T07:50:21,"Strategy’s Strategic Play: 2.5M Preferred Shares to Fuel Massive Bitcoin Acquisition","BitcoinWorld Strategy’s Strategic Play: 2.5M Preferred Shares to Fuel Massive Bitcoin Acquisition In a move that underscores its deep conviction in the future of digital assets, Strategy, the business intelligence and Bitcoin investment firm, has announced a significant financial maneuver. On June 2, the company revealed plans to launch an initial public offering (IPO) for 2.5 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock. This isn’t just standard corporate financing; the stated purpose directly ties back to Strategy’s core identity in the crypto space: funding additional Bitcoin purchases. This announcement immediately captured the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike, highlighting the company’s continued commitment to its unique corporate Bitcoin strategy . What Exactly is Strategy Planning with These Preferred Shares ? Let’s break down the technical details. Strategy intends to offer 2.5 million shares of a specific type of stock. This isn’t the common stock you’d typically trade on the open market. It’s classified as 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock. What does that mean for potential investors and for Strategy? Preferred Stock: This type of stock has certain advantages over common stock, often including priority in receiving dividends and assets in the event of liquidation. However, preferred shareholders typically don’t have voting rights. 10.00% Series A: This indicates a specific class of preferred stock, likely with a fixed dividend rate of 10.00% per annum based on its liquidation preference (the value at which it would be redeemed). Perpetual: This suggests the stock does not have a maturity date; the company is not obligated to buy it back at a specific time, although it may have call options (the right to redeem it). Stride: This term might refer to specific features or terms outlined in the stock’s prospectus, unique to this particular series issued by Strategy. The offering is structured as an IPO, meaning it’s the first time this specific class of preferred shares is being offered to the public. This allows Strategy to raise a substantial amount of capital directly from investors interested in this specific financial instrument. Why is Strategy Doubling Down on its Corporate Bitcoin Strategy ? For years, Strategy , under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has been one of the most prominent corporate advocates for Bitcoin. Their strategy is straightforward: accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible and hold it as a primary treasury reserve asset. They view BTC as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies, offering a hedge against inflation and a potential for significant long-term appreciation. This latest offering is a clear signal that their conviction hasn’t wavered. Despite market volatility, Strategy continues to find ways to leverage its financial structure to increase its BTC holdings. Their existing substantial holdings are a testament to this strategy, and this new funding initiative aims to add even more digital gold to their balance sheet. It reinforces their position as a leading example of a company fully embracing a corporate Bitcoin strategy on a large scale. The Mechanics: How Does This Funding Work for BTC Acquisition ? According to the press release, the net proceeds from the offering will be used for “general corporate purposes.” While this is a broad term, the release specifically highlights two key areas: Bitcoin Acquisitions: This is the most exciting part for the crypto community. A significant portion of the funds raised will be directly allocated to purchasing additional Bitcoin on the open market. This increases Strategy’s overall exposure to the digital asset and further solidifies its position as a major corporate whale. Working Capital: Funds will also be used for general working capital needs. This is standard for any company, covering operational expenses, potential investments in their core business intelligence software, and other day-to-day costs. However, the explicit mention of BTC acquisitions alongside working capital leaves little doubt about the primary driver behind this financing round. By issuing preferred shares, Strategy can raise capital without diluting the voting power of its common shareholders. This financing method provides a stream of funding specifically intended to fuel their ongoing BTC acquisition efforts, demonstrating a creative approach to treasury management in the digital age. What Does Strategy’s Move Mean for the Bitcoin Market? Strategy is already one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. When they announce plans to buy more, it sends a ripple through the market. Here’s what their continued accumulation could imply: Increased Buying Pressure: Direct purchases by a large entity like Strategy add demand to the market, which can potentially support the price of Bitcoin . Market Sentiment: Strategy’s actions are often seen as a bullish signal by the crypto community. It reinforces the narrative of institutional adoption and confidence in BTC as a long-term asset. Validation of Corporate Strategy: Other companies considering adding BTC to their balance sheets might look to Strategy’s ongoing efforts as a model or validation of the concept. While the exact amount of BTC Strategy will purchase with the proceeds depends on the final amount raised and the market price of Bitcoin at the time of purchase, the intention itself is a notable event for the market. Preferred Shares vs. Common Stock: A Quick Comparison Understanding the difference between the shares being offered and the common stock traded under the ticker MSTR is crucial. Here’s a simplified look: Feature Preferred Stock (Series A Perpetual Stride) Common Stock (MSTR) Ownership Type Senior claim on assets/earnings over common stock Basic ownership stake in the company Dividends Fixed rate (10.00% per annum) with priority payment Variable, declared by the board (Strategy does not currently pay common dividends) Voting Rights Typically none Usually one vote per share Potential for Appreciation Less direct correlation to company’s operational growth; tied to dividend yield and redemption value Directly tied to company’s performance and market perception (including BTC holdings) Risk Profile Lower risk than common stock in liquidation; dividend payments are more predictable (if paid) Higher risk than preferred stock; price is more volatile This offering provides investors with a different way to gain exposure to Strategy, primarily through a fixed-income-like instrument, rather than the direct equity exposure of common stock, which is more volatile and closely tracks the value of Strategy’s underlying assets, including its significant Bitcoin holdings. Key Takeaways and What to Watch Strategy’s plan to issue preferred shares for BTC acquisition is a significant development. Here are some key points and things to keep an eye on: Execution of the Offering: The success and terms of the IPO will determine the exact amount of capital raised. Amount of BTC Purchased: Monitor Strategy’s future announcements regarding their Bitcoin holdings to see how much BTC they acquire with the proceeds. Market Reaction: Observe how the market responds to both the offering itself and Strategy’s subsequent BTC purchases. Future Funding Rounds: Will Strategy continue to use similar financing methods to fund further BTC accumulation? This move highlights Strategy’s aggressive approach to leveraging financial markets to build its Bitcoin treasury, reinforcing its unique position at the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset economy. Concluding Thoughts Strategy’s planned offering of 2.5 million preferred shares is a bold statement of intent. By specifically earmarking proceeds for BTC acquisition , the company is not only reinforcing its long-held corporate Bitcoin strategy but also demonstrating innovative ways for public companies to gain and increase exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. This development is crucial for anyone following Bitcoin ‘s journey towards mainstream and institutional adoption, showcasing how a major player continues to find avenues to grow its digital asset reserves. It’s a clear signal that Strategy remains committed to its vision of Bitcoin as a foundational asset for the future.

2025-06-03T07:40:23,"MicroStrategy Adds Another 705 BTC, Extends Lead as Largest Corporate Holder","MicroStrategy , the enterprise software giant that has turned into a Bitcoin bull, has made a fresh Bitcoin purchase. Last week, it announced that it had bought 705 more BTC, valued at $75.1 million, at an average price of $106,495 per BTC. Company CEO Michael Saylor said that MicroStrategy now holds a total of 580,955 BTC, which are worth about $60.5 billion at today’s prices, making them, by a country mile, the largest corporate Bitcoin holders. MicroStrategy’s BTC strategy has become one of the most financially successful decisions ever taken by a corporation. It now has an unrealized profit of $19.83 billion—a figure that could change at any second, since it’s based on the numbers coming from the Bitcoin network. MicroStrategy( @Strategy ) bought another 705 $BTC ($75.1M) at an average price of $106,495 last week. #Strategy currently holds 580,955 $BTC ($60.5B), with an average buying price of $70,023 and an unrealized profit of $19.83B. https://t.co/tIy3luAAqa pic.twitter.com/DFRv8R87SX — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 2, 2025 Not the Biggest Whale, But the Biggest Corporation Even though it currently holds more Bitcoin than any other public company in the world, MicroStrategy is still not even close to being the top holder of Bitcoin. In fact, the company that has the most Bitcoin in the world is actually a pseudonymous figure who may or may not be a single person: Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto’s original mining wallet holds approximately 1.096 million BTC, worth about $112.2 billion at the current market price of $103,792. That’s nearly double MicroStrategy’s stash. Despite this, MicroStrategy holds the title of the largest publicly traded company with BTC on its balance sheet. Since August 2020, the company has adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset—a move that was both unprecedented and widely scrutinized at the time. Fast-forward nearly five years, and the decision appears visionary. The company’s Bitcoin holdings have appreciated massively, and its stock price has surged over 7x since its initial BTC buy. Although Satoshi is unassailable in terms of sheer BTC possession, MicroStrategy heads up the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. It and a growing number of companies are considering digital assets, like Bitcoin, as part of their treasury strategy. Institutional Buying Gains Momentum MicroStrategy is not the only one wagering substantially on Bitcoin. Per the most recent info from SosoValue and its BTC Treasuries Dashboard, 14 different firms that are publicly listed now hold the crypto asset, and these companies together own 637,000 BTC—worth around $66.1 billion. Of these 14 companies, 10 are U.S.-based, with the other four across the Pacific in Japan—all of which is to say that momentum toward Bitcoin’s institutional adoption appears to be building regionally. Tesla and the Japanese company Metaplanet are notable Bitcoin holders but trail behind MicroStrategy. Yet MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings are not just notable; they’re an astonishing 50 times larger than Tesla’s—not to mention they’re held at a cost BTC price of around $24,000, which is low in the world of corporate-held BTC prices. Nano Labs Ltd, the company with whom Elon Musk’s space travel interests are in touch, holds the highest average cost basis for its BItcoin: $99,500. Blockchain Inc. holds its BItcoin at the lowest average price: $30,405. Every company that has gone public and disclosed purchasing Bitcoin is currently sitting in the green, thanks to the current market price of $103,792. This profitability could well spark additional interest from firms that haven’t already bought in and could lead even more companies to scoop up some Bitcoin, especially as the cryptocurrency keeps proving itself as a long-term value play. 微策略是目前比特币的最大持有者吗？ —— 不是，中本聪才是 Satoshi Nakamoto 公开账户目前持有 109.6 万枚 BTC，总价值 1122 亿美元，而微策略的 BTC 持有量为 58 万枚（602 亿美元），想成为「比特币最大庄家」还得再买近一倍的量哈哈 自 2020 年 8… pic.twitter.com/8verivv2bo — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) June 2, 2025 Market Watches Whale Activity Closely Bitcoin is the sole digital asset that demonstrates consistent institutional faith during this market cycle. Corporate treasury strategies today are concentrated, almost exclusively, on Bitcoin. Profits are impressive; floating profits are through the roof. New entrants into this market are piling into this digital gold. And so analysts have turned their sights not just to the price of Bitcoin but also to the behavior of the Bitcoin whales—first and foremost, the corporate treasurers that have committed to holding this asset in their vaults. For institutional investors, the cost basis of $70,023 per BTC for MicroStrategy is presently regarded as a critical benchmark. It stands as both a financial floor and a psychological threshold. With MicroStrategy, even last week, buying above that average—like with last week’s purchase at $106,495, for example—it sends a powerful message about long-term, steadfast conviction. Market focus on the whale cost basis highlights the powerful influence that big, strategic Bitcoin holders have in molding both sentiment and technical support for the cryptocurrency. These corporate players, often referred to as Plus-edition whales, are handfuls of ELPs—they’re not even in the top 10. Yet, these quasigovernmental types are enough to keep buying. And because they can keep buying, they keep providing a level of price stability that our couldn’t-even-attempt society of Bitcoin retail investors doesn’t provide. Conclusion: MicroStrategy’s Strategy Pays Off Big Bitcoin’s price at the heart of MicroStrategy’s financial strategy, in 2020, is a thank-you note, written in profitable contractually-obliged software, to the half-dozen or so MicroStrategy employees who, back in 2013, connected their employer to the virtually wonk-tastic world of cryptocurrency. Even better, this seems to be a decision that Saylor himself couldn’t have predicted would end up as the most lauded corporate investment since the ill-fated AOL Time Warner merger. Despite the massive, overshadowing profile of Satoshi Nakamoto, MicroStrategy plays an undeniable role in legitimizing Bitcoin as a legitimate corporate asset—and everyone else seems ready to follow its lead.

2025-06-03T07:30:55,"Bitcoin Hashrate Breaks Record Even As Mining Gets Harder Than Ever","On-chain data shows the 7-day average of the Bitcoin Hashrate has just set a new record, despite network difficulty being at an all-time high. Bitcoin Hashrate Has Observed A Sharp Surge Recently The “ Hashrate ” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. The metric is traditionally measured in terms of hashes per second (H/s), but today a much more massive exahashes per second (TH/s) is used instead. When the value of this metric goes up, it means new miners are joining the network and/or old ones are expanding their farms. Such a trend implies the chain is appearing an attractive venture to these validators. On the other hand, the indicator registering a decline suggests some of the miners have decided to disconnect, potentially because they are no longer finding BTC mining profitable. Now, here is a chart from Blockchain.com that shows the trend in the 7-day average of the Bitcoin Hashrate over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate has observed a sharp increase recently, which suggests the miners have added more computing power to the network. The indicator has now hit a value of 942.6 EH/s, which is a new record. This high has come despite a couple of factors going against the miners recently. First, the price has been following a bearish trajectory since its ATH near $112,000. Miners make their income in BTC terms, but their bills are in a fiat currency like the USD, so the converted value of their revenue is what’s relevant to them. Naturally, whenever the price goes up, so does their income, which can incentivize them to upgrade their facilities. So it’s interesting that the uptrend in the metric has continued even with the price decline. That said, this is still just a 7-day average, so it remains to be seen how the trend will develop in the near future. It’s possible that a decline will be reflected with some delay. The other factor that has gone against the miners is the increase in the mining Difficulty , a metric built into the Bitcoin blockchain that controls how hard the miners would find it to mine blocks on the network right now. The Difficulty automatically fluctuates about every two weeks. These adjustments change the metric in such a way so as to neutralize the change in the Hashrate. The feature exists to constrain miner income, making it so that these validators always receive the block reward at a consistent pace. This means that no matter how much computing power Bitcoin miners add, they still earn the same amount. If new miners are joining, it means the competition just got fiercer for the same reward pool and if upgrades are happening, then profit margins just got lower (both would only be when the price remains the same, of course). Given this, spikes in the Difficulty can often price out the miners already just getting by. The latest adjustment, which went through on Friday, caused the indicator to hit a new all-time high. But so far, it seems miners haven’t pulled back on their expansions yet.

While MicroStrategy is drawing attention with its Bitcoin strategy, giant companies are making Solana (SOL) moves one after another. At this point, Canadian investment firm SOL Strategies continues to buy large amounts of Solana, while Nasdaq-listed company Classover also announced its $500 million move to buy Solana. According to the announcement, Classover has signed an agreement with Solana Growth Ventures to issue up to $500 million in senior secured convertible notes to establish Solana’s treasury reserves. The deal reportedly includes initial financing of $11 million, and 80 percent of the net proceeds will be used for SOL acquisitions. Classover CEO Stephanie Luo said: “This agreement represents a significant milestone in the Company’s strategic initiative to establish a Solana-based treasury reserve. “By entering into this agreement, Classover reaffirms its strong commitment to being a leader in blockchain-compatible financial strategy and being among the first public companies to directly integrate SOL into its treasury operations.” Classover previously initiated its SOL reserve strategy by purchasing 6,472 SOLs for approximately $1.05 million. The company’s current $500 million move reflects its long-term strategy for Solana.

2025-06-03T07:25:55,"Bitcoin Surges 11.1% in May Amid Bullish Market Sentiment and Shifting Holder Dynamics","Bitcoin achieved a mighty performance in May, climbing 11.1% through the month as investors reacted favorably to not-so-bad-macroeconomic-news and a return of risk-on sentiment across financial markets. The leading cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high of $111,784, as its most recent price chart summarily dismissed any worries about a global trade war, and as the S&P 500 and other traditional equity markets have shown renewed life. One of the most bullish months in recent history for Bitcoin occurred when its price skyrocketed. The renewed confidence among both retail and institutional investors was evident. The risk-on sentiment was back, and those looser macro economic concerns definitely allowed capital to flood back in to risk assets, with Bitcoin enjoying a tip from those broader trends. Bitcoin Gained 11.1% in May May was a bullish month for #Bitcoin , driven by easing concerns over a global trade war and strong performance from the S&P 500. Supported by these favorable conditions, Bitcoin managed to reach a new all-time high of $111,784 during the month. pic.twitter.com/ekNcfgHsHO — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 2, 2025 Even though Bitcoin’s price performance grabbed the headlines, other developments also took place beneath the surface— notable ones that involve the behavior of long-term holders of BTC. In my view, this group of holders—some of whom have had their Bitcoin for a period of three to five years— is a crucial cohort in the near-term assessment of Bitcoin’s supply dynamics and long-term market cycle performance. Long-Term Holders Begin to Shift On-chain analytics often designate the 3–5 year holding cohort as one of Bitcoin’s most strategic investor segments. They certainly act like it. After all, for historical data that we have on this group, the holding cohort just hit an all-time low last reached back in March 2017—on November 9, 2024, to be exact—in terms of a peak supply control level. Still, the holders in question resumed selling in April 2025—when Bitcoin’s price was again rising—that is, they resumed selling portions of their total holdings, which had been reduced in earlier rounds of profit-taking and had, to my mind, earlier looked set to become a set of longer-term HODLers. As of the time of this writing, holders in this group only represent 11.9% of the total Bitcoin supply. 3–5y $BTC holders reached an ATH of 15.7% of supply on Nov 9, 2024 – the highest since Mar 2017. They began selling soon after, paused, then resumed in Apr 2025. Now at 11.9%, their supply share remains well above the ~3% cycle low – still a major overhang. pic.twitter.com/UOu1KevBsE — glassnode (@glassnode) June 2, 2025 Even after this decrease, the level is still well above the roughly 3% lows seen during previous market cycles. This indicates that, while some long-term holders have taken profits, a good number of them still seems to be holding out for higher prices. This group carries a strong influence. They possess nearly 12% of Bitcoin’s total supply, a hefty sum that constitutes a large overhang likely to pressure the market if the holders decide to go in the same direction as the other large-scale sellers. The good news is that these folks seem content to sit on their Bitcoin. Either they’re not inclined to sell en masse, or they have other Bitcoin plans that entail not selling their Bitcoin anytime soon. And that suggests that if they have plans to hold their Bitcoin, it likely bodes well for the future price of Bitcoin. Because if it takes a certain price level to entice these holders to sell, and they haven’t sold yet, then Bitcoin is likely to trend upward until it reaches that certain price level. Reading the Realized Cap HODL Waves To understand this dynamic more deeply, analysts commonly use tools such as Realized Cap HODL Waves to track the held value among different age cohorts of Bitcoin holders. Using these metrics allows us to glean some understanding of when it might be that our long-term investors are entering or exiting the market. Even better, it gives us a view of how their price correlation might be aligning with the recent movements we’ve seen. The most recent activity reduction on the part of holders of 3-5 years indicates what could be an exhausting phase. These holders, having withstood past bear markets and price consolidation events, typically sell into market strength and reap the rewards of several years’ worth of gains and what they perceive to be high valuations. The not-so-recent uptick in the price of Bitcoin may have coaxed a few more of these holders to liquidate and take profits, but the uptick has not brought out a full-scale selling on the part of these holders. Nevertheless, the 11.9% of the total supply that these holders control means they can still influence prices pretty might as well talk about maintaining significant influence over price direction. The coming months will see this segment of the holder base confronted with a choice: stay absolutely immobile in the face of a price uptick, or get bearish. This segment undoubtedly re-owns enough Bitcoin to make either of those choices not too hard to maintain. Market players will keep a close eye on potential macroeconomic policy shift indicators, institutional demand, and on-chain trend data. Although the rally in May was certainly an encouraging sign for bulls, the supply overhang from long-term holders remains a wild card that could inject some volatility into the price of Bitcoin as it seeks to establish a base above $110,000 and push into new all-time high territory.

2025-06-03T07:24:57,"Blockchain Group Scoops Up 624 Bitcoin in $68M Transaction","Paris-listed Blockchain Group has stepped up its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, confirming a $68.6m acquisition of 624 BTC on Tuesday as it pushes to become a major institutional holder of the cryptocurrency. Its latest purchase raises its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, currently valued at $150.37m. The Blockchain Group funded most of its new Bitcoin purchase through a $63m convertible bond issued to Fulgur Ventures, enabling the acquisition of 544 BTC. It secured another 80 BTC using proceeds from a $9.8 million capital raise completed in late May. The Blockchain Group confirms the acquisition of 624 BTC for ~€60.2 million, the holding of a total of 1,471 BTC, and a BTC Yield of 1,097.6% YTD Full Press Release (EN): https://t.co/iZUEbRaDTZ Full Press Release (FR): https://t.co/IgTddli8Hu BTC Strategy (EN):… pic.twitter.com/0bQ9zaSRN3 — The Blockchain Group (@_ALTBG) June 3, 2025 The BTC was acquired through Banque Delubac & Cie and Swissquote Bank Europe, with both institutions relying on Swiss firm Taurus to manage secure custody. Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin Strategy Accelerates After Initial Small-Scale Entries The announcement comes just weeks after the firm shared plans to expand its crypto treasury. Since then, it has made several key purchases. These include 227 BTC on May 22 and 580 BTC on March 26. Earlier, the group made smaller acquisitions in November and December 2024. The Bitcoin investment strategy began modestly. In Nov. 2024, the firm bought 15 BTC for $1.08m. The following month, it added 25 BTC. With each round of buying, the group’s average cost basis has steadily increased. This trend reflects a calculated scaling approach aligned with its long-term treasury vision. The most recent purchase of 624 BTC marks its largest single-day acquisition to date. According to the company, the value of its Bitcoin reserves has appreciated significantly since acquisition. As of May 31, the group reported an unrealized gain of $47.88m. Treasury Strategy Tied to Increasing Bitcoin Holdings Per Share This aggressive treasury approach is supported by the firm’s broader financial strategy. Earlier this year, it completed a $9.8m capital raise to strengthen liquidity and scale up operations. The group said the combined moves help reinforce its long-term commitment to Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. Further, it has outlined a long-term aim to increase Bitcoin per share through targeted capital raises and crypto acquisitions.

2025-06-03T07:23:43,"Crypto Market Sentiment Wavers as BlackRock ETF Outflows and Stablecoin Declines Raise Red Flags","The cryptocurrency market is indicating a move in sentiment, with some mineral activity in exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock raising eyebrows. For the past week, both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have undergone meaningful changes in fund balances, seemingly the result of large-scale repositioning or some kind of short-term, dial-it-back profit-taking. Between May 27 and June 2, the Ethereum ETF saw its balance decline from 2.47 billion dollars to 2.29 billion dollars, reflecting a moderate withdrawal by investors. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ETF experienced a more significant drop, with holdings falling from 66.51 billion dollars to 63.98 billion dollars. The timing of this movement aligns with the seasonal trading pattern commonly referred to as “Sell in May and go away,” implying that investors may be reducing risk exposure ahead of the historically slower summer trading season. The net inflow for Bitcoin ETFs over the past six weeks had been extremely positive. But on the list of Bitcoin ETFs that experienced the most recent outflows, the one that definitely stood out was the spot Bitcoin ETF. What makes the situation even more interesting is that the outflow from the spot Bitcoin ETF over the past three days was larger than the outflow from the Bitcoin futures ETF over the same period. Like the recent outflow from the spot ETF, the situation isn’t just interesting per se, but it also raises some flags concerning the overall health of demand for the ETFs in question. Ethereum ETFs Buck the Trend While Bitcoin’s recent ETF outflows have been seen, Ethereum continues to attract capital in ETF inflows. Over this same recent time period, Ethereum-based spot ETFs have recorded a net inflow of 286 million dollars. This marks the third consecutive week of positive net flows for these Ethereum ETFs. This is all quite the opposite Bitcoin ETF situation going on. This relentless inflow could be sustained by hope surrounding Ethereum’s development path, new ecosystem prospects, or perception of a near-term price pop. Or it might just indicate that, after Bitcoin, Ethereum is the next digital asset to target for a concentrated portfolio. Panic selling on @BlackRock 's ETFs and Negative stablecoin flow these 3 months? Let's look on data provided by @nansen_ai From 27 May, ETF balance changed from $2.47B to 02 June $2.29B on Ethereum ETF and from $66.51B to $63.98B on Bitcoin ETF (Sell in May and go away?)… pic.twitter.com/WGkjWjuCzM — Kunst1er (@kunst13r) June 2, 2025 Even with Ethereum’s robustness, the overall scenario still looks murky. The changes in ETF balances—most dramatically seen in the plummeting Bitcoin ETF holdings—suggest a segment of the investment community is not feeling great about the short- to medium-term prospects for these assets. It’s not clear if this is happening for the same reasons across the board. Some speculate ETF investors are concerned with possible upcoming regulatory changes. Others think these ETF sell-offs are a response to the much-feared economic “contraction” that’s been weighing on the markets. Stablecoin Flows Show Underlying Weakness A more basic worry stems from the latest movement of stablecoins, which perfectly encapsulates the investor caution theme. According to Nansen, between March 28 and the start of June, exchanges experienced constant negative flow from stablecoins, with a net total outflow of roughly $8.92 billion. Crypto market participants might be withdrawing from the space, as shown by the lack of stablecoin deposits on exchanges. From May 27 to May 30 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $157 million for the week, ending a six-week streak of net inflows. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a weekly net inflow of $286 million, marking their third consecutive week of inflows.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 2, 2025 Stablecoins are a crucial source of liquidity across crypto. When you see them being deposited on exchanges, it’s a pretty clear signal that a lot of market participants are keen to buy up some digital assets. And when you see them flowing back out of the exchanges, it’s a pretty clear signal that a lot of market participants are either done with crypto for now or are keen to buy in at lower prices. The fact that funds continue to flow out of the market adds even more heft to the interpretation that the market is recalibrating. It is now two months since the outflow started. ETFs have also been net sellers of late. Their recent trades have resulted in a picture of a market that is not fully bearish but seems to have shifted away from the exuberance of early 2025. The next few weeks could be a critical time for the market. Investors will be observing to see if Bitcoin ETFs can regain positive inflow momentum, if Ethereum can hold onto its relative strength, and if the flow of stablecoins can reverse. In the meantime, the overall feeling seems to be one of caution as the crypto market reflects and maybe consolidates. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-03T07:23:18,"Altcoin Season is Coming? Data Says the Next Big Crypto Rally is Near!","The post Altcoin Season is Coming? Data Says the Next Big Crypto Rally is Near! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s been almost two weeks since Bitcoin hit an all-time high price. Meanwhile, the crypto market is at an important moment right now, and many traders are wondering what will happen next. Data from Alphractal, a trusted crypto data platform, shows some interesting trends that suggest altcoins could be about to steal the show. Interesting, Bitcoin dominance has just peaked at 64%. In the past, whenever Bitcoin dominance dropped from this level, altcoins had a huge rally, sometimes even 50x. Altcoin Dominance Near Strong Support Alphractal’s data shows that altcoin dominance, which excludes stablecoins like USDT and USDC, has dropped to 28.4%. This is getting close to a very important support area that’s been significant many times in the past. Usually, when altcoin dominance sits around 24% to 25.3%, it’s a sign that altcoins are getting ready to rise again. These levels have always appeared at times when Bitcoin and stablecoins were leading the market and altcoins seemed forgotten. But as soon as altcoin dominance reached this zone, altcoins quickly bounced back and took the spotlight. Now that we’re approaching this support level again, it looks like altcoins could be ready for another big moment. Excluding Ethereum Changes the Picture There’s another chart that removes not only stablecoins but also Ethereum. This chart shows that altcoin dominance (without ETH and stablecoins) is at 18.92%. That’s very close to 18%, which has been a strong support level for years. In the past, when this level was reached, Bitcoin’s dominance often fell, and altcoins started to grow again. This level has held strong even though there are now thousands of new altcoins on the market. Bitcoin Hits 64% – Could Altcoins Be Next to Rise? Bitcoin’s dominance just hit 64%, a level that has stopped it before. Crypto analyst CryptoElites has shared a chart showing that this resistance has always been a tough barrier for Bitcoin. In both 2019 and 2021, Bitcoin’s dominance peaked and then dropped sharply. What followed was a wave of explosive altcoin rallies, with some coins gaining 50x or more. Analyst chart suggests a similar setup is happening now, hinting that the next big altcoin season could be right around the corner. Meanwhile, the altocin index currently sits at 22 , reflecting a long way to go before the altcoin season begins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-is-coming-data-says-the-next-big-crypto-rally-is-near/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","News",cryptocompare

Up to 80% of the funds will be allocated to purchasing SOL tokens. Corporate interest in crypto reserves is rising, with firms like VivoPower and Trump Media also entering the space. Shares of Nasdaq-listed educational technology firm Classover Holdings surged nearly 40% on Monday after unveiling a plan to raise up to $500 million for a Solana (SOL)-based corporate treasury. The New York-headquartered company announced it had signed a securities purchase agreement with Solana Growth Ventures LLC, aiming to issue up to $500 million in senior secured convertible notes. An initial $11 million funding is expected soon, pending customary closing conditions. Classover to Allocate 80% of New Funding to Solana Purchases Under the agreement, Classover is required to allocate up to 80% of net proceeds toward purchasing SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain. “This agreement marks a significant milestone in the company’s strategic initiative to build a SOL-based treasury reserve,” said Classover CEO Stephanie Luo. “By entering into this agreement, Classover reaffirms its strong commitment to becoming a leader in blockchain-aligned financial strategy.” The latest deal adds to Classover’s previously announced $400 million equity purchase agreement, bringing its combined potential financing for SOL purchases to $900 million.

The stock remains down 48.19% over the past month and 7.23% year-to-date. Founded in 2020, Classover provides live online education for K-12 students. The company began its SOL treasury initiative last month, positioning the blockchain token as a key asset in its balance sheet. Classover’s move reflects a broader trend of corporate Solana adoption. Firms such as SOL Strategies , DeFi Development Corp., Upexi, and Janover have also begun accumulating SOL, either to complement existing operations or to pivot toward blockchain-focused strategies. Interest in Cryptocurrencies as Reserve Rises Last month, the publicly listed energy company VivoPower revealed that it is investing $121 million in XRP as a strategic reserve, making it the first company in the world with an XRP-focused treasury. The number of public companies holding Bitcoin also continues to grow. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 116 public firms have now added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Recent additions include GameStop and Swedish health tech company H100. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. Last week, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint.

While the Bitcoin dominance has hit 64% since May, it signals a reversal is on the way for altcoins. This period of consolidation has many investors watching closely, not just for Bitcoin’s next move but for signs that altcoin season may be near. According to Altcoin Daily analyst, this is the perfect setup: when Bitcoin stabilizes and dominance shows signs of reversing, altcoins historically begin to take off. In their latest video , the analyst boldly claims that now is “your last chance” to become a crypto millionaire in 2025. The cycle is playing out predictably, and history suggests we’re nearing another explosive move. Altcoin Season Coming: Here Are Top 5 Cryptocurrencies VeChain (VET) Analyst is highly bullish on VeChain due to its real-world use cases and partnerships in logistics and supply chain sectors. He emphasizes that VET remains undervalued and is still flying under the radar for many investors. With continued development and growing enterprise adoption, VET could experience explosive upside when the altcoin market heats up. Solana (SOL) The analyst sees Solana as a top-tier altcoin that is ready to break out. Despite previous setbacks, Solana has shown strong resilience , with growing network activity, NFT traction, and developer engagement. He believes SOL could be one of the best performers in the next altcoin wave. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa stands out for its unique architecture, offering high-speed proof-of-work transactions with rapid confirmation times. Analyst notes that Kaspa’s community is expanding fast, and the tech behind it makes it a compelling play as demand for scalable and decentralized solutions grows. Render (RNDR) With the rise of AI and decentralized computing, Render Network is getting noticed . RNDR allows GPU power to be rented out in a decentralized way. Analyst sees this as a game-changing project, especially as AI and metaverse applications require immense compute resources. Stacks (STX) Stacks is leading the Bitcoin Layer 2 narrative. Analyst highlights its ability to bring smart contracts to Bitcoin, a feature that could unlock massive value. As Bitcoin adoption grows , STX could emerge as a critical layer for building dApps and DeFi on BTC. As Bitcoin steadies, these altcoins could be gearing up for a major breakout. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Robert Kiyosaki says on the social media platform X that he thinks billions of investors will seek refuge in three store-of-value assets in the coming months. According to Kiyosaki, the move will be triggered by his predicted collapse in the US stock and bond markets. “Do not say I didn’t warn anyone. As predicted in my book Rich Dad’s Prophecy (2013), the biggest crash in history is coming. I am afraid that crash time is now and through this summer. Unfortunately, millions, especially my generation of boomers, will be wiped out when the stock and bond markets crash. The good news is that millions who are proactive may become extremely rich… and as you know….I want you to be one of those who become very rich. Over this summer, as stock, bond, and real estate markets crash… billions will rush into gold, silver, and Bitcoin.” Among the three assets mentioned, Kiyosaki believes that silver holds the most potential for upside. The personal finance author believes that silver will shatter its all-time high of nearly $50 this year. “The biggest bargain today is silver. In 2025, silver may 3x. The better news is silver is still 60% under all-time highs… still about $35… while gold and Bitcoin are at or near all-time highs. Tomorrow I am going to my local gold and silver dealer and trading fake money for real silver… no ETFs (exchange-traded funds)… the biggest bargain today. Silver is priced around $35 an ounce, which means almost everyone anywhere in the world….has a chance to grow richer…while millions grow poorer. What are you going to do tomorrow….grow richer or grow poorer? Please choose to get richer. Take care.” At time of writing, silver (XAG) is worth $34.6.

2025-06-03T07:00:38,"Strategy Latest Bitcoin Purchase: 705 BTC Bought For $75 Million","Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the Bitcoin (BTC) proxy firm led by Michael Saylor, has made headlines again with its latest acquisition of the market’s leading cryptocurrency. In a Monday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company revealed that it purchased an additional 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1, bringing its total holdings to 580,955 coins. Strategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Spree This recent acquisition was made at an aggregate cost of $75.1 million, translating to approximately $106,495 per Bitcoin. Overall, Strategy’s Bitcoin investments now amount to around $40.68 billion, averaging about $70,023 for each token. Following the announcement, Strategy’s stock, MSTR, rose 0.9% to $372.72, while the broader market showed mixed results, with the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively. Related Reading: $3 XRP Dream Delayed—No Bull Run Before November, Says Top Analyst Though the latest purchase is significant, it is not among the largest on record for the company, which has typically acquired thousands of Bitcoin in a single transaction. The smallest acquisition to date occurred in March, when MicroStrategy purchased just 130 tokens as the price of BTC remained below $85,000. Strategy’s recent buying spree comes amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties that have affected cryptocurrency prices. Despite Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,8000 last week, the cryptocurrency has retraced nearly 6% from its record. Nevertheless, the company has consistently taken advantage of the cryptocurrency’s price dips, marking its eighth consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases, ignoring any price fluctuation. Arkham Tracks 97% Of Saylor’s Holdings In a social media update on Sunday, Saylor hinted at the impending announcement, and on Monday, he shared details about the latest acquisition, stating that Strategy has achieved a Bitcoin yield of 16.9% year-to-date as of June 1, 2025. However, according to blockchain analysis platform Arkham Intelligence, Strategy’s holdings may be even larger than reported, estimating them at nearly 625,000 BTC, valued at approximately $59.92 billion. This estimate includes 70,816 BTC identified by Arkham, which highlights the significant assets held by the company. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A 5-Figure Breakout – Volatility Is Shaking ‘Weak Hands’ Arkham noted that it has tracked 97% of Saylor’s Bitcoin holdings, emphasizing that this is the first public acknowledgment of such substantial assets. They clarified that 87.5% of Strategy’s reported holdings consist of Bitcoin, with a portion held in Fidelity Digital’s omnibus custody. Previously, the firm identified about 107,000 BTC that were sent to Fidelity deposits, which are not listed under the Strategy entity due to Fidelity’s custody practices. In total, more than 327,000 BTC are held by Saylor’s Bitcoin proxy firm in segregated custody within the Strategy entity, further solidifying the company’s position as a significant player in the cryptocurrency market.

2025-06-03T06:59:48,"South Korea Lenders See Political Transition as Chance to Revamp Crypto Sector","Leading banks in South Korea are urging the incoming administration to revamp financial regulations that limit their role in the virtual asset sector. The call reflects a broader ambition among lenders to compete more effectively with tech firms and gain entry into fast-evolving nonbanking markets. The Korea Federation of Banks revealed Tuesday that it had recently held a strategy meeting with senior leaders from major banks, a local outlet reported. The session resulted in a proposal calling for regulatory changes that would allow traditional financial institutions to participate more directly in the digital asset economy. “Regulatory revisions are necessary to enable banks, backed by their credibility, accessibility and strong consumer protection standards, to enter the virtual asset business,” the federation said. All three major presidential hopefuls in South Korea have endorsed allowing Bitcoin ETFs and institutional crypto investment ahead of the 3 June vote, marking a potential policy shift. #BitcoinETF #Crypto @cryptoquant_com @YonhapNews https://t.co/63NbHMsIfe — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 As South Korea Votes, Banks Eye Regulatory Overhaul Opportunities The timing aligns with South Korea’s presidential transition. Voters cast ballots on Tuesday to elect a new leader after months of political uncertainty and the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. The banking industry sees this leadership change as a chance to push for long-stalled reforms. It is currently unclear when the result will emerge. The crypto market is already undergoing shifts. In May, South Korean authorities introduced new rules to govern digital asset transactions, part of a broader move to prepare for institutional participation in the sector. These regulations, which take effect in June, allow both nonprofit groups and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies. However, they must comply with tighter disclosure standards and meet enhanced listing requirements. Regulatory Clarity Urged As Banks Push To Expand Beyond Traditional Sectors Despite South Korea’s ranking as the world’s third-largest crypto market by trading volume, the country has yet to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework. Around one-third of the population holds digital assets, and crypto-related policies featured prominently in recent campaign pledges, including promises to legalize spot crypto ETFs and regulate stablecoins. Banks are stepping up efforts to position themselves within the space, exploring services such as stablecoin issuance and digital asset trusts. However, they remain constrained by existing rules that block entry into non-financial sectors. In contrast, tech firms face fewer restrictions and can integrate financial services into broader business operations, which banks argue creates a competitive imbalance. To address this, the federation called for broader permissions across sectors like retail, logistics, and ICT. It also urged a shift toward principle-based regulation, allowing more flexibility for both core banking and subsidiary functions. The report criticized vague provisions in the Banking Act that make enforcement unpredictable and called for clearer definitions and time-bound regulatory actions. Banks intend to gather more feedback and present a final set of proposals once the new government is in place. As South Korea looks to stabilize its economy and tech sector, lenders hope to play a stronger role in shaping the country’s financial trajectory.

2025-06-03T06:53:34,"POPCAT, WIF, and MUBARAK surge over 10% — which memecoin looks the most bullish?","Memecoins POPCAT, WIF, and MUBARAK have each posted double-digit gains in the past 24 hours, continuing their bounces from recent pullbacks. Which one of them shows the highest bullish potential? Popcat ( POPCAT ) price is up 15% in the past 24 hours, currently trading around $0.42, with 24-hour trading volume surging over 80% to $70 million. After the steep pullback from $0.60, the price recently bounced from the key support level at around $0.35 and is now continuing this recovery as it tests its 20 EMA, which acts as a dynamic resistance. However, it’s important to note the recent shift in market structure. Before the pullback, POPCAT’s price failed to make a new high higher, forming a lower high. This was followed by the break of the neckline of a double top pattern and then the formation of a lower low at $0.33. How the price reacts to the 20 EMA resistance will be critical in determining whether the recent break in structure signals the start of a broader downtrend or if the pullback was just a liquidity grab at a lower support level. Momentum is neutral, with the RSI at 47. However, it’s pointing upwards and just about to break above its moving average, potentially forming a golden cross – a bullish signal. Source: TradingView You might also like: James Wynn offloads $4.12M HYPE and takes another $100M 40x-leveraged long bet on Bitcoin Dogwifhat ( WIF ) price is up 12%, currently trading at $0.96, with the 24-hour trading volume surging over 80% to $428 million. Similarly to POPCAT, WIF price has recently broken the uptrend structure, forming a lower low at $0.80. However, three days ago, the price strongly rebounded from that level and is now continuing its recovery, having just wicked above the 20 EMA. With the continuation of the bounce from $0.80, the memecoin ‘s price has now reclaimed the previous higher low at around $0.95. If WIF maintains this upward momentum and closes above the 20 EMA, it could signal the resumption of an uptrend. On the momentum side, MACD bearish crossover is still in place. However, histogram is negative but showing decreasing red bars, suggesting bearish momentum is weakening. RSI is 52, recovering from neutral territory, but still way below its moving average.

Since breaking out of its previous range on May 9, MUBARAK price has been consolidating in the $0.04 – $0.07 range. Recently, the price dipped below $0.04, but then bounced and reclaimed the $0.0430 support level. However, volume is still weak, and the price has yet to break above the EMA 20, which is acting as its dynamic resistance. Despite this, bearish momentum is fading, as indicated by the declining MACD histogram and an upward-sloping RSI. A break above the 20 EMA with strong volume would likely confirm bullish momentum and open the path toward a retest of the $0.06 – $0.07 resistance at the top of the range.

While Lee maintained his year-end target for the S&P 500 at 6,600 points, his most notable statements were about Bitcoin. Tom Lee described Bitcoin's current movement as “consolidation” and stated that the market has already reacted to the increase in global liquidity and the expectation of a more dovish FED in 2025. Stating that this situation creates strong support for BTC, Lee said, “Bitcoin is an asset that is sensitive to liquidity. Liquidity is increasing in the world right now and this is an upward signal for Bitcoin.” Lee also made the following striking statement, citing Bitwise’s statistics: “95% of the Bitcoin supply has already been mined. However, 95% of the world's population does not yet own BTC. This creates a huge demand-supply imbalance for the next 10 years.” Related News: Massive XRP Move from Chinese Company - “300 Million Dollar Treasury...” Lee stated that Bitcoin could reach levels of $150,000 to $250,000 this year. Tom Lee thinks that Bitcoin is a more valuable asset compared to gold. The market value of gold is around $23 trillion. If this value is reflected in Bitcoin, Lee calculated that a single Bitcoin could reach $1.2 million, and went further and said: “I think BTC, in the long run, can go up to $2 million or even $3 million. Even higher.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T06:27:28,"U.S. Share of Bitcoin, Ether and Solana Trading Volume Falls Below 45% as Asia Catches Up","The rebound in digital assets since early April has been marked by a significant shift in activity, with Asian trading hours gaining market share in global bitcoin BTC, ether ETH and solana SOL spot trading volumes, while the U.S. steadily loses ground. The U.S. trading hours' share of the spot volume in the three major tokens has dropped below 45% on a 30-day simple moving average basis, having peaked at an all-time high of over 55% at the beginning of 2025, according to data tracked by institutional crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX. The latest reading is the lowest since pro-crypto Donald Trump's victory in the November presidential election. Meanwhile, Asian trading hours now account for nearly 30% of global activity, with Europe accounting for the remainder. Slower activity during the U.S. represents a change in investor mix driving the price action, according to FalconX. ""It may point to increased influence from non-U.S. portfolio flows or suggest that U.S. investors are focusing more on markets beyond spot crypto,"" FalconX's Head of Research David Lawant said in a note shared with CoinDesk. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has surged 40% to $105,000 since hitting lows under $75,000 in early April, according to CoinDesk data. Ether and solana have surged 87% and 68%, respectively, during the same period. Low-volume BTC rally Although bitcoin's price has surged to new highs, global spot trading activity hasn't yet recovered to levels seen early this year. According to FalconX, daily volume in BTC spot markets, which averaged over $15 billion on a 30-day rolling basis after the November election, declined during the April sell-off and has since held below $10 billion. A low-volume rally is often viewed as a bear trap. However, that's not necessarily the case this time, as ETFs have recently gained popularity as investment vehicles. According to FalconX, the cumulative volume in the 11 U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs has surged from approximately 25% of the global spot BTC market volume to a record 45% in under two months. The spike in ETF volume stems mainly from bold directional bets rather than non-directional arbitrage bets like the cash and carry trade, involving a long position in the ETF and a simultaneous short position in the CME BTC futures.

2025-06-03T06:25:00,"Top Analyst Spots XRP Breakout If It Holds This Crucial Level","Renowned cryptocurrency analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) has updated the technical outlook on XRP, focusing on a potential bullish continuation pattern developing on the 3-day timeframe. According to the analyst, a decisive close above $2.3, along with confirmation above the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), would signal the validation of a double bottom structure . The chart shared by EGRAG CRYPTO shows that XRP recently tested a key support region around $2.07 multiple times, which the analyst believes is the likely bottom on the 3-day timeframe. The analysis suggests that as long as the digital asset’s price remains above this critical $2.07 support level, bullish momentum remains intact. EGRAG CRYPTO emphasizes that holding this zone is essential for bulls, as it would prevent further downside and maintain the validity of the projected wave count structure. #XRP – A Close Above $2.3 Shields the Double Bottom Pattern : A strong close above $2.30 on the 3-day timeframe and above the 21 EMA will confirm that the Double Bottom is in play for #XRP , opening the door to potential targets around: $2.50 $2.65 $3.00 As long… pic.twitter.com/bguB9ujpZe — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 2, 2025 Double Bottom Pattern and Upside Targets EGRAG CRYPTO’s projection includes a potential double bottom formation, a classical technical pattern that often precedes upward breakouts. For this pattern to be confirmed, XRP must close decisively above $2.3. Such a close would also put the price above the 21 EMA, a resistance level that has recently capped upside attempts. With a confirmed breakout, the analysis sets clear price objectives. The near-term targets for XRP include $2.5, $2.65, and an extended move toward $3. Other well-known analysts have shared paths to targets around $3 , further supporting EGRAG CRYPTO’s prediction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The target levels are marked by horizontal green dashed lines on the chart and are likely based on Fibonacci extensions or historical resistance zones. The chart also projects a $24 target as part of a larger bullish wave structure. Notably, a Bitcoin advocate recently predicted that XRP could hit the $24 target in 2025 , and EGRAG CRYPTO’s chart suggests further gains beyond the $3 level under favorable conditions. Market Structure and Technical Setup From a technical standpoint, the chart illustrates that XRP is in a multi-wave structure. The asset rose to the wave (1) peak, followed by a corrective A-B-C structure leading to the wave (2) bottom. The successful defense of the support zone around $2.07 is consistent with the completion of wave C, aligning with common Elliott Wave Theory interpretations. EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis shows the importance of $2.07 as a pivotal support level, and XRP is currently trading at $2.18. The chart further illustrates an anticipated continuation of the bullish wave cycle, with the next impulsive phase targeting the $24 mentioned above.

Ether ETH led gains among majors at 4.5%, coming as the blockchain’s Foundation restructured staffing to focus on protocol developments in a competitive and crowded network landscape — bumping bullish sentiment for the world’s second-largest token. Dogecoin DOGE followed with a 3% rise, with Solana’s SOL SOL, Cardano’s ADA ADA, XRP XRP, and BNB Chain’s BNB BNB adding as much as 2.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, rose 2%. After weeks of gains, bitcoin’s latest price action has traders closely watching for signs of a potential cooling-off period. Caution is emerging among some as technical signals hint that the rally may be losing momentum. “Bitcoin hovering around the $105,000 range is circumstantial natural cooling after a strong rally, with elevated trading volumes followed by sustained interest, now hints at fatigue,” said Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, said in a Tuesday update shared with CoinDesk. “BTC could consolidate between $103,000 and $108,000, with $100,000 acting as psychological support. If that level fails, downside targets near $97,000–$93,000 may be tested,” Lee said. Lee added that on-chain data shows continued whale accumulation, typically a bullish sign that any correction could offer an entry point. For ETH, Lee noted that repeated rejections and long upper wicks around the $2,800 level indicate hesitation. “Overall strength remains intact, but momentum is capped unless ETH decisively breaks above $2,810,” he said. The bigger picture for BTC remains solid on a macro basis. “On a YTD basis, BTC remains a strong outperformer on a macro basis and vs equity, though there are short-term signs that we might be up for more challenging times ahead, with OGs and natives continuing to be better sellers and profit takers against mainstream buying,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Tuesday message. Geopolitical risks continue to weigh on sentiment. Fresh tariff headlines and a tense trade backdrop between the U.S. and China have traders bracing for more volatility, with key policy deadlines in early July on the radar, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market broadcast late Monday.

2025-06-03T06:12:18,"Bitcoin Waiting for Leverage Flush Before Next Big Move: Analyst","“Now is a bad time to take paper bets on BTC,” said technical analyst Willy Woo on June 2. He said it was “open season on liquidation hunts due to high levels of betting,” before adding that Bitcoin was “waiting to purge the bets before the next swing of all-time-highs.” Paper bets are generally crypto derivatives such as futures, options , and perpetual contracts that allow speculators to bet on the price direction without ever holding the asset. Woo said spot Bitcoin prices are hard to move up with too many of these “casino hitchhikers” onboard. NOW is a BAD TIME to take paper bets on BTC. It’s open season on liquidation hunts due to high levels of betting. BTC is waiting to purge the bets before the next swing of all-time-highs. Chart: paper bets on BTC, hard to move up with too many casino hitchhikers onboard. pic.twitter.com/bj9ikjdn8Q — Willy Woo (@woonomic) June 2, 2025 Leverage Flush Imminent Most derivatives gamblers use leveraged trading, which tends to overheat markets and create more volatility, especially when they get liquidated. When asked about the $100 million liquidation of Hyperliquid whale trader James Wynn last week, Woo explained that the buying pressure was low last week, which means “whales can push things around.” “In neutral environments, it’s easy to move price, especially weekends and summer months,” he said before warning: “Now add incentives to make money through liquidations, it’s the perfect setup for liquidation hunts NOW.” Bitcoin open interest (OI), or the number of open futures contracts that have yet to be settled, hit an all-time high of $80 billion on May 23, according to Coinglass. It has since fallen to $72 billion but remains elevated, indicating a high level of “paper bets” or leverage in the market. When OI surges, it indicates that massive leveraged positions have built up with lots of speculators holding large positions with borrowed money. When the spot price of BTC moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated. These flushouts can create a cascade effect and amplify selling pressure, which can cause a sharp decline in prices and volatility spikes. BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin prices are up marginally on the day, hitting an intraday high of $106,450 before retreating to around $105,350 during Tuesday morning trading in Asia. Since falling from its May 22 all-time high, the asset has remained in consolidation around current levels for the past few days. It looks very strong on the long-term view, but could see more volatility if Woo’s “casino hitchhikers” get liquidated. Meanwhile, the M2 money supply has just hit an all-time high, which is good news for risk-on assets such as crypto.

2025-06-03T06:11:11,"Australia Imposes New Restrictions on Crypto ATMs Amid Rising Scams","Australia’s financial crime regulator, AUSTRAC, has placed fresh rules on nationwide crypto ATM operators amid alarming crypto fraud cases. The regulator, on Tuesday, refused to renew the registration of a local crypto ATM operator , Harro’s Empires. The agency placed operating conditions, including transaction limits, on them. “The conditions come after an AUSTRAC taskforce flagged worrying trends in crypto ATM compliance,” the announcement read. The regulator has imposed a A$5,000 ($3,233) limit on cash deposits and withdrawals, enhanced customer due diligence obligations, mandatory scam warnings, and requirements for more robust transaction monitoring. “In light of the risks and harms we consider it is absolutely necessary to ensure the sector meets minimum standards and reduces the criminal misuse of crypto ATMs.” Crypto ATMs Increased 15X in Two Years Per Coin ATM Radar , there are around 1,824 crypto ATMs across Australia, with the highest number of machines in Sydney. Australia has over 1,800 crypto ATMs. (Source: Coin ATM Radar) The national financial intelligence agency noted that Australia had only 23 operating crypto ATMs in 2019. Besides, the trend increased to 60 in 2022 and over 1,200 in 2024. “In just two years, the number of crypto ATMs in Australia increased more than 15 times,” the agency said. Further, Austrac projected that around 150,000 transactions occur annually, with A$275 million ($178 million) being moved using crypto ATMs. About 99% of those transactions are cash deposits for crypto purchases, mostly Bitcoin , Ethereum and Tether , it added. “I would warn anybody who is asked to use one of these machines to send funds to someone to stop and think twice, as once your money is gone, it is almost impossible for authorities to retrieve it,” said Austrac CEO Brendan Thomas. He added that the agency will continue to monitor the space and take more action if needed. Austrac Taskforce Uncovers “Disturbing Trends” According to Thomas, the Austrac taskforce has uncovered “disturbing trends,” after observing customer activity for several months. “Surprisingly, the 60 to 70 age group were identified as the one of the most prolific users of crypto ATMs in Australia,” he said. They account for 29% of all transactions by value. Besides, after reviewing 9 crypto kiosk providers, the majority of users are over 50 years of age and account for almost 72% of all transactions by value. Though the A$5,000 cash limits apply to crypto ATM operators, Austrac is also planning to apply similar limits to crypto exchanges if they accept cash for crypto transactions. “This will reduce their exposure to money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crime risks,” said Thomas. Additionally, the Australian Federal Police’s JPC3, a joint policing cybercrime coordination centre, has come up with educational materials for users. These notices will be placed close to the kiosks, detailing how they work, warning signs, and how to report.

2025-06-03T05:57:53,"Crypto ATM operators in Australia hit with cash limits and tougher compliance checks","Australia has introduced new operating conditions and cash transaction limits for crypto ATM providers to curb scams and enhance anti-money laundering compliance. In a June 3 press release , the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) stated that crypto ATM operators must now implement a cash deposit and withdrawal cap of 5,000 Australian dollars (approximately $3,250). Operators must also display scam warning messages at machines to alert users about potential fraud . In addition, ATM providers are now required to conduct more thorough customer checks and enhance their transaction monitoring for suspicious activity. “These conditions are designed to help protect individuals from scams and businesses from criminal exploitation,” AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said in a statement. “In light of the risks and harms we consider it is absolutely necessary to ensure the sector meets minimum standards and reduces the criminal misuse of crypto ATMs,” he added. The new rules come as part of an enforcement initiative following an AUSTRAC taskforce investigation into crypto ATM usage across the country. The task force analyzed data from nine providers and found that individuals aged over 50 accounted for nearly 72% of all transaction value, with those aged 60 to 70 making up 29% alone. You might also like: Australia cracks down on crypto ATM providers over anti-money laundering rule compliance The agency also refused to renew the registration of one operator, Harro’s Empires, citing ongoing risks of misuse. It warned that other digital currency exchange providers failing to meet their obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act could face similar consequences. Although the current cash limit applies only to crypto ATM providers, AUSTRAC urged all exchanges accepting cash to consider adopting similar thresholds to reduce exposure to financial crime risks. In collaboration with the Australian Federal Police-led Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre (JPC3), AUSTRAC has also developed educational materials that will be placed near ATMs to alert users about common scam tactics, warning signs, and how to report suspicious activity. The announcement follows AUSTRAC’s warnings earlier this year, when it cautioned crypto ATM providers that non-compliance with AML/CTF rules would lead to legal action. At the time, AUSTRAC said it had already been working with industry participants since December 2024 to improve standards across the growing network of machines. Authorities highlighted that some Australians had lost their life savings after being directed to crypto ATMs by scammers. With most machines accepting only cash for Bitcoin purchases, officials say this raises significant risks of exploitation. Meanwhile, in a separate June 3 report , the Australian Federal Police reported 150 scam-related cases involving crypto ATMs between January 2024 and January 2025, with losses exceeding 3.1 million Australian dollars. Authorities believe the actual number may be higher, as many victims are either unaware they’ve been defrauded or are hesitant to come forward. As of last check, Australia is home to over 1,800 crypto ATMs, a dramatic rise from just 23 machines in 2019. According to AUSTRAC, nearly 150,000 transactions occur annually through these machines, moving an estimated $275 million in cash, with Bitcoin, Tether, and Ether being the primary assets purchased.
