2025-06-17T09:52:29,"Is Eric Trump Involved in Tron’s $210M Nasdaq Deal?","The post Is Eric Trump Involved in Tron’s $210M Nasdaq Deal? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto world is buzzing over Tron’s plan to go public but it’s Eric Trump’s recent comment that’s grabbing attention. Even though he holds an advisory role at the firm managing the deal, Trump says he has no public involvement . Still, his post on X calling Tron founder Justin Sun a “great friend” and a “crypto icon” has raised eyebrows. So, what’s really going on between Tron, the Trumps, and their growing role in the crypto space? Tron’s Big Nasdaq Move Instead of going the traditional IPO route, Tron is set to go public through a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, a little-known company based in Florida. SRM recently secured a $100 million investment from an undisclosed backer and plans to rebrand as “Tron.” The company will also start building a crypto treasury by accumulating TRX tokens. Leading the deal is Dominari Securities, a Trump-affiliated firm based in Trump Tower. It’s handling a $210 million stock offering tied to the merger. Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. joined Dominari’s advisory board earlier this year. Justin Sun and the Trump Connection Tron founder Justin Sun has been showing up more and more in Trump’s world. He attended the private launch party for Donald Trump’s meme coin, bought a $75 million stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and is now the biggest holder of the $TRUMP token. At a Trump-hosted dinner for the top 220 $TRUMP holders, Sun was gifted a luxury Trump Golden Tourbillon watch. It’s another sign of his growing closeness to the Trump circle. Soon after Sun’s WLFI investment, the U.S. SEC quietly paused its long-running investigation into him and his companies. The probe was focused on possible market manipulation and unregistered securities. Whether that timing is coincidental or not is still up for debate. Donald Trump’s Crypto Cash Flow Donald Trump’s involvement in crypto is growing fast. In 2024, he made $58 million from crypto-related deals – mostly through WLFI token sales. That figure was second only to his hospitality income. And there’s more coming. In 2025, he’s expected to make another $390 million from token sales and gains from his meme coin, which launched earlier this year. Trump is also involved in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs. The SEC recently approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury plan, which includes 85 million shares – 29 million of them tied to convertible notes. Eric Trump Says “No Public Role” But Questions Remain Eric Trump’s statement distancing himself from the Tron deal hasn’t stopped the speculation. His role at Dominari, paired with the family’s expanding crypto activity, makes many wonder what’s really happening behind the scenes. With Tron’s public listing on the way and the Trumps playing a bigger role in the space, there’s no doubt this story is far from over. As crypto keeps gaining ground, the Trump-Tron connection is one to watch and it may be shaping the future of crypto and politics more than anyone expected.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-eric-trump-involved-in-trons-210m-nasdaq-deal/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE","News",cryptocompare

In a recent post , DWF Labs CEO and Head of FalconStable, Andrei Grachev announced that the USD-backed stablecoin has been fully integrated into the Kaia ( KAIA ) Chain. The partnership enables the synthetic stablecoin to be embedded into the LINE messenger ecosystem through Kaia. “Together, we bring sustainable and innovative stablecoin yield solutions for more than 250 Millions of Line users BUIDL!” said Grachev in his recent post. By integrating USDf into Kaia Chain, LINE users will be able to access the stablecoin and earn passive yield from its staked product, sUSDf. Falcon Stable is a stablecoin venture established by DWF Labs’ Falcon Financial. Falcon Stable is the DWF Labs’ synthetic stablecoin protocol that enables users to mint a yield-bearing U.S. dollar‑pegged token called USDf. Unlike most stablecoins, Falcon’s USDf allows users to deposit various digital assets, such as other stablecoins like USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ), major tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and ETH ( ETH ) and even tokenized real-world assets into the protocol. These different assets are then used as collateral to mint USDf. You might also like: Societe Generale-FORGE to launch new USD CoinVertible stablecoin on Ethereum and Solana The stablecoin also offers yield for holders who stake minted USDf. Minted USDf can be staked to receive sUSDf, an interest-bearing version that accrues yield with an APY that has surpassed 22%. At press time, the stablecoin has accumulated a market cap of nearly $560 million and a 24 hour trading volume of more than $1.7 million. Kaia Chain serves as the main web3 infrastructure for the messaging platform, LINE. Kaia powers the Mini Dapp and Dapp Portal within LINE’s messaging app, allowing users to seamlessly access and interact with decentralized applications without the need for web3 onboarding. LINE is a messaging platform popular among East Asians, with a user base of more than 250 million people registered. Back in August last year, LINE began diving into web3 with the integration of mini dApps powered by Kaia blockchain. The Kaia DLT Foundation is an independent body born from the merger of two prominent blockchain projects, from LINE and South Korean tech giant Kakao. The blockchain combines Line’s Finschia blockchain and Kakao’s Klaytn blockchain.

2025-06-17T09:30:09,"On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge","As Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market show tentative signs of recovery following the most recent correction, a crypto analyst has made a bold statement suggesting that the market may have already reached its peak. BladeDeFi, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), warned followers that a significant downturn could be on the horizon, predicting a challenging summer ahead for the crypto space. Crypto Pump Or Trap? In his post, BladeDeFi emphasized that “crypto has already PEAKED” and forecasted a potential slump where alternative cryptocurrencies could see declines of up to 95%. He indicated that most indicators are flashing red, suggesting that the market is on the brink of a significant downturn. According to him, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high early in the current cycle and is now trapped in a “slow-motion downtrend,” with each subsequent bounce becoming weaker than the last. Related Reading: Bitcoin Gold Rush 2.0? Treasuries Swell With 60 New Players The analyst pointed out a concerning trend: retail investors are becoming exhausted, while larger institutional players have begun to exit the market. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and MicroStrategy are reportedly rotating their investments and hedging their positions, often without making their actions overtly public. The analyst suggests that this shift leaves retail investors vulnerable, potentially left holding depreciating assets as liquidity in the market continues to dwindle. BladeDeFi also criticized the current market dynamics, warning that sudden price increases or “green candles” are often deceptive, serving only to entice late buyers into traps that lead to further losses. He noted that without new capital inflows—such as fresh stimulus or significant investment—the recent price pumps lack sustainability. The absence of liquidity means that any upward movements are likely to be fleeting, and the overall trend remains downward. Bitcoin Poised For Year-End Peak? Adding to the bearish sentiment, another analyst, Peppeso, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the top of the 2025 bull market has already been established. Peppeso observed historical patterns in previous market cycles, noting that while bull markets have become longer, bear markets have shortened and softened in their impact. Despite this, Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs in the final months of each cycle, reinforcing Peppeso’s expectation of a peak around November or December 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance The current market environment is further complicated by macroeconomic factors, including rising interest rates and increasing geopolitical risks. With uncertainty clouding the outlook, many investors are adopting a risk-off approach, leading to a sustained downtrend in the crypto market. Even popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant declines of 9% and 7% in the past week alone respectively, indicating that the hype surrounding these assets is fading.

2025-06-17T09:30:07,"Ethereum ETF: US Spot ETH ETFs See Promising $21.4M Inflows Start","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF: US Spot ETH ETFs See Promising $21.4M Inflows Start The anticipation surrounding the launch of US Spot ETH ETFs has been palpable in the crypto market. While trading hasn’t officially begun for all, the underlying funds are starting to see movement. Recent data reveals a notable development: US Spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded a net inflow of $21.4 million on June 16. This marks an important early indicator of investor interest in these newly approved investment vehicles. What Exactly Are US Spot ETH ETFs and Why Do These Inflows Matter? Before diving deeper into the numbers, let’s quickly recap what a US Spot ETH ETF is. It’s an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of ETH futures contracts, a spot ETF aims to track the direct market price of Ethereum by holding the asset itself. This structure is generally preferred by investors seeking direct exposure to the asset’s price movements without the complexities of holding the cryptocurrency directly. The approval of US Spot ETH ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year was a landmark moment for the crypto industry. It followed the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which saw billions in inflows and significantly boosted Bitcoin’s price and mainstream acceptance. The approval of Ethereum ETFs signals growing regulatory comfort and institutional acceptance of major cryptocurrencies as legitimate asset classes for traditional investment products. Therefore, any recorded inflows into these funds, even before they are fully trading on exchanges (pending S-1 form approvals), are highly significant. They represent the first tangible signs of capital entering these specific investment products, indicating that investors and institutions are beginning to allocate funds towards Ethereum through this regulated and accessible pathway. Breaking Down the Initial ETH ETF Inflows: Who is Leading? According to data compiled by Farside Investors, the $21.4 million net inflow on June 16 was concentrated in just two of the approved funds. Here’s the breakdown: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund, managed by the world’s largest asset manager, led the pack with a substantial $16.1 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FETH: Another major financial player, Fidelity, saw its Ethereum ETF attract $5.3 million in net inflows. Other Funds: The remaining US Spot ETH ETFs tracked by Farside Investors reported no change in their holdings for that specific day. This initial data highlights the immediate impact and reach of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. Their existing client bases, brand recognition, and distribution networks likely play a significant role in attracting early capital into their respective Ethereum ETF offerings. While $21.4 million is a modest start compared to the massive inflows seen during the initial days of the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, it’s important contextually. The S-1 registration statements, which allow these ETFs to officially begin trading, are still pending final approval for most issuers. These early inflows could represent seed funding or initial strategic allocations ahead of the official launch. How Do These Early ETH ETF Inflows Compare to the Bitcoin Experience? It’s natural to compare the initial performance of US Spot ETH ETF inflows to that of their Bitcoin counterparts. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw billions of dollars in inflows within their first few days of trading in January 2024. While the $21.4 million figure for Ethereum ETFs on June 16 is significantly smaller, it’s crucial to remember that this data point represents activity *before* full trading commencement for all funds. The Bitcoin ETFs had their S-1s approved concurrently with the 19b-4 rule change, allowing them to trade almost immediately after the SEC’s decision. The Ethereum ETF process has been slightly different, with 19b-4 approval granted first, followed by the ongoing S-1 approval process for individual issuers. Therefore, a direct day-one comparison isn’t entirely fair. The true test for ETH ETF inflows will come once all major funds receive their S-1 approvals and begin trading on exchanges. However, these early numbers, particularly the interest shown in the BlackRock ETH ETF and Fidelity ETH ETF , suggest that there is indeed appetite among investors for this new product. What Could These Initial Flows Signal for the Future of Ethereum? While it’s too early to make definitive predictions based on a single day’s data, these initial ETH ETF inflows are generally viewed as a positive sign for Ethereum. Here’s why: Growing Institutional Interest: The participation of major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, and the capital they are attracting, underscores increasing institutional comfort and interest in gaining exposure to Ethereum. Increased Accessibility: Once fully operational, these ETFs will make investing in Ethereum significantly easier for traditional investors who are uncomfortable with or unable to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges and private key management. This expanded access could bring new capital into the ETH market. Potential Price Support: As ETFs accumulate ETH to back their shares, this creates buying pressure on the underlying asset. While the initial $21.4 million is small relative to Ethereum’s market cap, sustained inflows over time could provide significant price support. Market Legitimacy: The existence of regulated ETF products for Ethereum further solidifies its position as a recognized and legitimate asset class within the traditional financial system. Navigating the Path Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the launch of Ethereum ETF products presents significant opportunities, there are also potential challenges to consider: Opportunities: Massive Capital Influx: If ETH ETFs mirror the success of Bitcoin ETFs, they could unlock significant capital from retail and institutional investors who were previously unable or unwilling to invest directly in crypto. Enhanced Liquidity: Increased trading activity around the ETFs could indirectly improve liquidity in the underlying ETH market. Innovation in Financial Products: The success of spot crypto ETFs could pave the way for other regulated products based on digital assets. Challenges: Market Volatility: While ETFs offer a regulated wrapper, they still track a highly volatile asset. Investors must be prepared for significant price swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although the ETFs are approved, the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US remains complex and subject to change. Competition: The market is competitive, with multiple issuers vying for investor assets. Performance and fees will be key differentiators. Staking Exclusion: Importantly, the current US spot ETH ETFs are approved without a staking component, meaning investors in these funds will not earn staking rewards, which is a significant feature of holding native ETH. Actionable Insights for Those Watching US Spot ETH ETFs For investors and market observers, here are a few key takeaways: Monitor S-1 Approvals: Keep a close eye on the SEC’s approval timeline for the remaining S-1 registration statements. This will be the green light for full trading commencement. Track Inflow Data Post-Launch: Once trading begins, daily inflow/outflow data will provide a clearer picture of investor demand compared to these early seed figures. Observe Market Reaction: See how the price of Ethereum reacts as these ETFs go live and accumulate assets. Compare Performance: If considering investment (not financial advice), compare the fees, structure, and performance of different ETF offerings. Remember, investing in cryptocurrencies and related products carries significant risk. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The Broader Significance Beyond Just the ETF It’s also worth remembering that the Ethereum ETF is just one part of the larger Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum is a foundational layer for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and numerous other decentralized applications. Its ongoing technical upgrades, such as the transition to Proof-of-Stake and future scaling solutions, are critical drivers of its long-term value proposition, independent of the ETF wrapper. The ETF provides a new gateway for traditional capital, but the underlying technology and network development remain paramount. Concluding Thoughts: A Promising Start for a New Era The reported $21.4 million in net inflows on June 16 for US Spot ETH ETFs represents a modest but symbolically significant step forward. It confirms early interest from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity and signals the impending arrival of these highly anticipated investment products to the broader market. While the true impact will unfold once full trading commences, this initial activity sets a positive tone for the potential integration of Ethereum into traditional investment portfolios. The journey of US spot ETH ETFs is just beginning, and market participants will be keenly watching to see if the early promise translates into sustained growth and adoption.

2025-06-17T09:30:00,"CoreWeave eyes new highs and outgrows meme stock label","CoreWeave is closing in on its all-time peak above $160, suggesting its rally goes beyond being a meme stock. The rise of CRWV coincides with a positive month for miner stocks that pivoted to high-density computing for AI. CoreWeave (CRWV) is back to expansion mode, leading to expectations of another rally. The AI computation company, which pivoted early from Ethereum mining, was one of the biggest winners during the LLM expansion stage. CRWV showed strong bullish momentum in the past month, with periods of trading based on a short squeeze. | Source: Yahoo Finance CRWV climbed to $158.50, on track to repeat previous records above $161. In the last two weeks, the CRWV rally raised suspicions that the stock was boosted by meme traders . However, the company has tapped demand for high-density computation for AI, and got a boost from Nvidia (NVDA). The stock moves on a mix of two major factors—trading based on a potential short squeeze, and general bullish momentum for all AI stocks. CoreWeave goes through another record borrowing period While CRWV is watched for its fundamental potential, in the short term, the price rally coincides with record costs to borrow shares, signaling a short squeeze. During the recent price climb to near-peak prices, CRWV borrowing rates also reached new records. As of June 12, the rate increased to 343.1%, then turned down to around 197%, with 200K CRWV shares available to borrow. CRWV borrowing rates increased to a record, suggesting a short squeeze is a partial factor for the stock’s rally. | Source: CompaniesMarketcap The short interest on CRWV moved within a wide range in the past few days, from 32% to as much as 45%. On social media, messages of short interest of up to 65% of the free float also appeared, boosting the FOMO for trading CRWV. Short interest is not a guaranteed trend, and can shift on a daily basis. However, CRWV can still trade under conditions similar to a short squeeze, at least in the short term. The shares are closely watched for their month-long bullish trend, which may lead to sharp increases in borrowing costs for covering short positions. In June, shares available to borrow increased, potentially easing the borrowing situation, though at a high price. On June 8, only 25K shares were available to borrow, increasing to over 250K at the new record borrowing rates. CoreWeave brings attention to mining companies The success of CoreWeave and demand for computation is boosting the shares of other mining companies. Core Scientific (CORZ) rose by over 12% in the past month. The company may have an ongoing boost from its 12-year deal with CoreWeave, with $4.7B earmarked for data center investments. Core Scientific is also building some of the CoreWeave data centers in Texas, with a goal of tapping 200MW in energy for data centers. The shares are up by 100% since the lows in April and May. The company mixes ongoing BTC mining with a treasury of 977 BTC, while also making forays into computation services. Other companies like CleanSpark and Riot Platforms are still trying to push off their recent lows, with more gradual gains. TeraWulf (WULF) had a more dramatic rally, rising from around $3.50 in early June to over $4.33. The company has previously benefitted from its pivot to AI data centers. It also extends the trend of seeking out renewable electricity resources to create sustainable data centers.

2025-06-17T09:20:02,"Bitcoin Giant MARA Holdings Makes Shocking $84M Deposit to Binance","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Giant MARA Holdings Makes Shocking $84M Deposit to Binance News broke recently about a substantial Bitcoin movement: a wallet address suspected of belonging to leading crypto miner MARA Holdings (formerly Marathon Digital) deposited a significant amount of BTC into the Binance exchange. This MARA Holdings BTC deposit has naturally sparked interest and speculation within the crypto community, raising questions about the company’s strategy and potential market implications. Understanding the Recent MARA Holdings BTC Deposit Let’s break down the details of this significant transaction. According to data shared by on-chain analytics platform The Data Nerd via X, citing Arkham data, 790 Bitcoin (BTC) valued at approximately $84.64 million was moved to Binance just hours ago. This isn’t a small sum, even for a major player like MARA Holdings. For context, MARA Holdings currently holds a substantial treasury of 12,786 BTC, valued at roughly $1.37 billion based on recent market prices. This deposit represents a notable fraction of their total Bitcoin holdings, prompting observers to question the strategic intent behind the move to Binance. Why Would a Crypto Miner Deposit Bitcoin on Binance? When a large crypto miner like MARA Holdings moves a significant amount of Bitcoin to an exchange like Binance, it typically signals an intention to sell or use the funds for operational purposes. Miners accumulate Bitcoin through their mining activities, and periodically liquidating some of their holdings is a necessary part of their business model. Here are some common reasons behind such a substantial BTC deposit: Covering Operational Costs: Mining operations require significant capital for electricity, hardware maintenance, facility management, and staffing. Selling accumulated Bitcoin is a primary method for MARA Holdings to cover these ongoing expenses. Funding Capital Expenditures: To remain competitive, crypto miner companies often need to invest in new, more efficient mining hardware or expand their infrastructure. A large BTC deposit can provide the necessary funds for these capital-intensive projects. Treasury Management: Companies like MARA Holdings actively manage their balance sheets. Selling Bitcoin might be part of a broader treasury strategy, such as diversifying assets, securing profits, or increasing cash reserves for financial flexibility and risk management. Market Timing: If the company’s management believes the current market price for Bitcoin is favorable, they might choose to sell a portion of their holdings to realize profits and strengthen their financial position. Debt Servicing: Some mining companies utilize debt financing for operations or expansion. Liquidating BTC holdings can be necessary to make scheduled loan repayments or manage debt obligations. Understanding these potential motivations helps shed light on why MARA Holdings might choose to make such a large BTC deposit on a major exchange like Binance. Potential Market Impact and MARA Holdings Strategy While 790 BTC is a substantial amount in absolute terms ($84.64 million), it’s important to consider it relative to the overall Bitcoin market and Binance’s immense daily trading volume, which often runs into billions of dollars. A single deposit of this size is unlikely to cause a massive, immediate price crash on its own due to the market’s depth and liquidity on Binance. However, it does add potential selling pressure to the market, which traders monitor closely. More importantly, the MARA Holdings BTC deposit provides insight into the company’s strategic decisions. It suggests they are actively managing their Bitcoin treasury and potentially preparing for significant expenditures or aiming to capitalize on current market conditions. This move could be interpreted by investors as a signal regarding the company’s financial health, operational needs, or outlook on the Bitcoin market. Analyzing the Effect on Bitcoin Price and Market Sentiment The immediate effect on the Bitcoin price from this specific MARA Holdings deposit might be minimal due to the scale of the broader market. However, large miner movements to exchanges are closely watched indicators within the crypto community. If other major crypto miner entities also begin depositing significant amounts of Bitcoin onto exchanges simultaneously, it could collectively signal a bearish sentiment among large holders, potentially impacting market psychology and price trends. For Bitcoin, the continuous flow of newly mined coins onto exchanges represents a constant supply pressure, which is typically balanced by demand from retail buyers, institutional investors, and long-term holders who prefer to accumulate and hold BTC off exchanges. This MARA Holdings move is just one piece of that larger, dynamic supply-demand puzzle that influences Bitcoin price movements. Conclusion: What Does the MARA Holdings BTC Deposit Signify? In conclusion, the reported MARA Holdings BTC deposit of 790 BTC ($84.64 million) into Binance highlights the active treasury management strategies employed by major crypto miner companies. While the deposit itself might not drastically alter the Bitcoin price, it serves as a reminder of the operational realities and financial decisions that influence miner behavior and contribute to the dynamic supply side of the Bitcoin market. Keeping an eye on such on-chain movements provides valuable context for understanding the broader market landscape and the strategies of key players like MARA Holdings as they navigate the complexities of the crypto mining industry and the Bitcoin market.

2025-06-17T09:15:51,"‘Bond King’ Jeffrey Gundlach Says US Dollar To Continue Going Down, Sees American Currency Entering Bear Market and Collapsing 25%","Billionaire Jeffrey Gundlach is warning that the US dollar is very close to triggering a collapse amid its sustained weakness this year. In a new video update, the DoubleLine Capital CEO says he’s keeping a close watch on the US dollar index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the USD against a basket of foreign currencies. Gundlach points out that the DXY has been in a macro downtrend, and he expects the US dollar index to melt down if it loses a diagonal trendline that has held as support since 2011. “The dollar has been in a pattern of lower highs going back to 1985 and lower lows, with the exception of 2020, perhaps. But I think the dollar is going to continue to go down. I know I am not alone in this view… If it breaks down, if you can mentally draw a trendline between that low in 2011 (DXY at 72) and the low back in 2021 (DXY at 89), if we break down below that trendline, I think it’s truly a dollar bear market. Should that happen, I would expect it to take out the low on this chart, so down below the level of around 72 or whatever. Now this is surreal.” Source: DoubleLine Capital/YouTube Based on Gundlach’s diagonal trendline, the DXY needs to stay above 97 to avoid a 25% crash toward 72. At time of writing, the DXY is hovering at 98.24. Last week, the billionaire Bond King said that the stock market, the dollar and the Treasury market are not behaving as usual, hinting at deeper concerns that are unsettling investors in US assets. According to Gundlach, foreign investors holding trillions in US assets may begin pulling out of American markets as concerns mount over the government’s unsustainable fiscal path.

2025-06-17T09:12:02,"Bitcoin-Focused Vinanz Triples Fundraising Target With £3.6M Raise to Fuel BTC Strategy","Bitcoin mining company Vinanz has raised £3.58 million from investors, more than triple its initial £1 million target, as it looks to expand its cryptocurrency holdings and mining operations. Key Takeaways: Vinanz raised £3.58 million, triple its goal, to expand Bitcoin mining and treasury holdings. Retail investors led the round with £3 million via WRAP. The company plans to rebrand as the London Bitcoin Company. The London Stock Exchange-listed company said the new funds would be used to purchase more Bitcoin and reinforce its North American mining presence. “This raise reflects growing interest in our LSE-listed Bitcoin strategy and helps accelerate our goal of becoming a leading UK main board-listed Bitcoin company,” said CEO Hewie Rattray. Retail Investors Dominate Vinanz Raise With £3M via WRAP Of the total, £3.03 million was raised through retail investment platform WRAP, with the remaining £550,000 coming from direct institutional subscriptions. Both tranches were priced at 13.75p per share. Vinanz runs mining facilities in the U.S. and Canada and holds Bitcoin as a treasury asset, following a model popularized by U.S.-based firms such as MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, and Riot Platforms. With Bitcoin’s price surging over 75% since April 2024, driven in part by the most recent halving event, investor appetite for exposure to the asset appears to be heating up again. We are very pleased to see so many new retail shareholders coming on to the @VinanzBTC share register after this successful Retail Offer WRAP. Brilliant result £3.6m. We are going to own a lot more #Bitcoin very soon and also gives us horsepower to grow our biz. #BTC . Very… https://t.co/tqpSlWTFo1 — David Lenigas (@DavidLenigas) June 17, 2025 Bitcoin briefly touched $111,000 in May and currently trades near $107,000. Analysts have floated long-term price projections ranging from $200,000 to $1 million. Vinanz’s raise underscores rising interest in regulated, exchange-listed vehicles for Bitcoin exposure, especially in the UK, where few firms are subject to full LSE and FCA oversight. The company is expected to rebrand as the London Bitcoin Company in the near future. The announcement adds to a growing list of firms embracing Bitcoin as a balance sheet hedge or strategic investment. Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. Strategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder , with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

As Bitcoin stabilizes and Ethereum matures, early-stage protocols like Neo Pepe are emerging as crypto’s next breakout bets. Table of Contents Bitcoin proved crypto could be real Ethereum expanded crypto’s capabilities Neo Pepe Coin: Structured for crypto’s next cycle 5 reasons why early access to Neo Pepe matters Take action now Bitcoin set the stage. Ethereum expanded the horizons. Now, the market eagerly anticipates what’s next. While established tokens continue dominating headlines, real opportunities for new investors often lie in emerging, early-stage, and well-structured alternatives. One standout gaining attention is the Neo Pepe Protocol, currently priced at $0.05423 in Stage 0 of its presale. Already, over $103,000 has been raised toward its initial cap of $121,415.98. When this stage concludes, the price jumps to $0.061461. Neo Pepe’s presale consists of 16 stages, with each phase incrementally increasing the entry price, presenting an optimal scenario for early adopters. But investors must act swiftly, this window won’t stay open indefinitely. Bitcoin proved crypto could be real Before Bitcoin, the concept of digital money was widely dismissed. BTC legitimized cryptocurrency, demonstrating it could function independently from central systems and delivering one of history’s most remarkable ROI curves. However, Bitcoin’s revolutionary status is now well-established. Major funds, banks, and institutions now treat Bitcoin as a stable commodity. Its volatility has reduced significantly, and growth, though steady, lacks the explosiveness early investors enjoyed. For those aiming at rapid 10x returns, Bitcoin’s golden era is mostly past, stable, yes; transformative, no longer. Ethereum expanded crypto’s capabilities Ethereum ( ETH ) radically shifted crypto’s trajectory, moving beyond a mere store of value by introducing smart contracts, decentralized apps, and diverse digital ecosystems. Its innovations paved the way for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and virtually every significant crypto advancement post-2017. Yet, innovation comes at a cost. Ethereum newcomers often grapple with high transaction fees, scaling bottlenecks, and technical complexities. Though ETH remains foundational, it now faces robust competition from faster, cheaper blockchain alternatives. Ethereum laid a foundation, but the future belongs to those who can effectively build upon it or entirely reimagine it. You might also like: TRON amazes fans with features while Neo Pepe gains traction Neo Pepe Coin: Structured for crypto’s next cycle The rise of DeFi and NFTs has amplified Ethereum’s limitations, fueling increased interest in alternative blockchain platforms such as the Neo Pepe Protocol. Neo Pepe introduces a sophisticated on-chain governance system prioritizing transparency and security. To submit proposals, participants must stake at least 1 million NEOP. Each proposal undergoes a meticulously structured process involving a voting delay, a one-week voting period, and a timelock before execution, ensuring every decision is deliberate, transparent, and permanently recorded. Additionally, Neo Pepe Coin offers a fixed token supply of exactly 1 billion NEOP. With no minting capabilities within the token contract, the supply cap is unchangeable, thus eliminating inflation concerns or unauthorized token creation. 5 reasons why early access to Neo Pepe matters Increasing token price: With 16 presale stages, each round progressively increases token costs, rewarding the earliest investors. Structured governance: Transparent and secure voting ensures community-led project evolution. Fixed supply: A permanent 1 billion token cap guarantees scarcity and long-term value. No insider surprises: Neo Pepe Protocol commits to transparency, avoiding hidden unlocks or insider privileges. Classic crypto appeal: Echoes early Bitcoin and Ethereum vibes, providing open access and equal opportunity. Ethereum and Bitcoin began similarly, anyone with determination and basic tools could participate. Today’s landscape, dominated by institutions, has fewer open opportunities. Neo Pepe Protocol brings back that original crypto spirit: transparent governance, clear rules, and an equal-access presale structure.

With Bitcoin and altcoins highly sensitive to macroeconomic signals, all eyes are on the Fed’s next move — and especially Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks. What Time Is the FOMC Announcement? The Federal Reserve will reveal its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday, June 18, 2025 , at 2:00 p.m. ET (11:30 p.m. IST) . The FOMC meeting schedule is as follows: 2:00 PM ET – FOMC Interest Rate Decision 2:00 PM ET – FOMC Statement 2:00 PM ET – FOMC Dot Plot Release 2:30 PM ET (Midnight IST) – Powell’s Press Conference Will the Fed Cut Rates in June? Most traders believe the Fed won’t cut rates this month , with market odds sitting at around 97.5% in favor of no change. With inflation still running hot and ongoing tensions in the Middle East, the Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady in the 4.25% to 4.50% range. While no immediate cuts are on the table, investors will be paying close attention to Powell’s tone for any clues about potential rate cuts later this year. Fed Interest Rate Chart (as of June 2025) The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% during the June 18, 2025 FOMC meeting. The effective federal funds rate has held at 4.33% since January, and the Fed is likely to maintain its current stance. While futures markets suggest about a 60% chance of a rate cut in September, the upcoming meeting is expected to signal patience. Additionally, the Fed’s updated projections may indicate fewer rate cuts for 2025, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainty. Month Fed Funds Rate (%) Jan 2025 4.33 Feb 2025 4.33 Mar 2025 4.33 Apr 2025 4.33 May 2025 4.33 Jun 2025* 4.50 (target range upper) Bitcoin Price Outlook: What Comes Next? The rate decision itself might not surprise anyone, but it’s Powell’s speech that could move markets. If he shows concern about slowing economic growth or even hints at possible rate cuts or a return to quantitative easing (QE), it could spark a broad rally across financial markets. Two potential catalysts for Bitcoin: Geopolitical de-escalation , which could trigger a relief rally and squeeze short positions. A dovish Powell , which could be a bullish spark for Bitcoin, altcoins, and high-beta crypto assets. Currently, Bitcoin’s funding rates are negative, suggesting that bears are over-leveraged. If sentiment flips — especially after Powell’s press conference — That could trigger a short squeeze, fueling a strong surge in the crypto market. What is a FOMC Meeting? The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting is when the Fed’s main policy group sets U.S. monetary policy, including interest rates. Will the Fed cut interest rates at the June 18 meeting? Markets overwhelmingly expect no change — CME FedWatch data puts the odds of a hold at ~99.9%, with just 0.1% chance of a cut What’s the current federal funds rate? he Fed has held target range at 4.25–4.50% since January, with the effective federal funds rate around ~4.33%, and no change expected for June",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/fomc-meeting-today-what-to-expect-from-jerome-powell-speech-and-fed-interest-rate/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T09:00:45,"CoinShares Files for Spot Solana ETF, Proposes Staking Integration","CoinShares has entered the competitive race for spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. The digital asset manager submitted a Form S-1 registration statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marking its intent to list a spot Solana ETF for public trading. The application, submitted via the SEC’s EDGAR system, identifies CoinShares Co. as the sponsor of the fund, with Coinbase Custody and BitGo Trust slated to handle custody of the underlying SOL tokens. CoinShares Eyes Yield Through Staking in Solana ETF Filing A notable component of CoinShares’ proposal involves staking. According to the filing, the fund plans to stake a portion of its SOL holdings through designated providers . Although the initial staking partner has not been disclosed, the document states that staking rewards earned by the fund will be reinvested. The staking arrangement would be finalized ahead of the trust’s formal launch, introducing a yield component to what would otherwise be a passive, price-tracking vehicle . CoinShares joins seven other firms seeking approval for similar products. These include VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, Grayscale Investments, and Fidelity Investments. All applicants aim to launch funds that mirror the price of SOL, Solana’s native asset and currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The entry of multiple high-profile issuers suggests growing institutional interest in Solana as a tradable asset within US markets . ETF Competition Heats Up as Regulatory Sentiment Evolves The timing of CoinShares’ filing coincides with increasing speculation that the SEC may be softening its stance toward crypto spot ETFs. Last week, several asset managers, including VanEck and Franklin Templeton, reportedly amended their filings at the request of the SEC. These amendments included additional details on in-kind redemptions and staking methodologies, indicating a shift in how regulators may approach products that incorporate on-chain functionality such as staking. In parallel developments, Trump Media & Technology Group’s Truth Social platform has submitted its own ETF application. The proposed Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF aims to allocate approximately 75% of its assets to Bitcoin and the remainder to Ethereum . Filed under Form S-1, the ETF would be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital LLC, with flexibility to change the asset allocation ratio at its discretion. Foris DAX Trust Co. LLC is named as the custodian. Truth Social becomes the third known entity to pursue a dual crypto ETF product, joining Bitwise and Hashdex. Meanwhile, firms such as Volatility Shares and ProShares have filed for similar offerings, but those are tied to crypto futures markets rather than spot assets . The range of filings reflects both investor demand and evolving regulatory engagement with the crypto ETF market.

2025-06-17T08:42:55,"CleanSpark: Gaining Efficiency And Scale","Summary CleanSpark's operational efficiency and hashrate growth make it one of the most competitive and profitable bitcoin miners in the U.S. market. The company balances HODLing and selling bitcoin to fund expansion, using innovative treasury strategies like lending and covered calls to enhance returns. Key risks include bitcoin price volatility and not fully participating in potential bull market gains by selling some mined bitcoin for operations. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) recently saw a nice appreciation in its stock price over the past couple months from the April lows. CleanSpark, who proclaims to be ""America's Bitcoin Miner"", became primarily focused on bitcoin mining in 2020. Despite the company's fairly recent shift in focus, they have risen in the ranks to become one of the most competitive public bitcoin mining companies in the public market. As this article will show, despite not holding as much bitcoin as companies like MARA Holdings ( MARA ), their performance metrics seem to be improving more quickly than others. CleanSpark's Monthly Update On June 3, CleanSpark released its most recent update for the month of May where they showed impressive growth over the month, HODLing 12,502 bitcoin compared to 12,100 a month earlier. Although they HODL'd over 400 more bitcoin month-over-month, they mined a total of 694 bitcoin in May, selling some bitcoin to fund operations. They reached a total bitcoin hashrate of 47 Eh/s and plan on reaching 50 Eh/s in the month of June. This is an impressive feat considering MARA Holdings, a company that is nearly a decade older than CleanSpark, has amassed an only slightly larger hashrate of 58.3 Eh/s as of their May 2025 report. I recommended CleanSpark as a strong buy in my article on February 17, 2025 with the price trading just above $10/share. My recommendation was mostly based upon the mining efficiency of their fleet, which has led to them stacking bitcoin faster with more profitable operations. Since February 17, bitcoin has been volatile, but today, CleanSpark's stock trades near $10 once again. Has it bottomed and begun an upward rise alongside the potential bitcoin bull market? Time will tell. Company Overview American Made Bitcoin This chart shows the growth of the company's bitcoin mining from before the most recent halving to today. Even in the midst of the bitcoin halving, CleanSpark has continued to grow by mining more and more bitcoin, relative to the halving. Monthly Bitcoin Production ( CleanSpark 's May2025 Presentation) The company operates solely in America. This map shows the company's operations. Its largest footprint is found in the state of Georgia, where they first started their bitcoin mining journey with their first acquisition of ATL data centers. Bitcoin Mining Areas of Operation ( CleanSpark 's May2025 Presentation) CleanSpark's Mining Hashrate Through their growth in operations, they have more than doubled their mining hashrate each year, and they are on pace to do the same again in 2025. Here's the outlook from the CEO during the Q2 2025 Conference call. Looking beyond mid-year, we have active projects ongoing with miners and infrastructure paid for that will push us over 57 exahash. For long-term expansion, we have already secured infrastructure in hand or under contract to support growth beyond 60 exahash. Hashrate Growth Chart ( CleanSpark May2025 Presentation) Comparing CleanSpark's Hashrate Growth to MARA Holdings This is a graph comparing MARA Holding's hashrate over time. Although MARA Holdings began mining bitcoin in 2018, you can see how CLSK is on a trajectory that might overtake MARA. However, MARA has some exciting projects as well that will likely also continue to grow their hashrate quickly. MARA Holdings Hashrate Growth (Q1 2025 MARA Earnings Presentation) CleanSpark's Growth in Energy Efficiency This graphic shows CleanSpark's cost of mining bitcoin in terms of energy costs. Their average cost/kWh was $.06 cents in the most recent quarter. This was a substantial rise compared to the average cost/kWh of the previous two years. With energy costs bound to rise over time thanks to inflation, as well as bitcoin halvings reducing revenue, it is imperative for companies like CleanSpark to become ever more efficient. That is what they have accomplished by driving down the J/TH (Joules/TH) metric by over 40 percent since 2023 to 17.03 J/TH. CleanSpark's Operating Metrics ( CleanSpark May2025 Presentation) Because of CleanSpark's focus on efficiency, they were able to mine a bitcoin for the cost of $42,667 per bitcoin. With bitcoin trading above $100k per bitcoin, which creates an attractive operating margin for the company. With CleanSpark owning one of the most efficient fleets among public bitcoin mining companies, we can assume this is also one of the lowest costs among companies mining bitcoin. BTC Treasury Management As of April 30, 2025, CleanSpark's bitcoin treasury was valued at $1.13 billion. This is almost double the value that the company held in October 2024, just seven months prior. This was a combination of bitcoin's price appreciation and a nearly 40 percent increase in their bitcoin stack. Bitcoin Holdings Over Time ( CleanSpark May2025 Presentation) CleanSpark Performance Comparison Over Time As of January 2025 CleanSpark (This Article) June 7, 2025 CleanSpark ( Last Article ) Feb 17, 2025 All-In Power Costs 6.0c/kWh 4.6c/kWh Fleet Efficiency 16.71 J/Th 16.15 J/Th Average bitcoin Produced per Day 22.38 20.19 Bitcoin Held 12,502 10,556 Bitcoin Produced 05/2025 694 626 Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding(MM) 280.9 280.8 Total Deployed Hash Rate 45.6 EH/s 40.1 EH/s Market Cap($B) $2.75 $2.95 Quarterly Revenue($M) $181.7 $162.3 Debt-to-Asset Ratio Q3* .29 .27 New Financing Opportunities CleanSpark has begun to become more creative in generating additional revenue and financing from their bitcoin stack. First, they are increasing their Coinbase lending program to $200 million where they borrow using their bitcoin as collateral, which should provide a method for them to HODL greater amounts of their bitcoin. Here was the comment from Coinbase: Coinbase is excited to support CleanSpark and their innovative approach to capital and treasury management in Bitcoin mining,"" said Brett Tejpaul, Head of Coinbase Institutional. ""By deepening our relationship with CleanSpark and offering institutional-grade lending and custody management through our Prime service offering, we're committed to delivering strategic solutions that help CleanSpark thrive in the evolving crypto landscape. Secondly, the company will begin to sell covered calls on some of their bitcoin. Since they have chosen to sell a portion of their bitcoin to finance operations, selling covered calls to capture the premium to spot price only makes sense. The CFO Mike Vermicelli describes the covered call premiums like this from their 2025 Q2 conference call. Bitcoin’s trading around, what, $101,000 right now. So if we were to issue covered calls at the money, so with a strike price of $101,000 one week out, that’s a premium of a little over $2,400 or 2.4%. Risks and Counterarguments Bitcoin's Price Risk One of the biggest risks for CleanSpark is the bitcoin price. This should be obvious to investors, in that if the bitcoin price declines, then CleanSpark's share price will decline as well. This will impact their revenue as well as their balance sheet. But if you believe in bitcoin, then you understand that bitcoin's volatility can work to your advantage if you are patient. Not HODLing All Their Bitcoin Given bitcoin's impressive growth and its potential future growth, a risk that may not be so obvious, is the risk of not HODLing all of the bitcoin that the company mines. This is not a risk in that the company could go down in value, but rather a risk that other companies that HODL all of their bitcoin will perform better. Although CleanSpark's strategy should make them more stable, other bitcoin miners such as MARA have embarked on a bitcoin policy of not selling any of their bitcoin. If in fact we are entering a bitcoin bull market, then the companies that use financial leverage in order to fund operations while not selling any bitcoin, will outperform. As I mentioned, CleanSpark has chosen to hold most of their bitcoin, but to sell some to fund their expansion plans and ongoing operations. If bitcoin were to double or triple in price during a potential bull market, CleanSpark will miss out on some of those relatively quick returns in exchange for reducing balance sheet risk from greater debt levels. Looking at this from another perspective, some investors may appreciate this strategy more than the full HODL strategy. By selling bitcoin to finance operations, it certainly incentivizes CleanSpark to continue being one of, if not the most, efficient bitcoin miners in the market. Acquiring bitcoin via debt and issuing shares could make a bitcoin mining company complacent with their operating performance. The Bitcoin Treasury Companies Another counterargument to CleanSpark and the bitcoin mining industry at large, is the idea that bitcoin treasury companies will outperform bitcoin mining companies. The logic is that bitcoin mining companies have to invest tremendous amounts of capital to acquire the same number of bitcoin per share as companies like MicroStrategy, or as it is now called, Str ategy ( MSTR ). Strategy has experienced so much success, that many everyday companies have begun to follow by adopting bitcoin onto their balance sheets. Although few have tried to copy Strategy by making their company's sole focus being a bitcoin treasury company, there have been several that have begun, such as the future Twenty One Capital company which is waiting to be merged with Cantor Equity Partners ( CEP ). Tariffs Tariffs that increase the cost of bitcoin mining equipment coming from China is another risk. This, no doubt, can have an impact on the company. However, the CEO, Zach Bradford, tried to spin this as a positive in the following statement: In fact, if tariffs persist, we may see opportunities to acquire smaller miners at attractive valuations, particularly those unable to afford next-generation hardware under the new cost structures. This is a clear example of how our infrastructure-first, counter-cyclical strategy continues to generate strategic advantages over peers. Conclusion CleanSpark, among bitcoin mining companies, is one of the better, if not the best, company. If you believe in bitcoin mining, then CleanSpark belongs in your portfolio. They have proven themselves to be driven by continuous improvement, which has positioned them as one of the most efficient bitcoin mining companies. Given that bitcoin is a scarce, finite commodity, a company can only thrive long-term by being focused on continuous improvement. Currently, I think capital markets still have a hunger for bitcoin that the bitcoin treasury companies are positioned to benefit from. With limited competition, treasury companies like Strategy will likely continue to outperform. But bitcoin mining companies should still perform very well. One day, when the market competition among bitcoin treasury companies becomes much tighter, I expect bitcoin mining companies will provide a greater source of alpha for investors. Like I said, I don't think that day is today, but I'm not sure when that will be. Investors who want to invest in bitcoin in the public markets must play their hand and let the chips fall. But if your bet is on bitcoin mining, then CleanSpark is a strong buy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795333-cleanspark-gaining-efficiency-and-scale?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","CLSK",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T08:39:50,"Pay for Your Latte with Bitcoin? SpacePay’s Got You Covered","The post Pay for Your Latte with Bitcoin? SpacePay’s Got You Covered appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ever tried paying for coffee with Bitcoin? Yeah, it’s usually a nightmare. Most places either don’t accept it or make you jump through so many hoops that your latte gets cold before you’re done. But here’s where things get interesting. SpacePay , this fintech company from London, figured out how to let you pay with crypto using the same card machines that are already everywhere. They work with existing Android payment terminals, support more than 325 crypto wallets, and instantly convert everything to regular money so shop owners don’t freak out about price swings. Their $SPY token presale has pulled in over $1.1 million so far, with tokens going for $0.003181 each. Your Morning Latte Just Got a Crypto Upgrade We all know that one friend who owns Bitcoin but can never actually spend it anywhere useful. Coffee shops want these customers, but setting up crypto payments usually costs a fortune and requires a computer science degree to figure out. SpacePay decided to fix this mess. Coffee shop owners can start accepting crypto payments tomorrow using whatever card machine they already have. No expensive upgrades. No confusing setup process. Just a quick software update and they’re ready to go. For customers, it’s dead simple. Pull out your phone, open your favorite crypto wallet, and pay with Ethereum or whatever you’ve got. Takes about the same time as tapping your credit card. Done. This opens up a pretty big opportunity. There are more than 400 million people walking around with crypto in their digital wallets. Most of them would love to actually use it for something other than staring at price charts all day. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1925613304023511376 Here’s How SpacePay Deals with Crypto’s Wild Price Swings Anyone who’s owned cryptocurrency knows the drill. You wake up and your Bitcoin is worth 15% less than when you went to bed. Coffee shop owners hate this uncertainty, and honestly, who can blame them? SpacePay solves this problem in the most straightforward way possible. Customer pays with crypto, SpacePay immediately converts it to dollars or euros or whatever currency the business owner wants. The shop gets regular money. No crypto risk. No sleepless nights worrying about market crashes. This instant conversion thing is probably why business owners actually want to use SpacePay. They get access to crypto-spending customers without any of the usual drama. Plus, SpacePay only charges 0.5% per transaction, which beats most credit card companies by a mile. Think about a busy café processing 500 transactions a day. Those fee savings add up fast. More money stays in the business owner’s pocket instead of going to payment processors. Visit SpacePay Presale What’s the Deal with $SPY Tokens? SpacePay runs on their own token called $SPY. Token holders get to vote on platform changes, which is actually pretty cool if you’re into having a say in how things work. But here’s the part that gets people excited: revenue sharing. As SpacePay processes more transactions, token holders get a cut of the profits. More businesses using SpacePay means more money flowing back to the community. They also do these monthly airdrops for active users. Plus quarterly video calls where you can actually talk to the SpacePay team and ask questions. It feels less like buying tokens and more like joining a community that’s building something together. Early access to new features is another perk. $SPY holders get to test stuff before everyone else. If you’re running a business that accepts crypto payments, getting first dibs on new tools could give you an edge over competitors. Getting This Thing Up and Running SpacePay takes security seriously, which is smart considering how many crypto projects have gone sideways because of hacks. They use proper encryption and spread things across multiple systems instead of putting everything in one place. Setting up SpacePay looks pretty painless for merchants. Connect your Android payment terminal to their network, update the software, and you’re accepting crypto alongside regular cards. No rocket science required. The wallet support is solid too. Whether you’re team MetaMask or prefer something else, SpacePay probably works with it. They support the major cryptocurrencies plus stablecoins, so customers have options while merchants still get predictable fiat currency. Where This Could Go Next SpacePay already has a working product and seems focused on staying compliant with regulations. That’s probably smart given how many crypto companies have run into legal trouble by moving too fast and breaking things. Any business that takes card payments could potentially use SpacePay. Coffee shops, retail stores, restaurants, you name it. The low barrier to entry means even small businesses can get on board without breaking the bank. As more merchants join, the whole thing becomes more useful for everyone. More places to spend crypto means more transactions, which means more revenue to share with token holders. If you want to participate in the $SPY presale, head over to SpacePay’s website and connect your crypto wallet. Tokens are currently priced at $0.003181, and you can pay with various cryptocurrencies or even use a regular bank card if you’re new to the crypto world.

2025-06-17T08:32:54,"Why Bitfinex’s KYC Process Sets the Gold Standard in Crypto Industry","Would you ever lend money to a stranger who emailed you out of the blue? Exactly. Yet that’s the reality of the internet in 2025. Every day, you’re transacting with people you’ve never met, from every corner of the globe. Many are legitimate. Some know exactly how to hide behind layers of fake information. In fact, as the Bitrace Crypto Crime Report 2025 points out, crypto-related losses have already topped $502 million this year , with 63% due to hacks and the rest tied to phishing, rug pulls, and social engineering. Many of these crimes share one thing in common: they exploit weak or non-existent Know Your Customer (KYC) processes on platforms where compliance isn’t a priority. At Bitfinex, not only do we follow global compliance standards, we set the gold standard. Our KYC process is designed to protect users, prevent fraud, and ensure long-term access to a maturing financial system. At Bitfinex, KYC is the backbone of trust. Here, every stranger is verified. Thousands are going through our verification process the same way you did. All to protect you! At Bitfinex, Every Stranger is Verified KYC isn’t about red tape. It’s about responsibility. Without it, criminals can slip through the cracks, using throwaway accounts as launchpads for money laundering and fraud. While some platforms boast “instant access” or “no KYC required,” the underlying reality is often higher risk for users and higher conversion for their bottom line. High-stakes trading competitions, generous bonuses, and heavily hyped (often unvetted) listings, when paired with fast-tracked KYC processes that prioritise speed over thoroughness, are all part of the drive for massive acquisition. According to a 2020 study by blockchain analysis firm CypherTrace , in 2019, about 56% of crypto exchanges still had no KYC at all. That same year, criminals laundered an estimated $3.38 billion in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies As many exchanges prioritise rapid user acquisition and retail volume at all costs, often at the expense of safety, Bitfinex has consistently chosen the route of longevity, transparency, and compliance. Would you trust a bank that let anyone move millions without verifying who they are? Neither would we. Every credible financial platform, whether it’s a bank, brokerage, or crypto exchange, requires identity verification. This is the norm of best financial practices. At Bitfinex, we set the same financial standard for a crypto exchange. Here’s What Strong KYC Looks Like Bitfinex’s process is clear and structured but intentionally thorough: Basic Plus Verification Just upload your ID, confirm your address and phone number, and take a quick selfie. This gives you access to crypto deposits, withdrawals, and spot trading. Intermediate Verification Add a second ID, a proof of address, and complete a short financial form. Perfect if you want higher limits or to unlock margin trading. Full Verification Include a bank statement and a few extra details. Required if you want to deposit or withdraw fiat. This is bank-grade onboarding , built for users operating in a market where billions move daily and where security isn’t optional. Because just like any credible financial institution, we don’t offer advanced tools and global liquidity just to anyone without verifying who’s behind the screen. A Platform Worthy of Professional Traders Registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) while embracing The Original Bitcoin Exchange as our legacy, Bitfinex has been serving professional traders and institutions since 2012. That legacy isn’t built on hype. It’s built on trust. It happened because we took security, regulation, and infrastructure seriously long before it became industry standard. Today, Bitfinex holds approximately 403,000 BTC , worth over $47 billion , making it the second-largest bitcoin reserve among centralized exchanges . This is a signal that the biggest holders in the space continue to choose Bitfinex to move, manage, and secure large-scale capital. On-chain data confirms Bitfinex’s appeal to whales, including a $400 million ETH transfer from two dormant wallets in 2024. These are long-term actors choosing infrastructure built for serious capital. Our KYC process is intentionally rigorous, not just to meet global regulatory standards, but to ensure that all customers on our platform are protected. Our KYC process has been refined, audited, and stress-tested to meet not just where the industry was, but where it’s going. And it’s why Bitfinex continues to attract the most serious participants in the space , those who think long-term and act with intention. Trust Is Earned, Not Fast-Tracked A thorough KYC process is a feature and a high bar we proudly set . And the foundation of wealth building starts with asset security at its roots. In crypto, as in life, the things that are built to last are never the easiest, they’re just the most worth it. At the end of the day, a platform that takes your identity seriously, is far more likely to take your assets seriously too.

The MATIC price could reach a maximum of $0.47181 in 2025. POL price with a potential surge may reach a high of $4.94731 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network’s high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL’s price value, too. Through, POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framwork of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin, and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction. Table of contents Overview Polygon Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Polygon Price Action 2026 POL Price Prediction 2027 Polygon Crypto Price Forecast 2028 MATIC Coin Price Projection 2029 Polygon Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Token MATIC Price $ 0.21819891 2.88% Market Cap $ 0.00 Trading Volume $ 1,217,344.7306 Circulating Supply 0.00 All-time High $1.29 Mar 14, 2024 All-time Low $0.1533 Apr 07, 2025 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 As evident on the POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE, its price fell in Q1 2025, along with other altcoins in the market, due to trade deal problems in the US. This led investors to refrain from investing in the entire market and watch from the sidelines. However, in Q2 2025’s April month onwards, momentum started as investors got a glimpse of improving geopolitical situations and other positive factors. However, like every other altcoin, POL price action didn’t have a big rise in early May, and it lost its strength early on after reaching $0.269. Even the RSI has slipped below the median line and has taken rejection from the 14-day SMA smoothing line and is at 40.27. Despite the loss in momentum, the bears have not been dominant yet, and it is consolidating near the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands and key support zone. But if it breaks the support zone’s low of $0.194, then bearish forces will take control and push it down to the $0.15 level. However, if the conditions improve, then the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.4572 could act as a magnet for the POL price to rise. This level also aligns with early 2025’s price action-based high-volume profile level. If it successfully clears the $0.4572 level in June or July, there is a higher chance that the POL price might hit the Fibonacci 0.786 level at $0.6336 and the other at $0.7655 by the end of the year 2025. On the contrary, if the $0.4572 proves to be too strong to break, then there is a strong chance for bears to take over the trend and repel the price from the fibonacci 0.5 level to the lows of 2025.

2025-06-17T08:30:16,"Ethereum Slows Down In June: Historical Data Says More Losses To Come","Ethereum is already seeing a slowdown for the month of June, suggesting that it is sticking to established historical trends for the month. With half of the month already gone, the altcoin is likely to finish out the month in the same trend, and the previous cycle data warns of further price crashes. But how far down will the Ethereum price go before it recovers? Ethereum Fighting The Bears In June According to data from the CryptoRank website, the month of June is the second-worst month for the Ethereum price historically. This comes down to its average and median returns, which sit at -6.56% and -5.65%, respectively, showing that returns for the month are likely to be red. It falls behind only the month of September, which has -10.7% average returns and -13.6% median returns. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Explodes 3,194%: Can It Change The SHIB Price Trajectory? In the decade that the Ethereum cryptocurrency has existed, only a total of three years have the month of June ended in green. In contrast, six years have closed in the red, including back in 2024 when the Ethereum price tumbled 8.64% in June. So far, the month of June 2025 has seen very little gains, with CryptoRank data only showing a 0.20% increase at the time of writing. This suggests a continuation of the established bearish trend, especially with the bear still pushing down the price of Bitcoin, and the rest of the crypto market keeps going down with it. If the altcoin does stick to its historical performance, then it is possible that the price could break below $2,500 before the month is over. However, there is still the possibility of a recovery if the Bitcoin price does continue to rise. Bullish Sentiment Still Strong Despite the bearish trend of June, crypto analysts are still calling for higher prices for Ethereum. One analyst, Crypto Patel, predicts a possible short-term crash if the Ethereum price drops below $2,500. Patel believes $2,000 is next if this happens. However, long-term remains bullish as the crypto analyst believes Ethereum is headed for $10,000.

Crypto analyst Lord of Alts also explained that Ethereum is actually playing out as expected, with three trends. The first is consolidation, then accumulation, before ending in a price expansion. Lord of Alts says ETH is entering this trend again and puts the price as high as $6,000 by 2026.

The altcoins are mostly in the red today, aside from WBT, which has extended its massive run. BTC’s Up and Down The geopolitical tension in the Middle East harmed the primary cryptocurrency at the end of the previous business week. At the time, the asset traded close to $108,500, but Israel’s initial attack caught the market off guard, and bitcoin slumped by several grand to under $103,000. Although Iran retaliated on the next day and the attacks have continued, BTC managed to recover some ground during the weekend and stood between $104,000 and $106,000. The start of the current business week was a lot more positive as bitcoin jumped past $107,000 on Monday and kept climbing in the evening to a multi-day peak of $109,000. However, as US President Trump advised for the immediate evacuation of Tehran, BTC slumped back down to under $106,400. It has reclaimed some ground since then and now trades close to $107,000, but it’s still slightly down on a daily scale. Its market cap has dropped to $2.120 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has increased slightly to 61.6%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView WBT Defies the Odds Most altcoins have turned red on a daily scale, led by the recent high-flyer, HYPE. The asset, which charted yet another all-time high yesterday, is down by over 5% since then to $42. Even more painful declines come from the likes of PEPE, PI, TAO, ONDO, ICP, and KAS. SOL, SUI, AVAX, ADA, ETH, DOGE, and LINK are also in the red, albeit in a more modest manner. In contrast, XRP, BNB, TRX, and BCH have charted some gains. WBT stands in a league of its own, having surged by another 30% in the past 24 hours to tap a fresh peak above $50.

As of writing, probability that U.S. will strike Iran by June 30 stood at 46%, down sharply from the overnight high of 66.9%, according to trading in the Polymarket-listed contract "" U.S. military action against Iran before July ."" The decline follows a report from Axios that the U.S. is mulling a meeting this week between U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The meeting will be aimed at exploring a diplomatic initiative involving a nuclear deal and an end of the Israel-Iran conflict. Yet one Polymarket user said that ""Trump should join the fray: his troops need the experience in postpostmodern warfare,"" calling for a military action against Iran. On Friday, Israel launched coordinated airstrikes and drone attacks on multiple sites across on Iranian military and nuclear facilities, leading to retaliatory action by Tehran. Bitcoin initially fell in a knee-jerk reaction to $102,750 alongside risk aversion in traditional markets, characterized by an uptick in the anti-risk Japanese yen and weakness in the U.S. stocks. BTC, however, has stabilized since then, with prices recovering to trade at $106,700 at press time. However, futures tied to the S&P 500 traded 0.7% lower.

Over the past 48 hours, Bitcoin price action has remained choppy as the asset navigates between a key supply zone and a short-term order block. BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The rejection near the red liquidity area marked by a Change of Character (ChoCH) confirms sellers defending the $108,800–$110,000 range. However, bulls are holding onto structure, with price still above the $106,000 demand zone. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) A closer look at the 4-hour chart shows that Bitcoin price retraced after testing the overhead imbalance zone. Despite the bearish reaction, price has not violated the recent bullish ChoCH support formed near $105,900. The Bollinger Bands show expanding volatility, but the upper band rejection aligns with the local top. Meanwhile, price is hovering near the 20/50/100 EMA cluster between $106,270 and $106,530, keeping the trend neutral in the short term.

2025-06-17T08:10:48,"Elizabeth Warren Slams Stablecoin Bill, Says “This Helps Musk and Trump Get Rich”","The post Elizabeth Warren Slams Stablecoin Bill, Says “This Helps Musk and Trump Get Rich” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill to regulate payment stablecoins , is now at the center of a major controversy. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has raised alarms, warning that billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos could abuse the system if critical loopholes aren’t fixed. Her warning has ignited a heated debate in the crypto community and among lawmakers. So, what exactly is the GENIUS Act , and why is it drawing so much attention? What Is the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is a proposed U.S. Senate bill aiming to establish a federal framework for payment stablecoins. It sets out: Rules for issuance and transparency Reserve requirements for stablecoin providers Clear oversight roles for regulators The bill recently cleared a cloture vote and is now headed for a full Senate floor vote, where several amendments are expected to be considered. Warren’s Warning: “Billionaires Could Track Your Spending” Senator Elizabeth Warren took to X (formerly Twitter) to issue a sharp warning: “If Congress doesn’t fix the GENIUS Act, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos could launch stablecoins that track your purchases, exploit your data, and squeeze out competitors.” Warren’s statement highlights a key concern: if tech giants gain control over both stablecoin issuance and the platforms on which they operate, it could create a dangerous data monopoly. Musk and Bezos Eyeing Stablecoins? Elon Musk Reports suggest Musk’s company X is exploring stablecoin integration through its X Money initiative, with the goal of enabling peer-to-peer payments and reducing transaction fees. Jeff Bezos Speculation is swirling that Amazon is also developing a USD-backed stablecoin , aiming to cut costs and streamline online payments. These potential moves by tech titans are exactly what Warren fears—corporate dominance over digital money and consumer data. The Consumer Risk: Privacy at Stake? Stablecoin transactions are recorded on public blockchains. But if a corporation controls both the stablecoin and the user platform, it could: Connect your wallet to your profile Monitor spending behavior in real-time Use the data for hyper-targeted ads, dynamic pricing, or even sell it to third parties This raises major privacy and surveillance concerns. Trump, Stablecoins, and the Politics of Regulation Senator Warren also warned of another risk: bailouts. If corporate stablecoins crash, taxpayers might be on the hook. Adding fuel to the fire, President Donald Trump is now tied to a controversial stablecoin project. Trump’s Crypto Empire: World Liberty Financial World Liberty Financial (WLF) was launched in 2024 Trump serves as “Chief Crypto Advocate” His sons are listed as “ Web3 Ambassadors.” A Trump-affiliated entity owns 60% of WLF and receives 75% of revenue WLF has raised over $550 million and issued a USD1 stablecoin , backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents. While Trump’s support for crypto aligns with his campaign promises, critics question whether there’s a conflict of interest. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Today: Bitcoin Dips, XRP Pulls Back, Ethereum Lags Ahead of FOMC , Supporters vs Critics: The Stablecoin Divide Not everyone agrees with Warren. Fred Rispoli, a pro-crypto lawyer, argues the GENIUS Act could break big banks’ monopoly on consumer data. Others believe corporate stablecoins could boost innovation and financial inclusion. Critics also accuse Warren of hypocrisy for backing a government-run digital currency with similar data risks. Previous concerns around money laundering, foreign coins, and corporate involvement have been partially addressed in the bill, but the privacy debate remains unresolved. Final Vote Ahead: Will GENIUS Be Rewritten? The GENIUS Act is still evolving. As it heads to a full Senate vote, amendments may reshape its final form.But one thing is clear: the outcome will significantly impact the future of stablecoins in the U.S.—and the power tech giants may (or may not) have over them. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-17T08:05:46,"Bybit & Block Scholes: ETH-BTC volatility hits five-year high as ETH plays catch-up","BitcoinWorld Bybit & Block Scholes: ETH-BTC volatility hits five-year high as ETH plays catch-up DUBAI , UAE , June 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Bybit , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, released a new options volatility report in collaboration with Block Scholes. The report shows a historic volatility divergence between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) during May 2025. Key Highlights: In May 2025 , ETH options exhibited historically high volatility premiums over BTC, driven by ETH’s elevated realized volatility during a major price rally. The ETH-to-BTC implied volatility ratio for short-dated options surged past 2x — reaching a nearly five-year high. BTC’s realized volatility fell below a long-standing 35% floor, breaking a 19-month trend. ETH’s volatility term structure showed persistent inversion, with shorter-dated options pricing higher volatility than longer-dated ones. The implied volatility divergence coincided with ETH’s outperformance, which included a 23% intraday rally amid key market events. ETH-to-BTC Implied Volatility Expands to Five-Year High In May 2025 , a notable dislocation in implied volatility emerged between ETH and BTC options. Implied volatility reflects market expectations for future price movement over an option’s lifespan. At the start of the month, the ETH-to-BTC implied volatility ratio for 7-day options hovered around 1.5 — indicating that ETH options were priced with 50% higher expected volatility than BTC options. By May 16 , the ratio climbed above 2x, reaching a peak not seen since 2020, as BTC’s implied volatility declined to its lowest levels since October 2023 . This drop in BTC volatility broke below the 35% floor that had held for over 19 months, while ETH’s short-tenor implied volatility remained elevated, though slightly below its May 10 high. The volatility spread was particularly pronounced in the 30-day tenor, reaching its widest point since mid-2022. Realized Volatility Trends Underscore the Divergence The sharp divergence in implied volatility was reinforced by trends in realized volatility — a measure of actual historical price movement. In May, ETH’s realized volatility significantly outpaced BTC’s across various tenors, fueling expectations for continued dispersion between the two assets. On May 15 , the 7-day realized volatility ratio between ETH and BTC peaked, closely followed by the implied volatility ratio — suggesting market participants expected ETH’s higher volatility to persist. This trend is not new: the ETH-BTC volatility ratio has been climbing steadily since July 2024 , amid both bull runs and periods of market stress. ETH’s standout performance in May was catalyzed by several factors, including positive US-UK trade news. ETH surged more than 23% on May 8 alone and continued to outperform BTC, which gained approximately 10% during the same period. Despite this momentum, ETH remained over 50% below its January 2025 peak and its all-time high. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BybitReport About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

2025-06-17T07:59:01,"Crypto Market Today: Bitcoin Dips, XRP Pulls Back, Ethereum Lags Ahead of FOMC","The post Crypto Market Today: Bitcoin Dips, XRP Pulls Back, Ethereum Lags Ahead of FOMC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A cloud of uncertainty hangs over global markets as investors brace for the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. With no major policy shifts expected, traders are watching closely for signals on rate cuts, inflation trends, and macro risks. The crypto market, already tense from recent volatility, is showing mixed performance with XRP leading gains among major tokens. Bitcoin Wobbles Amid Geopolitical Tensions Bitcoin briefly topped $108,000 in early U.S. hours on Monday before sliding to $106,500 on profit-taking. It later bounced back above $107,000 during Asian trading on Tuesday. The movement follows Friday’s $1.2 billion in futures liquidations, which forced out overleveraged traders and weighed heavily on altcoins through the weekend. Despite the choppy action, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $1.4 billion in net inflows last week, reinforcing their growing role as stabilizers during volatile periods. Analysts suggest Bitcoin’s slow response to macroeconomic stress could change if investors seek alternative safe-haven assets. “Bitcoin typically lags behind gold and oil during geopolitical events, but if risk sentiment turns, BTC could quickly regain momentum,” said Eugene Cheung of OSL . XRP Takes the Lead as Altcoins Recover While most major altcoins are still recovering from the weekend drawdown, XRP stood out with a strong rebound. XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, is trading at $2.17 with a 0.77% daily gain, backed by a $128.23 billion market cap and $1.74 billion in volume. It continues to hold a strong position, supported by growing interest in institutional banking integration. Ethereum ticked up 1.5% to $2,609 but continued to trail Bitcoin’s ETF-fueled performance. Solana and Tron also posted modest gains, but sentiment across altcoins remains cautious. Meanwhile, Gold and oil surged early Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly urged the evacuation of Tehran during the G7 summit. The geopolitical jolt sent investors rushing into defensive assets, while Bitcoin’s response remained subdued. XRP Outperformed Bitcoin This Cycle, Says Analyst Crypto analyst Nick pointed out that XRP has gained more than 678% since its 2022 low, beating Bitcoin’s 565% rise. He added that XRP’s total gains this cycle have already topped 1,000%, and the rally isn’t over yet. According to him, XRP has outpaced both Bitcoin and Ethereum in this bull run so far. Fed Holds the Spotlight All eyes are now on the Fed. Market watchers expect interest rates to remain unchanged, but the tone of Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks could set the course for crypto and equities alike. With inflation easing and jobs data holding firm, officials may opt for patience, though some, like SignalPlus’ Augustine Fan, believe a dovish tilt could be signaled subtly. The near-term outlook remains tied to the Fed’s message and the unfolding tensions in the Middle East. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-17T07:54:16,"The Blockchain Group raises additional $7.7M to grow Bitcoin treasury","The Blockchain Group has raised an additional €7.2 million, about $7.7 million, to support its plan of becoming Europe’s leading Bitcoin Treasury company. The announcement was made in a June 17 press release by the Paris-listed firm (Euronext: ALTBG.PA), which is pursuing a long-term strategy of increasing the amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) per share it holds. The funding was secured through an “At-The-Market type” capital raise with asset manager TOBAM, where 1.6 million new shares were issued at an average price of €4.49. That price reflected a 20.76% discount from the stock’s June 13 close, due to market volatility during the raise. The capital raise allows The Blockchain Group to continue adding BTC to its balance sheet, as part of a broader treasury strategy that started in late 2024. https://twitter.com/_altbg/status/1934854391451775360?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw You might also like: Michael Saylor’s Strategy strengthens Bitcoin bet with 10,100 BTC purchase This strategy mirrors capital market moves made by firms like Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet, both of which hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. The Blockchain Group is one of the first in Europe to follow this path, aiming to accumulate up to 260,000 BTC, currently about $24 billion, by 2033. The recent capital raise saw TOBAM, through three of its funds, subscribe to all 1.6 million shares. The largest tranche went to the TOBAM Bitcoin CO2 Offset Fund, which acquired over 834,000 shares. The other two funds, the Bitcoin Treasury Opportunities Fund and the Blockchain Equity Fund, took the remaining portion. As a result, TOBAM now holds 3.3% of The Blockchain Group’s capital on a fully diluted basis. The capital raise follows a shareholder vote on June 11 that increased the company’s fundraising capacity to €500 million in nominal value. That resolution passed with over 95% approval, underlining strong investor support for the Bitcoin pivot. On a fully diluted basis, the company’s share count now exceeds 313 million, factoring in all potential conversions from bonds, free share grants, and warrants. The Blockchain Group’s model draws on the idea that Bitcoin is a long-term hedge against inflation and fiat currency risks. The company, which also develops decentralized tech, AI, and data tools, believes BTC can protect shareholder value and offer stronger returns than traditional treasury reserves. The firm joins a growing list of publicly traded companies shifting to a Bitcoin-focused strategy, a trend analysts say could grow to $330 billion in corporate holdings by 2029.

The total amount of Bitcoin in the country’s treasury has thus reached 6,209. El Salvador, the first country in the world to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, reached a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF in December 2024. The agreement stipulated that Bitcoin would be stripped of its official currency status and that the government would halt Bitcoin purchases. However, President Nayib Bukele’s strategy of “buying one Bitcoin a day”, which he launched in 2022, continues. According to the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, a total of 240 more Bitcoins have been purchased since December 19, 2024 (following the IMF agreement). These purchases, calculated at approximately $106,658 each, amount to more than $25 million. Related News: XRP Experiences a First-Time Event in Its History - Unusual Data Coming In Rodrigo Valdes, Director of the IMF’s Western Hemisphere Department, stated at a press conference on April 26, 2025, that the country was still technically in compliance with the agreement: “El Salvador remains committed to not increasing its Bitcoin holdings within the financial sector.” Blockchain consultant Anndy Lian attributed this to the IMF’s flexible interpretation: “The IMF’s flexible interpretation of the agreement may allow these purchases to be made through non-governmental entities or reclassified assets, thus technically achieving compliance.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-17T07:18:16,"Crypto Shows Immunity as Bitcoin Quickly Recovers From Tehran Tensions","Total crypto market capitalization shed around $80 billion over a few hours late on Monday night as Middle East tensions escalated. It fell marginally to around $3.44 trillion as Bitcoin dipped by over $2,000 in a decline to around $106,500 before it immediately started to recover and reclaim $107,000 at the time of writing. The dip was caused by US President Donald Trump calling for the evacuation of Tehran as the exchange of missiles between Israel and Iran continued for a fourth day. Trump Leaves G7 Donald Trump departed the annual G7 meeting in Canada early, telling reporters, “I have to be back early for obvious reasons.” The POTUS also took to his Social Media platform to say that Iran should have signed his “deal” before adding that the country cannot have a nuclear weapon and “everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran.” TRUMP: “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran.” pic.twitter.com/vGygTxuFsg — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 16, 2025 Meanwhile, other nations, including China and Russia, urged their citizens to evacuate Tel Aviv as the military action intensified. The message appeared orchestrated to increase pressure on Iran to come to the negotiating table amid a veiled threat of military intervention. “American forces are maintaining their defensive posture, and that has not changed. We will defend American interests,” White House spokesman Alex Pfeiffer wrote on X while disputing fake news that air strikes were imminent. Odds on the United States taking military action against Iran before the end of this month surged to 67% on blockchain prediction platform Polymarket.

In fact, crypto markets tanked twice as hard when the Trump and Elon Musk bromance collapsed on June 6. Meanwhile, other risk-on assets such as tech stocks are also weathering the storm at the moment. “If there were even a 50% chance of WW3 right now, the S&P 500 wouldn’t be 2% away from a new all-time high,” observed the Kobeissi Letter. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was still trading in the middle of its range-bound channel, where it has been since the beginning of May, and Ethereum had bounced off support at $2,500, so crypto markets are holding up pretty well, all things considered.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 153,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is on track to follow his version of the logarithmic growth channel (LGC) curve and print an all-time high of $220,000. The LGC curve aims to predict Bitcoin’s longer-term cycle lows and highs while filtering out shorter-term volatility. He also says Bitcoin may be moving away from the parabolic moves that were indicative of prior cycles. “Many are now describing the different nature of this BTC cycle. For years, I have predicted the ‘maturing of the market’ with the price action of cycles moving from a parabolic to a more technical nature… A maturing market not only explains the qualitatively different nature of this cycle but also explains the LGC [logarithmic growth curve] itself.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin appears to be locked in a narrow range for now as it trades between $100,000 and $110,000. “BTC bring it on.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Lastly, the analyst says that Bitcoin is showing market strength by continuing to trade above $100,000 on the weekly chart. “BTC holding up.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,083 at time of writing, up 1.9% in the last 24 hours.

2025-06-17T07:00:38,"Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Plummet $61 Billion—Warning Sign for Bitcoin?","On-chain data shows the exchange inflows related to the stablecoins USDT and USDC have seen a sharp plunge. Here’s what this could mean for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Have Dropped Below Yearly Average In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed about the latest trend in the Exchange Inflow of the top two stablecoins in the sector, USDT and USDC. The “Exchange Inflow” refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that’s moving into the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. Generally, investors may deposit their coins into these platforms when they want to trade them away, so a high value on the Exchange Inflow can indicate demand for swapping the cryptocurrency. For volatile assets like Bitcoin, this is something that can naturally be bearish for the price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Must Hold This Level—Or Risk A 30% Price Crash In the case of stablecoins, however, their price doesn’t see any impact from exchange deposits, since it always remains, by definition, stable around whatever fiat currency the asset is tracking. That said, stablecoin inflows aren’t without consequence. Investors usually deposit these assets to swap into a volatile cryptocurrency of their choice. As such, coins like Bitcoin can see a bullish effect from an Exchange Inflow spike related to these fiat-tied tokens. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the combined Exchange Inflow of the top two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, over the past few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Inflow of USDT and USDC shot up to a very high value at the end of last year, a sign that the investors were making massive deposits of these stablecoins. Alongside the spike in the indicator, the Bitcoin price observed a rally to a new all-time high (ATH), a potential sign that the stablecoin inflows may have helped provide the fuel for the run. At the peak of the spike, the metric reached a value of $131 billion per day. From the chart, it’s apparent that since then, the indicator has been following a downward trajectory and today, its value has come down to $70 billion per day.

Though, while the indicator is indeed notably down compared to the peak, its current level is still high in the context of the wider cycle so far. Naturally, if this drawdown in the stablecoin Exchange Inflow keeps up, it could potentially turn out to be a bearish sign for Bitcoin and other digital assets. That said, even though BTC went down earlier in the year, its price is still above the $100,000 mark right now, a possible sign that investors may simply be entering a phase of consolidation. Bitcoin Price Following a surge of about 2.5% over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has managed to recover back to the $108,100 level.
