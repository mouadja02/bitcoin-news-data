2025-06-17T14:52:02,"XRP Army Reacts As Trump‚Äôs Truth Social Files for ETFs Without XRP on the List","President Donald Trump‚Äôs social media platform, Truth Social, has filed for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, according to a report shared by Watcher.Guru. The filing triggered a strong response from the XRP community, especially after it became clear that XRP was excluded. One of the most prominent voices who reacted to the news was Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL). He tagged the president, asking why XRP is excluded. The comment reflects the broader sentiment among XRP holders who have been waiting for more signs of institutional recognition, particularly in the form of more ETF filings. No XRP wtf man @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/UR5E5HFkxt ‚Äî Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 16, 2025 XRP ETF Landscape and Institutional Moves The timing of this exclusion has raised questions, considering the current state of ETF applications. More than 11 XRP ETF filings are currently pending with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and industry observers view XRP as a viable candidate for future spot ETFs. Teucrium, a commodities ETF provider, recently launched a leveraged XRP ETF, which it tagged as the most successful launch in its history. Yet XRP remains absent from the Truth Social plan. Speculation on XRP‚Äôs Omission While the Bitcoin and Ethereum filings mark a significant institutional step, many in the XRP community believe that XRP‚Äôs omission may be temporary or intentional. Several responses under Cobb‚Äôs post suggest that another filing, including XRP, might follow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 One user speculated that a separate ETF could be in the works, focusing mainly on XRP, SOL, and ADA. Notably, these three assets were included in Trump‚Äôs crypto reserve announcement , suggesting that the president is interested in them. Another commenter pointed to the pending legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, and this case has historically caused hesitation. Other members of the XRP community echoed similar theories or took a more defiant stance. One user commented that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need one,‚Äù suggesting that Bitcoin will eventually collapse. Another implied that a potential 1,000% pump from ETFs cannot happen yet due to a coordinated strategy. This view reinforces a common belief within the XRP community that institutional players are deliberately withholding public support until the timing is optimal, possibly after regulatory hurdles are resolved. A recent TimesTabloid report discussed reasons why Eric Trump has not publicly supported XRP . The Trumps could be waiting for full legal clarity before engaging fully with the digital asset that many believe will lead the financial revolution.

2025-06-17T14:50:06,"BTC block production is shifting to the USA","Bitcoin mining is changing its profile, with over 30% in the hands of US-based corporate miners. US-based miners generally hold more than 40% of the hashrate, but listed companies are now in charge of large-scale mining centers. Bitcoin mining has changed its approach multiple times, evolving past personal computers into ASIC. In the past few years, mining is only viable through large-scale operations, leading to the creation of dedicated data centers. Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at Van Eck, noted that corporate miners controlled over 30% of the hashrate for the first time after a period of constant growth. In total, exchange-listed miners had 31.8% of the Bitcoin network hashrate. üá∫üá∏ pic.twitter.com/Y9enIzQwea ‚Äî matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) June 17, 2025 The Bitcoin network produces blocks with a near-record hashrate, close to 900 EH/s, with peak difficulty. Previous narratives of miner capitulation did not materialize, as large-scale miners can afford to mine at a loss. Long-term corporate miners have a lower cost basis and can afford to hold coins for the long term. BTC mining is currently viable based on prices above $100,000. Miners are also not shy about building new data centers, tapping the remaining BTC block rewards while also seeking ways to branch out to new crypto assets and AI computation. BTC mining stocks, in general, rise during favorable market periods. | Source: Hashrate Index The list of 13 BTC corporate miners tracked by Morgan Stanley shows they nearly doubled their output in the past year. The growth was linked to previous plans to launch new data centers with favorable energy contracts. Corporate miners either use their data centers for solo block production or join pools. Foundry Digital, the top US-based pool, now carries 29.1% of the total hashrate. The pool produces up to 33% of all BTC for each 100-block interval. BTC corporate miners use reserves to pivot into AI For crypto natives, the mining situation is entirely normalized, with no signs of distressed conditions. However, BTC miners are not relying on block rewards for the long term. Transaction fees produce under $500K per day, even during busy periods, and may be insufficient to sustain operations or renew mining and data centers. BTC mining stocks benefit from the general recovery of the crypto market. The BTC miner index is up in the past quarter, bouncing from the lows in April and March. Miners are still estimating ways to extend their operations, especially after the 2024 halving. Top miners like Mara Holdings, Riot Platform, IREN, and others are also using traditional fundraising to finance their shift into AI computation. Bitcoin miners ( $MARA $IREN $CLSK $CIFR $RIOT ) are raising big cash via equity (50-115% of capital) to survive post-2024 halving.

2025-06-17T14:28:44,"U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Extend Inflow Streak as Institutional Interest Holds Steady","U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted $412.2 million in net inflows on Monday, marking the sixth consecutive day of gains and lifting total cumulative inflows to $46.04 billion. The strong inflow streak began on June 9 and has now drawn in more than $1.8 billion in fresh capital, according to figures compiled by SoSoValue. These inflows have persisted despite ongoing geopolitical instability, including renewed military tensions between Iran and Israel. The run started with a $386.27 million inflow on June 9, followed by a spike to $431.12 million the next day. Midweek activity saw a minor pullback, but interest resumed with $322.60 million on Friday and a fresh surge on Monday. Total net assets across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have reached $132.5 billion. This figure now represents 6.13% of Bitcoin‚Äôs entire market capitalization. Meanwhile, daily trading volumes have also remained high, with $3.12 billion worth of trades executed on Monday alone. BlackRock and Fidelity Continue to Lead the ETF Race Among the ETFs, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains the frontrunner. It pulled in $266.60 million on Monday alone and has now amassed $50.03 billion in total net inflows. Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC also performed strongly, adding $82.96 million in net flows. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, however, lagged behind significantly with just $12.84 million in inflows and continues to reflect a total net outflow of $23.23 billion since its inception. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Taiwan-based Kronos Research, emphasized that institutional investors appear to be focusing on long-term strategies. ‚ÄúDespite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, institutions are looking past short-term volatility and focusing on long-term positioning,‚Äù Liu told Cointelegraph. He added, ‚ÄúSteady Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect growing trust in BTC‚Äôs resilience, accessibility, and role as a hedge in a shifting macro environment.‚Äù Bitcoin Price Volatile, But Underlying Structure Intact While ETF inflows remain strong, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has faced some turbulence. A surprise Israeli strike on Iran last Friday triggered a broader sell-off, pushing Bitcoin down more than 7% and ending the week in the red. Bitfinex analysts noted that the market showed signs of capitulation, with Net Taker Volume hitting a multi-week low of $197 million. ‚ÄúThis selling, however, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation-style setups that often mark local bottoms,‚Äù they stated in a report released Monday. They also observed that if Bitcoin can maintain support between $102,000 and $103,000, it may indicate that downward pressure is being absorbed and could suggest a potential rebound in the near term. Despite the brief price dip, the continued inflows into ETFs suggest growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a resilient asset class, even amid uncertain global conditions.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/u-s-bitcoin-etfs-extend-inflow-streak-as-institutional-interest-holds-steady/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T14:20:34,"Russia hits crypto farm in ramp up to illegal mining operators","Law enforcement authorities in Russia have closed down a large crypto mining farm that operated outside the law in the middle of Siberia. The industrial coin minting facility, which occupied almost 30,000 square meters of land, has been targeted amid an ongoing crackdown on illegal mining across the vast country. Russian court bans Bitcoin farm plugged into the power grid without permit A court in Russia‚Äôs Krasnoyarsk Krai has stopped the illegal mining of cryptocurrencies for millions of rubles a month, the region‚Äôs prosecutor‚Äôs office announced. The large coin-producing operation was set up in the city of Nazarovo. The unusual facility, which minted crypto in open air and behind a barbed wire fence, attracted the attention of the local community, RBC Crypto reported on Monday, quoting a press release which was also published on Telegram. Regional authorities said the property was registered as a non-residential building on an industrial site with a total area of 29,800 square meters. However, law enforcement officials established that the land plot had been repurposed. Prosecutors explained: ‚ÄúIn reality, the territory is occupied by transformers, power plants, mobile centers and other equipment that was leased, together with a non-existent building, to another organization for 4.6 million rubles (nearly $60,000) a month.‚Äù The operator of the illegal mining farm connected the hardware to the city‚Äôs power grid without obtaining the proper permits and rights to use the state-owned land. Inspectors also reported violations of fire safety regulations, the article detailed. Initially, the prosecutor‚Äôs office demanded that the miner address the registered violations, but their request was ignored. Eventually, a lawsuit was filed, which resulted in the ban of mining operations at the site until these are eliminated. Russia busts large crypto mining farm. Photo: Prosecutor‚Äôs Office of Krasnoyarsk. Source: RBC Crypto Russia cracks down on illegal cryptocurrency miners Crypto mining in the Russian Federation, which was legalized last year, has been blamed by local authorities across the country for causing excessive load on power distribution networks, resulting in breakdowns and blackouts. Their concerns have led to seasonal and permanent restrictions on the energy-intensive activity in many parts of the country. But while a blanket ban on mining has already affected almost a dozen Russian regions, a report earlier in June indicated that Moscow is halting its expansion . Citing a drop in tax revenues and decreasing electricity sales, the federal government now wants to shift its focus to targeting illegal mining farms rather than all mining firms. Recently announced legislative changes seek to punish the so-called ‚Äúgray‚Äù miners with hefty fines and crypto confiscation. Back in February of this year, the authorities in Krasnoyarsk Krai, one of the most popular mining destinations in Russia, charged an employee of a local utility with taking 600,000 rubles in bribes to cover up the activities of illegal miners who caused damages exceeding 9 million rubles. This month, engineers from the local energy distributing company in the Russian republic of Buryatia discovered 95 mining rigs hidden in the back of a truck. The improvised mobile mining farm was connected to the power lines supplying electricity to a village in the Pribaikalsky district. This week, police in Ingushetia announced they have detained a man who stole 2.34 million rubles‚Äô worth of electricity to power 65 coin-minting devices illegally tapped into the grid. The mining installation, found in a utility room, had been connected to a substation, bypassing electricity meters. The North Caucasian republic is among the Russian regions where cryptocurrency mining has been completely prohibited until the spring of 2031. The list includes territories from the Far East to the Russia-occupied oblasts of Ukraine. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-06-17T14:00:50,"Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East","Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price activity has been characterized by sharp swings as global uncertainties persist, particularly following the escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran. After plunging by nearly 5% amid the rising geopolitical strain, Bitcoin managed to recover, bouncing back above $105,000 and currently trading around $106,800. The past 24 hours have been highlighted by Bitcoin recovering toward $108,000 briefly again, but with escalating tensions in the Middle East, there‚Äôs a good chance it could crash soon. This aligns with an outlook from a crypto analyst, who noted that Bitcoin might crash toward $100,000. Resistance Band Faces Test For Bitcoin According to crypto analyst Pejman_Zwin on the TradingView platform, Bitcoin is hovering within a confluence of resistance and short liquidation zones, stretching from $105,330 to $107,120. This range, he notes, is not only a structural resistance zone but also corresponds with the cumulative short liquidation leverage area. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions Basically, this means there‚Äôs a high possibility of an intensified price volatility if this zone is challenged or broken. The charts also reveal the presence of a possible contracting triangle pattern, which is a bearish continuation setup in the context of a larger correction. According to the analyst, if Bitcoin fails to reclaim $106,600 convincingly, the structure could shift from a corrective triangle to a five-wave downward impulse. This would cause a deeper retracement, especially as the price is already forming lower highs within the triangle. As such, the longer Bitcoin lingers in this resistance range without a breakout, the higher the likelihood of a rapid downward move. Bearish And Bull Targets If Bitcoin were to confirm this breakdown, the analyst noted the first major target around the lower boundary of the support zone, which lies between $105,330 and $103,162. This zone is reinforced by the monthly pivot point and also overlaps with the cumulative long liquidation leverage region. The 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart further highlighted a potential short setup from the reversal zone near $107,100 and a projected target close to $104,300. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Further downside could pull the price toward the next support band around $102,600 or even down to $101,000, should liquidation pressure persist. Pejman, on the other hand, pointed out that a sustained breakout above the $107,120 resistance line could initiate a bullish reversal and push Bitcoin back towards the heavy resistance cluster above $108,000. A strong daily close above $108,000 could cancel the bearish outlook. However, failure to break above here could lead to a rejection and another downside move. Although Bitcoin is starting to show some signs of bullishness, its price action is still vulnerable to a quick pullback, especially if the tensions in the Middle East continue to unfold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,638, down 0.02% in the past 24 hours. This subdued price action shows its current consolidation nature.

2025-06-17T13:59:41,"Monster $13 billion Bitcoin short squeeze alert","Bitcoin ( BTC ) is knocking on the door of a historic short squeeze . With the digital asset trading above $105,500, over $13 billion worth of leveraged short positions across major exchanges like Binance , Bybit, and OKX are hanging by a thread, according to fresh data from Coinglass, retrieved by Finbold on June 17. The liquidation heatmap doesn‚Äôt lie, if Bitcoin surges past $118,000, we could witness one of the largest mass short liquidations in crypto history. The chart breaks down where leveraged positions are most concentrated‚Äîand, more importantly, where they‚Äôre most vulnerable. On the right-hand side, the rising green curve represents short liquidation leverage. What makes this setup especially dangerous for shorts is the way the green line steepens past $110,000. That sharp upward curve means a growing pile of leverage is waiting just above the current market price. The moment BTC starts inching toward those levels, a chain reaction could be triggered, trapping late sellers and slingshotting Bitcoin upward. BTC exchange liquidation map. Source: Coinglass In simple terms, this shows how much money traders have bet against Bitcoin going up. If BTC climbs, these short positions start bleeding. And if it climbs fast? They‚Äôre forced to close, automatically, by exchanges. That process is called liquidation. Liquidations don‚Äôt happen quietly. When shorts get closed, the traders must buy Bitcoin to settle their losses. That sudden burst of buying adds fuel to the fire, pushing prices even higher and forcing more shorts to close. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle for the bears. This cascading effect is known as a short squeeze, and right now, the chart is flashing a textbook setup. It‚Äôs not just theoretical. We‚Äôve seen it before in past cycles. The 2020 breakout past $20,000? Similar mechanics. The $30,000 rally in early 2021? Same story. Bitcoin short liquidation leverage summary For beginners, this chart might seem intimidating. But here‚Äôs the simple takeaway: it shows where leveraged traders are likely to get wiped out. And right now, those at risk are the ones betting against Bitcoin. The fact that $13 billion in short exposure exists just overhead is a strong bullish signal. Not because that money guarantees upward movement, but because it reveals just how unstable the current positioning is. If a catalyst appears, whether ETF inflows, macro easing, or more institutional headlines such as BlackRock, the move could be explosive, not gradual.

2025-06-17T13:50:09,"Ethereum ETFs on-chain holdings at all-time high","Investments in Ethereum are accelerating in the past few weeks, leading the on-chain holdings of major funds to a new all-time high. The ongoing buying shows a clear accumulation trend where institutions are positioning for an ETH rally. The on-chain activity and holdings of Ethereum ETFs suggest the network and the token are nowhere near dead. ETH on-chain holdings for all major ETFs are close to an all-time high, after the last few weeks of accelerated accumulation. BlackRock was the most active buyer, driving the momentum of inflows to Ethereum ETFs. | Source: Dune Analytics Blackrock and Grayscale lead institutional demand for ETH ETF funds have bought over 3.77M ETH, or around 2.97% of the supply, currently above 120M ETH. Alternative data by CryptoQuant points to over 4M ETH acquired by all ETFs, with a market acceleration in June. The funds based on Ethereum have a much lower level of assets under management but stronger accumulation momentum. Inflows have surpassed BTC since the end of May. The ETFs are approaching $1B in accumulation per month. For now, BlackRock and Grayscale remain the biggest holders, with the most rapid new ETH inflows. Grayscale switched to accumulation in the past month, ending the era of divesting its ETH acquired for as low as $90. The accumulation happens at a time when ETH still trades sideways, at around $2,561.97, with a total market dominance of 9.03%. ETH stabilized at around 0.024 BTC, ending its long-term slide. The ETF accumulation is seen as just one of the positive signs for the Ethereum ecosystem, in addition to growing DeFi activity, stablecoin transfers, and general accumulation in both small and whale-sized wallets. ETFs are not the most significant destination for ETH, as many of the tokens are locked in protocols. Currently, Ethereum carries over $63.3B in total value locked, in addition to over 125B in stablecoins. Close to 30% of ETH is staked with validators, while leaving diminishing reserves on exchanges. In total, each week, 16,621 ETH is produced, smaller than one single day of ETF inflows. While Ethereum does not offer the same scarcity as BTC, ETFs still control a significant part of the supply. Ethereum ETFs show growing daily inflows Ethereum ETFs have seen much more lively inflows in the past few days, surpassing the accumulation of BTC. Spot Ethereum ETFs had an almost unbroken period of net daily inflows since the middle of May. This is the longest period of ETF accumulation since the bull rally in March 2024. However, this time, ETH trades at a lower range, after dipping as low as $1,200. Despite this, there is interest in the token, with the potential for a late but outsized rally to a higher price range. One of the possible effects of an ETH rally is the launch of a new altcoin market. Despite expectations for an altcoin rally in Q1, most old tokens failed to break out. ETH is considered the one factor to lift up other tokens and chains. ETF inflows also precede a new period of fund approvals. This time, the most probable new fund will accumulate SOL, as investors seek to tap the growth potential of other crypto platforms.

2025-06-17T13:49:18,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Registers Sharp Drop As Middle East Crisis Worsens","Bitcoin (BTC) made a promising start to the week, surging to an intraday high of $108,944 on Monday. However, the worsening situation in the Middle East prompted a sharp decline as markets turned bearish. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped to $106,806. BTC is down almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $105,897. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, the price has stayed above $105,000. Strategy Announces Latest Bitcoin Purchase Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy has announced that it purchased 10,100 BTC for approximately $1.05 billion at an average acquisition price of around $104,080 per coin. Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor announced the news in a post on X, stating, ‚ÄúStrategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved a BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/15/2025, we hodl 592,100 acquired for ~$41.84 billion at ~$70,666 per bitcoin.‚Äù The latest Bitcoin purchase takes Strategy‚Äôs total holdings to a staggering 592,100 BTC , further cementing its place as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Strategy has doubled down on its ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù strategy, using proceeds from equity and debt financing instead of its at-the-market programs. Notably, it did not sell any stock in the days leading up to its latest acquisition. Strategy‚Äôs management is convinced about BTC‚Äôs long-term value proposition. However, they acknowledge the risks associated with a highly concentrated treasury allocation. Strategy‚Äôs filing warns that the absence of diversification increases the firm‚Äôs exposure to BTC‚Äôs short-term fluctuations and volatility. ‚ÄúThe concentration of our assets in Bitcoin limits our ability to mitigate risk that could otherwise be achieved by holding a more diversified portfolio.‚Äù Bank Of America Ranks Bitcoin Among The Most Disruptive Innovations Bank of America has called Bitcoin one of the most disruptive innovations, signaling its potential to shape the global financial ecosystem. The observations were made in a long-term chart outlining 1,000 years of technological and scientific disruptions. The chart highlighted Bitcoin as one of the most consequential innovations in history. The chart highlights key breakthroughs from the invention of the printing press to quantum computing and everything in between. Bank of America Global Research stated that Bitcoin stands out for its challenge to traditional financial systems by introducing a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Its inception is also regarded as the catalyst for the rapid growth of the crypto industry. The chart put Bitcoin alongside innovations like the World Wide Web, microprocessors, and electric vehicles. Bitcoin ETFs Continue Inflow Streak US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows of $412 million on Monday, extending their positive streak to six days despite escalating tensions in the Middle East. The latest inflows take the cumulative inflows to $46 billion. The latest streak of inflows began on June 9 and has attracted a total of $1.8 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. Inflows have persisted despite rising geopolitical tensions across the world, including a renewed conflict between Israel and Iran. As expected, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led inflows, recording over $266 million in net inflows on Monday, with its total accumulation crossing $50 billion. This was followed by Fidelity with inflows of $82 million, and Grayscale, which recorded just 12.84 million in inflows. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer of Kronos Research, stated, ‚ÄúDespite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, institutions are looking past short-term volatility and focusing on long-term positioning. Steady Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect growing trust in BTC‚Äôs resilience, accessibility, and role as a hedge in a shifting macro environment.‚Äù Trump Media To Hold Bitcoin (BTC) And Ethereum (ETH) Trump Media & Technology Group‚Äôs ETF will hold BTC and ETH and combine them into a single tradable asset. The company, founded by the Trump family, said it intended to launch the ETF with a quarter of the assets in ETH, with the rest in BTC . It added that the launch is planned for ‚Äúlater this year.‚Äù Trump Media & Technology Group initially planned to offer a Bitcoin-only ETF, announcing in May that it was raising funds to acquire Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp drop on Monday as it fell from an intraday high of $108,944 Monday. However, sentiment soured after it emerged that President Trump requested the National Security Council convene in the White House Situation Room. Trump left the G7 early, posting a chilling warning on his Truth Social handle, urging people to evacuate Tehran. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed President Trump‚Äôs early departure from the summit in Canada, stating, ‚ÄúMuch was accomplished, but because of what‚Äôs going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.‚Äù However, a Bitfinex Alpha report predicts a quick rebound for BTC and the broader crypto market, provided global tensions don‚Äôt escalate further. BTC fell over 7% following the Israel-Iran conflict, with the net taker volume also registering a sharp drop to negative $197 million, suggesting widespread panic. Bitfinex analysts stated that such declines in net taker volumes often indicate capitulation, a pattern seen in previous market bottoms. The crypto fear and greed index also slid into ‚Äúfear‚Äù territory. The Bitfinex Alpha report stated, ‚ÄúThis selling, however, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation‚Äîstyle setups that often mark local bottoms. If Bitcoin can hold the $102,000‚Äì$103,000 zone, it may suggest that selling pressure is being absorbed and that the market could be primed for recovery‚Äîassuming geopolitical risks don‚Äôt intensify further.‚Äù BTC registered a sharp drop on Thursday (June 5) as bearish sentiment increased after it dipped below $105,000. As a result, it fell 3%, dropping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. BTC surged on Monday as it started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 4% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The price fell to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,253. Source: TradingView BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.42% to $108,687. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 3% to $105,828. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $106,106. The price was back in the red on Saturday, dropping 0.59% to $105,482, but registered a marginal rise on Sunday to end the weekend at $105,562. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,944 on Monday as it started the week on a bullish note. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $106,806, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. The current session sees BTC down over 1%, trading around $105,000. Buyers must keep the price above $105,000. A drop below this level could drive BTC toward $100,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, ‚ÄúEthereum-Killer,‚Äù as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana Strategies has planned to raise $1 billion to boost the ecosystem. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 49.01% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like ‚ÄúWill Solana Go Back Up?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow high can Solana go?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWill SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?‚Äù To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 ‚Äì 2030.

The RSI near 48 hints at the start of recovery but lacks strong momentum. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight. Potential High: $190 Average Price Range: $165 Potential Low: $140 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the derivatives market with $6.74B in open interest, far surpassing other altcoins. The heatmap and high trader positioning signal elevated volatility ahead. Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-06-17T13:48:00,"Dow opens lower as Israel-Iran conflict weighs on investors","Global stocks pared gains on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average opening more than 100 points lower in early trading as Israel and Iran continued attacks against each other. Alongside the Dow, the S&P 500 opened down 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%. These declines came as investors weighed the prospects of a quick truce versus a potential escalation of the Israel-Iran hostilities. U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent remarks and social media posts related to the conflict, as well as his early departure from the G7 summit, stoked fears that a swift ceasefire was unlikely. Trump said in a post on Truth Social : ‚ÄúPublicity seeking President Emmanuel Macron, of France, mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a ‚Äúcease fire‚Äù between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong.‚Äù Market reactions were swift.

And here‚Äôs a list of the people who think a $SOL ETF could send Solana ‚Äì and Solaxy, a much-needed Solana Layer 2 ‚Äì sky-high: also everyone. That‚Äôs right, Solana is gaining serious momentum. Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs analysts report that Solana-focused firms DeFi Development, Upexi, and SOL Strategies will raise each raise $250M this year for various crypto-related efforts, including $SOL treasuries. Both the pending $SOL ETFs and current treasury efforts underscore SOL‚Äôs strengths: a unified, low‚Äëcost, and high‚Äëthroughput blockchain that enables native staking yields and positions it as an attractive treasury asset. And how does this impact side projects like Solaxy, Solana‚Äôs first-ever Layer-2 chain? Let‚Äôs discuss below. Solana‚Äôs TVL Climbs as ETFs Loom Solana‚Äôs Total Value Locked (TVL) now exceeds $8B, and it maintains a vibrant developer base. Today‚Äôs treasury strategies are shifting accordingly, favoring scalable, productive blockchains alongside traditional reserve assets like Bitcoin. Simultaneously, CoinShares joined other financial heavyweights in filing for a spot Solana ETF, featuring staking components and third-party custody via Coinbase and BitGo. The filing aims to address SEC concerns about redemption and staking. While there‚Äôs no timeline on the SEC‚Äôs response and potential approval, analysts anticipate potential approvals in late summer or early fall 2025. It‚Äôs worth noting that CoinShares‚Äôs filing was one of 8 on the same day for new $SOL ETFs. Why the rush? In part because Solana is enjoying steadily growing adoption, despite relatively lackluster $SOL price performance. Strategy‚Äôs Treasury Strategy Expands to Solana As the drumbeat of Michael Saylor‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy goes on, companies beyond (Micro)Strategy are joining the bandwagon. After all, who doesn‚Äôt want their very own pile of crypto? And in this case, companies are applying it to $SOL as well. DeFi Development Corp notified the SEC back in April that it intended to sell $1B in securities to purchase $SOL. SOL Strategies, based in Canada, did the same in late May. What does this mean for investors? At least three possibilities: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è SOL could be moving into the mainstream, attracting attention as a yield-generating asset thanks to its staking model and institutional embrace. ‚úÖ Approval of spot $SOL ETFs would dramatically lower barriers to $SOL exposure through traditional brokerage venues. üìäContinued technological adoption and treasury-level interest could propel SOL further, though regulatory black swans and market volatility remain risks. Solana stands at a pivotal junction, even as $SOL treasuries take off and Solana meme coins continue to get attention. And the core Solana technical advantages ‚Äì low fees, fast transactions ‚Äì will get supercharged as Solaxy wraps up a dynamite presale. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì $54M Raised as Time Runs Out for Groundbreak Layer-2 Presale $53.9M raised in its official presale ‚Äì but with interest still sky-high, Solaxy ($SOLX) has opened a six-day window for investors to join the action. Solana loyalists and meme coin enthusiasts, drawn by Solaxy‚Äôs potential as the first-ever Solana Layer 2, have added another $2M after the presale ended on Monday. That potential is taking shape with the Testnet Block Explorer and Bridge already live. The full launch schedule kicks in with the Token Claim on June 23, then builds out with a Mainnet Launch and bridge connecting Solana, Ethereum, and Solaxy. Multichain functionality is built into Solaxy from launch, with full Layer 2 deployment as the crowning achievement of a red-hot crypto presale. With Solana interest peaking at just the right time, how far could Solaxy go? Our own price prediction shows the token could reach $0.032, up 1,700% from its current $0.001766. What is Solaxy? It‚Äôs the future of an already dynamic blockchain, combining Solana‚Äôs speed and low costs with Ethereum‚Äôs rock-solid framework and incredible ability to scale.

2025-06-17T13:27:03,"Did Barron Trump Really Pocket $40M from His Dad‚Äôs Crypto Scheme?","Barron Trump may have secured one of the most profitable windfalls among presidential relatives, thanks to his father‚Äôs crypto venture. Key Takeaways: Barron Trump may have earned up to $40 million from World Liberty Financial. He was named a cofounder and ‚ÄúWeb3 ambassador‚Äù alongside his brothers in the venture. Trump acknowledged his son‚Äôs crypto knowledge, calling him more informed than himself. Nine months after Donald Trump entered the crypto arena with the launch of World Liberty Financial, his 19-year-old son Barron is reportedly sitting on a fortune. According to financial disclosures and estimates by Forbes , Barron may have earned up to $40 million from the venture, placing him well ahead of his older siblings in terms of early wealth accumulation. After taxes, his net gain is believed to hover around $25 million. Trump Admits Barron Knows More About Crypto Than He Does Trump first teased Barron‚Äôs crypto curiosity in September 2024, calling him ‚Äúa young guy, but he knows it‚Äù and admitting he himself barely understood the basics of digital wallets. That same month, World Liberty Financial launched with a ‚Äúgold paper‚Äù ‚Äî a Trump-branded version of a white paper, naming Barron, Don Jr., and Eric Trump as ‚ÄúWeb3 ambassadors‚Äù and cofounders. Exactly how much the Trump children stood to gain remained unclear until last week, when the former president disclosed his stake: 52.5% personally, with an additional 22.5% split among unnamed family members. If divided equally among the three sons, that would mean a 7.5% share each, the same percentage they reportedly held in the now-defunct Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. World Liberty Financial has sold over $550 million worth of tokens to date, with roughly $520 million distributed to stakeholders. That suggests each Trump son may have received around $39 million, though a partial sale of the venture in early 2025 could have changed those figures. Pres. Trump raked in $57.7M from the crypto scheme he and his sons helped launch. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF CRONY CAPITALISM. pic.twitter.com/refkdV1Xmw ‚Äî Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) June 15, 2025 The sale‚Äôs timing fell outside the disclosure window, and neither the Trump Organization nor the crypto venture has responded to requests for clarification. Barron‚Äôs rise as a crypto figurehead marks a notable shift from his previously private profile. He was just nine when Trump launched his first presidential campaign. Since then, Barron has remained largely out of the spotlight, attending elite private schools in Washington and Florida before enrolling at NYU‚Äôs Stern School of Business in fall 2024. Trump Continues to Capitalize on Crypto Market Momentum Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to capitalize on crypto market momentum. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group‚Äôs (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative.

With a lower high now in place, can Bitcoin bulls avoid making a lower low? Conflict rages on but stock market doggedly climbs higher The current financial and geopolitical situation for Bitcoin is just as nervy and gut-wrenching as it has been over these last several days. The Israel/Iran conflict has entered its fifth day without seemingly any end in sight. That said, the U.S. stock market has doggedly continued to climb, and with the S&P 500 currently holding above 6,000 points, the all-time high of 6,147 isn‚Äôt more than a stone‚Äôs throw away. It would appear that increasing global liquidity holds more sway for Wall Street than a Middle Eastern conflict. Strong buying for Bitcoin Bitcoin has also generally managed to avoid the geopolitical downdrag and was able to rise as high as the important $109,000 resistance on Monday. It would have helped that the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued into a sixth straight trading day of inflows amounting to a combined 16.8K BTC. In the same vein, Strategy announced that it had acquired 10,100 BTC for $1.5 billion. Sideways price action continues Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that the price action is still generally sideways. The $109,000 resistance is becoming a major level, and therefore on the next upward impulse, if the bulls can pierce this and confirm above, this can leave the path open to revisit the all-time high. However, there is a lot for the bulls to do right now in order to avoid a dip below the important horizontal supports of $105,750 and $104,400. $102,000 is probably the last of the major supports before a potential tumble under $100,000. Increased volatility at higher levels Source: TradingView The weekly time frame reveals how the candle wicks are getting longer due to the volatility and the rarefied air at these higher levels. The dragonfly doji candle of two weeks ago had the potential to provide momentum for the bulls, but last week‚Äôs candle went some way towards annulling this by leaving a long candle wick to the upside. It‚Äôs still early days for this week‚Äôs candle, but as it stands the bulls will need to push the price back above $106,000, and at the very least, avoid a fall below $104,400. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI still has the blue fast line posturing to climb back above the orange slow line. If this can take place, it would be extremely bullish going forward. Possible concerns for Bitcoin on 2-week time frame Source: TradingView The 2-week chart backs up the positivity of the weekly chart. The breakout of the bull flag still hasn‚Äôt reached its $115,000 target. As long as this next 2-week close is positive, further upside price action could be expected. Nevertheless, there is the danger that a double top might play out here. If the price continues to roll over and falls down under the support, this could encourage the Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame to also roll over and cross back down. If this particular scenario were to play out, there could be a substantial dip to come. Bulls will be keeping their fingers firmly crossed that this does not come to pass.

Talking about numbers, the BTC price today is down 1.17% to $105,650.15. However, what keeps the hodlers charged up is the growing institutional faith. In recent news, BlackRock has purchased 2,454 BTCs, bringing its total holdings to 674,000 BTCs. Amidst the current trend, if you are keen on knowing the Bitcoin Price Prediction for today, then this analysis is for you. Bitcoin Price Analysis: At press time, Bitcoin price is at $105,650.15, marking a 1.17% daily loss, with a 24-hour low of $105,528.73 and a high at $108,915.38. The market cap hovers around $2.1 trillion, while trading volume spiked 24.93% to $53.85 billion, indicating heightened activity as traders respond to volatility. Technically speaking, BTC is testing a key support level near $105,500. A breakdown below this threshold could trigger mass liquidations, with analysts eyeing sub-$105k zones as potential acceleration points for downside momentum. The RSI is currently at 45.39, reflecting weakening buying pressure. Bollinger Bands show increased volatility, with BTC hovering near the lower band, a sign of downward bias. Analyst Michael van de Poppe , in a recent post, highlights that the resistance lies at $108,924, which Bitcoin needs to reclaim to regain bullish momentum. Failure to reclaim that level could see BTC revisit deeper liquidity zones, possibly near the $100K psychological level, as per previous patterns.

The Fed‚Äôs Interest Rate Decision Looms Tomorrow","The next Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision is due on Wednesday, June 18th, at 2:00 PM Eastern Time. The cryptocurrency market, akin to that of legacy stocks, is largely correlated with the US fiscal policy and any news other than the expected are likely to have an impact. The FOMC Meeting June 17-18 The US Federal Reserve will meet today and tomorrow and markets are expecting critical policy statements regarding the institution‚Äôs fiscal stance. Experts seem to be of the opinion that the Fed will hold interest rates steady, despite the mounting political pressure against Chairman Jerome Powell. Recall that acting president Donald Trump launched a wave of recent attacks, stating on multiple occasions that an interest rate cut is long overdue, citing ECB‚Äôs decision to lower rates recently (yet again). In fact, this also seems to be the consensus trade on the world‚Äôs largest prediction market ‚Äì Polymarket. Source: Polymarket The odds of the Fed cutting rates tomorrow are 1% according to traders. The next meeting is scheduled to take place on July 29-30, followed by the first Autumn meeting held on September 16-17. According to Polymarket bettors, there‚Äôs a 19% chance of a 25 bps decrease in July ‚Äì a number that increases to 41% for September. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin and Crypto Markets? Well, Bitcoin is up by about 1.6% in the past 30 days. Taken in a vacuum, this could mean that investors are aligned with expectations and are waiting for a more decisive signal on behalf of the Fed. However, if we take a closer look at the charts, we can see the volatile nature of BTC‚Äôs range-bound movement thorughout this period. On a few occasions, the cryptocurrency charted gains upwards of 7-8% in just a few days and subsequent declines, which more or less means that its price has been reacting to global macroeconomic and geopolitical events considerably. This makes it hard to gauge how are traders positioned for tomorrow‚Äôs decision. If history is any indicator, though, an expected outcome is unlikely to cause substantial movement. Anything other than that, of course, will most probably send ripples across Bitcoin and, by extension ‚Äì the rest of the market. But what about later on? Well, there are growing expectations , not just on Polymarket, that the Fed will cut rates in September. If that coincides with favorable developments amid the ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the trade conflicts spurred by Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff war, the broader crypto industry could be headed for a bullish last quarter.

2025-06-17T13:04:07,"Judge Denies Alex Mashinsky Any Celsius Bankruptcy Payout ‚Äì Creditors Win","Chief United States Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn has officially denied former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky any claim to bankruptcy proceeds from the defunct crypto lender. The court order , entered on June 16, 2025, formally disallows all claims submitted by Mashinsky and his associated entities, including AM Ventures Holdings Inc., Koala1 LLC, and Koala3 LLC. This frees up reserved cash, liquid cryptocurrency, and MiningCo shares for distribution to legitimate creditors under the Chapter 11 reorganization plan. The stipulation agreement was reached on May 20, 2025, between Celsius litigation administrator Mohsin Meghji and Mashinsky. The court‚Äôs decision ensures that Celsius creditors, who have already received over $2.5 billion in distributions throughout 2024, will benefit from the release of funds held in reserve pending resolution of Mashinsky‚Äôs claims. Source: Stretto From Crypto Visionary to Convicted Fraudster Celsius Network, founded in 2017, positioned itself as a revolutionary alternative to traditional banking. It promised customers they could ‚Äúunbank yourself‚Äù while earning double-digit yields on their cryptocurrency deposits. Mashinsky‚Äôs charismatic promotion of the platform attracted billions in customer funds by promising that Celsius would lend these assets to institutional borrowers, generating returns far exceeding anything traditional financial institutions could offer. The facade began cracking in mid-2022 as broader crypto markets entered a severe downturn and high-profile failures shook investor confidence. Celsius customers, growing increasingly nervous about their deposits, began requesting withdrawals in high volumes, creating a classic bank run scenario that exposed the platform‚Äôs fundamental insolvency. Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding investors with false promises of high crypto returns. #Celsius #AlexMashinsky https://t.co/R4syyDiKaU ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 9, 2025 On June 12, 2022, Celsius froze all customer withdrawals and, within weeks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, revealing a massive $1.19 billion hole in its balance sheet that left hundreds of thousands of depositors facing potential total losses. Federal prosecutors later revealed the extent of Mashinsky‚Äôs deception, showing how he had knowingly misled customers about Celsius‚Äôs financial health while directing employees to use new customer deposits to pay promised yields to existing users in a Ponzi-like scheme. Most egregiously, prosecutors proved that Mashinsky had been secretly selling his personal CEL token holdings while publicly claiming he wasn‚Äôt selling. Creditor Recovery Success Contrasts Sharply with FTX Debacle While FTX creditors face the frustrating reality of receiving payments based on November 2022 cryptocurrency valuations, when Bitcoin traded at just $17,583 compared to over $109,000 today, Celsius creditors have benefited from more favorable recovery terms that better reflect actual market conditions during the distribution process. Defunct crypto lender @CelsiusNetwork crypto lender has announced a second payout of $127 million to its creditors. #CryptoLender #Celsius https://t.co/fiZ0ctQybG ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 28, 2024 Celsius has already distributed over $2.53 billion to approximately 251,000 creditors through multiple payout rounds, with the most recent November 2024 distribution adding another $127 million from the ‚ÄúLitigation Recovery Account.‚Äù These payments have covered nearly two-thirds of eligible creditors and represent 93% of total claim value, a remarkably high recovery rate for a major cryptocurrency platform failure. The success stems partly from the relatively quick resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings and the litigation administrator‚Äôs aggressive pursuit of asset recovery through various legal channels. The contrast with FTX becomes even more pronounced when considering the complexity and duration of each bankruptcy process. While FTX continues to grapple with what attorney Andrew Dietderich described as ‚Äú27 quintillion‚Äù claims, including many fraudulent submissions, Celsius has managed to streamline its creditor verification and payout processes. FTX, the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange that shook the industry in late 2022, is set to begin repaying its creditors on May 30. #FTX #Crypto https://t.co/pNRaarc5nG ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 30, 2025 FTX‚Äôs repayment plan, which began distributions in May 2025 targeting $16.5 billion in total recoveries , faces ongoing challenges from creditors who argue they‚Äôre being shortchanged due to the outdated valuation methodology that doesn‚Äôt account for dramatic cryptocurrency price appreciation since the platform‚Äôs collapse. As it stands now, Sam Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence and is projected for release in December 2044. Mashinsky, on the other hand, is now serving 12 years while being completely cut off from any financial recovery.

2025-06-17T13:01:50,"Here‚Äôs XRP Minimum, Average, and Maximum Price Outlook for 2030","Discussions about how high XRP could go by the end of this decade have resurfaced in the crypto community. Crypto influencer Cobb Alex triggered the conversation with a recent tweet. He asked XRP enthusiasts if they agreed with a long-term price analysis published by Telegaon researchers. The analysis outlines how XRP's price could evolve from this year to 2050.Specifically, the analysis projects that XRP could rise from $2 to as high as $285 over the next 25 years. It highlights minimum, average, and maximum outlooks for the coin throughout this period.XRP Price by 2030For instance, Telegaon argues that XRP's average price in 2025 would be $4.16, although this price has remained elusive. Six months into 2025, the coin has yet to break its all-time high. Meanwhile, the platform suggests a maximum price of $5.87 for XRP this year.For next year, the analysts project an average price of $7.53 and a maximum price of $9.18. Telegaon's forecasts suggest XRP will break the double-digit price level by 2027, though broader sentiment among enthusiasts and analysts is that XRP could hit that threshold this year.Looking further ahead, the report argues XRP could trade at a minimum price of $36.86 by 2030. In that year, it expects XRP‚Äôs average price to be $42.34 and projects a maximum value of $48.03.Five years later, it expects XRP to average $78.16 and reach a maximum of $87.49. As for 2040 and 2050, Telegaon believes XRP could break into the triple-digit price range. During this time, it projects a minimum price of $119.08 and a maximum value of $285.56.Overall, the analysis sees a promising future for XRP over the coming decades, highlighting values that would place its market cap in the trillions of dollars.https://twitter.com/AbsGMCrypto/status/1934426475790516274No More Bear Market for XRP?Essentially, the report suggests XRP's price will only go up over the years, never dipping, and each year's maximum price will become the next year's minimum. In effect, it fails to account for bear market scenarios.One commenter pointed this out, noting that the projected minimum prices flaw the analysis. He argued that XRP would likely fall below $1 during bearish periods, so projecting a scenario where XRP only moves upward is unrealistic.Another commenter humorously reinforced this view, saying, ‚ÄúIf you believe there will be no more bear markets, I have a bridge to sell you.‚Äù ""No Way It Takes a Decade for XRP to Reach $100""Meanwhile, optimistic voices argued that the projections are actually conservative. Some even claimed the analysis underestimates XRP‚Äôs potential. One commenter argued that XRP could hit $20 by the end of this year, opposing Telegaon‚Äôs 2029 timeline.Another insisted that there's no way XRP would take 25 years to reach a $100 price, as the report suggests. This viewpoint implies XRP could reach that level much sooner.¬†Given the long timeline to $100, some commentators speculated that the analysis might have come from Bitcoin maxis. Ultimately, these comments highlight the inflated short-term expectations many have for XRP.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/17/heres-xrp-minimum-average-and-maximum-price-outlook-for-2030/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-xrp-minimum-average-and-maximum-price-outlook-for-2030,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T13:01:08,"Europe's First Bitcoin Treasury Company Raises Capital to Buy More Bitcoin! Here Are the Details","The Blockchain Group, known as Europe‚Äôs first Bitcoin treasury company, has announced a capital increase totaling ‚Ç¨7.2 million ($8.3 million) in order to expand its Bitcoin purchases. The Blockchain Group Raises $8.3 Million to Increase Bitcoin Reserves The Blockchain Group, which is listed on the Paris-based Euronext Growth exchange, will issue approximately 1.6 million new shares at an average price of 4.49 euros ($5.19), the company announced today. The transaction is part of a ‚Ç¨300 million ($342 million) at-the-market (ATM) Bitcoin purchasing program that the company launched last week. The company announced plans to increase its Bitcoin treasury last Friday by issuing shares and convertible bonds worth 9.7 million euros ($11.2 million). Currently holding 1,471 BTC, The Blockchain Group is solidifying its place among the companies accumulating Bitcoin at the institutional level. TOMAB, the company‚Äôs strategic partner, also supports this move as a shareholder. However, with the news of the capital increase, the company's shares lost more than 4% of their value during the day, falling to 5.53 euros, according to Euronext data. This aggressive Bitcoin strategy by The Blockchain Group follows the path taken by giants in the institutional investment world, such as MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor. With the 10,100 BTC purchase announced earlier this week alone, MicroStrategy has brought its total Bitcoin holdings to 592,100 BTC and is now the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-17T13:00:49,"Trump‚Äôs Crypto Wealth Estimated Near $1 Billion In White House Report","In a recent report by Fortune, significant details emerged about President Donald Trump‚Äôs growing entanglement with the cryptocurrency industry, as disclosed in his first financial report since taking office. The report highlights various aspects of his business interests, including golf courses, sponsorship deals, and his publicly traded media group. Notably, it sheds light on Trump‚Äôs crypto platform, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which was announced by his sons last summer. $57 Million Earned From Crypto Token Sales The financial disclosure reveals that Trump has generated over $57 million from token sales on the World Liberty platform. He holds nearly 16 billion governance WLFI tokens‚Äîessentially the crypto equivalent of voting shares‚Äîissued by the company. Based on previous sales, which valued the tokens between $1.5 and $0.5, Trump‚Äôs holdings could potentially be worth close to $1 billion, although the tokens are not currently trading, as estimated by Bloomberg. As discussions in Congress about blockchain regulation intensify, government watchdogs are raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest stemming from Trump‚Äôs ventures in the crypto space. This report provides the first substantial insight into how deeply embedded Trump has become in digital assets. Before his recent campaign, Trump expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies, famously labeling Bitcoin (BTC) a ‚Äúscam‚Äù just a few years ago. However, during his last campaign, he began to embrace blockchain technology, promising to be the first president to support the industry. His engagement has included appearances at industry events, such as the National Bitcoin conference , where he promoted the technology and explored his business opportunities in the sector. Trump Expands Digital Asset Ventures Trump‚Äôs foray into crypto has expanded beyond the initial launch of a series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to a more comprehensive engagement through World Liberty Financial. Announced by his son Eric Trump last August, the World Liberty Financial platform aims to herald a ‚Äúnew era of finance,‚Äù although its specific functions remain somewhat unclear to date. In recent months, World Liberty has rolled out several products, including governance tokens and a dollar-pegged stablecoin named USD1. This stablecoin has garnered attention as it was utilized by an Emirati investment firm to inject $2 billion into Binance, one of the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchanges. The report also touches on another significant aspect of Trump‚Äôs crypto ventures‚Äîhis memecoin, also named TRUMP , which launched just before his inauguration. While the memecoin‚Äôs market capitalization has plummeted from $9 billion in January to around $2 billion today, it remains a controversial asset. It is believed that Trump‚Äôs organization owns about 80% of the total supply of this memecoin. In May, Trump hosted a dinner for top memecoin holders, an event that sparked criticism from lawmakers, particularly Democrats. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,550, having briefly dropped to $102,000 at the end of last week. According to CoinGecko data , the cryptocurrency has increased by 4.5% over the past month.

2025-06-17T13:00:19,"Shocking: Donald Trump Denies Iran Peace Talks Amid Rising Geopolitical Risk","BitcoinWorld Shocking: Donald Trump Denies Iran Peace Talks Amid Rising Geopolitical Risk In a move that reverberated across political circles and global markets, former U.S. President Donald Trump took to his preferred platform, Truth Social , to vehemently deny reports suggesting the initiation of Iran peace talks . His blunt statement dismissed the claims as ‚ÄúHIGHLY FABRICATED, FAKE NEWS,‚Äù adding a layer of uncertainty to already complex international relations. For those navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency, understanding such geopolitical shifts is crucial, as they can introduce significant Geopolitical risk that ultimately impacts the Crypto market impact . What Exactly Did Donald Trump Say on Truth Social? Using his distinctive style, Donald Trump directly addressed the rumors via a post on Truth Social . He was unequivocal, stating he had made no contact with Iran regarding negotiations. He further challenged Iran, suggesting they knew how to reach him if they genuinely desired talks. Referencing past opportunities, Trump added, ‚ÄúThey should have taken the deal that was on the table ‚Äì Would have saved a lot of lives!!!‚Äù This statement not only shut down the idea of current talks but also underscored his perspective on past diplomatic efforts with the nation. Trump‚Äôs choice of platform, Truth Social , is noteworthy in itself. Since being banned from major social media sites like Twitter (now X) and Facebook following the January 6th events, he has primarily used his own platform to communicate directly with his supporters and the public. This makes Truth Social a key channel for understanding his current views and potential future policy directions, which can have indirect implications for global stability and, by extension, financial markets, including crypto. Understanding the Context: Why are Iran Peace Talks Significant? The relationship between the United States and Iran has been fraught with tension for decades, marked by periods of confrontation, sanctions, and failed diplomatic attempts. The idea of Iran peace talks represents a potential de-escalation of hostilities, a pathway towards resolving significant disagreements over issues like nuclear programs, regional influence, and economic sanctions. Past efforts, such as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, aimed to curb Iran‚Äôs nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from this deal in 2018, reimposing sanctions and significantly increasing tensions. Therefore, any mention of renewed Iran peace talks carries significant weight, signaling a potential shift in policy or a response to ongoing pressures. The denial by Donald Trump is significant because it comes at a time when regional dynamics remain volatile. It signals that, at least from his perspective or potential future stance, direct negotiations are not on the immediate horizon. This lack of dialogue or a clear diplomatic path contributes directly to Geopolitical risk . How Does Geopolitical Risk Connect to Crypto Market Impact? You might wonder, what does a denial of Iran peace talks by Donald Trump have to do with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies? The connection lies in the fundamental principle that global events, particularly those involving major powers and potential conflict zones, introduce uncertainty into financial markets. This is known as Geopolitical risk . Here‚Äôs how Geopolitical risk can influence the Crypto market impact : Increased Uncertainty: Political instability or the threat of conflict makes investors nervous. They may become more risk-averse, pulling funds out of assets perceived as volatile or risky. Flight to Safety (or not): Traditionally, assets like gold or government bonds are considered safe havens during times of uncertainty. Bitcoin has sometimes been argued to serve a similar role, but its correlation with traditional risk assets (like tech stocks) means it often falls when traditional markets do. Macroeconomic Effects: Tensions in the Middle East, for instance, can impact oil prices, leading to inflation concerns. Central banks might react with monetary policy changes, which in turn affect liquidity and investment appetite for assets like crypto. Regulatory Scrutiny: Heightened global tensions can increase focus on how digital assets might be used for illicit finance or sanctions evasion, potentially leading to calls for stricter regulation on crypto. Investor Sentiment: Negative global headlines can simply dampen overall investor enthusiasm and confidence across all markets, including crypto. While the direct, immediate impact of Donald Trump‚Äôs statement on Truth Social denying Iran peace talks might seem distant from the daily fluctuations of the Crypto market impact , it contributes to the broader tapestry of global uncertainty that influences investor decisions. Savvy crypto participants understand that external macro factors, including Geopolitical risk , play a significant role in market movements, sometimes even more so than crypto-specific news. Navigating Uncertainty: Challenges and Actionable Insights The primary challenge posed by situations like the denial of Iran peace talks and the resulting Geopolitical risk is increased market volatility. Predicting the exact Crypto market impact of such events is difficult because crypto markets react to a confluence of factors. However, there are actionable insights for crypto holders and traders: Stay Informed: Pay attention not just to crypto news but also to major global political and economic developments. Understanding the broader context is key. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical events can cause sharp market swings. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. Consider Diversification: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different crypto assets or even traditional assets can help mitigate risk during turbulent times. Develop a Strategy: Have a plan for how you will react to significant market downturns or upturns triggered by external events. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or panic. Look for Trends, Not Just Headlines: While headlines create short-term noise, look for how persistent geopolitical tensions or policy shifts might create longer-term trends in market behavior. The statement by Donald Trump on Truth Social is a reminder that the global political landscape is constantly shifting, and these shifts can have ripple effects far beyond the immediate headlines, including influencing the complex dynamics of the Crypto market impact . Donald Trump, Truth Social, and the Future Landscape Donald Trump‚Äôs continued use of Truth Social as his primary communication channel means that anyone interested in his potential future policies, including those that might touch upon economic stability, international relations, or even digital assets (given his past comments and the evolving landscape), needs to monitor this platform. His past administration‚Äôs approach to Iran and international agreements, combined with his recent statement, provides insight into how he might handle foreign policy if he were to return to office. This potential shift in foreign policy approach represents another layer of Geopolitical risk that market participants must consider. While Donald Trump has expressed skepticism about Bitcoin in the past, the crypto landscape is constantly evolving, and political stances can change. The broader environment of increased Geopolitical risk and uncertainty highlighted by events like the denial of Iran peace talks could, paradoxically, increase interest in decentralized assets for some investors, while causing others to retreat. The interaction between political actions announced on platforms like Truth Social and the resulting Crypto market impact is a developing area that requires careful observation. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in the Crypto Age Donald Trump‚Äôs recent post on Truth Social , unequivocally denying claims of initiating Iran peace talks , serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present Geopolitical risk in the global arena. While seemingly distant from the world of digital currencies, such high-stakes political statements contribute to a climate of uncertainty that inevitably influences financial markets, including the volatile realm of cryptocurrency. The potential Crypto market impact of heightened tensions, shifts in foreign policy, and the communication strategies employed by influential figures like Donald Trump via platforms like Truth Social cannot be ignored by serious market participants. Staying informed about both the political landscape and market fundamentals is essential for navigating the challenges and potential opportunities that arise in this interconnected world.

2025-06-17T12:50:12,"Bitcoin: Genius Group Strategically Boosts Holdings to 100 BTC","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Genius Group Strategically Boosts Holdings to 100 BTC Exciting developments are unfolding in the corporate world as more companies explore and expand their exposure to digital assets. In a significant move that underscores the growing trend of Institutional adoption , Singapore-based AI education company, Genius Group , has substantially increased its Bitcoin holdings. Genius Group‚Äôs Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation According to a report by Cointelegraph, Genius Group has made a notable addition to its digital asset reserves. The company acquired an additional 34 BTC over the past month, significantly boosting its total holdings. This recent purchase brings Genius Group‚Äôs total Bitcoin treasury to a round 100 BTC . At the time of reporting, these holdings were valued at over $10 million. This accumulation demonstrates a clear strategic decision by the company to integrate digital assets onto its balance sheet. Why the Recent Boost? Understanding the Court Ruling What prompted this specific increase in Bitcoin holdings now? The timing is linked to a key legal development. Genius Group‚Äôs ability to make this recent acquisition stems from a favorable U.S. Court of Appeals ruling. This ruling successfully overturned a prior ban that had prevented the firm from purchasing BTC . With this legal hurdle cleared, Genius Group was able to proceed with its plan to expand its digital asset reserves, adding to its nascent crypto treasury . Beyond Genius Group: The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Genius Group‚Äôs move is not an isolated incident but rather part of a larger, ongoing trend of Institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While retail investors have been active in the market for years, the past few cycles have seen corporations, asset managers, and even governments begin to allocate capital to digital assets. Major players like MicroStrategy have famously adopted a Bitcoin -centric treasury strategy, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC . Other companies have followed suit, albeit on a smaller scale. This trend is driven by various factors: Store of Value: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class to traditional holdings. Potential Appreciation: Anticipating future price growth of BTC . Attracting Talent and Investors: Signalling forward-thinking and tech-savviness to employees and shareholders. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Seeking alternatives amidst global economic shifts. The decision by a company like Genius Group , primarily focused on AI education, to build a significant crypto treasury highlights how mainstream this consideration is becoming across different industries. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Treasury Trend? The expansion of Genius Group ‚Äòs crypto treasury reinforces the viability of holding digital assets for corporations. However, adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy comes with its own set of considerations. Here‚Äôs a brief look at potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits Potential Challenges Asset Diversification Price Volatility Inflation Hedge Potential Regulatory Uncertainty Potential Long-Term Growth Security Risks (Custody) Increased Investor Interest Accounting and Tax Complexities For companies considering this path, understanding these factors is crucial. Genius Group‚Äôs successful navigation of a legal challenge to acquire BTC also sets a precedent, demonstrating that regulatory environments are evolving and can be influenced or clarified. Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering Crypto For other companies watching the trend of Institutional adoption and contemplating their own foray into a crypto treasury , Genius Group‚Äôs experience offers several takeaways: Do Thorough Due Diligence: Understand the asset class, its risks, and potential rewards specific to your business goals. Address Legal and Regulatory Hurdles: Proactively seek clarity on your jurisdiction‚Äôs stance on corporate crypto holdings. Genius Group‚Äôs case highlights the importance of navigating legal frameworks. Develop a Clear Strategy: Define your objectives for holding Bitcoin or other digital assets (e.g., long-term hold, transactional use). Prioritize Security: Implement robust custody solutions to protect your digital assets. Consult Experts: Engage with legal, financial, and crypto professionals to navigate the complexities. Genius Group‚Äôs ability to acquire 100 BTC after overcoming a legal obstacle serves as a practical example for others navigating similar waters. Summary: Genius Group‚Äôs decision to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings to 100 BTC , valued at over $10 million, marks a key moment for the company and the broader trend of Institutional adoption . Enabled by a favorable court ruling, this move underscores the growing confidence among corporations in adding digital assets to their balance sheets. While challenges exist, the strategic accumulation by companies like Genius Group signals a potential shift in corporate finance, making the concept of a crypto treasury increasingly relevant in the global economy.
