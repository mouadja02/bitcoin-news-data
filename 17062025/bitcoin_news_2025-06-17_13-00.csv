Analyst Edo Farina breaks down the latest XRP Rich List, as he reveals exactly how many tokens one needs to rank in the top 10%, top 1%, and beyond. How Much XRP Puts You in the Top 1%? The analyst shared insights on how the XRP wallet distribution is changing. An investor now needs fewer XRP to climb the ladder. As of now, the top 10% of XRP holders own at least 2,480 XRP. The top 5% need about 8,762 XRP and to be among the top 1%, you need to own over 50,000 XRP. He points out that many individuals use multiple wallets. As of now, about 328,000 wallets hold at least 8,000 XRP. But the number of actual people holding that much is probably much lower. Edo revealed that he himself holds over 20–25 XRP wallets for testing, staking, and security purposes. That is why the analyst calls it a very conservative estimate. Only 657 Wallets Hold Over 5 Million XRP Currently, only 657 wallets hold over 5 million XRP, putting them in the top 0.01%. These are mostly institutions, exchanges, and Ripple-related wallets. According to Farina, if you are among the top 10% of XRP holders, with 2,480 XRP, then patience is key. He explains that if XRP reaches $10 and you decide to sell your entire holdings, you might make around $24,000. Although that is a decent return, it’s not life-changing, he says. Why10,000 XRP Should Be Your Goal The real opportunity lies in holding long term and using your XRP to generate passive income, like lending to banks or financial institutions. He asks users to aim for at least 10,000 XRP. In his view, the real value lies in thinking beyond short-term gains and focusing on sustainable growth. Earlier, the analyst had shared that $20 could just be the starting point for XRP and it would go much higher. He compares it to Bitcoin’s early days, saying selling too early, like selling BTC at $500 would be a big mistake. Farina even suggests XRP could hit $10,000 someday, due to its growing utility in the global payments market.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-rich-list-are-you-in-the-top-10/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T10:43:10,"Bitcoin Mining Becomes Pricier as Firms Like H100 Double Down","Bitcoin’s role in corporate finance continues to evolve as production costs climb and treasury adoption expands. The median cost to mine one Bitcoin has risen to over $70,000 this quarter, pressuring miners to maintain efficiency amid soaring energy prices. At the same time, Swedish health-tech firm H100 Group has secured a financing deal of up to $79 million from Blockstream CEO Adam Back to bolster its growing Bitcoin holdings, signaling broader institutional confidence in the asset’s long-term value. Bitcoin Mining Costs Surge Past $70,000 as Industry Faces Rising Energy Prices and Hashrate Pressure The cost to mine a single Bitcoin has surged past $70,000 in the second quarter of 2025, putting additional pressure on mining firms already grappling with rising energy prices and a rapidly intensifying network hashrate. According to a recent industry report published by Bitcoin mining research firm TheMinerMag, median Bitcoin production costs have steadily climbed from $52,000 in late 2024 to $64,000 in Q1 2025 — and are projected to exceed $70,000 this quarter. The near 9.4% increase in production costs threatens to erode profitability for less efficient miners, even as Bitcoin trades above $107,500. The steep rise comes amid a growing divergence between mining companies, with investors rewarding firms that have expanded their revenue streams beyond traditional Bitcoin mining. The implied cost of Bitcoin production by company (Source: TheMinerMag) Despite the cost pressure, the continued strength in Bitcoin’s price is providing a cushion for most miners. “ With Bitcoin currently trading near $107,635, many miners still retain healthy profit margins — at least for now. But the margin for error is narrowing, particularly for companies operating with aging hardware, higher-cost energy contracts, or limited operational scale. One of the key drivers behind the rising cost of Bitcoin mining is the increase in energy prices, which directly impacts the fleet hashcost — the amount miners pay for computing power. In the first quarter of 2025, the median fleet hashcost for public mining firms held at $34 per petahash per second (PH/s), but some companies experienced significantly steeper increases. Terawulf, for instance, reported a 25% rise in production costs due to energy expenses spiking to $0.081 per kilowatt-hour — nearly double its Q1 2024 rate of $0.041. Similarly, Bitdeer and other firms have reported similar cost inflation, sparking renewed focus on operational efficiency, energy sourcing strategies, and hardware upgrades. For many mining companies, keeping fleet costs low has become a critical priority as the industry enters a higher-cost operating environment. Mining Stocks Reflect Divergence in Strategy The impact of rising mining costs is being felt not only in data centers but also in the stock market. Mining equities have shown diverging performance, with investors showing a clear preference for companies that have diversified beyond Bitcoin block rewards. Between May 4 and June 13, while Bitcoin rose a modest 1.35%, shares of Iris Energy (IREN) soared by 21.4%. Other top performers include Core Scientific (CORZ), Bit Digital (BTBT), and Cipher Mining (CIFR), all of which posted double-digit gains. Change in share price of top public Bitcoin miners since May 4 (Source: TheMinerMag) In contrast, hardware-focused and less diversified firms like Canaan (CAN) and Bitfarms (BITF) each saw their stock prices drop by over 21% in the same period. The pursuit of new revenue streams is leading many miners into adjacent industries such as artificial intelligence (AI) hosting and high-performance computing (HPC) services. These ventures offer miners a way to repurpose or dual-purpose their infrastructure — particularly data centers and energy supply contracts — to serve enterprise-grade computing needs. By offering AI training environments, machine learning compute cycles, and even cloud-based services, some Bitcoin miners are transforming themselves into diversified tech infrastructure providers. This pivot is not without its challenges, but for now, it’s winning favor with shareholders eager for stability in an otherwise volatile sector. Outlook: Profitability Hinges on Adaptation The months ahead may prove to be a defining moment for the Bitcoin mining industry. With the cost of mining continuing to rise — driven by energy markets, network difficulty , and operational overheads — firms that fail to adapt may be forced to downscale or exit the market altogether. Conversely, those that embrace diversification, optimize fleet efficiency, and invest in new technologies are positioning themselves not only to survive the cost crunch, but potentially to thrive in a post-halving era of industrial-scale mining. H100 Group Secures $79M Bitcoin Treasury Financing Deal with Blockstream CEO Adam Back In related news, Swedish health-technology company H100 Group (H100) has announced a landmark financing agreement with Blockstream CEO Adam Back that could bring in up to 750 million Swedish kronor (approximately $79 million) to support the firm’s expanding Bitcoin treasury strategy. The agreement, revealed Monday, marks a significant milestone in the convergence of healthcare innovation and Bitcoin adoption, as H100 accelerates its plans to solidify BTC as a strategic reserve asset. As part of the agreement, Back has already committed to an initial 150 million-krona investment in what the company has designated as Tranche 6, a convertible loan structured to convert into equity at a future date. The terms were established through arm’s length negotiations, with the tranche priced at 6.38 kronor per share — a 33% premium over H100’s current market value. In addition to Tranche 6, Back retains the option to participate in two follow-up tranches, each currently set at 75 million kronor. However, the company signaled it may increase the size of these tranches depending on evolving market conditions. Bitcoin as a Long-Term Strategic Reserve The move aligns with H100’s long-term strategy of integrating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury — a decision that reflects growing institutional confidence in the digital asset’s role as a store of value. As of now, H100 holds 24.41 BTC, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net, and the company appears committed to significantly expanding that figure in the near term. This strategy mirrors a broader trend among forward-looking companies that view Bitcoin not only as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency depreciation, but also as a technological signal to markets about innovation readiness and balance sheet strength. H100’s announcement sparked a sharp rise in investor interest. Shares of H100 jumped 22% on Monday, fueled by both the capital infusion and the prestige of partnering with one of Bitcoin’s most respected figures. Adam Back, a legendary cryptographer and an early contributor to Bitcoin’s development, is best known for inventing Hashcash, the proof-of-work system that laid the groundwork for Bitcoin’s consensus algorithm. His role as CEO of Blockstream, a leading Bitcoin infrastructure firm, adds significant weight to his financial endorsement. Why H100’s Bitcoin Move Matters While companies like Strategy and Metaplanet have made headlines for massive Bitcoin treasury allocations, H100’s entry into this arena is notable for a few reasons: Sector Diversification: As a health-technology company, H100’s Bitcoin strategy introduces BTC into an industry that has traditionally shied away from crypto exposure. Alternative Financing Approach: The convertible loan structure offers speed and scalability, contrasting with slower and more rigid equity-raising mechanisms like rights issues. Prestige Backing: With Adam Back’s participation, the deal not only brings capital but also validation from one of the Bitcoin industry’s most influential voices. The firm’s proactive stance may inspire other European technology and healthcare companies to explore similar strategies, especially under the increasingly favorable regulatory frameworks emerging across the continent. Bitcoin’s Institutional Momentum Expands H100’s financing deal and its growing BTC holdings highlight a broader narrative: Bitcoin’s transition from speculative asset to corporate reserve is no longer confined to tech or financial firms. As energy costs, inflation concerns, and fiat volatility continue to impact global markets, more companies are exploring the strategic potential of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. And with heavyweight figures like Adam Back backing innovative entrants, the momentum shows no signs of slowing. For H100, this financing round may just be the beginning of a much larger transformation — one that not only reshapes its treasury but positions it at the forefront of a new economic paradigm in corporate finance.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9593/bitcoin-mining-becomes-pricier-as-firms-like-h100-double-down,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T10:41:58,"Celsius Bankruptcy Twist: Mashinsky’s Crypto Assets Now Go to Creditors","The post Celsius Bankruptcy Twist: Mashinsky’s Crypto Assets Now Go to Creditors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the ongoing Celsius bankruptcy saga, former CEO Alexander Mashinsky has agreed not to claim any assets from the company’s bankruptcy proceedings. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York confirmed the agreement, marking a significant step toward ensuring more funds reach Celsius’s creditors. Mashinsky Agrees to Forfeit All Celsius Claims On Monday, the court reviewed and approved a new agreement involving Celsius’s debtors, Mashinsky, and associated entities, including AM Ventures Holding Inc., Koala1 LLC, and Koala3 LLC. Under this deal, these parties are officially barred from receiving any distributions from Celsius’ bankruptcy estate. As a result, funds that were previously held due to Mashinsky’s disputed claims can now be unlocked and made available for Celsius creditors. However, this stipulation will only take full effect after final court approval. Court Orders Release of Held Crypto and Shares The court ordered that all crypto assets, cash, and Miningco shares held by Mashinsky and the involved entities must be released for redistribution. This decision clears the way for a wider distribution of remaining assets, bringing some relief to the thousands of creditors still waiting for their payouts. Importantly, the court has retained jurisdiction over the case, meaning any disputes regarding this agreement must be resolved solely under its supervision. The court emphasized that no further claims from Mashinsky or his affiliated companies will be allowed without direct approval. Celsius Bankruptcy: Creditors Still Waiting Celsius began the distribution process in 2024, releasing over $3 billion in cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to eligible creditors. Despite this progress, over 121,000 eligible users have yet to claim their rightful distributions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Eric Trump Involved in Tron’s $210M Nasdaq Deal? , While some creditors expressed satisfaction after receiving their assets, many have faced delays and complications. According to recent figures from 2025, $1 billion has already been reclaimed by over 251,000 creditors, but a substantial number are still waiting for access to their funds. Final Verdict: No Recovery for Mashinsky This latest court order follows Mashinsky’s 12-year prison sentence for securities and commodities fraud tied to his actions at Celsius. By relinquishing all claims to the bankruptcy proceeds, the path is now clearer for Celsius creditors to receive what they’re owed. Why It Matters for Crypto Investors The Celsius bankruptcy continues to be one of the most high-profile collapses in the crypto space. With Mashinsky officially out of the picture, this move is likely to boost confidence in ongoing asset recovery efforts. Investors are hoping this milestone accelerates the process for those still waiting to reclaim their digital assets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Additionally, the recent surge in oil prices, prompted by Middle East tensions, could fuel inflation concerns. However, May’s CPI and PPI data indicate core inflation “remains relatively tame. This macro disconnect between data and sentiment is fueling policy uncertainty.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $106,856. This is a pullback from the intraday high of $108,785, as the coin failed to hold this level despite several attempts. The resistance levels now stand at $108,951 and $110,406. If the coin breaks through these zones, it may start breaking new ATHs. The first support level to keep an eye on is $106,196, followed by $104,633, and then $103,132. Bitcoin Price Chart.

While the crypto market dropped over the last 24 hours, the stock market increased by the closing time on Monday. The S&P 500 increased by 0.94%, the Nasdaq-100 went up by 1.42%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.75%. The stock market has recovered from losses in the previous session, following Israel’s attack on Iran. It’s still paying close attention to it. Is this dip sustainable? This crypto market dip is likely another typical, short-term pullback.

2025-06-17T10:38:41,"Bitcoin Hits $107,000 as Geopolitical Crises Hit Fever Pitch and Gold Remains a Hedging Asset for Portfolios","The price of Bitcoin has shattered many records in recent years, and has just hit $107,000 with momentum building around geopolitical conflicts. Gold, meanwhile, is up 90% since June 2020. Early investors of Bitcoin have made a lot of money, leaving behind new investors who may be wondering whether the price will continue to rise. Traditional investors use Bitcoin to hedge against global conflicts. As with Gold, Bitcoin can measure long-term value, with the added benefit of cutting-edge cryptography to secure a wallet address. Gold may be primed for a new high if the price breaks $3,400 per Troy ounce. The Israel-Iran conflict may have provided a new reason for investors to hedge their portfolios with Bitcoin or Gold. There has occurred a sharp escalation of conflict in the Middle East, with Israel striking Iranian nuclear facilities. Otherwise, there was positive news for markets, with the Trump administration making breakthroughs to ease tensions in the US-China trade war. However, all of the progress made has been overshadowed by conflicts involving the possibility of nuclear armament. Gold offers investors a haven if supply chains are disrupted. However, Bitcoin provides a similar service, with the added benefit of hiding one’s wealth within a private wallet address. Whether investors prefer Bitcoin to Gold depends on how serious they deem the current geopolitical crisis. Manav Modi, a Motilal Oswal Financial Services senior analyst, said that gold was back in focus amongst growing global uncertainty. Investors will also be considering Bitcoin, with the added benefit of a better-educated public, and the potential to secure their wealth during an economic crisis, or worse, a nuclear war. The Federal Reserve is set to meet on June 18 to discuss a possible rate cut. Futures markets have already predicted a 99% probability that the Fed will put rates on hold between 4.25%-4.5%. Bitcoin traders may pay attention to the Federal Reserve speech to ascertain whether there is a chance of a future rate cut. Inflation has continued to soften over time, which could indicate a rate cut later in the year. Futures markets continue to price in two rate cuts later in the year. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve may not be in a rush to cut rates, holding on a bit longer to ensure that inflation is dampened considerably. Future prices of Bitcoin are challenging to predict, but the climate is right for another bull run in the near future. Although inflation has dampened recently, the inflation rate has risen by 0.1% from the 2.3% rate of April. Economists would like to see inflation trend the other way. Investors often invest in assets like Gold and Bitcoin when inflation goes up. Investors seek assets like Gold as a safe haven during an economic crisis. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released an inflation report. The Gold price was $3,355 per Troy ounce before the report, then $3,382 afterward. Although the price change is small, it might indicate a positive sentiment for hedging Gold against inflation. Given the shaky situation lately, a slight shift in inflation could tip the scales and send Bitcoin into new all-time highs. Brent crude oil prices jumped by 5% last week, confirming concerns about further inflation and economic crises. The conflicts in the Middle East are not easing concerns that inflation may be lowered in the near future. US inflation figures have been cooler than expected, despite continuing to rise. The better-than-usual economic figures may have put a cap on the Bitcoin price before geopolitical concerns once again made cryptocurrencies a choice for hedging against economic crises. The People’s Bank of China has increased its gold bullion reserves for the seventh month. This could indicate positive institutional sentiment towards hedging assets such as Gold and Bitcoin. Alternatively, it may indicate a zero-sum game fermenting between Gold and Bitcoin, with China backing Gold and the US backing Bitcoin. US dollar weakness could also create strength for the price of Bitcoin and Gold. Volatility in the US dollar market could also spill over into the Gold and Bitcoin markets, creating further fluctuations and boosting the prices of cryptocurrencies. Gold price has support at $3,280 and resistance at $3,500 per Troy ounce. Bitcoin traders may monitor the Gold price to ascertain the sentiment of hedging investors. It would be difficult for a trader to short the Gold market during a major conflict in the Middle East. Gold prices often settle back down over time. However, the conflicts and economic tariffs seem to be escalating.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-hits-107000-as-geopolitical-crises-hit-fever-pitch-and-gold-remains-a-hedging-asset-for-portfolios/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Gold",cryptocompare

However, the real story may be unfolding elsewhere in the crypto universe, particularly around specific altcoins like $XYZ. This memecoin is staking its claim in the volatile market, propelled by strong investor interest and a unique market position. Current Bitcoin Market Dynamics and Whale Behavior Despite Bitcoin’s current price hovering around $105,000, it shows no significant retreat from its peak levels. Whale activity, as tracked by CryptoQuant , suggests a robust accumulation phase, often a precursor to a substantial market move. The market's resilience is evident as it stabilizes in the face of varied macroeconomic factors and institutional inflows from ETFs. This stability is crafting a bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape, influencing not just Bitcoin but also altcoins and memecoins alike. Why Memecoins Like $XYZ Are Gaining Traction Amidst this bullish backdrop, certain memecoins are seeing unprecedented attention. Memecoins, known for their rapid ascents in value, often benefit from the broader market's positive momentum. One such emergent story is that of XYZVerse ($XYZ) , capturing the spotlight with its innovative approach that integrates memecoin excitement with tangible blockchain utility. Chart source: TradingView What Sets $XYZ Apart? $XYZ is carving out its niche by blending the viral appeal of memecoins with a solid utility framework. This memecoin is designed around a sports-centric ecosystem, where token holders can engage in fantasy sports, staking, and earn real-time rewards. Key attributes of $XYZ include: Robust Tokenomics and Limited Supply The supply of $XYZ is capped at 100 billion tokens , with a strategic plan for a deflationary burn mechanism, enhancing its scarcity and potential value over time. Security and Transparency The underlying technology of $XYZ is fortified by comprehensive security audits and a transparent roadmap, factors critical in building investor confidence. Expanding Ecosystem and Strategic Partnerships $XYZ's growth is accelerated by partnerships with key industry players like bookmaker.XYZ , a blockchain-based sportsbook, which is pivotal for real-world application and utility. Could $XYZ Reach $1? The potential for $XYZ to hit the $1 mark is a topic of intense speculation. Given its current presale momentum and strategic market positioning, $XYZ is not just another memecoin. It’s a project with a foundation laid out for substantial growth, potentially increasing its value multifold. For early adopters, now is a promising time to buy $XYZ as it progresses through its presale stages, currently priced attractively before its public listing.

2025-06-17T10:32:51,"Which Memecoin Could Reach $1 As Bitcoin Whales Accumulate? $XYZ is on the Radar","Bitcoin is just 2% below its all-time high of $111,000. Yet, despite the proximity to its record, whales are showing no signs of heavy selling. According to CryptoQuant , this looks like a phase of accumulation – a behavior whales typically display before major price moves and market breakouts. Bitcoin remained rangebound around the $105,000 mark in mid-June as investors assessed macroeconomic signals, ETF-driven institutional inflows, and mounting concerns of a potential market correction. The world’s largest cryptocurrency, which briefly surged past $111,000 earlier, is now consolidating amid a cautious but still predominantly bullish outlook. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Overview Bitcoin is trading at approximately $105,000 after retreating from highs near $111,000. The current price action follows a wave of optimism driven by strong ETF demand and a moderating U.S. inflation print. Intraday movement shows support at $103,700 and a more significant floor near $97,100, while resistance remains firmly planted just under the all-time high of $112,000. Source: TradingView Despite short-term volatility, sentiment remains largely constructive. Investors are drawing confidence from dovish signals out of the Federal Reserve and sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. With total ETF assets now reaching $130 billion , institutional backing is playing an increasingly pivotal role in shaping market dynamics. Memecoins to Benefit from Bullish Sentiment: Which One Could Reach $1 The broader bullish sentiment spills over to altcoins that usually follow BTC. Memecoins in particular are known for their potential to deliver explosive short-term gains. History has shown cases where some surged by thousands of percent almost overnight — for example, Pepe (PEPE) skyrocketed by over 7,000% in just a few weeks after launch. As Bitcoin is likely nearing a new breakout, capital tends to rotate toward promising altcoin projects, and investors are now wondering which memecoin could reach $1 in the next bullish cycle. Among the contenders, XYZVerse ($XYZ) is starting to stand out with its unusual concept and fast-moving presale. Why $XYZ Could Well Be the Next Meme Coin to Reach $1 XYZVerse introduces a fresh concept by merging memecoin fun with blockchain utility and global sports culture. The project creates an interactive ecosystem where users can engage in fantasy competitions, stake tokens, and earn rewards based on real-time sports events. This fan-driven model appeals to a wide audience and gives the token practical, ongoing use. Here are the key factors that could contribute to XYZVerse (XYZ) reaching $1: 1. Strong Tokenomics and Capped Supply $XYZ is built on structured tokenomics designed to support long-term growth. The total supply is capped at 100 billion tokens , preventing excessive dilution. A deflationary burn mechanism gradually reduces the supply, increasing scarcity over time — a feature that has historically supported price appreciation in similar projects. 2. Audited and Transparent Infrastructure The smart contracts behind $XYZ have been independently audited , and the project roadmap is publicly available. These transparency measures help build investor trust and differentiate XYZVerse from many meme tokens that lack accountability or long-term vision. 3. Growing Ecosystem and Early Partnerships The platform is expanding ahead of schedule. Its first official partner, bookmaker.XYZ , is a fully on-chain sportsbook and casino — a key step in integrating real-world applications. Future plans include additional partnerships with sports platforms and games, further embedding $XYZ into interactive digital experiences. 4. Early Entry Timing and Presale Momentum Currently in the presale phase, $XYZ offers early participants a lower entry point of just $0.003333 (Stage 12) before the token lists publicly. With the presale now past $14 million raised and nearing its final stages, the project has already demonstrated strong investor interest — a sign that market confidence is building ahead of launch. Buy $XYZ at current prices before the next stage kicks in Could XYZVerse Realistically Reach $1? XYZVerse is currently in Stage 12 of 15 of its presale. The project aims to reach $30 million in total funding. If successful, it plans to list at $0.10 per token — a 30x return from today’s price. But what about the $1 mark? While it would take another 10x from the listing price, such growth isn’t unheard of in the meme coin space. Projects like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT) have seen thousands of percent gains in just months, particularly in strong market conditions. XYZVerse has a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, a deflationary burn model (with over 17% planned), and a roadmap that includes staking, sportsbook integration, and new ecosystem tools. Combined with rising market optimism and early investor momentum, a post-listing surge — while ambitious — is within the realm of possibility. Reaching $1 would depend on continued execution, exchange listings, and community traction. But with the foundations in place, XYZVerse is positioning itself as more than just another meme coin — and that’s what could make all the difference. Summary As Bitcoin nears its all-time high and whale activity signals confidence in further growth, market attention is shifting toward high-potential altcoins and memecoins. In this environment, XYZVerse ($XYZ) is emerging as a standout project. Combining the viral appeal of memecoins with real-world sports utility, XYZVerse offers a unique ecosystem for staking and fan engagement. Given its timing, structure, and growing ecosystem, $XYZ is positioning itself as a serious contender for long-term growth that could potentially reach and overcome the $1 threshold.

2025-06-17T10:30:09,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: The Blockchain Group Secures $7.7M for Ambitious Plan","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: The Blockchain Group Secures $7.7M for Ambitious Plan Big news from the world of corporate finance meeting digital assets! The Blockchain Group, a notable French firm deeply involved in the blockchain space, has just announced a significant capital raise aimed squarely at a bold new direction: adopting a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy . This move signals a growing trend among companies looking to integrate digital assets into their balance sheets. Understanding The Blockchain Group’s Recent Capital Boost Let’s dive into the specifics of this financial maneuver. The Blockchain Group revealed via an announcement on the social platform X that they successfully raised approximately €7.2 million, which translates to about $7.7 million USD at the current exchange rate. This wasn’t a traditional venture capital round or a standard IPO. Instead, the company utilized an “ATM-type,” or At-The-Market, capital increase program. Here’s a breakdown of the key details: Amount Raised: ~€7.2 million ($7.7 million USD) Method: At-The-Market (ATM) capital increase program Partner: Asset manager TOBAM Share Price: New shares were sold at an average price of €4.49 each. Purpose: To finance and support the company’s initiative to become a Bitcoin treasury strategy company. An ATM offering allows a company to sell new shares into the public market gradually at prevailing market prices, rather than through a single large offering at a fixed price. This method provides flexibility and can minimize dilution impact compared to a large, sudden share issuance. Partnering with an asset manager like TOBAM for this program adds a layer of institutional backing and execution expertise. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? This is the core of The Blockchain Group’s announcement and perhaps the most interesting part for those watching the convergence of traditional business and crypto. A Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a primary treasury reserve asset, alongside or instead of traditional assets like cash, cash equivalents, or short-term investments. Why would a company do this? The motivations are varied, but often include: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often viewed as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation, given its fixed and verifiable supply limit (21 million BTC). Potential for Appreciation: Companies hope to benefit from the potential long-term price appreciation of Bitcoin, which has historically outperformed many traditional asset classes over certain periods. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset (though correlation can vary) to the treasury can potentially improve the overall risk-adjusted return of the corporate balance sheet. Signal to Market: For companies in the tech or blockchain space, holding Bitcoin can signal forward-thinking leadership and alignment with the digital economy. While promising, it’s crucial to note that this strategy also comes with significant risks, primarily related to Bitcoin’s price volatility and the evolving regulatory landscape. Why is The Blockchain Group Adopting This Strategy Now? The decision by The Blockchain Group to pivot towards a Bitcoin treasury strategy isn’t happening in a vacuum. It reflects broader trends and perhaps the company’s specific vision for its future. As a firm already operating within the blockchain ecosystem, integrating Bitcoin into its core financial operations seems like a natural, albeit bold, extension of its expertise and mission. Several factors could be influencing this timing: Market Conditions: The crypto market has seen periods of recovery and increased institutional interest, potentially making this an opportune time to acquire Bitcoin. Strategic Alignment: For a blockchain company, holding the premier decentralized digital asset aligns its financial strategy with its technological focus. Long-Term Vision: The company likely sees Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a foundational element of the future digital economy. This move positions The Blockchain Group alongside a select but growing number of publicly traded companies that have allocated a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin, becoming players in the burgeoning Institutional crypto space. The Growing Trend of Institutional Crypto and Bitcoin Adoption The Blockchain Group is not the first, and likely won’t be the last, company to explore significant Crypto investment and specifically, Bitcoin adoption for its treasury. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, is perhaps the most well-known example, having amassed a substantial amount of BTC on its balance sheet over the past few years. Other companies, ranging from technology firms to financial services providers, have also made smaller allocations or explored holding crypto for various purposes. This trend signifies a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly being considered as legitimate components of corporate financial planning, moving beyond just speculative trading. The rationale often cited by pioneers in this space includes the potential long-term value of Bitcoin, its decentralized nature, and its fixed supply as protection against inflationary pressures that could erode the value of traditional cash holdings. Benefits and Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Embarking on a Bitcoin treasury strategy is a high-stakes decision with potential rewards and significant challenges. Potential Benefits: Upside Potential: If Bitcoin’s value increases, the company’s balance sheet strengthens significantly. Inflation Hedge: Provides potential protection against currency devaluation. Innovation Signal: Positions the company as forward-thinking and technologically advanced. Attracting Talent/Investors: May appeal to employees and investors interested in the crypto space. Key Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, potentially leading to significant paper losses (or gains). Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Accounting and Tax Complexity: Accounting for and taxing crypto holdings can be complex and vary by region. Public Perception: Some stakeholders may view the strategy as too risky or speculative. For The Blockchain Group, navigating these challenges will be critical to the success of their newly funded strategy. What Does This Mean for The Blockchain Group and the Market? For The Blockchain Group itself, this capital raise and strategic shift represent a significant commitment. The $7.7 million raised provides the initial capital infusion needed to begin acquiring Bitcoin for their treasury. It signals confidence from investors (via the ATM program) and their partner TOBAM in the company’s vision and the potential of this strategy. For the broader market, this is another data point indicating the continued interest in Institutional crypto adoption. While $7.7 million is not on the scale of MicroStrategy’s multi-billion dollar holdings, it shows that the trend isn’t limited to just a few large players. It suggests that even medium-sized firms, particularly those already in the tech or blockchain sector, are seriously considering or actively implementing Bitcoin adoption strategies. This kind of move can potentially influence other companies, making the idea of holding Bitcoin less novel and more mainstream over time. It contributes to the overall narrative of Bitcoin transitioning from a purely retail or speculative asset to one with potential use cases in corporate finance. Actionable Insights for the Reader If you’re watching this space, here are a few takeaways: Monitor Corporate Moves: Keep an eye on announcements from publicly traded companies regarding their treasury strategies. Increased Bitcoin adoption by corporations can be a significant demand driver. Understand the ‘Why’: Look beyond the headline number. Understand the company’s rationale for a Bitcoin treasury strategy – does it align with their core business? Assess the Risks: Remember that corporate holdings introduce a new layer of market dynamics. Large purchases or sales by companies can impact Bitcoin’s price volatility. Regulatory Watch: Pay attention to how regulators in different countries address corporate crypto holdings, as this will influence future adoption. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Bitcoin Treasury Space The Blockchain Group’s successful $7.7 million capital raise via an ATM program, specifically earmarked for a Bitcoin treasury strategy , is a significant development. It highlights the increasing willingness of companies, particularly within the blockchain sector, to explore innovative ways to manage their corporate reserves using digital assets. While challenges related to volatility and regulation persist, this move by the French firm, supported by asset manager TOBAM, underscores the growing legitimacy and strategic appeal of Crypto investment and Institutional crypto adoption. It’s another step forward in the integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial world, demonstrating a tangible commitment to the potential long-term value of decentralized assets.

2025-06-17T10:27:21,"Whales Move Big: Binance Sees 4,500 BTC Withdrawn and $400M Stablecoin Inflows","The Bitcoin and broader crypto markets are facing another decline as Middle East tensions rise. This follows President Trump’s abrupt departure from the annual G7 meeting in Canada and a warning aimed at Tehran. Despite this, a shift in market behavior has been detected on Binance, which points to a potential return of bullish sentiment, especially among large investors. Imminent Bitcoin Breakout On June 16, Binance recorded a single-day outflow of nearly 4,500 BTC, which, according to CryptoQuant, is one of the largest such events this month. Historically, such large-scale withdrawals are interpreted as a sign of accumulation, which often preceded upward price movement due to reduced supply pressure on exchanges. At the same time, Binance witnessed two major stablecoin inflows – each exceeding $400 million – on June 13 and June 15. These back-to-back capital movements are among the strongest inflow surges seen in recent months. Large stablecoin deposits are commonly viewed as a precursor to market activity and imply that significant capital is being positioned for potential asset purchases. In this context, the synchronized timing of stablecoin inflows with the large Bitcoin withdrawal points to strategic buy-side readiness among whales or institutional players. The combined behavior creates a notable on-chain pattern: while Bitcoin is being pulled from circulation on exchanges, the influx of stablecoins reflects growing liquidity aimed at entering the market. This divergence between diminishing sell-side pressure and increasing buy-side potential establishes a bullish supply-demand setup. If historical trends hold, this positioning could serve as a catalyst for a fresh price breakout in Bitcoin. The aggressive movement of capital suggests renewed risk appetite and a broader market optimism heading into the second half of June. While on-chain data signals accumulation, derivatives market trends point to rising bearish exposure, which has created conditions ripe for a sharp reversal if sentiment shifts. BTC’s Two Key Pressure-Release Valves Crypto analytics firm, Swissblock, pointed to two potential catalysts that could trigger a sharp move in Bitcoin’s price: a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions and a dovish outcome from Wednesday’s FOMC meeting. The firm noted that the BTC perpetual futures funding rate has turned negative, which means that short sellers are currently paying to maintain their positions. This is an imbalance that indicates bearish overcrowding. This setup raises the risk of a short squeeze if sentiment shifts. According to Swissblock, even a single positive geopolitical headline could cause BTC to rally quickly, targeting bear liquidation zones. Should Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell deliver a dovish message midweek, it would add bullish momentum. With funding deeply negative and short positions piling up, the market appears to be primed for a sharp reversal if either of these pressure-release valves is triggered.

2025-06-17T10:25:47,"XRP News Today: Quantum Biopharma Adds 100K XRP to Crypto Treasury","The post XRP News Today: Quantum Biopharma Adds 100K XRP to Crypto Treasury appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is making waves again, not just in the charts but also in institutional portfolios. According to lawyer and crypto advocate Bill Morgan, financial data filed with the SEC confirms that Quantum Biopharma has added 100,000 XRP to its crypto treasury earlier this year. The firm already holds Bitcoin, Solana, and Dogecoin, and this move further reinforces the growing trend of diversified institutional crypto adoption . Financial information lodged with the SEC yesterday shows that Quantum Biopharma earlier this year added 100,000 XRP to its crypto holdings. It continued to hold and add to its other holdings (Bitcoin, Solana and Dogecoin). Bitcoin Maxis do not believe in diversified crypto… pic.twitter.com/41thBZQX2U — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 17, 2025 Challenging Bitcoin Maxis with Real Capital Morgan, on a serious note, took a subtle jab at Bitcoin maximalists. He pointed out that institutions like Quantum are putting their money where their analysis is, unlike maxis, who often ridicule other assets without offering real financial justification. By spreading their investments across multiple blockchains , Quantum is embracing a multi-chain future, and XRP seems to be a central piece of that strategy. XRP Price and Derivatives Market Heat Up In the meantime, the current sentiment for XRP remains mixed. In the last 24 hours, XRP surged nearly 7% to $2.31, riding on a wave of bullish momentum in the broader market. Supporting this upswing, Coinglass reported a 3% rise in XRP open interest, reaching $4.03 billion, which is a sign of intensified capital inflows. The OI-weighted funding rate climbed to 0.0096%, indicating growing leveraged long positions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why the XRP Lawsuit Is Stalled Until August 15? , However, the data isn’t entirely bullish. Long liquidations hit $9.27 million in the past 24 hours, slightly outweighing short liquidations at $6.46 million. Yet, the long/short ratio remains balanced at 0.996, showing only a minor tilt against bullish positions. XRP Faces Key Resistance Technically, XRP is trying to recover past dynamic resistance levels. Though yesterday’s 3.35% bounce brought it closer to breaking above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs near $2.24. A clean close above these levels could fuel a rally toward the $2.33 trendline, which has been acting as resistance since January. The MACD indicator flashes a buy signal with growing green histogram bars, but the RSI at 49 suggests a lack of strong momentum. XRP may be at a peak point. All eyes are on whether institutional demand can drive the breakout. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-17T10:15:36,"Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: $124K to $179K Surge Ahead — Qubetics Presale Raises $18M Before Final Listing","The crypto market is entering a critical phase in 2025. With Bitcoin maintaining its position as the leading digital asset and alternative investment vehicle, analysts and market participants are focusing closely on its expected trajectory for the remainder of the year. The Bitcoin price prediction 2025 continues to draw attention across institutional, retail, and decentralized finance sectors, as each month presents its own set of opportunities and risks. In parallel, notable developments in the altcoin space—particularly the final presale stage of Qubetics ($TICS)—are offering a distinct investment opportunity. With limited time remaining before Qubetics lists publicly, market watchers are closely monitoring both Bitcoin’s next move and the potential upside of this emerging project. This article provides a structured analysis of Bitcoin’s forecast from June through December 2025, while also outlining the essential details of the Qubetics presale, a standout event within the broader crypto world. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Month-by-Month Outlook June 2025: A Bullish Start to the Second Half Bitcoin’s projected price for June 2025 suggests a continued upward trend. The forecasted average price is $124,565, following a 3.71% monthly increase. Analysts estimate the trading range for this month to lie between $108,189 and $139,257. Such a range indicates ongoing volatility, yet the mid-point suggests a strong positive sentiment. If the market follows this trajectory, the potential return on investment is estimated at 30.26%. June is therefore considered a strong month for Bitcoin accumulation, particularly for those seeking medium-term returns based on broader economic and technological adoption trends. July 2025: Sustained Growth with Greater Upside Momentum is expected to continue into July. The Bitcoin price prediction 2025 for this month places the average price at $125,975, with a predicted range of $112,531 to $159,018. The sentiment remains largely bullish, supported by heightened institutional inflows and greater regulatory clarity in key financial jurisdictions. The potential ROI stands at approximately 48.75%, making July one of the more optimistic periods in this year’s outlook. Market observers view this as a continuation of the earlier uptrend, reinforced by liquidity inflows and potential ETF activity. August 2025: Probable Peak Before Correction August could mark a significant peak for Bitcoin in 2025. The forecast suggests an average price of $158,736, with a lower boundary of $144,023 and a possible high of $179,470. If Bitcoin reaches these levels, the estimated return from current prices could rise as high as 67.88%. Market catalysts likely to drive such performance include increased adoption of blockchain infrastructure in corporate settings, global currency devaluation concerns, and expanding use cases for Bitcoin as a store of value. If momentum holds through August, the coin could challenge previously established resistance levels, potentially setting new yearly highs. September 2025: Market Stabilization After Surge Following August’s predicted peak, September appears to present a period of stabilization. The average price forecast is $128,385, with the trading range estimated between $119,989 and $143,716. The Bitcoin price prediction 2025 still reflects a positive sentiment, albeit more cautious compared to the summer’s bullish tone. A potential ROI of 34.43% remains favorable, especially for long-term holders. This phase may offer a strategic point for re-entry or portfolio adjustment following the anticipated price highs in August. October 2025: A Short-Term Decline Within Broader Strength October’s outlook signals a minor decline, with the average price projected at $122,016. The expected trading band is narrower, between $120,884 and $122,988. Compared to September, this represents a dip of approximately 4.96%. Despite the short-term decrease, the potential ROI still stands at 15.04% over current values. For those monitoring the Bitcoin price prediction 2025, this month may reflect a consolidation phase where the market resets before the final year-end push. November 2025: Stability and Recovery Indications Bitcoin is expected to regain stability in November. Forecasts place the average price at $119,600, with estimates ranging between $116,682 and $123,849. This period could act as a stabilizing bridge between October’s dip and December’s closing performance. Analysts expect a potential gain of 15.85%, aligning with historical patterns where November has often shown signs of recovery after early Q4 corrections. Strategic buyers may interpret this month as a signal of regained strength ahead of new developments in 2026. December 2025: A Confident Close to the Year The final month of the year offers a moderate but positive outlook. December’s Bitcoin price prediction 2025 stands at an average price of $116,373, with projected movement between $115,880 and $116,720. This suggests an approximate 8.86% gain from current levels. With a projected ROI of 9.18%, December reflects steady performance and closes the year on a reassuring note. While not as explosive as earlier months, this stability reinforces confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term asset. Qubetics Presale: Final Stage Before Listing Alongside Bitcoin’s monthly progression, the final stage of the Qubetics crypto presale presents a significant opportunity in the altcoin space. Currently in Stage 37, the last phase of its public sale, Qubetics offers its $TICS token at a fixed price of $0.3370. Over $18 million has already been raised, and more than 515 million tokens have been sold to a growing base of 28,000+ holders. The token supply has recently undergone a major overhaul, reducing from over 4 billion tokens to a scarce 1.36 billion. This strategic change has increased the protocol’s scarcity and potential long-term value. Furthermore, Qubetics has allocated 38.55% of the total supply to public sale, signaling a commitment to decentralization and community control. With only 10 million tokens left in this presale stage, the listing price is confirmed at $0.40, guaranteeing an immediate 20% return upon launch. Market analysts are forecasting a substantial post-listing rally, driven by limited supply, surging demand, and a tokenomics structure that empowers its holders. Projections from early-stage buyers place the future value of $TICS between $5 and $10 in the upcoming market cycle. Based on these estimates, a $1,000 investment today could potentially yield between $15,000 and $30,000 in returns. This presale phase is considered the final entry point before wider exchange access and potential price discovery. For those seeking exposure to emerging Web3 infrastructure projects with real scarcity mechanisms and community governance models, Qubetics stands out as a notable candidate. Final Word The Bitcoin price prediction 2025 outlines a clear pattern: strong growth mid-year, minor corrections in early Q4, and a steady conclusion to the calendar year. June through August presents the most optimistic outlook, with forecasts projecting high double-digit returns. September and October introduce normalization, while November and December reinforce Bitcoin’s long-term resilience. At the same time, the closing opportunity in the Qubetics presale adds a compelling dimension to the 2025 crypto world. With limited supply remaining, a pre-determined listing price, and a newly optimized token structure, Qubetics represents an opportunity aligned with broader market trends emphasizing decentralization and utility-driven token economics.

2025-06-17T09:52:29,"Is Eric Trump Involved in Tron’s $210M Nasdaq Deal?","The post Is Eric Trump Involved in Tron’s $210M Nasdaq Deal? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto world is buzzing over Tron’s plan to go public but it’s Eric Trump’s recent comment that’s grabbing attention. Even though he holds an advisory role at the firm managing the deal, Trump says he has no public involvement . Still, his post on X calling Tron founder Justin Sun a “great friend” and a “crypto icon” has raised eyebrows. So, what’s really going on between Tron, the Trumps, and their growing role in the crypto space? Tron’s Big Nasdaq Move Instead of going the traditional IPO route, Tron is set to go public through a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, a little-known company based in Florida. SRM recently secured a $100 million investment from an undisclosed backer and plans to rebrand as “Tron.” The company will also start building a crypto treasury by accumulating TRX tokens. Leading the deal is Dominari Securities, a Trump-affiliated firm based in Trump Tower. It’s handling a $210 million stock offering tied to the merger. Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. joined Dominari’s advisory board earlier this year. Justin Sun and the Trump Connection Tron founder Justin Sun has been showing up more and more in Trump’s world. He attended the private launch party for Donald Trump’s meme coin, bought a $75 million stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and is now the biggest holder of the $TRUMP token. At a Trump-hosted dinner for the top 220 $TRUMP holders, Sun was gifted a luxury Trump Golden Tourbillon watch. It’s another sign of his growing closeness to the Trump circle. Soon after Sun’s WLFI investment, the U.S. SEC quietly paused its long-running investigation into him and his companies. The probe was focused on possible market manipulation and unregistered securities. Whether that timing is coincidental or not is still up for debate. Donald Trump’s Crypto Cash Flow Donald Trump’s involvement in crypto is growing fast. In 2024, he made $58 million from crypto-related deals – mostly through WLFI token sales. That figure was second only to his hospitality income. And there’s more coming. In 2025, he’s expected to make another $390 million from token sales and gains from his meme coin, which launched earlier this year. Trump is also involved in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs. The SEC recently approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury plan, which includes 85 million shares – 29 million of them tied to convertible notes. Eric Trump Says “No Public Role” But Questions Remain Eric Trump’s statement distancing himself from the Tron deal hasn’t stopped the speculation. His role at Dominari, paired with the family’s expanding crypto activity, makes many wonder what’s really happening behind the scenes. With Tron’s public listing on the way and the Trumps playing a bigger role in the space, there’s no doubt this story is far from over. As crypto keeps gaining ground, the Trump-Tron connection is one to watch and it may be shaping the future of crypto and politics more than anyone expected.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-eric-trump-involved-in-trons-210m-nasdaq-deal/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE","News",cryptocompare

In a recent post , DWF Labs CEO and Head of FalconStable, Andrei Grachev announced that the USD-backed stablecoin has been fully integrated into the Kaia ( KAIA ) Chain. The partnership enables the synthetic stablecoin to be embedded into the LINE messenger ecosystem through Kaia. “Together, we bring sustainable and innovative stablecoin yield solutions for more than 250 Millions of Line users BUIDL!” said Grachev in his recent post. By integrating USDf into Kaia Chain, LINE users will be able to access the stablecoin and earn passive yield from its staked product, sUSDf. Falcon Stable is a stablecoin venture established by DWF Labs’ Falcon Financial. Falcon Stable is the DWF Labs’ synthetic stablecoin protocol that enables users to mint a yield-bearing U.S. dollar‑pegged token called USDf. Unlike most stablecoins, Falcon’s USDf allows users to deposit various digital assets, such as other stablecoins like USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ), major tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and ETH ( ETH ) and even tokenized real-world assets into the protocol. These different assets are then used as collateral to mint USDf. You might also like: Societe Generale-FORGE to launch new USD CoinVertible stablecoin on Ethereum and Solana The stablecoin also offers yield for holders who stake minted USDf. Minted USDf can be staked to receive sUSDf, an interest-bearing version that accrues yield with an APY that has surpassed 22%. At press time, the stablecoin has accumulated a market cap of nearly $560 million and a 24 hour trading volume of more than $1.7 million. Kaia Chain serves as the main web3 infrastructure for the messaging platform, LINE. Kaia powers the Mini Dapp and Dapp Portal within LINE’s messaging app, allowing users to seamlessly access and interact with decentralized applications without the need for web3 onboarding. LINE is a messaging platform popular among East Asians, with a user base of more than 250 million people registered. Back in August last year, LINE began diving into web3 with the integration of mini dApps powered by Kaia blockchain. The Kaia DLT Foundation is an independent body born from the merger of two prominent blockchain projects, from LINE and South Korean tech giant Kakao. The blockchain combines Line’s Finschia blockchain and Kakao’s Klaytn blockchain.

2025-06-17T09:39:43,"Best crypto to buy now as Truth Social files for Bitcoin-Ether ETF","Bitcoin (BTC) edged higher above $107,000 on Tuesday, building on Monday’s 1.14% gain. The cryptocurrency briefly touched a 24-hour high of $108,952 before pulling back to $106,000. Market sentiment improved following comments from French President Emmanuel Macron , who said that US President Donald Trump had received an offer—delivered through intermediaries—intended to secure a ceasefire and resume broader negotiations between the warring parties. “There is indeed an offer to meet and exchange. An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to kickstart broader discussions,” Macron told reporters that the development was a potentially positive step in resolving the Iran-Israel conflict. The broader market rebound is also benefiting early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe , which has continued to draw steady investor interest since its presale launch in February. Over the weekend, the project recorded more than $250,000 in new inflows, underscoring sustained momentum as traders seek high-upside opportunities amid improving sentiment. Trump’s Truth Social files for Bitcoin-Ether ETF Truth Social, the social media platform operated by Trump Media & Technology Group, has filed to launch an exchange-traded fund tracking the prices of both bitcoin and ether. According to a Form S-1 filed Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the proposed “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, B.T.” will allocate approximately 75% of its assets to bitcoin, with the remaining portion invested in ether. The ratio may be adjusted at the discretion of the sponsor, Yorkville America Digital LLC, with any changes to be disclosed via prospectus supplements, SEC filings, or updates on the fund’s website. Foris DAX Trust Co. LLC is listed as the custodian, as in the platform’s earlier filing for a single-asset bitcoin ETF submitted on June 5. Truth Social is the third issuer to seek approval for a dual-spot crypto ETF, following similar filings by Bitwise and Hashdex. Other firms, including Volatility Shares and ProShares, have filed for bitcoin-ether ETFs as well, but tied to futures markets rather than spot prices. Bitcoin Pepe continues its forward march Bitcoin’s resilience amid macroeconomic uncertainty is lifting broader crypto market sentiment, rekindling speculative appetite across digital assets. Historically, such periods have often preceded market-wide rallies, especially in high-volatility segments like meme coins. Investors are once again rotating into riskier bets, with meme tokens among the early beneficiaries. One project gaining momentum is Bitcoin Pepe, which merges viral internet culture with a Layer 2 infrastructure play. Bitcoin Pepe is attempting to “build Solana on Bitcoin.” The project seeks to pair Bitcoin’s base-layer security with Solana-style scalability, distinguishing it from meme tokens that rely purely on hype. Unlike most of its peers, Bitcoin Pepe is underpinned by a technical roadmap and infrastructure-first narrative. That positioning appears to be resonating: the project has raised more than $14.6 million in its ongoing presale, with a listing announcement due today. As capital continues to rotate into early-stage, high-upside opportunities, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself to capitalise on renewed risk-taking in the final days of its token sale.

2025-06-17T09:38:00,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as another firm raises funds to buy BTC","Bitcoin edged higher on Tuesday even as broader cryptocurrency markets posted a mixed performance and global financial markets paused amid the continuing conflict between Israel and Iran . Both stocks and digital assets fell sharply on Friday following renewed Israeli strikes but began to stabilize on Monday. By early Tuesday, however, momentum had stalled . US index futures slipped, and cryptocurrency price action turned mixed over the previous 24 hours. Digital assets often mirror high-risk technology stocks—rising with investor optimism and reversing course when sentiment weakens. Geopolitical shocks typically trigger knee-jerk sell-offs, but markets tend to stabilize as traders reassess the broader implications. Amid this volatile backdrop, early-stage project Bitcoin Pepe has continued to see strong presale inflows. Since launching in February, the project has maintained steady investor interest, positioning itself as a notable outlier in an otherwise cooling meme coin segment. Firms continue to load up BTC The Blockchain Group has raised €7.2 million (approximately $7.7 million) to advance its ambition of becoming Europe’s leading Bitcoin Treasury company. In a press release dated June 17, the Paris-listed firm said the capital was secured via an “At-The-Market type” raise with asset manager TOBAM. The offering involved the issuance of 1.6 million new shares at an average price of €4.49, reflecting a 20.76% discount to the stock’s June 13 close amid market volatility.

The Blockchain Group aims to emulate firms such as US-based Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet, which have adopted similar Bitcoin-forward capital allocation models. It plans to hold up to 260,000 BTC—currently valued at about $24 billion—by 2033, positioning itself as a pioneer of corporate Bitcoin adoption in Europe. Bitcoin Pepe: listing announcement scheduled for today Even amid a volatile market, the accelerating embrace of Bitcoin and digital assets by traditional finance has helped lift sentiment across the broader crypto ecosystem. In this risk-on climate, investors in search of outsized returns are rotating back into speculative plays—meme coins among the first to benefit. Among them, Bitcoin Pepe has emerged as one of 2025’s most closely tracked presales. The project distinguishes itself with the ambition to “build Solana on Bitcoin,” aiming to merge the Bitcoin network’s security with Solana-style scalability. The project’s PEP-20 token standard allows permissionless minting and trading on the Bitcoin network. Unlike meme tokens that rely purely on hype, Bitcoin Pepe is anchored by a defined technical roadmap and infrastructure-led narrative. The project has raised over $14.6 million in presale funding ahead of a planned listing announcement today, underscoring continued investor interest. As speculative capital flows back into early-stage assets, Bitcoin Pepe is well-positioned to harness the momentum in the final stretch of its token sale.

2025-06-17T09:30:09,"On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge","As Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market show tentative signs of recovery following the most recent correction, a crypto analyst has made a bold statement suggesting that the market may have already reached its peak. BladeDeFi, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), warned followers that a significant downturn could be on the horizon, predicting a challenging summer ahead for the crypto space. Crypto Pump Or Trap? In his post, BladeDeFi emphasized that “crypto has already PEAKED” and forecasted a potential slump where alternative cryptocurrencies could see declines of up to 95%. He indicated that most indicators are flashing red, suggesting that the market is on the brink of a significant downturn. According to him, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high early in the current cycle and is now trapped in a “slow-motion downtrend,” with each subsequent bounce becoming weaker than the last. Related Reading: Bitcoin Gold Rush 2.0? Treasuries Swell With 60 New Players The analyst pointed out a concerning trend: retail investors are becoming exhausted, while larger institutional players have begun to exit the market. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and MicroStrategy are reportedly rotating their investments and hedging their positions, often without making their actions overtly public. The analyst suggests that this shift leaves retail investors vulnerable, potentially left holding depreciating assets as liquidity in the market continues to dwindle. BladeDeFi also criticized the current market dynamics, warning that sudden price increases or “green candles” are often deceptive, serving only to entice late buyers into traps that lead to further losses. He noted that without new capital inflows—such as fresh stimulus or significant investment—the recent price pumps lack sustainability. The absence of liquidity means that any upward movements are likely to be fleeting, and the overall trend remains downward. Bitcoin Poised For Year-End Peak? Adding to the bearish sentiment, another analyst, Peppeso, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the top of the 2025 bull market has already been established. Peppeso observed historical patterns in previous market cycles, noting that while bull markets have become longer, bear markets have shortened and softened in their impact. Despite this, Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs in the final months of each cycle, reinforcing Peppeso’s expectation of a peak around November or December 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance The current market environment is further complicated by macroeconomic factors, including rising interest rates and increasing geopolitical risks. With uncertainty clouding the outlook, many investors are adopting a risk-off approach, leading to a sustained downtrend in the crypto market. Even popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant declines of 9% and 7% in the past week alone respectively, indicating that the hype surrounding these assets is fading.

2025-06-17T09:30:07,"Ethereum ETF: US Spot ETH ETFs See Promising $21.4M Inflows Start","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF: US Spot ETH ETFs See Promising $21.4M Inflows Start The anticipation surrounding the launch of US Spot ETH ETFs has been palpable in the crypto market. While trading hasn’t officially begun for all, the underlying funds are starting to see movement. Recent data reveals a notable development: US Spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded a net inflow of $21.4 million on June 16. This marks an important early indicator of investor interest in these newly approved investment vehicles. What Exactly Are US Spot ETH ETFs and Why Do These Inflows Matter? Before diving deeper into the numbers, let’s quickly recap what a US Spot ETH ETF is. It’s an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of ETH futures contracts, a spot ETF aims to track the direct market price of Ethereum by holding the asset itself. This structure is generally preferred by investors seeking direct exposure to the asset’s price movements without the complexities of holding the cryptocurrency directly. The approval of US Spot ETH ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year was a landmark moment for the crypto industry. It followed the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which saw billions in inflows and significantly boosted Bitcoin’s price and mainstream acceptance. The approval of Ethereum ETFs signals growing regulatory comfort and institutional acceptance of major cryptocurrencies as legitimate asset classes for traditional investment products. Therefore, any recorded inflows into these funds, even before they are fully trading on exchanges (pending S-1 form approvals), are highly significant. They represent the first tangible signs of capital entering these specific investment products, indicating that investors and institutions are beginning to allocate funds towards Ethereum through this regulated and accessible pathway. Breaking Down the Initial ETH ETF Inflows: Who is Leading? According to data compiled by Farside Investors, the $21.4 million net inflow on June 16 was concentrated in just two of the approved funds. Here’s the breakdown: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund, managed by the world’s largest asset manager, led the pack with a substantial $16.1 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FETH: Another major financial player, Fidelity, saw its Ethereum ETF attract $5.3 million in net inflows. Other Funds: The remaining US Spot ETH ETFs tracked by Farside Investors reported no change in their holdings for that specific day. This initial data highlights the immediate impact and reach of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. Their existing client bases, brand recognition, and distribution networks likely play a significant role in attracting early capital into their respective Ethereum ETF offerings. While $21.4 million is a modest start compared to the massive inflows seen during the initial days of the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, it’s important contextually. The S-1 registration statements, which allow these ETFs to officially begin trading, are still pending final approval for most issuers. These early inflows could represent seed funding or initial strategic allocations ahead of the official launch. How Do These Early ETH ETF Inflows Compare to the Bitcoin Experience? It’s natural to compare the initial performance of US Spot ETH ETF inflows to that of their Bitcoin counterparts. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw billions of dollars in inflows within their first few days of trading in January 2024. While the $21.4 million figure for Ethereum ETFs on June 16 is significantly smaller, it’s crucial to remember that this data point represents activity *before* full trading commencement for all funds. The Bitcoin ETFs had their S-1s approved concurrently with the 19b-4 rule change, allowing them to trade almost immediately after the SEC’s decision. The Ethereum ETF process has been slightly different, with 19b-4 approval granted first, followed by the ongoing S-1 approval process for individual issuers. Therefore, a direct day-one comparison isn’t entirely fair. The true test for ETH ETF inflows will come once all major funds receive their S-1 approvals and begin trading on exchanges. However, these early numbers, particularly the interest shown in the BlackRock ETH ETF and Fidelity ETH ETF , suggest that there is indeed appetite among investors for this new product. What Could These Initial Flows Signal for the Future of Ethereum? While it’s too early to make definitive predictions based on a single day’s data, these initial ETH ETF inflows are generally viewed as a positive sign for Ethereum. Here’s why: Growing Institutional Interest: The participation of major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, and the capital they are attracting, underscores increasing institutional comfort and interest in gaining exposure to Ethereum. Increased Accessibility: Once fully operational, these ETFs will make investing in Ethereum significantly easier for traditional investors who are uncomfortable with or unable to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges and private key management. This expanded access could bring new capital into the ETH market. Potential Price Support: As ETFs accumulate ETH to back their shares, this creates buying pressure on the underlying asset. While the initial $21.4 million is small relative to Ethereum’s market cap, sustained inflows over time could provide significant price support. Market Legitimacy: The existence of regulated ETF products for Ethereum further solidifies its position as a recognized and legitimate asset class within the traditional financial system. Navigating the Path Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the launch of Ethereum ETF products presents significant opportunities, there are also potential challenges to consider: Opportunities: Massive Capital Influx: If ETH ETFs mirror the success of Bitcoin ETFs, they could unlock significant capital from retail and institutional investors who were previously unable or unwilling to invest directly in crypto. Enhanced Liquidity: Increased trading activity around the ETFs could indirectly improve liquidity in the underlying ETH market. Innovation in Financial Products: The success of spot crypto ETFs could pave the way for other regulated products based on digital assets. Challenges: Market Volatility: While ETFs offer a regulated wrapper, they still track a highly volatile asset. Investors must be prepared for significant price swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although the ETFs are approved, the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US remains complex and subject to change. Competition: The market is competitive, with multiple issuers vying for investor assets. Performance and fees will be key differentiators. Staking Exclusion: Importantly, the current US spot ETH ETFs are approved without a staking component, meaning investors in these funds will not earn staking rewards, which is a significant feature of holding native ETH. Actionable Insights for Those Watching US Spot ETH ETFs For investors and market observers, here are a few key takeaways: Monitor S-1 Approvals: Keep a close eye on the SEC’s approval timeline for the remaining S-1 registration statements. This will be the green light for full trading commencement. Track Inflow Data Post-Launch: Once trading begins, daily inflow/outflow data will provide a clearer picture of investor demand compared to these early seed figures. Observe Market Reaction: See how the price of Ethereum reacts as these ETFs go live and accumulate assets. Compare Performance: If considering investment (not financial advice), compare the fees, structure, and performance of different ETF offerings. Remember, investing in cryptocurrencies and related products carries significant risk. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The Broader Significance Beyond Just the ETF It’s also worth remembering that the Ethereum ETF is just one part of the larger Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum is a foundational layer for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and numerous other decentralized applications. Its ongoing technical upgrades, such as the transition to Proof-of-Stake and future scaling solutions, are critical drivers of its long-term value proposition, independent of the ETF wrapper. The ETF provides a new gateway for traditional capital, but the underlying technology and network development remain paramount. Concluding Thoughts: A Promising Start for a New Era The reported $21.4 million in net inflows on June 16 for US Spot ETH ETFs represents a modest but symbolically significant step forward. It confirms early interest from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity and signals the impending arrival of these highly anticipated investment products to the broader market. While the true impact will unfold once full trading commences, this initial activity sets a positive tone for the potential integration of Ethereum into traditional investment portfolios. The journey of US spot ETH ETFs is just beginning, and market participants will be keenly watching to see if the early promise translates into sustained growth and adoption.

2025-06-17T09:30:00,"CoreWeave eyes new highs and outgrows meme stock label","CoreWeave is closing in on its all-time peak above $160, suggesting its rally goes beyond being a meme stock. The rise of CRWV coincides with a positive month for miner stocks that pivoted to high-density computing for AI. CoreWeave (CRWV) is back to expansion mode, leading to expectations of another rally. The AI computation company, which pivoted early from Ethereum mining, was one of the biggest winners during the LLM expansion stage. CRWV showed strong bullish momentum in the past month, with periods of trading based on a short squeeze. | Source: Yahoo Finance CRWV climbed to $158.50, on track to repeat previous records above $161. In the last two weeks, the CRWV rally raised suspicions that the stock was boosted by meme traders . However, the company has tapped demand for high-density computation for AI, and got a boost from Nvidia (NVDA). The stock moves on a mix of two major factors—trading based on a potential short squeeze, and general bullish momentum for all AI stocks. CoreWeave goes through another record borrowing period While CRWV is watched for its fundamental potential, in the short term, the price rally coincides with record costs to borrow shares, signaling a short squeeze. During the recent price climb to near-peak prices, CRWV borrowing rates also reached new records. As of June 12, the rate increased to 343.1%, then turned down to around 197%, with 200K CRWV shares available to borrow. CRWV borrowing rates increased to a record, suggesting a short squeeze is a partial factor for the stock’s rally. | Source: CompaniesMarketcap The short interest on CRWV moved within a wide range in the past few days, from 32% to as much as 45%. On social media, messages of short interest of up to 65% of the free float also appeared, boosting the FOMO for trading CRWV. Short interest is not a guaranteed trend, and can shift on a daily basis. However, CRWV can still trade under conditions similar to a short squeeze, at least in the short term. The shares are closely watched for their month-long bullish trend, which may lead to sharp increases in borrowing costs for covering short positions. In June, shares available to borrow increased, potentially easing the borrowing situation, though at a high price. On June 8, only 25K shares were available to borrow, increasing to over 250K at the new record borrowing rates. CoreWeave brings attention to mining companies The success of CoreWeave and demand for computation is boosting the shares of other mining companies. Core Scientific (CORZ) rose by over 12% in the past month. The company may have an ongoing boost from its 12-year deal with CoreWeave, with $4.7B earmarked for data center investments. Core Scientific is also building some of the CoreWeave data centers in Texas, with a goal of tapping 200MW in energy for data centers. The shares are up by 100% since the lows in April and May. The company mixes ongoing BTC mining with a treasury of 977 BTC, while also making forays into computation services. Other companies like CleanSpark and Riot Platforms are still trying to push off their recent lows, with more gradual gains. TeraWulf (WULF) had a more dramatic rally, rising from around $3.50 in early June to over $4.33. The company has previously benefitted from its pivot to AI data centers. It also extends the trend of seeking out renewable electricity resources to create sustainable data centers.

2025-06-17T09:20:02,"Bitcoin Giant MARA Holdings Makes Shocking $84M Deposit to Binance","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Giant MARA Holdings Makes Shocking $84M Deposit to Binance News broke recently about a substantial Bitcoin movement: a wallet address suspected of belonging to leading crypto miner MARA Holdings (formerly Marathon Digital) deposited a significant amount of BTC into the Binance exchange. This MARA Holdings BTC deposit has naturally sparked interest and speculation within the crypto community, raising questions about the company’s strategy and potential market implications. Understanding the Recent MARA Holdings BTC Deposit Let’s break down the details of this significant transaction. According to data shared by on-chain analytics platform The Data Nerd via X, citing Arkham data, 790 Bitcoin (BTC) valued at approximately $84.64 million was moved to Binance just hours ago. This isn’t a small sum, even for a major player like MARA Holdings. For context, MARA Holdings currently holds a substantial treasury of 12,786 BTC, valued at roughly $1.37 billion based on recent market prices. This deposit represents a notable fraction of their total Bitcoin holdings, prompting observers to question the strategic intent behind the move to Binance. Why Would a Crypto Miner Deposit Bitcoin on Binance? When a large crypto miner like MARA Holdings moves a significant amount of Bitcoin to an exchange like Binance, it typically signals an intention to sell or use the funds for operational purposes. Miners accumulate Bitcoin through their mining activities, and periodically liquidating some of their holdings is a necessary part of their business model. Here are some common reasons behind such a substantial BTC deposit: Covering Operational Costs: Mining operations require significant capital for electricity, hardware maintenance, facility management, and staffing. Selling accumulated Bitcoin is a primary method for MARA Holdings to cover these ongoing expenses. Funding Capital Expenditures: To remain competitive, crypto miner companies often need to invest in new, more efficient mining hardware or expand their infrastructure. A large BTC deposit can provide the necessary funds for these capital-intensive projects. Treasury Management: Companies like MARA Holdings actively manage their balance sheets. Selling Bitcoin might be part of a broader treasury strategy, such as diversifying assets, securing profits, or increasing cash reserves for financial flexibility and risk management. Market Timing: If the company’s management believes the current market price for Bitcoin is favorable, they might choose to sell a portion of their holdings to realize profits and strengthen their financial position. Debt Servicing: Some mining companies utilize debt financing for operations or expansion. Liquidating BTC holdings can be necessary to make scheduled loan repayments or manage debt obligations. Understanding these potential motivations helps shed light on why MARA Holdings might choose to make such a large BTC deposit on a major exchange like Binance. Potential Market Impact and MARA Holdings Strategy While 790 BTC is a substantial amount in absolute terms ($84.64 million), it’s important to consider it relative to the overall Bitcoin market and Binance’s immense daily trading volume, which often runs into billions of dollars. A single deposit of this size is unlikely to cause a massive, immediate price crash on its own due to the market’s depth and liquidity on Binance. However, it does add potential selling pressure to the market, which traders monitor closely. More importantly, the MARA Holdings BTC deposit provides insight into the company’s strategic decisions. It suggests they are actively managing their Bitcoin treasury and potentially preparing for significant expenditures or aiming to capitalize on current market conditions. This move could be interpreted by investors as a signal regarding the company’s financial health, operational needs, or outlook on the Bitcoin market. Analyzing the Effect on Bitcoin Price and Market Sentiment The immediate effect on the Bitcoin price from this specific MARA Holdings deposit might be minimal due to the scale of the broader market. However, large miner movements to exchanges are closely watched indicators within the crypto community. If other major crypto miner entities also begin depositing significant amounts of Bitcoin onto exchanges simultaneously, it could collectively signal a bearish sentiment among large holders, potentially impacting market psychology and price trends. For Bitcoin, the continuous flow of newly mined coins onto exchanges represents a constant supply pressure, which is typically balanced by demand from retail buyers, institutional investors, and long-term holders who prefer to accumulate and hold BTC off exchanges. This MARA Holdings move is just one piece of that larger, dynamic supply-demand puzzle that influences Bitcoin price movements. Conclusion: What Does the MARA Holdings BTC Deposit Signify? In conclusion, the reported MARA Holdings BTC deposit of 790 BTC ($84.64 million) into Binance highlights the active treasury management strategies employed by major crypto miner companies. While the deposit itself might not drastically alter the Bitcoin price, it serves as a reminder of the operational realities and financial decisions that influence miner behavior and contribute to the dynamic supply side of the Bitcoin market. Keeping an eye on such on-chain movements provides valuable context for understanding the broader market landscape and the strategies of key players like MARA Holdings as they navigate the complexities of the crypto mining industry and the Bitcoin market.

2025-06-17T09:15:51,"‘Bond King’ Jeffrey Gundlach Says US Dollar To Continue Going Down, Sees American Currency Entering Bear Market and Collapsing 25%","Billionaire Jeffrey Gundlach is warning that the US dollar is very close to triggering a collapse amid its sustained weakness this year. In a new video update, the DoubleLine Capital CEO says he’s keeping a close watch on the US dollar index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the USD against a basket of foreign currencies. Gundlach points out that the DXY has been in a macro downtrend, and he expects the US dollar index to melt down if it loses a diagonal trendline that has held as support since 2011. “The dollar has been in a pattern of lower highs going back to 1985 and lower lows, with the exception of 2020, perhaps. But I think the dollar is going to continue to go down. I know I am not alone in this view… If it breaks down, if you can mentally draw a trendline between that low in 2011 (DXY at 72) and the low back in 2021 (DXY at 89), if we break down below that trendline, I think it’s truly a dollar bear market. Should that happen, I would expect it to take out the low on this chart, so down below the level of around 72 or whatever. Now this is surreal.” Source: DoubleLine Capital/YouTube Based on Gundlach’s diagonal trendline, the DXY needs to stay above 97 to avoid a 25% crash toward 72. At time of writing, the DXY is hovering at 98.24. Last week, the billionaire Bond King said that the stock market, the dollar and the Treasury market are not behaving as usual, hinting at deeper concerns that are unsettling investors in US assets. According to Gundlach, foreign investors holding trillions in US assets may begin pulling out of American markets as concerns mount over the government’s unsustainable fiscal path.

2025-06-17T09:12:02,"Bitcoin-Focused Vinanz Triples Fundraising Target With £3.6M Raise to Fuel BTC Strategy","Bitcoin mining company Vinanz has raised £3.58 million from investors, more than triple its initial £1 million target, as it looks to expand its cryptocurrency holdings and mining operations. Key Takeaways: Vinanz raised £3.58 million, triple its goal, to expand Bitcoin mining and treasury holdings. Retail investors led the round with £3 million via WRAP. The company plans to rebrand as the London Bitcoin Company. The London Stock Exchange-listed company said the new funds would be used to purchase more Bitcoin and reinforce its North American mining presence. “This raise reflects growing interest in our LSE-listed Bitcoin strategy and helps accelerate our goal of becoming a leading UK main board-listed Bitcoin company,” said CEO Hewie Rattray. Retail Investors Dominate Vinanz Raise With £3M via WRAP Of the total, £3.03 million was raised through retail investment platform WRAP, with the remaining £550,000 coming from direct institutional subscriptions. Both tranches were priced at 13.75p per share. Vinanz runs mining facilities in the U.S. and Canada and holds Bitcoin as a treasury asset, following a model popularized by U.S.-based firms such as MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, and Riot Platforms. With Bitcoin’s price surging over 75% since April 2024, driven in part by the most recent halving event, investor appetite for exposure to the asset appears to be heating up again. We are very pleased to see so many new retail shareholders coming on to the @VinanzBTC share register after this successful Retail Offer WRAP. Brilliant result £3.6m. We are going to own a lot more #Bitcoin very soon and also gives us horsepower to grow our biz. #BTC . Very… https://t.co/tqpSlWTFo1 — David Lenigas (@DavidLenigas) June 17, 2025 Bitcoin briefly touched $111,000 in May and currently trades near $107,000. Analysts have floated long-term price projections ranging from $200,000 to $1 million. Vinanz’s raise underscores rising interest in regulated, exchange-listed vehicles for Bitcoin exposure, especially in the UK, where few firms are subject to full LSE and FCA oversight. The company is expected to rebrand as the London Bitcoin Company in the near future. The announcement adds to a growing list of firms embracing Bitcoin as a balance sheet hedge or strategic investment. Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. Strategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder , with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

Table of Contents Bitcoin proved crypto could be real Ethereum expanded crypto’s capabilities Neo Pepe Coin: Structured for crypto’s next cycle 5 reasons why early access to Neo Pepe matters Take action now Bitcoin set the stage. Ethereum expanded the horizons. Now, the market eagerly anticipates what’s next. While established tokens continue dominating headlines, real opportunities for new investors often lie in emerging, early-stage, and well-structured alternatives. One standout gaining attention is the Neo Pepe Protocol, currently priced at $0.05423 in Stage 0 of its presale. Already, over $103,000 has been raised toward its initial cap of $121,415.98. When this stage concludes, the price jumps to $0.061461. Neo Pepe’s presale consists of 16 stages, with each phase incrementally increasing the entry price, presenting an optimal scenario for early adopters. But investors must act swiftly, this window won’t stay open indefinitely. Bitcoin proved crypto could be real Before Bitcoin, the concept of digital money was widely dismissed. BTC legitimized cryptocurrency, demonstrating it could function independently from central systems and delivering one of history’s most remarkable ROI curves. However, Bitcoin’s revolutionary status is now well-established. Major funds, banks, and institutions now treat Bitcoin as a stable commodity. Its volatility has reduced significantly, and growth, though steady, lacks the explosiveness early investors enjoyed. For those aiming at rapid 10x returns, Bitcoin’s golden era is mostly past, stable, yes; transformative, no longer. Ethereum expanded crypto’s capabilities Ethereum ( ETH ) radically shifted crypto’s trajectory, moving beyond a mere store of value by introducing smart contracts, decentralized apps, and diverse digital ecosystems. Its innovations paved the way for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and virtually every significant crypto advancement post-2017. Yet, innovation comes at a cost. Ethereum newcomers often grapple with high transaction fees, scaling bottlenecks, and technical complexities. Though ETH remains foundational, it now faces robust competition from faster, cheaper blockchain alternatives. Ethereum laid a foundation, but the future belongs to those who can effectively build upon it or entirely reimagine it. You might also like: TRON amazes fans with features while Neo Pepe gains traction Neo Pepe Coin: Structured for crypto’s next cycle The rise of DeFi and NFTs has amplified Ethereum’s limitations, fueling increased interest in alternative blockchain platforms such as the Neo Pepe Protocol. Neo Pepe introduces a sophisticated on-chain governance system prioritizing transparency and security. To submit proposals, participants must stake at least 1 million NEOP. Each proposal undergoes a meticulously structured process involving a voting delay, a one-week voting period, and a timelock before execution, ensuring every decision is deliberate, transparent, and permanently recorded. Additionally, Neo Pepe Coin offers a fixed token supply of exactly 1 billion NEOP. With no minting capabilities within the token contract, the supply cap is unchangeable, thus eliminating inflation concerns or unauthorized token creation. 5 reasons why early access to Neo Pepe matters Increasing token price: With 16 presale stages, each round progressively increases token costs, rewarding the earliest investors. Structured governance: Transparent and secure voting ensures community-led project evolution. Fixed supply: A permanent 1 billion token cap guarantees scarcity and long-term value. No insider surprises: Neo Pepe Protocol commits to transparency, avoiding hidden unlocks or insider privileges. Classic crypto appeal: Echoes early Bitcoin and Ethereum vibes, providing open access and equal opportunity. Ethereum and Bitcoin began similarly, anyone with determination and basic tools could participate. Today’s landscape, dominated by institutions, has fewer open opportunities. Neo Pepe Protocol brings back that original crypto spirit: transparent governance, clear rules, and an equal-access presale structure.

With Bitcoin and altcoins highly sensitive to macroeconomic signals, all eyes are on the Fed’s next move — and especially Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks. What Time Is the FOMC Announcement? The Federal Reserve will reveal its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday, June 18, 2025 , at 2:00 p.m. ET (11:30 p.m. IST) . The FOMC meeting schedule is as follows: 2:00 PM ET – FOMC Interest Rate Decision 2:00 PM ET – FOMC Statement 2:00 PM ET – FOMC Dot Plot Release 2:30 PM ET (Midnight IST) – Powell’s Press Conference Will the Fed Cut Rates in June? Most traders believe the Fed won’t cut rates this month , with market odds sitting at around 97.5% in favor of no change. With inflation still running hot and ongoing tensions in the Middle East, the Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady in the 4.25% to 4.50% range. While no immediate cuts are on the table, investors will be paying close attention to Powell’s tone for any clues about potential rate cuts later this year. Fed Interest Rate Chart (as of June 2025) The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% during the June 18, 2025 FOMC meeting. The effective federal funds rate has held at 4.33% since January, and the Fed is likely to maintain its current stance. While futures markets suggest about a 60% chance of a rate cut in September, the upcoming meeting is expected to signal patience. Additionally, the Fed’s updated projections may indicate fewer rate cuts for 2025, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainty. Month Fed Funds Rate (%) Jan 2025 4.33 Feb 2025 4.33 Mar 2025 4.33 Apr 2025 4.33 May 2025 4.33 Jun 2025* 4.50 (target range upper) Bitcoin Price Outlook: What Comes Next? The rate decision itself might not surprise anyone, but it’s Powell’s speech that could move markets. If he shows concern about slowing economic growth or even hints at possible rate cuts or a return to quantitative easing (QE), it could spark a broad rally across financial markets. Two potential catalysts for Bitcoin: Geopolitical de-escalation , which could trigger a relief rally and squeeze short positions. A dovish Powell , which could be a bullish spark for Bitcoin, altcoins, and high-beta crypto assets. Currently, Bitcoin’s funding rates are negative, suggesting that bears are over-leveraged. If sentiment flips — especially after Powell’s press conference — That could trigger a short squeeze, fueling a strong surge in the crypto market. What is a FOMC Meeting? The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting is when the Fed’s main policy group sets U.S. monetary policy, including interest rates. Will the Fed cut interest rates at the June 18 meeting? Markets overwhelmingly expect no change — CME FedWatch data puts the odds of a hold at ~99.9%, with just 0.1% chance of a cut What’s the current federal funds rate? he Fed has held target range at 4.25–4.50% since January, with the effective federal funds rate around ~4.33%, and no change expected for June",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/fomc-meeting-today-what-to-expect-from-jerome-powell-speech-and-fed-interest-rate/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T09:00:45,"CoinShares Files for Spot Solana ETF, Proposes Staking Integration","CoinShares has entered the competitive race for spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. The digital asset manager submitted a Form S-1 registration statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marking its intent to list a spot Solana ETF for public trading. The application, submitted via the SEC’s EDGAR system, identifies CoinShares Co. as the sponsor of the fund, with Coinbase Custody and BitGo Trust slated to handle custody of the underlying SOL tokens. CoinShares Eyes Yield Through Staking in Solana ETF Filing A notable component of CoinShares’ proposal involves staking. According to the filing, the fund plans to stake a portion of its SOL holdings through designated providers . Although the initial staking partner has not been disclosed, the document states that staking rewards earned by the fund will be reinvested. The staking arrangement would be finalized ahead of the trust’s formal launch, introducing a yield component to what would otherwise be a passive, price-tracking vehicle . CoinShares joins seven other firms seeking approval for similar products. These include VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, Grayscale Investments, and Fidelity Investments. All applicants aim to launch funds that mirror the price of SOL, Solana’s native asset and currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The entry of multiple high-profile issuers suggests growing institutional interest in Solana as a tradable asset within US markets . ETF Competition Heats Up as Regulatory Sentiment Evolves The timing of CoinShares’ filing coincides with increasing speculation that the SEC may be softening its stance toward crypto spot ETFs. Last week, several asset managers, including VanEck and Franklin Templeton, reportedly amended their filings at the request of the SEC. These amendments included additional details on in-kind redemptions and staking methodologies, indicating a shift in how regulators may approach products that incorporate on-chain functionality such as staking. In parallel developments, Trump Media & Technology Group’s Truth Social platform has submitted its own ETF application. The proposed Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF aims to allocate approximately 75% of its assets to Bitcoin and the remainder to Ethereum . Filed under Form S-1, the ETF would be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital LLC, with flexibility to change the asset allocation ratio at its discretion. Foris DAX Trust Co. LLC is named as the custodian. Truth Social becomes the third known entity to pursue a dual crypto ETF product, joining Bitwise and Hashdex. Meanwhile, firms such as Volatility Shares and ProShares have filed for similar offerings, but those are tied to crypto futures markets rather than spot assets . The range of filings reflects both investor demand and evolving regulatory engagement with the crypto ETF market.

2025-06-17T08:42:55,"CleanSpark: Gaining Efficiency And Scale","Summary CleanSpark's operational efficiency and hashrate growth make it one of the most competitive and profitable bitcoin miners in the U.S. market. The company balances HODLing and selling bitcoin to fund expansion, using innovative treasury strategies like lending and covered calls to enhance returns. Key risks include bitcoin price volatility and not fully participating in potential bull market gains by selling some mined bitcoin for operations. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) recently saw a nice appreciation in its stock price over the past couple months from the April lows. CleanSpark, who proclaims to be ""America's Bitcoin Miner"", became primarily focused on bitcoin mining in 2020. Despite the company's fairly recent shift in focus, they have risen in the ranks to become one of the most competitive public bitcoin mining companies in the public market. As this article will show, despite not holding as much bitcoin as companies like MARA Holdings ( MARA ), their performance metrics seem to be improving more quickly than others. CleanSpark's Monthly Update On June 3, CleanSpark released its most recent update for the month of May where they showed impressive growth over the month, HODLing 12,502 bitcoin compared to 12,100 a month earlier. Although they HODL'd over 400 more bitcoin month-over-month, they mined a total of 694 bitcoin in May, selling some bitcoin to fund operations. They reached a total bitcoin hashrate of 47 Eh/s and plan on reaching 50 Eh/s in the month of June. This is an impressive feat considering MARA Holdings, a company that is nearly a decade older than CleanSpark, has amassed an only slightly larger hashrate of 58.3 Eh/s as of their May 2025 report. I recommended CleanSpark as a strong buy in my article on February 17, 2025 with the price trading just above $10/share. My recommendation was mostly based upon the mining efficiency of their fleet, which has led to them stacking bitcoin faster with more profitable operations. Since February 17, bitcoin has been volatile, but today, CleanSpark's stock trades near $10 once again. Has it bottomed and begun an upward rise alongside the potential bitcoin bull market? Time will tell. Company Overview American Made Bitcoin This chart shows the growth of the company's bitcoin mining from before the most recent halving to today. Even in the midst of the bitcoin halving, CleanSpark has continued to grow by mining more and more bitcoin, relative to the halving. Monthly Bitcoin Production ( CleanSpark 's May2025 Presentation) The company operates solely in America. This map shows the company's operations. Its largest footprint is found in the state of Georgia, where they first started their bitcoin mining journey with their first acquisition of ATL data centers. Bitcoin Mining Areas of Operation ( CleanSpark 's May2025 Presentation) CleanSpark's Mining Hashrate Through their growth in operations, they have more than doubled their mining hashrate each year, and they are on pace to do the same again in 2025. Here's the outlook from the CEO during the Q2 2025 Conference call. Looking beyond mid-year, we have active projects ongoing with miners and infrastructure paid for that will push us over 57 exahash. For long-term expansion, we have already secured infrastructure in hand or under contract to support growth beyond 60 exahash. Hashrate Growth Chart ( CleanSpark May2025 Presentation) Comparing CleanSpark's Hashrate Growth to MARA Holdings This is a graph comparing MARA Holding's hashrate over time. Although MARA Holdings began mining bitcoin in 2018, you can see how CLSK is on a trajectory that might overtake MARA. However, MARA has some exciting projects as well that will likely also continue to grow their hashrate quickly. MARA Holdings Hashrate Growth (Q1 2025 MARA Earnings Presentation) CleanSpark's Growth in Energy Efficiency This graphic shows CleanSpark's cost of mining bitcoin in terms of energy costs. Their average cost/kWh was $.06 cents in the most recent quarter. This was a substantial rise compared to the average cost/kWh of the previous two years. With energy costs bound to rise over time thanks to inflation, as well as bitcoin halvings reducing revenue, it is imperative for companies like CleanSpark to become ever more efficient. That is what they have accomplished by driving down the J/TH (Joules/TH) metric by over 40 percent since 2023 to 17.03 J/TH. CleanSpark's Operating Metrics ( CleanSpark May2025 Presentation) Because of CleanSpark's focus on efficiency, they were able to mine a bitcoin for the cost of $42,667 per bitcoin. With bitcoin trading above $100k per bitcoin, which creates an attractive operating margin for the company. With CleanSpark owning one of the most efficient fleets among public bitcoin mining companies, we can assume this is also one of the lowest costs among companies mining bitcoin. BTC Treasury Management As of April 30, 2025, CleanSpark's bitcoin treasury was valued at $1.13 billion. This is almost double the value that the company held in October 2024, just seven months prior. This was a combination of bitcoin's price appreciation and a nearly 40 percent increase in their bitcoin stack. Bitcoin Holdings Over Time ( CleanSpark May2025 Presentation) CleanSpark Performance Comparison Over Time As of January 2025 CleanSpark (This Article) June 7, 2025 CleanSpark ( Last Article ) Feb 17, 2025 All-In Power Costs 6.0c/kWh 4.6c/kWh Fleet Efficiency 16.71 J/Th 16.15 J/Th Average bitcoin Produced per Day 22.38 20.19 Bitcoin Held 12,502 10,556 Bitcoin Produced 05/2025 694 626 Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding(MM) 280.9 280.8 Total Deployed Hash Rate 45.6 EH/s 40.1 EH/s Market Cap($B) $2.75 $2.95 Quarterly Revenue($M) $181.7 $162.3 Debt-to-Asset Ratio Q3* .29 .27 New Financing Opportunities CleanSpark has begun to become more creative in generating additional revenue and financing from their bitcoin stack. First, they are increasing their Coinbase lending program to $200 million where they borrow using their bitcoin as collateral, which should provide a method for them to HODL greater amounts of their bitcoin. Here was the comment from Coinbase: Coinbase is excited to support CleanSpark and their innovative approach to capital and treasury management in Bitcoin mining,"" said Brett Tejpaul, Head of Coinbase Institutional. ""By deepening our relationship with CleanSpark and offering institutional-grade lending and custody management through our Prime service offering, we're committed to delivering strategic solutions that help CleanSpark thrive in the evolving crypto landscape. Secondly, the company will begin to sell covered calls on some of their bitcoin. Since they have chosen to sell a portion of their bitcoin to finance operations, selling covered calls to capture the premium to spot price only makes sense. The CFO Mike Vermicelli describes the covered call premiums like this from their 2025 Q2 conference call. Bitcoin’s trading around, what, $101,000 right now. So if we were to issue covered calls at the money, so with a strike price of $101,000 one week out, that’s a premium of a little over $2,400 or 2.4%. Risks and Counterarguments Bitcoin's Price Risk One of the biggest risks for CleanSpark is the bitcoin price. This should be obvious to investors, in that if the bitcoin price declines, then CleanSpark's share price will decline as well. This will impact their revenue as well as their balance sheet. But if you believe in bitcoin, then you understand that bitcoin's volatility can work to your advantage if you are patient. Not HODLing All Their Bitcoin Given bitcoin's impressive growth and its potential future growth, a risk that may not be so obvious, is the risk of not HODLing all of the bitcoin that the company mines. This is not a risk in that the company could go down in value, but rather a risk that other companies that HODL all of their bitcoin will perform better. Although CleanSpark's strategy should make them more stable, other bitcoin miners such as MARA have embarked on a bitcoin policy of not selling any of their bitcoin. If in fact we are entering a bitcoin bull market, then the companies that use financial leverage in order to fund operations while not selling any bitcoin, will outperform. As I mentioned, CleanSpark has chosen to hold most of their bitcoin, but to sell some to fund their expansion plans and ongoing operations. If bitcoin were to double or triple in price during a potential bull market, CleanSpark will miss out on some of those relatively quick returns in exchange for reducing balance sheet risk from greater debt levels. Looking at this from another perspective, some investors may appreciate this strategy more than the full HODL strategy. By selling bitcoin to finance operations, it certainly incentivizes CleanSpark to continue being one of, if not the most, efficient bitcoin miners in the market. Acquiring bitcoin via debt and issuing shares could make a bitcoin mining company complacent with their operating performance. The Bitcoin Treasury Companies Another counterargument to CleanSpark and the bitcoin mining industry at large, is the idea that bitcoin treasury companies will outperform bitcoin mining companies. The logic is that bitcoin mining companies have to invest tremendous amounts of capital to acquire the same number of bitcoin per share as companies like MicroStrategy, or as it is now called, Str ategy ( MSTR ). Strategy has experienced so much success, that many everyday companies have begun to follow by adopting bitcoin onto their balance sheets. Although few have tried to copy Strategy by making their company's sole focus being a bitcoin treasury company, there have been several that have begun, such as the future Twenty One Capital company which is waiting to be merged with Cantor Equity Partners ( CEP ). Tariffs Tariffs that increase the cost of bitcoin mining equipment coming from China is another risk. This, no doubt, can have an impact on the company. However, the CEO, Zach Bradford, tried to spin this as a positive in the following statement: In fact, if tariffs persist, we may see opportunities to acquire smaller miners at attractive valuations, particularly those unable to afford next-generation hardware under the new cost structures. This is a clear example of how our infrastructure-first, counter-cyclical strategy continues to generate strategic advantages over peers. Conclusion CleanSpark, among bitcoin mining companies, is one of the better, if not the best, company. If you believe in bitcoin mining, then CleanSpark belongs in your portfolio. They have proven themselves to be driven by continuous improvement, which has positioned them as one of the most efficient bitcoin mining companies. Given that bitcoin is a scarce, finite commodity, a company can only thrive long-term by being focused on continuous improvement. Currently, I think capital markets still have a hunger for bitcoin that the bitcoin treasury companies are positioned to benefit from. With limited competition, treasury companies like Strategy will likely continue to outperform. But bitcoin mining companies should still perform very well. One day, when the market competition among bitcoin treasury companies becomes much tighter, I expect bitcoin mining companies will provide a greater source of alpha for investors. Like I said, I don't think that day is today, but I'm not sure when that will be. Investors who want to invest in bitcoin in the public markets must play their hand and let the chips fall. But if your bet is on bitcoin mining, then CleanSpark is a strong buy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795333-cleanspark-gaining-efficiency-and-scale?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","CLSK",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T08:39:50,"Pay for Your Latte with Bitcoin? SpacePay’s Got You Covered","The post Pay for Your Latte with Bitcoin? SpacePay’s Got You Covered appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ever tried paying for coffee with Bitcoin? Yeah, it’s usually a nightmare. Most places either don’t accept it or make you jump through so many hoops that your latte gets cold before you’re done. But here’s where things get interesting. SpacePay , this fintech company from London, figured out how to let you pay with crypto using the same card machines that are already everywhere. They work with existing Android payment terminals, support more than 325 crypto wallets, and instantly convert everything to regular money so shop owners don’t freak out about price swings. Their $SPY token presale has pulled in over $1.1 million so far, with tokens going for $0.003181 each. Your Morning Latte Just Got a Crypto Upgrade We all know that one friend who owns Bitcoin but can never actually spend it anywhere useful. Coffee shops want these customers, but setting up crypto payments usually costs a fortune and requires a computer science degree to figure out. SpacePay decided to fix this mess. Coffee shop owners can start accepting crypto payments tomorrow using whatever card machine they already have. No expensive upgrades. No confusing setup process. Just a quick software update and they’re ready to go. For customers, it’s dead simple. Pull out your phone, open your favorite crypto wallet, and pay with Ethereum or whatever you’ve got. Takes about the same time as tapping your credit card. Done. This opens up a pretty big opportunity. There are more than 400 million people walking around with crypto in their digital wallets. Most of them would love to actually use it for something other than staring at price charts all day. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1925613304023511376 Here’s How SpacePay Deals with Crypto’s Wild Price Swings Anyone who’s owned cryptocurrency knows the drill. You wake up and your Bitcoin is worth 15% less than when you went to bed. Coffee shop owners hate this uncertainty, and honestly, who can blame them? SpacePay solves this problem in the most straightforward way possible. Customer pays with crypto, SpacePay immediately converts it to dollars or euros or whatever currency the business owner wants. The shop gets regular money. No crypto risk. No sleepless nights worrying about market crashes. This instant conversion thing is probably why business owners actually want to use SpacePay. They get access to crypto-spending customers without any of the usual drama. Plus, SpacePay only charges 0.5% per transaction, which beats most credit card companies by a mile. Think about a busy café processing 500 transactions a day. Those fee savings add up fast. More money stays in the business owner’s pocket instead of going to payment processors. Visit SpacePay Presale What’s the Deal with $SPY Tokens? SpacePay runs on their own token called $SPY. Token holders get to vote on platform changes, which is actually pretty cool if you’re into having a say in how things work. But here’s the part that gets people excited: revenue sharing. As SpacePay processes more transactions, token holders get a cut of the profits. More businesses using SpacePay means more money flowing back to the community. They also do these monthly airdrops for active users. Plus quarterly video calls where you can actually talk to the SpacePay team and ask questions. It feels less like buying tokens and more like joining a community that’s building something together. Early access to new features is another perk. $SPY holders get to test stuff before everyone else. If you’re running a business that accepts crypto payments, getting first dibs on new tools could give you an edge over competitors. Getting This Thing Up and Running SpacePay takes security seriously, which is smart considering how many crypto projects have gone sideways because of hacks. They use proper encryption and spread things across multiple systems instead of putting everything in one place. Setting up SpacePay looks pretty painless for merchants. Connect your Android payment terminal to their network, update the software, and you’re accepting crypto alongside regular cards. No rocket science required. The wallet support is solid too. Whether you’re team MetaMask or prefer something else, SpacePay probably works with it. They support the major cryptocurrencies plus stablecoins, so customers have options while merchants still get predictable fiat currency. Where This Could Go Next SpacePay already has a working product and seems focused on staying compliant with regulations. That’s probably smart given how many crypto companies have run into legal trouble by moving too fast and breaking things. Any business that takes card payments could potentially use SpacePay. Coffee shops, retail stores, restaurants, you name it. The low barrier to entry means even small businesses can get on board without breaking the bank. As more merchants join, the whole thing becomes more useful for everyone. More places to spend crypto means more transactions, which means more revenue to share with token holders. If you want to participate in the $SPY presale, head over to SpacePay’s website and connect your crypto wallet. Tokens are currently priced at $0.003181, and you can pay with various cryptocurrencies or even use a regular bank card if you’re new to the crypto world.

2025-06-17T08:32:54,"Why Bitfinex’s KYC Process Sets the Gold Standard in Crypto Industry","Would you ever lend money to a stranger who emailed you out of the blue? Exactly. Yet that’s the reality of the internet in 2025. Every day, you’re transacting with people you’ve never met, from every corner of the globe. Many are legitimate. Some know exactly how to hide behind layers of fake information. In fact, as the Bitrace Crypto Crime Report 2025 points out, crypto-related losses have already topped $502 million this year , with 63% due to hacks and the rest tied to phishing, rug pulls, and social engineering. Many of these crimes share one thing in common: they exploit weak or non-existent Know Your Customer (KYC) processes on platforms where compliance isn’t a priority. At Bitfinex, not only do we follow global compliance standards, we set the gold standard. Our KYC process is designed to protect users, prevent fraud, and ensure long-term access to a maturing financial system. At Bitfinex, KYC is the backbone of trust. Here, every stranger is verified. Thousands are going through our verification process the same way you did. All to protect you! At Bitfinex, Every Stranger is Verified KYC isn’t about red tape. It’s about responsibility. Without it, criminals can slip through the cracks, using throwaway accounts as launchpads for money laundering and fraud. While some platforms boast “instant access” or “no KYC required,” the underlying reality is often higher risk for users and higher conversion for their bottom line. High-stakes trading competitions, generous bonuses, and heavily hyped (often unvetted) listings, when paired with fast-tracked KYC processes that prioritise speed over thoroughness, are all part of the drive for massive acquisition. According to a 2020 study by blockchain analysis firm CypherTrace , in 2019, about 56% of crypto exchanges still had no KYC at all. That same year, criminals laundered an estimated $3.38 billion in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies As many exchanges prioritise rapid user acquisition and retail volume at all costs, often at the expense of safety, Bitfinex has consistently chosen the route of longevity, transparency, and compliance. Would you trust a bank that let anyone move millions without verifying who they are? Neither would we. Every credible financial platform, whether it’s a bank, brokerage, or crypto exchange, requires identity verification. This is the norm of best financial practices. At Bitfinex, we set the same financial standard for a crypto exchange. Here’s What Strong KYC Looks Like Bitfinex’s process is clear and structured but intentionally thorough: Basic Plus Verification Just upload your ID, confirm your address and phone number, and take a quick selfie. This gives you access to crypto deposits, withdrawals, and spot trading. Intermediate Verification Add a second ID, a proof of address, and complete a short financial form. Perfect if you want higher limits or to unlock margin trading. Full Verification Include a bank statement and a few extra details. Required if you want to deposit or withdraw fiat. This is bank-grade onboarding , built for users operating in a market where billions move daily and where security isn’t optional. Because just like any credible financial institution, we don’t offer advanced tools and global liquidity just to anyone without verifying who’s behind the screen. A Platform Worthy of Professional Traders Registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) while embracing The Original Bitcoin Exchange as our legacy, Bitfinex has been serving professional traders and institutions since 2012. That legacy isn’t built on hype. It’s built on trust. It happened because we took security, regulation, and infrastructure seriously long before it became industry standard. Today, Bitfinex holds approximately 403,000 BTC , worth over $47 billion , making it the second-largest bitcoin reserve among centralized exchanges . This is a signal that the biggest holders in the space continue to choose Bitfinex to move, manage, and secure large-scale capital. On-chain data confirms Bitfinex’s appeal to whales, including a $400 million ETH transfer from two dormant wallets in 2024. These are long-term actors choosing infrastructure built for serious capital. Our KYC process is intentionally rigorous, not just to meet global regulatory standards, but to ensure that all customers on our platform are protected. Our KYC process has been refined, audited, and stress-tested to meet not just where the industry was, but where it’s going. And it’s why Bitfinex continues to attract the most serious participants in the space , those who think long-term and act with intention. Trust Is Earned, Not Fast-Tracked A thorough KYC process is a feature and a high bar we proudly set . And the foundation of wealth building starts with asset security at its roots. In crypto, as in life, the things that are built to last are never the easiest, they’re just the most worth it. At the end of the day, a platform that takes your identity seriously, is far more likely to take your assets seriously too.

2025-06-17T08:32:27,"Pol (MATIC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will MATIC Price Surge to $1?","The post Pol (MATIC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will MATIC Price Surge to $1? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of the Polygon coin is $ 0.21819891 . The MATIC price could reach a maximum of $0.47181 in 2025. POL price with a potential surge may reach a high of $4.94731 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network’s high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL’s price value, too. Through, POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framwork of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin, and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction. Table of contents Overview Polygon Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Polygon Price Action 2026 POL Price Prediction 2027 Polygon Crypto Price Forecast 2028 MATIC Coin Price Projection 2029 Polygon Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Token MATIC Price $ 0.21819891 2.88% Market Cap $ 0.00 Trading Volume $ 1,217,344.7306 Circulating Supply 0.00 All-time High $1.29 Mar 14, 2024 All-time Low $0.1533 Apr 07, 2025 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 As evident on the POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE, its price fell in Q1 2025, along with other altcoins in the market, due to trade deal problems in the US. This led investors to refrain from investing in the entire market and watch from the sidelines. However, in Q2 2025’s April month onwards, momentum started as investors got a glimpse of improving geopolitical situations and other positive factors. However, like every other altcoin, POL price action didn’t have a big rise in early May, and it lost its strength early on after reaching $0.269. Even the RSI has slipped below the median line and has taken rejection from the 14-day SMA smoothing line and is at 40.27. Despite the loss in momentum, the bears have not been dominant yet, and it is consolidating near the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands and key support zone. But if it breaks the support zone’s low of $0.194, then bearish forces will take control and push it down to the $0.15 level. However, if the conditions improve, then the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.4572 could act as a magnet for the POL price to rise. This level also aligns with early 2025’s price action-based high-volume profile level. If it successfully clears the $0.4572 level in June or July, there is a higher chance that the POL price might hit the Fibonacci 0.786 level at $0.6336 and the other at $0.7655 by the end of the year 2025. On the contrary, if the $0.4572 proves to be too strong to break, then there is a strong chance for bears to take over the trend and repel the price from the fibonacci 0.5 level to the lows of 2025.
