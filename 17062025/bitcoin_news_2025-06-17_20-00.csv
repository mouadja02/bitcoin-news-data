2025-06-17T17:53:21,"Solana Nears All-Time High in Monthly Users Despite Year-Long Price Stagnation","Even though Solana (SOL) is witnessing a ranging market, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization is witnessing an uptick in active monthly users as they edge closer to the all-time high (ATH) level of 160 million. Some of the key factors contributing to this surge include Solana’s broader ecosystem and developer engagement, thanks to the network’s high speed and ultra-low fees to the tune of $0.02. Solana is also known to experience a beehive of meme-coin activity, contributing to its high monthly usage. Solana Remains Locked in a Consolidated Market According to market analyst Crypto Joe, “SOL has been chopping in a sideways range for over a year — bouncing between Fib levels and shaking out the weak hands. $140 remains the key level to hold for any real continuation upward.” Source: Crypto Joe The analyst added that Solana’s ranging market is not a sign of giving up because the one-year sideways grind is a volatile base-building phase. At the time of this writing, Solana was hovering around the $146 zone, and the altcoin’s consolidation between the $140 and $160 zones was intensifying. As previously reported by ZyCrypto, popular crypto analyst AltcoinGordon recently opined that the next leg up for Solana would be violent to the extent of surpassing Bitcoin’s recent all-time high (ATH) move. With seven providers already filing for Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , time will tell how SOL plays out in the short and long term. This development has the potential to spur heightened institutional investments.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/solana-nears-all-time-high-in-monthly-users-despite-year-long-price-stagnation/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T17:45:12,"Exploring Cardano's Ambitious Path to Surpass Bitcoin","High stakes and high ambitions define the tumultuous realm of cryptocurrencies, where every player seeks to innovate and outpace the rest. Standing prominently among these is Cardano, directed by its visionary leader Charles Hoskinson. His latest proposal for a monumental $1 billion Sovereign Wealth Fund seeks to not just accelerate ADA's adoption but fundamentally alter the ecosystem's dynamics. Cardano's Disruptive Technology and Strategic Moves Unlike Bitcoin, which has primarily focused on stability and security, Cardano aims to revolutionize the blockchain arena through advanced technical frameworks and on-chain governance . These innovations make Cardano a significant contender in the race to redefine the blockchain's future. Charles Hoskinson argues that Cardano's approach is not about picking up where Bitcoin left but about pushing the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve. The Vision for a $1 Billion Sovereign Wealth Fund Hoskinson's ambitious strategy includes the creation of a decentralized fund as detailed in his recent Cardano treasury conversion proposal . This fund aims to invest in a mix of assets to foster network liquidity and curb inflation, drawing parallels with strategies employed by massive networks like Ethereum. Real-World Applications and Market Dynamics While Cardano focuses on infrastructural evolution, other cryptocurrencies like Remittix are carving niches by solving practical financial dilemmas. Remittix offers rapid conversion between crypto and fiat, appealing to users needing efficient, economical international transactions. Such dual paths highlight the diverse approaches within the crypto industry, where some entities like Remittix directly address user needs, whereas others like Cardano innovate at a foundational level. Future Prospects and Industry Positioning In the fast-evolving crypto world, the future lies in both technological innovation and practical utility. Cardano, with its robust technological advancements and strategic initiatives such as Hoskinson's 2025 vision , alongside practical solutions offered by platforms like Remittix, reveal the multifaceted nature of blockchain advancements.

2025-06-17T17:44:54,"Cardano Founder Believes ADA Is Bitcoin's Biggest Threat, Proposes $1B Cardano Sovereign Wealth Fund","Cardano’s outspoken founder Charles Hoskinson has once again stirred the crypto world - this time with a bold claim that ADA could emerge as Bitcoin’s biggest threat. In a recent proposal, Hoskinson introduced the idea of a $1 billion Cardano Sovereign Wealth Fund, aimed at accelerating ecosystem development, boosting ADA adoption and reshaping global perceptions of crypto governance. Could this be the move that propels Cardano to the top? Analysts feel that another altcoin is set to play a leading role in 2025 and could become a bigger challenger to Bitcoin than ADA. Cardano Aims To Dethrone Bitcoin's Dominance With Next-Generation Capabilities Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently stated that Cardano offers the most significant threat to Bitcoin, thanks to its next-generation technical structure and governance model. He explained how Cardano's UTXO-based smart contract development and governance on-chain are radical advancements over Bitcoin's more inflexible structure. Source: TradingView Hoskinson believes Bitcoin's plan is something Cardano has already integrated. He contends Cardano doesn't merely take up ""unfinished work"" early Bitcoin developers started but never completed, making ADA a future-proof solution for secure and scalable blockchain transactions. Remittix Investors Have Actual Real World Use While Ada Is Focused On Enhancing Structure Remittix has focused on functional problems in global finance. With a Q3 wallet release, RTX enables users e.g., remote workers or overseas merchants to convert crypto to fiat in under 24 hours. An East African logistics company already uses Remittix to pay European suppliers without waiting for traditional banks. Here, Remittix is a more instant attraction for customers looking for fast and inexpensive transfers. It is for this reason that the majority of early adopters are already thinking of it as a valid XRP alternative with much higher potential. Hoskinson's $1b Fund Can Redefine The Cardano Ecosystem Hoskinson proposed to introduce a $1 billion decentralized sovereign wealth fund to boost Cardano's DeFi and stablecoin sectors. The fund would invest treasury ADA in assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins, encouraging network liquidity while limiting inflation risk. The move echoes Ethereum's adoption of treasury-backed projects. It could also help Cardano make up lost ground in the DeFi domain with networks like Solana, which currently dominate in Total Value Locked and stablecoin activity. Nevertheless, some pundits warn that it could cause market imbalances if poorly tracked. Conclusion: A New Era Of Ecosystem Competition? Both ADA and RTX are two of the biggest aspects of blockchain technology. Cardano is technical prowess and formal regulation, whereas Remittix provides speed and convenience. Hoskinson's 2025 vision also includes BTC integration and privacy tools, but such innovations may not show up in the price of ADA immediately. With its clear use case, strong presale momentum and upcoming product releases, Remittix may offer quicker gains. If you’re looking to back the next breakout crypto, now might be the time to get in early.

2025-06-17T17:40:47,"Alchemy Pay Unlocks Seamless RLUSD Access Globally Through Fiat On-Ramp","BitcoinWorld Alchemy Pay Unlocks Seamless RLUSD Access Globally Through Fiat On-Ramp The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space. A significant step in this direction has just been announced, promising to make access to digital assets easier than ever before. Alchemy Pay , a leading crypto payment gateway, has officially teamed up with Ripple to enable a crucial service for Ripple’s recently announced, fully backed stablecoin, RLUSD. What Does the Alchemy Pay and Ripple Partnership Mean for RLUSD? This collaboration is centered around providing robust fiat on-ramp crypto services specifically for RLUSD. Announced via Alchemy Pay’s official channels, the partnership leverages Alchemy Pay’s extensive network to allow users worldwide to convert their local fiat currencies directly into RLUSD. This removes significant friction typically associated with entering the crypto market, especially for stablecoins. For those unfamiliar, a fiat on-ramp is essentially a service that allows individuals to use traditional money (like USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) to buy cryptocurrencies directly, often through familiar payment methods such as bank transfers, credit cards, or local payment systems. By integrating this service for RLUSD, Alchemy Pay is making it straightforward for users in a vast number of regions to acquire Ripple’s stablecoin. Accessing RLUSD Stablecoin in 173 Countries One of the most impressive aspects of this partnership is the sheer scale of accessibility it promises. Alchemy Pay’s integration is set to enable fiat on-ramp services for RLUSD in an astounding 173 countries. This global reach is critical for the widespread adoption of any digital asset, particularly a stablecoin aiming for stability and utility across diverse markets. Users in these countries will no longer need to navigate complex processes involving multiple exchanges or intermediaries to get their hands on RLUSD. They can potentially use their preferred local payment methods, making the transition from fiat to the RLUSD stablecoin much smoother and more intuitive. This level of accessibility is a powerful catalyst for onboarding new users into the digital asset ecosystem. Why is RLUSD Significant? Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market with RLUSD is a noteworthy development. As a fully backed stablecoin, RLUSD aims to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with a reserve asset like the US dollar. Stablecoins are crucial components of the crypto economy, providing a bridge between volatile cryptocurrencies and stable fiat currencies. They are used for trading, lending, payments, and as a safe haven during market downturns. Ripple’s decision to launch RLUSD signals their commitment to participating in the growing stablecoin sector, which is vital for facilitating smoother transactions and fostering greater confidence in digital currencies for everyday use and institutional adoption. A reliable fiat on-ramp is essential for any stablecoin to achieve broad utility, and this is where the Alchemy Pay partnership plays a pivotal role. Alchemy Pay: A Key Crypto Payment Gateway Alchemy Pay has established itself as a significant player in the crypto payment gateway space. Their infrastructure is designed to connect traditional finance with the crypto economy, offering solutions for businesses and individuals. Their services typically include: Fiat On-Ramp: Enabling users to buy crypto with fiat. Fiat Off-Ramp: Allowing users to sell crypto for fiat. Crypto Payroll: Facilitating salary payments in crypto. NFT Checkout: Simplifying the purchase of NFTs using fiat. Their strength lies in integrating a wide array of local payment channels across numerous jurisdictions. This existing infrastructure is precisely what makes them an ideal partner for Ripple to ensure RLUSD is easily accessible globally. Their network covers diverse payment methods, from major credit cards like Visa and Mastercard to regional mobile wallets and bank transfer systems. The Benefits of This Partnership for Users and the Ecosystem The collaboration between Ripple and Alchemy Pay brings several tangible benefits: Enhanced Accessibility: Users in 173 countries gain a direct, easy way to acquire RLUSD using their local currencies. Simplified Onboarding: The fiat on-ramp service reduces the technical barriers for new users entering the stablecoin market. Increased RLUSD Adoption: Greater accessibility naturally leads to increased potential usage and adoption of the RLUSD stablecoin. Broader Utility for Ripple Ecosystem: As RLUSD becomes easier to acquire, it can be more readily used within applications and services built on or connected to Ripple’s infrastructure. Strengthened Alchemy Pay Network: Partnering with a major player like Ripple enhances Alchemy Pay’s reputation and expands its transaction volume. Support for Local Payments: The focus on local payment methods makes the process feel familiar and trustworthy to users worldwide. How Does the Fiat On-Ramp Process Work? While the exact user interface will depend on the platform integrating Alchemy Pay’s service, the general process for a user wanting to acquire RLUSD stablecoin via the fiat on-ramp typically involves: Selecting RLUSD as the desired cryptocurrency to purchase. Entering the amount of RLUSD they wish to buy or the amount of fiat they wish to spend. Choosing their country and preferred local payment method (e.g., bank transfer, credit card, specific regional wallet). Completing identity verification (KYC – Know Your Customer), if required by regulations or the platform. Authorizing the payment using their chosen local method. Receiving the purchased RLUSD directly into their designated crypto wallet. This streamlined process contrasts sharply with older methods that might require users to first buy a more common crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum on one platform, transfer it to another exchange, and then trade it for the desired stablecoin. Looking Ahead: The Future of Fiat On-Ramps and Stablecoins The partnership between Alchemy Pay and Ripple for RLUSD’s fiat on-ramp is indicative of a larger trend in the crypto space: the increasing focus on usability and integration with the traditional financial system. As stablecoins like RLUSD aim for wider adoption, easy and reliable fiat on-ramps become non-negotiable necessities. This development not only benefits individual users but also lays groundwork for businesses looking to interact with digital assets. A readily accessible stablecoin like RLUSD, backed by a major entity like Ripple and easily purchasable via a global payment gateway like Alchemy Pay, has the potential to be used for cross-border payments, settlements, and various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Actionable Insight: How to Access RLUSD via Alchemy Pay Users interested in utilizing this new service should look for platforms, exchanges, or wallets that have integrated Alchemy Pay’s fiat on-ramp solution for RLUSD. Once integrated, the option to buy RLUSD directly using local fiat currency via various payment methods will become available within those platforms’ interfaces. Keep an eye on announcements from exchanges and wallets popular in your region regarding their integration with Alchemy Pay’s RLUSD service. Conclusion The partnership between Alchemy Pay and Ripple to provide a comprehensive fiat on-ramp for the RLUSD stablecoin across 173 countries marks a significant leap forward in making digital assets more accessible globally. By leveraging Alchemy Pay’s robust crypto payment gateway infrastructure and wide network of local payment methods, acquiring RLUSD is set to become easier and more convenient for millions of potential users. This collaboration not only boosts the potential adoption and utility of RLUSD but also underscores the growing importance of seamless fiat-to-crypto solutions in the evolving financial landscape. It’s a powerful example of how strategic partnerships are paving the way for broader participation in the digital economy.

2025-06-17T17:33:34,"America’s Largest Bank JPMorgan Applies for Possible Stablecoin JPMD Trademark","JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in America, has filed for a trademark for a digital currency titled JPMD with the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). At this stage, it is unclear what JPMD represents or whether it is a new stablecoin developed by JPMorgan in secret. A stablecoin pegs a digital currency to a real-world asset such as the US dollar. JPMorgan has taken an interest in stablecoins, signalling a change in the bank’s stance regarding using digital assets in the finance industry. The PTO website described the JPMD trademark as representing a service that would provide trading and exchange services for digital assets. The trademark is categorised as relating to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Traders on X have surmised that the new crypto trademark is JPMorgan’s stablecoin and will be accompanied by a coin offering. JPMD, the new trademark by JPMorgan, seems to imply that the “D” represents the word “dollar”, making the new crypto trademark a stablecoin issued by JPMorgan. Other stablecoins of note include Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. The Wall Street Journal published an article on May 22 suggesting that JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America planned to create a stablecoin shared between them. The WSJ article indicated that the stablecoin would speed up routine transactions and make cross-border payments. Therefore, the stablecoin could be used as an advanced accounting tool to save on transaction costs and record financial details within the bank. However, one can only speculate as to the legitimacy of the WSJ article at this stage. The Genius Act, meanwhile, is being considered by US lawmakers as a way to install regulatory guardrails on stablecoin use. Many expect the new laws to pass through this summer. Various companies plan to capitalise on the looser regulations relating to stablecoin use. JPMorgan may be one such company that intends to profit by investing early in stablecoin technology. The Trump administration may continue to provide incentives for the crypto industry. Therefore, companies from non-crypto industries may take a proactive approach to stablecoin investing. The Trump-backed crypto World Liberty project debuted its stablecoin USD1. The crypto company BitGo announced its stablecoin, USDS. Tether, however, remains the most popular stablecoin by market capitalisation with its token USDT. The World Liberty token USD1 is backed by real-world assets such as US dollars to legitimise the project. JPMorgan has adopted Bitcoin into its financial business model, accepting Bitcoin spot ETFs as collateral for loan applications. When assessing creditworthiness, JPMorgan will consider digital assets alongside fine art and vehicles to ascertain an individual’s net worth. JPMorgan has started considering BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a loan collateral. The largest bank in America has surely begun to embrace Bitcoin within its business practices. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that they will adopt their own stablecoin, especially with the current climate that may favour the stablecoin market. The major banks in America may be trying to control the issuance and circulation of stablecoins while applying traditional finance rules to use these assets. The PTO website has formally accepted the trademark application but is awaiting further review by a separate examiner. The trademark application allows JPMorgan to connect a trade name to an underlying process so that they have exclusive rights to use that name. Kinexys Digital Payments is the blockchain specialist that JPMorgan uses to complete its crypto projects. Kinexys completed their second test batch of transactions on a public blockchain last week. JPMorgan has the specialists lined up to adopt blockchain more fully within their bank. However, they have a lot of competition to contend with, such as with Tether, the largest issuer of US stablecoins.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/americas-largest-bank-jpmorgan-applies-for-possible-stablecoin-jpmd-trademark/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|USDT","Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|JPMorgan|stablecoin",cryptocompare

Major U.S. stock indices were down as hopes for a swift resolution to the Israel-Iran conflict continued to fade. On Tuesday, July 17, the Dow Jones fell 130 points, or 0.31%, with healthcare firms leading the declines. At the same time, the S&P 500 dropped 0.44%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined by 0.50%. Dow Jones Industrial Average heatmap | TipRank The downturn came after U.S. President Donald Trump called for the evacuation of Tehran, Iran’s capital. The move rattled investors, signaling the possibility of a prolonged conflict. Instead of pushing for a ceasefire, Trump has maintained a firm stance on Iran’s nuclear disarmament , a demand which the regime is unlikely to accept. In response, oil prices spiked 3%, as investors feared that the escalating conflict could threaten the region’s oil production and trade. Notably, Israel has already attacked major Iranian oil facilities , while traders fear that Iran might close the Strait of Hormuz , a vital global oil artery.

2025-06-17T17:10:47,"Bitcoin Miner Vinanz Secures $4.85M Funding for Massive BTC Acquisition and Expansion","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Miner Vinanz Secures $4.85M Funding for Massive BTC Acquisition and Expansion Exciting news from the world of digital asset infrastructure! London-listed Bitcoin miner Vinanz has just announced a significant milestone, successfully closing a funding round that exceeded all expectations. This substantial capital injection is set to power the company’s strategic growth initiatives, focusing on expanding its operational footprint and, notably, increasing its direct holdings of Bitcoin (BTC). For anyone tracking the crypto market or considering a crypto investment , this development offers valuable insights into the confidence surrounding the mining sector and the future of Bitcoin accumulation strategies. Understanding the Vinanz Funding Success The core of this positive news revolves around the recent Vinanz funding round. Vinanz managed to raise a total of £3.58 million, which translates to approximately $4.85 million based on current exchange rates. What makes this particularly impressive is that the amount raised is more than three times the company’s initial target. This oversubscription is a strong indicator of robust investor confidence in Vinanz’s business model and its future prospects within the competitive Bitcoin mining landscape. Why did this funding round attract such significant interest? Several factors likely contributed: Market Position: Vinanz, being a London-listed entity, offers a level of transparency and regulatory oversight that appeals to certain investor segments. Growth Strategy: The clear intention to use funds for both operational expansion and direct BTC acquisition presents a dual-pronged growth strategy. Sector Confidence: Despite market volatility, the underlying belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and the necessity of mining operations remains strong among dedicated crypto investors. Exceeding Targets: The sheer volume of oversubscription creates positive momentum and signals strong demand for Vinanz’s equity. This successful capital raise provides Vinanz with the necessary financial muscle to execute its ambitious plans effectively. Fueling the BTC Acquisition Strategy A key stated purpose for the newly raised capital is the direct BTC acquisition . This isn’t just about funding mining operations; it’s also about strategically accumulating Bitcoin itself. For a Bitcoin miner, acquiring BTC can happen in two primary ways: through the mining process itself (earning block rewards) and through direct purchase on the open market. Vinanz’s announcement suggests they will utilize a portion of the raised funds for the latter. Why would a miner buy Bitcoin directly when they are already producing it? This strategy can be seen as a form of balance sheet management and a bullish bet on Bitcoin’s price appreciation. By using external capital to buy BTC, Vinanz can potentially: Increase its overall BTC holdings faster than mining alone would allow. Benefit directly from future price increases on the acquired BTC. Potentially use acquired BTC as collateral or for other financial strategies down the line. This approach highlights a growing trend among publicly listed miners to not only focus on operational efficiency but also to leverage their position to become significant holders of the asset they produce. It signals a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future value among the company’s leadership and investors alike. Driving Bitcoin Mining Expansion Beyond acquiring Bitcoin, the Vinanz funding is also earmarked for Bitcoin mining expansion . This is the core business of a Bitcoin miner , and scaling operations is crucial for increasing hash rate, improving efficiency, and ultimately, earning more block rewards and transaction fees. Expanding mining operations typically involves several key components: Purchasing New Hardware: Acquiring the latest generation of ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners is essential for maintaining competitiveness and efficiency. Newer machines offer higher hash rates with better energy consumption ratios. Developing or Securing Infrastructure: This includes setting up or expanding data centers, ensuring reliable and cost-effective power sources, and establishing cooling and security systems. Location is often critical, seeking regions with cheap and ideally renewable energy. Increasing Capacity: Simply adding more machines requires space, power capacity, and network connectivity. Funding allows for building out or leasing larger facilities. The commitment to expansion indicates Vinanz’s intent to increase its share of the global Bitcoin hash rate. A larger hash rate contributes more to securing the network and increases the miner’s probability of earning block rewards. This strategic growth is vital for long-term profitability and relevance in the rapidly evolving mining sector. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment? The success of the Vinanz funding round provides interesting signals for the broader crypto investment landscape, particularly concerning infrastructure plays like mining companies. While direct Bitcoin investment remains popular, investing in publicly traded miners offers a different kind of exposure. Here’s what this funding success might suggest for investors: Investor Appetite for Mining: The oversubscribed round demonstrates that significant capital is willing to flow into well-structured and publicly listed mining operations. Confidence in Long-Term BTC Value: The focus on both mining and direct BTC acquisition reflects a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s price trajectory among sophisticated investors. Sector Maturity: Successful, oversubscribed funding rounds like this suggest increasing maturity and institutional interest in the crypto mining sector as a legitimate industry. Growth Potential: For investors considering mining stocks, this highlights the potential for companies to raise capital to scale operations and increase their Bitcoin holdings, potentially leading to significant growth. However, like any crypto investment , investing in miners comes with its own set of risks, which are crucial to consider. Challenges Facing a Bitcoin Miner While the Vinanz funding is a clear success, operating as a Bitcoin miner is far from without its challenges. These factors influence profitability and operational stability: Bitcoin Price Volatility: A miner’s revenue is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin. Significant price drops can quickly impact profitability, even for efficient operations. Network Difficulty Increases: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of finding a block increases. This means each miner earns less BTC for the same amount of hash rate, requiring constant investment in more powerful hardware. Energy Costs: Electricity is the single largest operational expense for a Bitcoin miner. Fluctuating energy prices or lack of access to cheap, stable power can severely impact margins. Regulatory changes impacting energy grids can also pose risks. Hardware Obsolescence: Mining hardware improves rapidly. Today’s top-tier miner might be significantly less efficient than models released just a year or two later, necessitating continuous capital expenditure to upgrade. Regulatory Landscape: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrency mining, leading to potential uncertainty regarding energy consumption, environmental impact, and financial oversight. Successful miners like Vinanz must constantly navigate these challenges through strategic planning, efficient operations, and securing favorable energy deals. Actionable Insights from Vinanz’s Success What can we take away from this news? For those interested in the crypto space: Mining Sector Health: This successful raise suggests that despite market cycles, there is still strong belief and investment flowing into the Bitcoin mining sector. Strategic Accumulation: Watch for other miners potentially adopting or increasing their direct BTC acquisition strategies, signaling bullish sentiment from industry insiders. Importance of Capital: Access to capital is crucial for miners to remain competitive, especially post-halving when block rewards are reduced. Funding rounds like this enable necessary expansion and hardware upgrades. Diversification Considerations: For investors, consider how mining stocks fit into a broader crypto investment strategy. They offer leverage to BTC price but also come with operational risks distinct from holding BTC directly. Vinanz’s ability to raise significant funds underscores the potential seen in scaling Bitcoin mining operations and accumulating the underlying asset. Conclusion: A Strong Vote of Confidence The successful £3.58 million ($4.85 million) funding round by London-listed Bitcoin miner Vinanz is a significant event, far exceeding its initial target and providing a strong vote of confidence from investors. The allocation of these funds towards both BTC acquisition and Bitcoin mining expansion highlights a clear strategy for growth and value accumulation. In a sector facing constant challenges from market volatility, network difficulty, and energy costs, Vinanz’s ability to secure substantial capital positions it well for future scaling and underscores the continued appeal of the mining industry as a key component of the crypto ecosystem. This development offers positive signals for the health of the mining sector and potential opportunities within the broader crypto investment landscape.

2025-06-17T17:00:47,"Trump Media Makes Moves On Bitcoin And Smartphone – What’s Next?","A new filing shows Trump Media & Technology Group moving into both crypto and telecom markets. The company behind Truth Social and Truth+ has asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission to register a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, according to reports. At roughly the same time, it unveiled plans for a $499 Trump‑branded smartphone and service plan. Related Reading: Record‑High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Truth Social Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF According to the registration statement dated June 16, the proposed ETF would hold 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and the remaining 25% in Ethereum. If the SEC clears the way, the fund will list on NYSE Arca under a sponsor agreement with Yorkville America Digital. The plan is to store both coins in direct custody, meaning the ETF will actually hold the digital tokens rather than futures contracts or other derivatives. Crypto.com Handles Custody And Staking Based on reports, Crypto.com will serve as the ETF’s sole custodian and prime execution agent. The company will also provide staking and liquidity services for the Ethereum portion. That setup could ease SEC concerns, given the regulator’s focus on secure storage and clear oversight. Still, there’s no guarantee the ETF will win approval. Past spot crypto ETF proposals have faced delays and rejections due to worries over market manipulation and investor protection. Trump Mobile Smartphone and Service Plan At a media event in Trump Tower, US President Donald Trump’s organization introduced “Trump Mobile,” a new phone and network service. The device will sell for $499 starting in September, and the monthly plan is priced at $47.45—a nod to Trump’s role as the 47th US President.

2025-06-17T17:00:00,"BTC or RUVI? why analysts predict up to 109x returns from the newcomer","Bitcoin (BTC) has been the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies since its inception, offering stability and long-term growth for investors. However, with Bitcoin’s market cap towering above all others, its potential for explosive returns has somewhat diminished. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI), a revolutionary newcomer combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts are now forecasting up to 109x returns, positioning Ruvi AI as a compelling alternative to Bitcoin for forward-thinking investors. Why analysts favor Ruvi AI over Bitcoin Bitcoin has established itself as a store of value, but its functionality is largely limited to being a crypto equivalent of gold. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, prioritizes real-world applications across industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance, ensuring scalable demand for its utility token. At its core, Ruvi AI solves practical problems by integrating AI-driven solutions with blockchain technology. Investors are attracted to this dual-purpose innovation that caters to future-facing industries. At a current presale price of $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI provides a rare opportunity for investors to secure significant returns. Experts predict its token price will rise to $0.07 post-presale, delivering 50% gains immediately. Looking further ahead, analysts anticipate Ruvi’s valuation will hit $1 per token, translating to an extraordinary 109x ROI for presale participants. Ruvi AI’s explosive start Ruvi AI is already making waves with its highly successful presale, which has raised over $1.8 million and garnered interest from more than 1,600 holders. This remarkable momentum highlights the growing confidence in Ruvi AI as a next-gen blockchain project. What makes Ruvi AI particularly compelling is its structured price roadmap, designed to deliver predictable returns. Unlike Bitcoin, which relies on macroeconomic trends and scarce supply for value increases, Ruvi AI’s presale sets a guaranteed price rise to $0.07 after Post Presale. This transparency eliminates speculation, giving investors a clear trajectory for growth. Unlock big gains with VIP investment tiers Ruvi AI further enhances its appeal with VIP investment tiers, which reward participants with bonus tokens based on their contributions. Here’s a breakdown of how these tiers magnify returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers provide substantial value for investors, creating opportunities to secure massive returns while Ruvi AI is still in its presale phase. Transparency and security build confidence What distinguishes Ruvi AI from many speculative projects is its commitment to transparency and security. Currently undergoing a CyberScope audit, Ruvi AI ensures that its platform is safe, reliable, and robust. This third-party audit is a major confidence booster for cautious investors seeking credible blockchain projects. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, a globally recognized platform, ensuring liquidity and smooth trading transitions when the token enters public markets. These proactive steps set Ruvi AI apart in terms of trustworthiness and investor accessibility. Real-world applications drive demand While Bitcoin’s primary use case revolves around being a decentralized store of value, Ruvi AI’s focus on practical solutions creates ongoing utility for its token. Here are some key areas where Ruvi AI is making an impact: Marketing Ruvi AI helps businesses improve ad targeting, enhance customer engagement, and optimize ROI. By bridging the gap between big data and actionable insights, it’s revolutionizing marketing campaigns. Entertainment Personalized content recommendations and blockchain-secure payment solutions bring efficiency and transparency to the entertainment industry. Ruvi AI empowers both creators and consumers while reshaping how digital content is monetized. Finance With advanced fraud detection, operational transparency, and efficiency tools, Ruvi AI is quickly establishing itself as a go-to solution for modern financial institutions. These use cases ensure that Ruvi AI remains relevant and valuable across various industries, driving consistent token demand in the long term. Why Ruvi AI is the smarter choice Bitcoin investors looking for exponential gains need to consider Ruvi AI’s revolutionary potential. With a presale price of $0.015, a guaranteed increase to $0.07, and a projected valuation of $1 per token, Ruvi AI offers a level of scalability and ROI that Bitcoin simply cannot match at this stage of its market maturity. Backed by a CyberScope audit, WEEX Exchange partnership, and powerful real-world applications, Ruvi AI combines security, transparency, and innovation. For investors seeking high-growth opportunities with transformative potential, now is the perfect time to join Ruvi AI’s revolution and reap the rewards of a project destined for greatness.

2025-06-17T16:55:24,"Cantor Fitzgerald launch coverage for public companies with Solana treasuries","Financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald has initiated coverage for public companies with Solana treasuries. In a note to the client, the firm’s analysts gave the coverage an overweight rating, suggesting that the companies are trading at a premium. According to the analysts led by Thomas Shinske , Solana has the potential to become the leading blockchain for digital finance, with more applications likely to surface on the network. Thus, they expect this will boost the value of companies holding SOL. The analysts wrote: “With increased liquidity making it easier to raise capital, Solana treasury companies can follow the ‘Saylor playbook’ and raise capital at a premium to NAV, purchase SOL, and increase SOL-per-share.” The coverage covers the three public companies with SOL treasuries: Sol Strategies (HODL), Upexi (UPX), and Defi Development (DFDV). Currently, their stocks are trading at C$2.48, $9.84, and $31.06 respectively. However, the analyst has set a price target of C$54 for HODL, $16 for UPX, and $45 for DFDV. According to Shinske, these companies can provide investors with exposure to SOL with tax benefits. He added that these companies can combine SOL treasuries with staking, allowing them to grow their SOL/share faster than BTC treasury companies. Interestingly, he identified DFDV as the best-positioned SOL treasury company due to its access to the US capital markets and crypto-native management team, noting that the company could raise $250 million at a 250% premium on average. However, he noted that Sol Strategies is the most forward-thinking SOL treasury company. Even though the company is not currently listed in the US, the analyst noted that it is already in the final stages of a US listing. This is the first time a Wall Street analyst will cover SOL treasury company. Cantor analysts say SOL is a better treasury asset than ETH Meanwhile, the Cantor analyst noted that Solana will outperform Ether because Solana technology is far better than Ethereum’s on every metric. Thus, it will be a future chain of choice for on-chain finance. As proof of this, the firm noted that developer growth in Solana has recently exceeded Ethereum’s and expects the trend to continue. Thus, they believe it makes more sense for companies to adopt SOL for their treasury over ETH. They added that companies that have chosen SOL for their treasuries believe that the asset could one day flip Ethereum despite ETH’s market cap currently having 2.5x its market cap. Interestingly, the analyst did not place Solana on the same level as Bitcoin, noting that Bitcoin has established itself as a foundational reserve asset. Still, a bet on treasury today is an investment in its long-term growth as the transactions network. They wrote: “If BTC has solidified itself as the foundational reserve currency, or asset, for the digital economy, Solana aims to be the technology that powers transactions and marketplaces in the digital economy.” The research note represents a significant endorsement of Solana at a time when the network has seen activity drop. This decline, due to reduced interest in memecoins and the growth of transaction volume on the BNB Chain due to Binance Alpha, has led some experts to be bearish on the network. Standard Chartered analysts noted last month that Solana might be a one-trick pony if it cannot use its advantage to attract other use cases where low-cost and high-speed transactions are required. More companies are buying SOL for treasuries Meanwhile, Cantor’s note appears to push more companies to adopt an SOL strategy. The latest to do that is Hong Kong-listed MemeStrategy , which bought 2,440 SOL tokens for around $369,000. Despite its minimal investment, the announcement was enough to send its stock soaring more than 28%, reaching HK$2.70. The company has also stated that it plans to provide SOL staking services and is bullish on Solana’s long-term potential. However, the faith in Solana has not yet been reflected in SOL performance, with the token down 3.24% in the last 24 hours, falling to $151.21. The token has decreased 11.74% in the past 30 days, declining 21.46% year-to-date. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-06-17T16:55:17,"Japanese Bitcoin Hoarder Metaplanet Surges Past Coinbase To Become Ninth-Largest Corporate BTC Holder After Latest Buying Spree","The Japanese hotel and investment firm Metaplanet (MTPLF) has now accumulated more Bitcoin ( BTC ) than that which is currently held by top US crypto exchange Coinbase. Metaplanet says that it added another 1,112 BTC to its books, bringing its total holdings to 10,000 BTC, making it the ninth-largest holder of the flagship crypto asset among public companies. BitcoinTreasuries.net data shows that Coinbase currently holds 9,267 Bitcoin, 733 fewer Bitcoin than Metaplanet. The public company with the largest Bitcoin holdings remains Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, with 592,100 Bitcoin. Says Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, “Metaplanet has acquired 1,112 BTC for ~$117.2 million at ~$105,435 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC yield of 266.1% year to date 2025. As of 6/16/2025, we hold 10,000 BTC acquired for ~$947 million at ~$94,697 per Bitcoin.” In 2024, the company said it would start buying the top crypto asset as part of a Bitcoin Treasury strategy. The aim is to reach 21,000 BTC in holdings by the end of 2026. Gerovich said previously that he “worries every day” that the company doesn’t own enough Bitcoin. “The window to buy won’t stay open forever. Soon, there will be two kinds of people: those who own Bitcoin and those who regret not buying it. At Metaplanet, we’re accumulating as much as we can so our shareholders can relax.” Metaplanet also operates a Tokyo hotel that it plans to renovate and rebrand into “the Bitcoin Hotel.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-17T16:47:01,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Market Sentiment Indicates A Potential Altcoin Season Next","Bitcoin’s early rally has historically always been the warm-up act before the real “bull market.” The real drama, especially for retail investors, begins when Ethereum starts gaining traction. That’s when the market starts whispering that the altcoin season is near, which is the phase where smaller coins start clocking 2x, 5x, even 10x moves in a matter of days. Despite Bitcoin’s strong upward moves this year, altcoins have largely remained quiet. But that silence may be ending. The broader sentiment, while still cautiously optimistic, has begun to lean in favor of altcoins. And with Ethereum’s demand building quietly in the background, many in the space believe the tide could finally be shifting toward a market where alts start running hard. Why This Altcoin Season Speculation Isn’t Just Hopeful Thinking The clearest evidence that altcoins are about to gain strength isn’t found in hopes or hype but in the form of a technical indicator called Bitcoin dominance. This metric measures how much of the total crypto market cap is absorbed by Bitcoin alone. When dominance is rising, Bitcoin is doing the heavy lifting. But when dominance stalls or begins falling, it usually means that liquidity is rotating into altcoins. That’s exactly what’s beginning to happen right now. Bitcoin dominance has hit a strong resistance zone just under 65%, and it’s already showing signs of rejection. As the metric begins trending down again, traders are preparing for what could be a heavy altcoin rotation. A drop toward the 64.2% level or below would likely confirm this shift. The second biggest crypto per market cap, Ethereum, has also managed to remain the heartbeat of altcoin activity. The recent accumulation of over 1.4 million ETH by major whale and shark wallets, even as retail has been selling, shows that smart money is positioning early. These wallets now control nearly 27% of Ethereum’s supply. Simultaneously, whale transactions in Ethereum-related protocols like ENS, L2 DeFi platforms, and USDC bridges have surged sharply, indicating increased strategic exposure to Ethereum’s ecosystem. 🐳 There are currently 6,392 wallets holding between 1K and 100K Ethereum. Over the past month alone, these key whale and shark wallets have rapidly added more coins as retail traders have taken profit.During these past 30 days, a net of +1.49M more $ETH has been accumulated by… pic.twitter.com/1hPBTuAOrL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 13, 2025 Interestingly, despite some retail selling, institutional appetite has been growing quite a bit. A 19-day inflow streak into spot ETH ETFs recently funneled over $1.3 billion into Ether products before finally cooling off. This wasn’t random enthusiasm, but a move that reflects belief in Ethereum’s longer-term role in the next market phase. Historically, altcoin seasons begin when retail exits and institutions accumulate. That’s what the current setup resembles. Best Crypto to Buy Now As the Altcoin Season Looks Like a Reality Bitcoin Hyper Every bull cycle chooses a mascot. During the present run, Bitcoin is that mascot, breaking ceilings while the rest of the market watches. Bitcoin Hyper leverages that spotlight while refusing to stay as just another memecoin with a BTC theme. The project builds a layer that slashes confirmation times to seconds, unlocks scalable smart contracts, and introduces fee levels the average phone user will accept. In an environment where analysts expect capital to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, Bitcoin Hyper offers a bridge rather than a divergence. Holders get exposure to Bitcoin’s brand strength along with the transactional speed that usually belongs to leaner networks. The protocol places an automated relay on-chain that verifies Bitcoin block headers within a separate virtual machine. That relay mints wrapped BTC instantly, making the asset liquid inside decentralized applications without waiting for slow twelve-minute intervals. Once traders decide the broader market has room for creativity, platforms that extend Bitcoin’s utility tend to absorb fresh liquidity first. Institutional desks can park treasury-sized positions without leaving Bitcoin’s narrative, retail wallets can finally use BTC for micropayments, and developers can experiment with tokens pegged to the largest asset by market value. Top crypto YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins and many others across social media channels have already endorsed it as an up-and-coming presale with huge potential. Investors looking for early entries before altcoin season accelerates may see Bitcoin Hyper as a strategic midway point. It keeps the spotlight of the dominant coin while positioning itself to benefit from the inevitable search for alternative high-growth venues that characterizes every maturing bull rally. These converging forces place the token on watchlists at major desks. SUBBD Scroll through any social platform and you will see a silent struggle. Creators grinding for reach while algorithms change rules overnight. SUBBD proposes a different contract. Instead of chasing advertising pennies or surrendering data, creators issue subscription keys on-chain that fans can buy, trade, or even lend. Behind the simple paywall lies a familiar experience for mainstream audiences, which is why SUBBD stands out as altcoin season approaches. Capital often hunts for coins linked to practical, non-speculative demand, and few utilities are clearer than direct fan support. The architecture keeps complexity hidden. Fans pay with familiar cards or stablecoins, the gateway handles conversion in the background, and the SUBBD token coordinates revenue sharing plus loyalty boosts. Every purchase raises the circulating utility of the asset because access passes live as smart tokens anchored to SUBBD liquidity pools. If a concert video goes viral next month, early pass holders can resell their slot, capturing upside that would normally flow only to the platform owner. Adoption does not require the viewer to understand wallets on day one. Email sign-in works, content unlocks, and a custodial vault holds the tokens until the user is ready to explore deeper. That hybrid approach invites millions who ignore crypto headlines yet spend daily on digital media. As the market pivots from narrative trades to tangible use cases, SUBBD writes itself into the story investors care about. Creators keep freedom, audiences gain real ownership. Solaxy Price chatter often circles around Ethereum first, then jumps to Solana, yet the rails connecting those ecosystems remain clunky. Solaxy treats that gap as an opportunity rather than a technical footnote. It deploys a dual execution layer that can post transactions to both chains without forcing users to choose sides. As Ethereum volume climbs, gas fees rise, and traders look for faster venues, Solaxy routes overflow toward Solana while preserving settlement on Ethereum for those who need it. The platform therefore rides two of the most influential narratives driving this looming altcoin season. The mechanism relies on optimistic rollups that synchronize state between the two networks every few minutes. Meanwhile, a directional liquidity engine monitors price corridors and seeds pooled assets where demand spikes. The result feels like a single exchange window even though orders may clear on separate chains. Developers appreciate that they can target either virtual machine with one tool set, saving weeks of porting work. Solaxy also introduces yield channels that automatically stake idle balances in whichever environment offers the higher base return. Users do not have to chase pools or bridge back and forth. Reward tokens compound in the background, adding a passive layer to what begins as simple swapping. $SOLX is now breaking records... 🚀53M RAISED! 🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/J3tguZnTNG — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 16, 2025 Thanks to all these features, SOLX managed to become one of the biggest and most successful presales this year with a meme-based theme. At the time of writing, it has raised upwards of $53 million. As Ethereum rallies and institutional flows push for scalable throughput, Solaxy positions itself as the conveyor belt moving value to the edges. When optimism toward altcoins erupts, infrastructure projects that smooth those paths often outperform, carrying assets across chains smoothly. Snorter Trying to grab a fresh altcoin the instant it surfaces can feel like chasing sparks in a storm. Snorter turns that scramble into a few taps inside Telegram. The bot listens for on-chain liquidity events, sweeps the order book before manual traders even load a chart, and settles each fill at Solana’s cut-rate fees. Copy trading sits one command away, letting newcomers trail seasoned hunters in real time without studying Solidity or order routing. At first glance, it sounds like a toy for hard-core speculators, yet the service is quietly courting a broader wave of users as institutional flow widens the gap between casual investors and high-speed desks. Retail portfolios swell when altcoin season kicks in, but so does volatility. Traditional interfaces lag, gas spikes, and slippage gouges profits. Snorter sidesteps those bottlenecks by anchoring trades to Solana’s low-latency network while still reading activity across Ethereum and upcoming Layer 2 hubs. Its routing engine chooses the cheapest path in the background, then pipes the result back to the Telegram chat where the request began. The experience feels more like messaging a friend than executing an algorithmic strategy, which is precisely why adoption curves bend upward when markets heat. For professionals, the appeal is different. They can script conditional orders, mirror wallet behavior from top-performing accounts, and distribute entries across multiple chains in seconds. Every bull run rewards the tools that help traders keep pace with accelerating price action, making it a project worth keeping on the watchlist and following very closely. Conclusion Market data now places Bitcoin dominance on the back foot while institutional bids on Ether keep climbing. Those two conditions often precede the first clear move in altcoins. Retail outflows from key wallets show many traders are still waiting for an obvious trigger, yet history suggests the best gains accrue to positions set before headlines confirm the trend. Assets backed by functional throughput, cross-chain access, and faster settlement tend to attract the earliest rotation of capital. The projects discussed above meet those practical benchmarks and could reward investors who prefer substance over speculation when the wider market finally pivots.

2025-06-17T16:40:47,"Geopolitical Risk: Iran Commander Issues Grave Warning of Escalation","BitcoinWorld Geopolitical Risk: Iran Commander Issues Grave Warning of Escalation In the often unpredictable world of global events, geopolitical developments can send ripples through financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. A recent report highlights a significant warning from a senior Iranian military commander, suggesting a potential escalation of attacks against Israel could be imminent. Understanding the Latest Geopolitical Risk According to a report by Odaily, citing Iran’s official news agency, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), a high-ranking Iranian military official has issued a stern warning. The commander stated that attacks targeting Israel are expected to intensify significantly in the coming hours. This statement comes amidst already heightened Geopolitical Risk in the region, following previous exchanges and ongoing tensions. Such warnings from senior military figures are typically taken seriously by analysts and governments worldwide, as they can signal a potential shift in the scale or nature of the conflict. Key points from the report: A senior Iranian commander made the statement. The warning points to an escalation of attacks. The escalation is expected within hours. The report cites Iran’s official news agency, IRNA. How Do Iran Israel Tensions Affect Global Markets? Periods of elevated Iran Israel Tensions historically correlate with increased uncertainty in global financial markets. Investors often react to potential conflict by moving away from riskier assets and towards perceived safe havens like gold or government bonds. The Middle East is a critical region for global energy supplies, and any instability there can directly impact oil prices, which in turn affect inflation and economic forecasts globally. Market reactions can include: Increased volatility across stocks, commodities, and currencies. Potential sell-offs in equity markets. Rise in the price of safe-haven assets. Disruptions to supply chains, particularly energy. While the direct economic ties between the conflicting parties might seem limited on a global scale, the broader implications of regional instability, potential involvement of other actors, and impact on critical resources like oil mean that these tensions have a wide-reaching effect on investor sentiment and market stability. Exploring the Impact on the Crypto Market Amidst Middle East Conflict The relationship between geopolitical events and the Crypto Market Impact is a topic of ongoing debate. Some argue that Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ could serve as a hedge against geopolitical instability and inflation, similar to traditional safe havens. The idea is that it operates outside the traditional financial system and is not tied to any single country’s economy or political stability. However, in practice, the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has often shown correlation with traditional risk assets like tech stocks. During periods of broad market fear driven by events like the current Middle East Conflict , cryptocurrencies have sometimes seen price declines alongside equities, as investors liquidate assets across the board to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Key considerations for crypto investors: Bitcoin’s safe-haven narrative is tested during geopolitical crises. Correlation with traditional markets can lead to downside risk. Increased volatility in crypto prices is likely during uncertain times. Global events can affect investor sentiment and adoption rates. While specific attacks or escalations might not have an immediate, direct technical impact on blockchain networks, the resulting fear and uncertainty among global investors can certainly influence trading behavior and price movements in the highly speculative crypto market. Navigating Potential Market Volatility Given the warning of potential escalation and the inherent uncertainty of geopolitical situations, investors should be prepared for increased Market Volatility . This applies not only to traditional assets but also to the crypto market. Actionable insights for investors: Stay Informed: Keep track of reliable news sources regarding the geopolitical situation and market reactions. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how comfortable you are with potential price swings and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Consider Diversification: Ensure your investments are not overly concentrated in assets that might be particularly vulnerable to geopolitical shocks. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Volatility can trigger panic selling. Stick to your long-term investment strategy rather than making impulsive moves based on short-term news. Understand Crypto’s Role: Recognize that while crypto offers unique features, it is not immune to macro global events and market sentiment shifts. Geopolitical events are significant external factors that can influence market dynamics, often rapidly and with little warning. While impossible to predict the exact outcome or market reaction, being aware of the risks and having a prepared mindset can help navigate turbulent times. What Does This Mean for the Future Crypto Market Impact? The current situation underscores how interconnected global finance is, even for emerging asset classes like cryptocurrency. The Crypto Market Impact of geopolitical events like rising Iran Israel Tensions serves as a reminder that while crypto operates on decentralized technology, its valuation and adoption are still heavily influenced by global macroeconomic and political forces. As the situation in the Middle East develops, market participants will be closely watching for signs of de-escalation or further conflict. Each development will likely contribute to the ongoing narrative about crypto’s role in a world facing various economic and political uncertainties. Ultimately, the ability of crypto to function as a true safe haven during crises remains a subject of observation and debate. Events like these provide real-world scenarios to study how this nascent asset class behaves under pressure. Summary A senior Iranian commander’s warning of escalating attacks on Israel within hours introduces a significant layer of Geopolitical Risk into the global landscape. Such developments in the Middle East Conflict naturally heighten Iran Israel Tensions and are expected to increase Market Volatility across traditional financial systems. While the Crypto Market Impact is complex and debated, historical trends suggest that cryptocurrencies are unlikely to be entirely insulated from the fear and uncertainty that grips global markets during such times. Investors are advised to stay informed, assess their risk exposure, and approach the coming hours and days with caution and a clear strategy.

2025-06-17T16:30:00,"Experts projecting BTC nears $112K again—but MUTM stuns with 12,000+ holders","As Bitcoin (BTC) approaches the $112,000 mark again, the crypto market is heating up with renewed excitement. Historically, such major price milestones have triggered a wave of capital rotation from Bitcoin (BTC) into promising altcoins—especially those under $0.10 with clear use cases and growth potential. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the spotlight. While Bitcoin (BTC) grabs headlines with price speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining ground through real progress, delivering strong presale momentum, and building a functional lending ecosystem from the ground up. Dual lending models: P2C and P2P at the core Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed as a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol. The system enables lenders to deposit digital assets like USDC, ETH, or AVAX into liquidity pools, where they begin earning interest automatically. Interest rates are determined dynamically, depending on pool usage. As more borrowers take overcollateralized loans from a pool, interest rates rise. This market-driven rate model incentivizes new lenders to join high-performing pools and discourages over-borrowing, allowing the system to regulate itself without any centralized control. Alongside this automated pool-based model, users will also be able to participate in P2P lending. Here, individual lenders and borrowers can define terms directly with one another, creating flexible, custom-tailored loan agreements. This peer-to-peer feature is especially relevant for lending or borrowing tokens not usually accepted in traditional DeFi pools, including higher-risk assets like PEPE or SHIB. Both models will be powered entirely by smart contracts, enabling users to interact directly with the protocol without relying on third parties. It’s a design that brings complete transparency, flexibility, and decentralization to the lending landscape. Users in Mutuum’s liquidity pools will instantly receive mtTokens that represent the value of their deposited assets. These mtTokens, such as mtDAI or mtUSDC, will accumulate interest over time and can be traded on secondary markets or used within the protocol for further borrowing. The mtTokens provide constant liquidity for users without needing to exit their lending positions, unlocking greater flexibility and utility. A portion of the protocol’s profits will be used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This buyback mechanism is designed to increase token demand over time while delivering consistent value to long-term participants. It also aligns incentives between users and the growth of the protocol—something that speculative tokens simply don’t offer. A regulatory-ready foundation with CertiK Audit completed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already taken significant steps to ensure security and transparency. The project completed a CertiK audit, using manual review and static analysis, and received a Token Scan Score of 80.00. The audit began on February 25, 2025, and was revised on May 20, 2025, confirming that the team is focused on deploying a well-tested, secure system ahead of launch. At a time when investors are increasingly cautious about smart contract risk, this layer of verification sets Mutuum apart from other low-market-cap DeFi tokens. While most DeFi protocols still operate on congested and expensive Layer-1 networks, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed with full Layer-2 integration. This will significantly reduce transaction fees and improve speed for users engaging in lending and borrowing. The choice to build on Layer-2 solves major usability issues in decentralized finance, making Mutuum more accessible and efficient—especially for smaller investors who are often priced out of Ethereum-based transactions. Among the key features in development is Mutuum’s upcoming decentralized stablecoin, which will be fully overcollateralized and backed by assets already held within the protocol. Unlike traditional stablecoins that rely on fiat reserves or centralized backers, Mutuum’s stable asset will be minted directly from on-chain collateral, ensuring full transparency and algorithmic supply adjustment. This stablecoin will not only offer users a more reliable borrowing option but will also strengthen the protocol’s treasury by redirecting interest payments into the ecosystem. It’s a system designed to increase platform sustainability while opening up new utility paths for MUTM holders. Why MUTM token holders will benefit Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply of 4 billion tokens. Its utility is deeply integrated into every part of the protocol. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) users will have access to passive income through staking, influence over protocol decisions, and eligibility to participate in safety modules that generate dividends. At the current price of $0.03, early buyers will soon gain exposure with extensive built-in utility and a protocol backed by a functioning roadmap. Upon launch, the planned listing price is $0.06. An investor allocating $1,500 during Phase 5 receives 50,000 MUTM. When the price reaches $0.90—aligned with realistic valuations in the DeFi sector—this allocation becomes $45,000. According to the project roadmap, a beta version of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform is scheduled to go live in parallel with the token listing. This early access phase will give users the opportunity to test the platform, engage in real lending and borrowing, and begin staking rewards. To increase awareness and participation, the team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway campaign—driving new users to explore the presale and become part of the early community. While Bitcoin (BTC) continues its upward march toward $112,000, investors are looking beyond the headlines for high-utility, high-upside opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is answering that demand with real DeFi functionality, smart contract-powered lending, passive income systems, and a rapidly growing user base.

2025-06-17T16:14:19,"Blockchain Group Plans to Raise €7.2M to Buy More Bitcoin","Blockchain Group has announced plans to raise €7.2 million, about $8.3 million to buy more Bitcoin (BTC). This is part of a larger goal to invest up to $342 million in Bitcoin over time through its at-the-market (ATM) offering program. The company’s move reflects a rising trend, as more firms add Bitcoin to their financial reserves. Blockchain Group To Fund Bitcoin Purchases With New Shares During the official announcement , the Paris-listed firm said it will issue about 1.6 million new shares to fund this acquisition. The average price for each share is expected to be €4.49, equivalent to $5.19. These funds will support its ongoing Bitcoin acquisition efforts. This move follows last week’s announcement of a larger program with TOMAB, a French asset manager and investor in the company. As part of that plan, the company also revealed plans to raise an additional €9.7 million, worth $11.2 million, through a mix of equity and convertible bond issuance. These steps show the company’s clear focus on building a strong Bitcoin treasury. Meanwhile, Matthew Sigel of VanEck recently raised concerns about small-cap companies claiming to build significant crypto investments. He said many of these firms have weak finances and low market value. Their crypto investment announcements may boost stock prices rather than reflect real business plans. Blockchain Group Joins Growing List of Major BTC Holders This move is part of a broader trend where more companies hold Bitcoin as a key treasury asset . Once viewed as too unstable for corporate finances, Bitcoin is now gaining acceptance as a long-term store of value. Many now see the digital coin as a long-term store of value and a safe haven during economic crises. Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, which recently added 10,100 BTC to its balanced sheet is leading the trend. The Nasdaq-listed company now owns 592,100 BTC, the most significant amount held by any publicly traded firm. Meanwhile, according to public data, Blockchain Groups holds a modest stash of 1,471 BTC. Market Reaction and Price Movements Despite the news, Blockchain Group’s stock dropped more than 4% and is now trading at around €5.53 on Euronext Growth Paris. However, the market remains open, and the stock could move further depending on investor reaction. Bitcoin also dipped slightly, falling 1.00% over the last 24 hours. It is currently trading at $105,634, according to CoinMarketCap data.

2025-06-17T16:12:08,"Why Doesn't the FED Cut Interest Rates? What to Expect Tomorrow? Analysts Explained! ""There's Only One Reason for This!""","One of the expected events that will trigger a rise in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins is the US Federal Reserve (FED) starting to cut interest rates. At this point, tomorrow's FED June interest rate decision will be more important, while the general expectation in the market is that the FED will keep interest rates constant. While the possibility of the FED making a surprise move is almost non-existent, analysts argue that the FED is actually in a position to cut interest rates. FED May Cut Interest Rates But…! Accordingly, analyst Nick Timiraos said the FED will keep interest rates steady and evaluate the impact of tariffs on inflation. Nick Timiraos expects the Fed to keep interest rates on hold this week despite recent inflation improvements, amid ongoing concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on price expectations. According to the analyst, although inflation data has moderated in the last three months, Fed members remain concerned about how tariff-related cuts could affect future inflation data. At this point, the Fed will continue its cautious approach, according to the analyst. The Reason FED Doesn't Cut Interest Rates Is Only Political! Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya also claimed that the FED could cut interest rates right now, but it did not do so for just one reason. Speaking on the All-In Podcast, Chamath Palihapitiya argued that the Fed will not be cutting interest rates in the near future, pointing to politics as the reason for this. Stating that the possibility of a rate cut in the summer months is quite low, the famous name argued that the FED could make a 100 basis point cut right now. Stating that such a move would reduce the US debt by $300 billion, the famous name claimed that it would be good for the US and the economy in every way, not just debt savings. “If there's a numerical justification for lowering interest rates and it has all these positive effects for the U.S. economy, why not do it? “The only answer is political. The bottom line is that the Fed is being cautious for political reasons.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Doesn't the FED Cut Interest Rates? What to Expect Tomorrow?

2025-06-17T16:10:47,"Brazilian stock exchange begins trading Ethereum and Solana futures contracts in US dollars","B3, a Brazilian stock exchange, has started trading Ethereum and Solana futures contracts in US dollars. The firm announced the groundbreaking development Monday, stating that quoted prices for the products will reference Nasdaq Ether and Solana indices. With this, B3 is consolidating its reach in the crypto derivatives sector as it already offers Bitcoin futures contracts with around $4 billion in daily trading volume on the exchange. Derivative contracts expose investors to the expected price adjustments for crypto assets without owning a single coin. The exchange wrote: “With the new cryptoasset futures, B3 meets the growing market and investor demand for products with exposure to cryptocurrencies, bringing more innovation and sophistication to products.” The announcement added that each unit of the Ethereum futures contract will be 0.25 ETH while the Solana contract unit will be 5 SOL. Thus, this will make the product more accessible while offering users familiar with crypto a safe and regulated way to trade on price volatility. B3 has a long history of offering crypto-focused products for investors, with the exchange launching its first digital assets-related product, HASH11, in 2021. It now has 21 crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs) of ETFs available for investors. B3 announces changes in Bitcoin futures contract size Meanwhile, the stock exchange has also reduced the unit size of its Bitcoin futures contract by ten times, with a unit now worth 0.01 BTC (approximately 6,000 Brazilian Real). This follows approval by the Brazilian securities regulator (CVM). This move is part of its efforts to make the Bitcoin futures contract, which launched in 2024, more accessible, not only for Brazilian traders but also for international investors. For instance, US investors have enjoyed access to Bitcoin Future and Bitcoin Future Scrolling products on B3 since May. Unlike the Ethereum and Solana futures contract, the Bitcoin futures trade in Brazilian Real and the reduction in unit size also took effect on June 16, the same day as the launch of the two new products. In one year of having Bitcoin futures, 41 million contracts were negotiated, and in April 2025 alone, 4 million were negotiated. Brazil’s crypto sector continues to grow With many countries still struggling to understand and regulate crypto, B3’s new products capture how Brazil is growing into a major crypto hub in Latin America. By pricing its new products in US Dollars, the exchange particularly shows its interest in attracting international investors to the country. Interestingly, the country has seen significant levels of adoption as it ranks ninth globally on the Chainalysis Global Adoption Index for 2024 while ranking second in value received for the Latin America region with $90.3 billion. Brazilian fintech Meliuz also recently adopted the Bitcoin treasury. However, there are regulatory pressures from several angles. The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has expressed concerns about stablecoin use in the country, claiming it enables money laundering and tax evasion. It is now making efforts to regulate stablecoins, with recently proposed rules that could limit the transfer of stablecoins across wallets. However, stakeholders have warned that rules must not overregulate the sector to avoid killing innovation. Still, more setbacks might be coming with the recent removal of tax exemptions on capital gains for small-scale crypto holders. The move, part of new tax policies under Provisional Measure 1303, imposed a flat 17.5% tax on all gains from crypto assets. However, the new rules have already faced pushback from crypto stakeholders who believe that they could affect the competitiveness of the country’s crypto sector. Lawmakers have queried the new tax regime for not involving stakeholders, with some even pushing to repeal it. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The trader, known as AguilaTrades on X, entered a bitcoin long position at $106,000, and sat through at Monday's high of $108,800 before the largest cryptocurrency took a tumble to trade recently around $104,000. Bitcoin volatility has been relatively low for months, with the price ranging between the $100,000 level of support and record highs around $110,000. That hasn't perturbed derivatives traders, who are continually betting on upside with leverage, subsequently getting chopped in a tight range. It's not the first time AguilaTrades has recorded a losing trade at these levels. Last week they were up $5.8 million on a BTC long before losing $12.5 million, according to Lookonchain . On paper the trade has credentials because BTC has managed to remain above $100,000 despite escalating conflict in the Middle East, which is typically a catalyst for downside in risk assets. However, remaining agnostic to price action in this range and simply buying support and selling resistance would have yielded far greater results. Bitcoin has been trading in this range since May 9 with numerous attempts at breaking support and resistance along the way.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/17/hyperliquid-trader-turns-usd10m-profit-into-usd2-5m-loss-as-bitcoin-falls,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING","Finance|Cryptocurrency Derivatives|Bitcoin Trading|Leverage|News",cryptocompare

During this renewed upward action, there has been a significant uptick in on-chain activity, with active wallet addresses rising at a rapid rate. Explosive Rise In XRP Active Addresses XRP’s price has risen sharply, breaking past key resistance levels following the growing bullish sentiment across the market. At the same time, the leading network witnessed exponential growth as its user base continued to expand. A recent report from Santiment, a market intelligence and on-chain data platform, revealed that XRP Ledger is experiencing a sharp increase in activity. Particularly, the number of active wallet addresses on the ledger has grown strongly in recent weeks. This significant uptick in active addresses on the ledger suggests a possible shift in user engagement and network utility. According to the on-chain platform, the ledger is exhibiting serious signs of growth from the standpoint of key stakeholders and usage. Such a bullish development implies a resurgence in investors’ interest in XRP as the altcoin slowly recovers its upward trend. The dramatic surge in wallet activity, whether due to institutional testing, growing retail interest, or increased adoption , represents a turning point for the network and its price action. Data from the platform shows there have been more than 295,000 interacting XRP wallet addresses on average every day in the past week, indicating a robust conviction among retail and institutional investors. Prior to the past week, the ledger’s daily average of interacting wallet addresses was approximately 35,000 to 40,000. Specifically, this range, considered normal, was observed for over three months. While the active addresses count has risen sharply, accumulation among key investors appears to have increased. Santiment highlighted that whales and sharks have been purchasing the altcoin rapidly during the same time frame. The platform revealed that more than 2,700 whale and shark wallets currently contain at least 1 million XRP for the first time in the asset’s 12+ year history. When these cohorts accumulate strongly, it implies a robust conviction in the coin’s long-term prospects as they position themselves for an impending rally. A Short-Term Upward Move Brewing With large investors’ interest in XRP growing, the development is likely to influence price spikes in the short term. Crypto analyst AlienOvicho has forecasted a potential short-term rally to higher resistance levels despite the last pullback. Following a flawless retest of the damaged channel, the analyst stated that the altcoin bounced higher. As bullish momentum builds, the token is currently targeting a brief surge toward the $2.35 and $2.41 range. However, for the asset to reclaim these levels, it must hold above the $2.10 support level. As long as it holds above this area during the subsequent pullback, the structure is constructive and the bulls remain in control.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-heats-up/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|AlienOvicho|Santiment|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Whales And Sharks|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T15:55:50,"Thailand approves a five-year income tax exemption on crypto","The Thai cabinet has approved a personal income tax exemption on profits from trading digital assets through regulated exchanges. The plan has been confirmed by the Deputy Finance Minister of Thailand, Chulaphan Amornvivat, and was publicly announced . The move aligns with the nation’s effort to establish its footprint in the blockchain and digital currency space across Southeast Asia. The new policy, which takes immediate effect, applies to individual investors trading on authorized platforms and will remain in place until 2029, according to the Ministry of Finance. Previously, such profits from crypto trading were part of a person’s income and were subject to progressive tax rates. That was a source of tension for both small-time investors and big players, some of whom looked to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Now, with the tax removed, the Thai government believes it will be able to foster a way for fresh capital to flow into the market and encourage the global adoption of blockchain technology. The waiver is limited to transactions on government-approved platforms. The new tax relief will not apply to unauthorized exchange investors; some could even face fines . Thailand welcomes the world to crypto investment The tax-free period is one aspect of a broader national initiative to turn Thailand into a hub for digital asset innovation. The government aims to promote a strong financial technology sector, including cryptocurrencies, asset-backed or “tokenized” currencies, and blockchain-based financial services. Thailand has gradually been opening to digital finance. The SEC endorsed using stablecoins such as Tether’s USDt and Circle’s USDC on regulated venues in early 2024. The country is also considering crypto-tied debit and credit card services for tourists as part of a broader commitment to digitizing spending and increasing financial inclusion . Heavyweights in the industry will see the tax policy as a game-changing event. Social media reaction has been almost universally good. Crypto influencers and traders on X (formerly Twitter) describe the move as a breath of fresh air when contrasted with restrictive regimes in other countries. Thailand’s largest digital asset exchange, Bitkub, has the most to gain, particularly after Bitcoin’s recent price hike. With more than 5 million registered users and daily trading volumes approaching 2 billion baht ($54 million), it’s in a good place for that rebound in investor appetite. Thailand balances crypto tax relief with tight oversight The policy has generated optimism but also some wariness among experts. Removing taxes from a highly volatile and speculative asset class might cause a chronically stretched government to lose some much-needed funds – especially as digital assets are increasingly being used and viewed as “store of value” vehicles. Others also caution that bringing in speculative capital may disrupt Thailand’s financial markets with inadequate regulation. Additionally, there is worry about investor protection, particularly for less sophisticated retail traders who may be attracted to the siren song of tax-free profits without a real grasp on the risks. Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has responded swiftly. The commission said it would maintain onerous licensing standards and closely monitor the market. In the last few months, the SEC has moved against unlicensed crypto platforms, such as Bybit and OKX, preventing them from serving Thai users. The Thai cabinet has also agreed on changes to the Digital Asset Business Act to protect crypto investors better, enhance cybercrime surveillance, and increase the transparency of the cryptocurrency industry.

JPMorgan’s latest report reveals that the Bitcoin network’s hashrate has hit an all-time high—often seen as a sign of long-term confidence from miners and big-money players alike. While price action remains tense, this surge in network strength hints at a possible shift in momentum. As BTC stabilizes, eyes are turning to which other cryptocurrencies could ride the wave next. In this analysis, we break down Bitcoin’s current setup and explore where the smart money may flow next. Bitcoin Price Struggles as Bulls Show Weakness Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current range sits between roughly $102,000 and $110,000, marking a slight tension in its movement. Recent data points to bulls losing their grip, with prices dipping about 3.7% in the past week. The coin is approaching the support level near $98,600, while resistance looms at around $114,000. With an RSI under 40, bearish tendencies appear stronger now. However, over the last month, Bitcoin has grown by nearly 3%, showing potential for resurgence. If bullish momentum gains, it could aim for the second resistance, just over $121,000, capturing a near 20% gain from the current lower price of $102,000. Yet, for now, cautious optimism prevails. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rebound, paired with record-breaking hashrate growth, sends a clear signal: institutions are far from bearish. Despite short-term price hesitations, the long-term fundamentals are strengthening—laying the groundwork for a broader market recovery. If BTC pushes beyond key resistance levels, it could trigger a wider rally across altcoins. For now, cautious optimism prevails, but with deep-pocket investors stepping in and network health surging, Bitcoin’s next big move may be closer than it looks—and other major coins may soon follow.

2025-06-17T15:32:44,"Quantum Biopharma Adds 100,000 XRP to its Crypto Treasury","Quantum Biopharma, a publicly traded Canadian biopharmaceutical company, has expanded its digital asset holdings with the purchase of 100,000 XRP, according to a report shared by crypto analyst Xaif on X. Though the company has not yet released an official press statement, the move adds to its growing crypto treasury and signals deepening interest in Ripple’s native token from institutional players. At XRP’s current trading price of $2.20, the acquisition represents an investment of approximately $220,000. This latest addition builds on Quantum’s broader crypto strategy, which has already seen it allocate millions to digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) over the past six months. Inside Quantum’s Crypto Playbook Quantum Biopharma entered the crypto space in December 2024 with an initial $1 million investment in BTC and other selected tokens. On May 19, 2025, the company expanded its digital portfolio to $4.5 million, followed by another capital injection on June 10, bringing its total crypto holdings to $5 million. The XRP purchase is believed to be part of this most recent treasury expansion, as per Xaif’s disclosure. Just In: Quantum Biopharma has added 100,000 $XRP to its crypto treasury! Pharma meets crypto — are more institutions eyeing #XRP next? #Ripple #XRPL #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/MjM8v5Rm9W — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 17, 2025 All assets are held in custody by BitGo, a trusted institutional provider offering cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and regulatory-grade compliance. This custodial arrangement ensures the company’s crypto holdings remain secure and auditable. Quantum’s CEO, Zeeshan Saeed, has previously emphasized that crypto is not merely a speculative bet, but a deliberate part of the company’s treasury management strategy. According to Saeed, the goals include protecting shareholder value, hedging against currency depreciation—especially the Canadian dollar—and exploring opportunities for yield generation through staking where applicable. Why XRP? XRP’s inclusion in the portfolio highlights the company’s interest in assets with real-world utility. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily viewed as a store of value, XRP is designed for fast, low-cost international transactions and is already used by financial institutions and payment providers through Ripple’s growing network. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Quantum’s decision to add XRP comes when the token regains institutional attention, buoyed by ongoing regulatory clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships across the financial sector. Though not XRP’s highest historical price, its current valuation of $2.20 reflects the asset’s resilience. A Pioneer in Pharma-Fintech Integration Quantum Biopharma stands out in the pharmaceutical industry for its proactive adoption of blockchain assets. While most biotech and pharma firms have avoided exposure to crypto due to perceived volatility and regulatory uncertainty, Quantum is carving a different path—one that blends traditional healthcare with modern finance. The company’s crypto strategy has also been well-received by investors. Quantum’s stock (QNTM) has attracted increasing attention from both individual and institutional investors since its initial investment in December 2024, thanks to its forward-thinking financial strategy. As the line between traditional finance and digital assets continues to blur, Quantum Biopharma’s latest XRP acquisition sends a clear message: blockchain-based finance is no longer confined to the tech sector. With this move, the company strengthens its position as a leader in integrating decentralized tools into legacy industries.

2025-06-17T15:30:52,"XRP Must Complete Right Shoulder Before Takeoff—But How Low First?","XRP bulls appear to be facing one last test of conviction before the market’s next explosive phase, according to CryptoInsightUK’s video analysis released on 16 June. The British analyst argues that the token is sculpting an inverse head-and-shoulders formation whose right shoulder “still needs to form around the high-$1.80s” before any sustained rally can commence. How Low Must XRP Go? In the broadcast, he emphasised that “dense liquidity is below us,” pointing to a confluence of resting bids and stop-loss clusters between roughly $1.92 and $1.80. “I still think it comes down to make the right shoulder which is around 1.88,” he said, adding that a swift wash-out into that pocket would “flush the lows, tap in there and send it.” At present, XRP is changing hands near $2.24, up about 3% over the past 24 hours, which implies a prospective drawdown of roughly 20% if the market fulfills his downside scenario. From the analyst’s vantage point, such a retreat is less a cause for alarm than a prerequisite for the next major leg higher: “If we come down first, we’ve done the downside part. Otherwise I’m still going to be worried about going down even if we come up to $2.42 or higher.” Related Reading: What Are The Implications For XRP If Ripple Captures 14% Of SWIFT’s Volume? He linked the bearish short-term bias to structural forces beyond the XRP Ledger’s ecosystem. Bitcoin dominance, he noted, has crept toward a historical inflection zone that previously triggered alt-seasons: “Anywhere in this box could be the start of alt-season… That would probably coincide with Bitcoin dropping to between $100,000 and $93,000.” A dominance spike fed by a late-cycle Bitcoin dip, he argued, would typically inflict outsized percentage losses on major altcoins—including XRP—before liquidity rotates back into them. Within XRP’s own order book, CryptoInsightUK highlighted a “liquidity vacuum” created by May’s capitulation candle. Although the token has since retraced most of that single-session collapse, he described the rebound as “choppy corrective price action,” lacking the conviction and volume that accompanied earlier impulse waves. The right-shoulder flush, in his view, would neutralise residual leverage, particularly among traders who re-loaded longs too aggressively during the $2.15–$2.40 bounce. How High Can XRP Explode? The inverse head-and-shoulders thesis also features prominently on his long-range chart, stretching back to mid-May. The analyst first published the pattern on X, showing a left shoulder near $2.42, a head at $1.47, and a neckline just above $2.50. Completing a symmetrical right shoulder near $1.88 would, by classical pattern-measuring rules, project an upside target above $3.50—a level not visited since late-2021’s cycle top. Related Reading: Still Sleeping On XRP? Analyst Says $8 Breakout Is ‘Just Waiting’ Liquidity dynamics across the broader market reinforce his caution. Open interest in perpetual swaps for Ether, he observed, remains “as high as it’s ever been,” suggesting that any sudden drop in majors could spark a forced-liquidation cascade across altcoin pairs. “These people will be flushed out,” he warned, calling attention to negative-funding episodes that hint at an overcrowded short base waiting to be squeezed—once the final downside pocket has been filled. Despite the near-term jitters, CryptoInsightUK reiterated a resolutely bullish macro stance. “The next stage I’m most certain about is that we’re going to go significantly higher for crypto,” he told viewers. Drawing parallels with gold’s record weekly close, he argued that an undercurrent of global risk aversion is quietly supporting non-sovereign stores of value, positioning both Bitcoin and XRP for accelerated appreciation once the technical reset concludes. For long-term holders, his advice was unequivocal: avoid wholesale portfolio shifts and instead treat any sub-$2.00 wick as a final accumulation window. “Dollar-cost averaging from here is a good thing to do,” he said, revealing that 97% of his own capital remains in spot positions, with only a single-digit percentage reserved for surgical bids in the $1.80–$1.92 zone. Whether XRP respects that script will become clear in the days ahead. Should the market indeed sweep into the high-$1.80s and rebound with the aggressive thrust the analyst expects, the right shoulder will be complete—and the runway clear—for the long-awaited take-off. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23.

The project has raised $804,511 so far. Husky Inu (HINU) Registers Latest Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) has registered the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00018045 to $0.00018098. The jump comes at a testing time for the broader crypto ecosystem, as escalating tensions in the Middle East have put pressure on the market. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies registered a steep decline on Monday after starting the week positively. The price jump is part of Husky Inu’s HINU) pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The pre-launch phase allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date draws closer. It is the next strategic step in the Husky Inu roadmap, designed to raise additional capital to fund ongoing development, platform improvements, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a dynamic pricing strategy, allowing the project to increase the token price every two days. The phase will end once the project meets its fundraising goal or the HINU tokens sell out. Another Milestone Reached Husky Inu’s dynamic pricing strategy has allowed the project to raise the price of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds faster while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering the project’s growing community. The pre-launch phase saw the project cross the $750,000 milestone on May 16. The project crossed the $800,000 milestone over the weekend and has raised $804,511 so far. Markets Tumble Meanwhile, the crypto market turned bearish as Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens traded in the red. Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $108,000 on Monday but lost momentum as tensions in the Middle East escalated. As a result, it declined sharply and is down over 2%, trading around $105,120. Ethereum (ETH) has also registered an uptick in bearish sentiment, with the price down nearly 4% over the past 24 hours. ETH currently trades around $2,545.

2025-06-17T15:12:16,"This Key Level Holds Key to Unlocking Bitcoin’s Next Bull Run: Analyst","Bitcoin’s recent consolidation above the $104,000 mark may be more than just a pause; it could be the final checkpoint before a new all-time high, according to leading market analyst Rekt Capital. As the crypto market braces for a major move, the king cryptocurrency’s ability to hold this critical level could determine whether bulls finally take the wheel or sellers reclaim dominance. The $104,400 Litmus Test In a newsletter published on June 16, Rekt Capital pointed out that BTC has now spent six consecutive weeks retesting the $104,400 level as support. According to the pseudonymous market watcher, the prolonged retest follows Bitcoin’s breakout from a multi-month “re-accumulation range.” He reminded investors that BTC took over 240 days to break its post-halving range earlier this year. Holding above $104,400 on weekly closes is paramount: “It’s difficult to talk about lower prices until the $104,400 level breaks down,” they stated. Despite “brutal” sentiment and exhaustion among traders, the actual price pullback from recent highs has been modest at just -10%, representing more of a “time-based capitulation” rather than a price-driven plunge. In their estimation, failure to hold this level risks a deeper correction. At the same time, sustained support could pave the way to challenge the final major resistance near $108,890, pushing the asset into what he called “Price Discovery Uptrend 2.” “As long as BTC holds $104400, then it is positioned for upside over time,” declared the analyst. Though sluggish, the transition is notable for producing higher lows and diamond-shaped formations, technical signals that often precede strong upward movements. Market Behavior Even geopolitical jitters caused by the ongoing military conflict between Israel and Iran have failed to derail Bitcoin’s structural support seriously , further strengthening its bullish case. At the time of writing, BTC was trading around $105,569, a 2% drop over the past 24 hours. It also shaved about 3.4% from its value in the last seven days, while maintaining a 60.2% gain across 12 months. A tightening consolidation near the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of $111,814 could also signal growing tension, with investor Daan Crypto Trades noting that the monthly range is “extremely likely” to break in June. He warned that a “large move is coming in the next couple of weeks,” even as on-chain data shared by Axel Adler Jr. revealed a sustained drop in Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) Momentum below zero, indicating reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. Coupled with a continued decline in exchange-held BTC, the setup points toward a market primed for supply shocks.
