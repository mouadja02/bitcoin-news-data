2025-06-17T15:58:45,"Coinbase Seeks US Approval to Launch Tokenized Stocks, Details","Per a report from Reuters, crypto exchange Coinbase is currently seeking approval to offer tokenized stocks on its platform. The trading venue is in talks and awaiting the greenlight from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Coinbase to Expand its Products According to the report, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, stated that Coinbase will provide access to ‘tokenized equities’ by leveraging blockchain technology. Thus, the crypto exchange might expand into a new line of business and become a competitor to Robinhood, Revolut, and similar platforms. Grewal told Reuters that ‘tokenized equities’ have become a ‘top priority’ for the crypto exchange. This product would allow its users to gain exposure to the US financial markets, but without directly purchasing or going through the requirements to buy the stock. Instead, users would hold tokenized versions of these assets. Coinbase and other companies in the legacy and crypto industry are keen to offer these products to on-board new users, reduce costs, and provide faster transactions for its users. The US SEC declined to comment on this potential expansion. However, Reuters noted that currently the US lacks a market for trading ‘tokenized equities.’ Thus, if Coinbase gets the approval it could become the first to offer this product in the country, opening the door for more exchanges to diversify their offerings. Moreover, the report noted the change in the US SEC and in the Federal Government regarding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In the previous administration, Coinbase, Kraken, Binance.US, and several DeFi protocols were targeted by the regulator for allegedly offering ‘unregistered securities’ in the country. However, less than a year later and under the Trump administration, the country has changed its approach to a more favorable stance regarding the nascent sector. Coinbase’s CLO claims that the platform has already filed a request to the SEC, but they are still waiting for its approval. Grewal stated: With a no action letter, an issuer of a tokenized equity or a platform that wishes to offer secondary trading in those equities can have some confidence, some comfort, that the SEC has adopted its view of why this product is compliant. It’s that confidence that has been lacking so far, and I think really held back a lot of the institutional adoption. The New Meta in Crypto? There has been a lot of buzz in the crypto market regarding equities. Earlier this week, Justin Sun, founder of the TRON blockchain, inked a deal to take its native token TRX to the US stock exchange. The deal, supported by a company linked to Donald Trump, will take form via a merger with an already existing company trading in the US. This is just one of the many deals and potential partnerships looking to take crypto into the US financial markets. As Nic Carter, General Partner at Castle Island Ventures, stated the narrative currently dominating crypto, and the one more likely to take control of the market in the next year, is simply stocks. Carter stated: Most of my crypto trading GCs just talk about stocks now. the new meta is literally just stocks.

2025-06-17T15:40:48,"Bitcoin Rebounds as Institutions Buy the Dip — JPMorgan Says Hashrate Hits Record","Bitcoin is making a quiet but notable comeback, with institutional buyers stepping in to scoop up the dip. JPMorgan’s latest report reveals that the Bitcoin network’s hashrate has hit an all-time high—often seen as a sign of long-term confidence from miners and big-money players alike. While price action remains tense, this surge in network strength hints at a possible shift in momentum. As BTC stabilizes, eyes are turning to which other cryptocurrencies could ride the wave next. In this analysis, we break down Bitcoin’s current setup and explore where the smart money may flow next. Bitcoin Price Struggles as Bulls Show Weakness Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current range sits between roughly $102,000 and $110,000, marking a slight tension in its movement. Recent data points to bulls losing their grip, with prices dipping about 3.7% in the past week. The coin is approaching the support level near $98,600, while resistance looms at around $114,000. With an RSI under 40, bearish tendencies appear stronger now. However, over the last month, Bitcoin has grown by nearly 3%, showing potential for resurgence. If bullish momentum gains, it could aim for the second resistance, just over $121,000, capturing a near 20% gain from the current lower price of $102,000. Yet, for now, cautious optimism prevails. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rebound, paired with record-breaking hashrate growth, sends a clear signal: institutions are far from bearish. Despite short-term price hesitations, the long-term fundamentals are strengthening—laying the groundwork for a broader market recovery. If BTC pushes beyond key resistance levels, it could trigger a wider rally across altcoins. For now, cautious optimism prevails, but with deep-pocket investors stepping in and network health surging, Bitcoin’s next big move may be closer than it looks—and other major coins may soon follow.

2025-06-17T15:32:44,"Quantum Biopharma Adds 100,000 XRP to its Crypto Treasury","Quantum Biopharma, a publicly traded Canadian biopharmaceutical company, has expanded its digital asset holdings with the purchase of 100,000 XRP, according to a report shared by crypto analyst Xaif on X. Though the company has not yet released an official press statement, the move adds to its growing crypto treasury and signals deepening interest in Ripple’s native token from institutional players. At XRP’s current trading price of $2.20, the acquisition represents an investment of approximately $220,000. This latest addition builds on Quantum’s broader crypto strategy, which has already seen it allocate millions to digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) over the past six months. Inside Quantum’s Crypto Playbook Quantum Biopharma entered the crypto space in December 2024 with an initial $1 million investment in BTC and other selected tokens. On May 19, 2025, the company expanded its digital portfolio to $4.5 million, followed by another capital injection on June 10, bringing its total crypto holdings to $5 million. The XRP purchase is believed to be part of this most recent treasury expansion, as per Xaif’s disclosure. Just In: Quantum Biopharma has added 100,000 $XRP to its crypto treasury! Pharma meets crypto — are more institutions eyeing #XRP next? #Ripple #XRPL #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/MjM8v5Rm9W — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 17, 2025 All assets are held in custody by BitGo, a trusted institutional provider offering cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and regulatory-grade compliance. This custodial arrangement ensures the company’s crypto holdings remain secure and auditable. Quantum’s CEO, Zeeshan Saeed, has previously emphasized that crypto is not merely a speculative bet, but a deliberate part of the company’s treasury management strategy. According to Saeed, the goals include protecting shareholder value, hedging against currency depreciation—especially the Canadian dollar—and exploring opportunities for yield generation through staking where applicable. Why XRP? XRP’s inclusion in the portfolio highlights the company’s interest in assets with real-world utility. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily viewed as a store of value, XRP is designed for fast, low-cost international transactions and is already used by financial institutions and payment providers through Ripple’s growing network. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Quantum’s decision to add XRP comes when the token regains institutional attention, buoyed by ongoing regulatory clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships across the financial sector. Though not XRP’s highest historical price, its current valuation of $2.20 reflects the asset’s resilience. A Pioneer in Pharma-Fintech Integration Quantum Biopharma stands out in the pharmaceutical industry for its proactive adoption of blockchain assets. While most biotech and pharma firms have avoided exposure to crypto due to perceived volatility and regulatory uncertainty, Quantum is carving a different path—one that blends traditional healthcare with modern finance. The company’s crypto strategy has also been well-received by investors. Quantum’s stock (QNTM) has attracted increasing attention from both individual and institutional investors since its initial investment in December 2024, thanks to its forward-thinking financial strategy. As the line between traditional finance and digital assets continues to blur, Quantum Biopharma’s latest XRP acquisition sends a clear message: blockchain-based finance is no longer confined to the tech sector. With this move, the company strengthens its position as a leader in integrating decentralized tools into legacy industries.

2025-06-17T15:30:52,"XRP Must Complete Right Shoulder Before Takeoff—But How Low First?","XRP bulls appear to be facing one last test of conviction before the market’s next explosive phase, according to CryptoInsightUK’s video analysis released on 16 June. The British analyst argues that the token is sculpting an inverse head-and-shoulders formation whose right shoulder “still needs to form around the high-$1.80s” before any sustained rally can commence. How Low Must XRP Go? In the broadcast, he emphasised that “dense liquidity is below us,” pointing to a confluence of resting bids and stop-loss clusters between roughly $1.92 and $1.80. “I still think it comes down to make the right shoulder which is around 1.88,” he said, adding that a swift wash-out into that pocket would “flush the lows, tap in there and send it.” At present, XRP is changing hands near $2.24, up about 3% over the past 24 hours, which implies a prospective drawdown of roughly 20% if the market fulfills his downside scenario. From the analyst’s vantage point, such a retreat is less a cause for alarm than a prerequisite for the next major leg higher: “If we come down first, we’ve done the downside part. Otherwise I’m still going to be worried about going down even if we come up to $2.42 or higher.” Related Reading: What Are The Implications For XRP If Ripple Captures 14% Of SWIFT’s Volume? He linked the bearish short-term bias to structural forces beyond the XRP Ledger’s ecosystem. Bitcoin dominance, he noted, has crept toward a historical inflection zone that previously triggered alt-seasons: “Anywhere in this box could be the start of alt-season… That would probably coincide with Bitcoin dropping to between $100,000 and $93,000.” A dominance spike fed by a late-cycle Bitcoin dip, he argued, would typically inflict outsized percentage losses on major altcoins—including XRP—before liquidity rotates back into them. Within XRP’s own order book, CryptoInsightUK highlighted a “liquidity vacuum” created by May’s capitulation candle. Although the token has since retraced most of that single-session collapse, he described the rebound as “choppy corrective price action,” lacking the conviction and volume that accompanied earlier impulse waves. The right-shoulder flush, in his view, would neutralise residual leverage, particularly among traders who re-loaded longs too aggressively during the $2.15–$2.40 bounce. How High Can XRP Explode? The inverse head-and-shoulders thesis also features prominently on his long-range chart, stretching back to mid-May. The analyst first published the pattern on X, showing a left shoulder near $2.42, a head at $1.47, and a neckline just above $2.50. Completing a symmetrical right shoulder near $1.88 would, by classical pattern-measuring rules, project an upside target above $3.50—a level not visited since late-2021’s cycle top. Related Reading: Still Sleeping On XRP? Analyst Says $8 Breakout Is ‘Just Waiting’ Liquidity dynamics across the broader market reinforce his caution. Open interest in perpetual swaps for Ether, he observed, remains “as high as it’s ever been,” suggesting that any sudden drop in majors could spark a forced-liquidation cascade across altcoin pairs. “These people will be flushed out,” he warned, calling attention to negative-funding episodes that hint at an overcrowded short base waiting to be squeezed—once the final downside pocket has been filled. Despite the near-term jitters, CryptoInsightUK reiterated a resolutely bullish macro stance. “The next stage I’m most certain about is that we’re going to go significantly higher for crypto,” he told viewers. Drawing parallels with gold’s record weekly close, he argued that an undercurrent of global risk aversion is quietly supporting non-sovereign stores of value, positioning both Bitcoin and XRP for accelerated appreciation once the technical reset concludes. For long-term holders, his advice was unequivocal: avoid wholesale portfolio shifts and instead treat any sub-$2.00 wick as a final accumulation window. “Dollar-cost averaging from here is a good thing to do,” he said, revealing that 97% of his own capital remains in spot positions, with only a single-digit percentage reserved for surgical bids in the $1.80–$1.92 zone. Whether XRP respects that script will become clear in the days ahead. Should the market indeed sweep into the high-$1.80s and rebound with the aggressive thrust the analyst expects, the right shoulder will be complete—and the runway clear—for the long-awaited take-off. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23.

2025-06-17T15:12:16,"This Key Level Holds Key to Unlocking Bitcoin’s Next Bull Run: Analyst","Bitcoin’s recent consolidation above the $104,000 mark may be more than just a pause; it could be the final checkpoint before a new all-time high, according to leading market analyst Rekt Capital. As the crypto market braces for a major move, the king cryptocurrency’s ability to hold this critical level could determine whether bulls finally take the wheel or sellers reclaim dominance. The $104,400 Litmus Test In a newsletter published on June 16, Rekt Capital pointed out that BTC has now spent six consecutive weeks retesting the $104,400 level as support. According to the pseudonymous market watcher, the prolonged retest follows Bitcoin’s breakout from a multi-month “re-accumulation range.” He reminded investors that BTC took over 240 days to break its post-halving range earlier this year. Holding above $104,400 on weekly closes is paramount: “It’s difficult to talk about lower prices until the $104,400 level breaks down,” they stated. Despite “brutal” sentiment and exhaustion among traders, the actual price pullback from recent highs has been modest at just -10%, representing more of a “time-based capitulation” rather than a price-driven plunge. In their estimation, failure to hold this level risks a deeper correction. At the same time, sustained support could pave the way to challenge the final major resistance near $108,890, pushing the asset into what he called “Price Discovery Uptrend 2.” “As long as BTC holds $104400, then it is positioned for upside over time,” declared the analyst. Though sluggish, the transition is notable for producing higher lows and diamond-shaped formations, technical signals that often precede strong upward movements. Market Behavior Even geopolitical jitters caused by the ongoing military conflict between Israel and Iran have failed to derail Bitcoin’s structural support seriously , further strengthening its bullish case. At the time of writing, BTC was trading around $105,569, a 2% drop over the past 24 hours. It also shaved about 3.4% from its value in the last seven days, while maintaining a 60.2% gain across 12 months. A tightening consolidation near the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of $111,814 could also signal growing tension, with investor Daan Crypto Trades noting that the monthly range is “extremely likely” to break in June. He warned that a “large move is coming in the next couple of weeks,” even as on-chain data shared by Axel Adler Jr. revealed a sustained drop in Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) Momentum below zero, indicating reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. Coupled with a continued decline in exchange-held BTC, the setup points toward a market primed for supply shocks.

The company successfully challenged these restrictions through the appeals process. Now, it has regained the ability to manage its corporate treasury according to board and shareholder preferences. Roger Hamilton, CEO of Genius Group, stated: “We launched our Bitcoin Treasury in November 2025, and believe we were one of the first Bitcoin Treasury companies on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) American. We also believe that subsequent to our announcement, we were one of the only companies legally prevented from buying Bitcoin by a US court.” Genius Group renewed its Bitcoin acquisition strategy on May 22 with a $2.7 million Bitcoin investment announcement.

The filing triggered a strong response from the XRP community, especially after it became clear that XRP was excluded. One of the most prominent voices who reacted to the news was Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL). He tagged the president, asking why XRP is excluded. The comment reflects the broader sentiment among XRP holders who have been waiting for more signs of institutional recognition, particularly in the form of more ETF filings. No XRP wtf man @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/UR5E5HFkxt — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 16, 2025 XRP ETF Landscape and Institutional Moves The timing of this exclusion has raised questions, considering the current state of ETF applications. More than 11 XRP ETF filings are currently pending with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and industry observers view XRP as a viable candidate for future spot ETFs. Teucrium, a commodities ETF provider, recently launched a leveraged XRP ETF, which it tagged as the most successful launch in its history. Yet XRP remains absent from the Truth Social plan. Speculation on XRP’s Omission While the Bitcoin and Ethereum filings mark a significant institutional step, many in the XRP community believe that XRP’s omission may be temporary or intentional. Several responses under Cobb’s post suggest that another filing, including XRP, might follow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 One user speculated that a separate ETF could be in the works, focusing mainly on XRP, SOL, and ADA. Notably, these three assets were included in Trump’s crypto reserve announcement , suggesting that the president is interested in them. Another commenter pointed to the pending legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, and this case has historically caused hesitation. Other members of the XRP community echoed similar theories or took a more defiant stance. One user commented that “we don’t need one,” suggesting that Bitcoin will eventually collapse. Another implied that a potential 1,000% pump from ETFs cannot happen yet due to a coordinated strategy. This view reinforces a common belief within the XRP community that institutional players are deliberately withholding public support until the timing is optimal, possibly after regulatory hurdles are resolved. A recent TimesTabloid report discussed reasons why Eric Trump has not publicly supported XRP . The Trumps could be waiting for full legal clarity before engaging fully with the digital asset that many believe will lead the financial revolution.

2025-06-17T14:50:06,"BTC block production is shifting to the USA","Bitcoin mining is changing its profile, with over 30% in the hands of US-based corporate miners. US-based miners generally hold more than 40% of the hashrate, but listed companies are now in charge of large-scale mining centers. Bitcoin mining has changed its approach multiple times, evolving past personal computers into ASIC. In the past few years, mining is only viable through large-scale operations, leading to the creation of dedicated data centers. Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at Van Eck, noted that corporate miners controlled over 30% of the hashrate for the first time after a period of constant growth. In total, exchange-listed miners had 31.8% of the Bitcoin network hashrate. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/Y9enIzQwea — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) June 17, 2025 The Bitcoin network produces blocks with a near-record hashrate, close to 900 EH/s, with peak difficulty. Previous narratives of miner capitulation did not materialize, as large-scale miners can afford to mine at a loss. Long-term corporate miners have a lower cost basis and can afford to hold coins for the long term. BTC mining is currently viable based on prices above $100,000. Miners are also not shy about building new data centers, tapping the remaining BTC block rewards while also seeking ways to branch out to new crypto assets and AI computation. BTC mining stocks, in general, rise during favorable market periods. | Source: Hashrate Index The list of 13 BTC corporate miners tracked by Morgan Stanley shows they nearly doubled their output in the past year. The growth was linked to previous plans to launch new data centers with favorable energy contracts. Corporate miners either use their data centers for solo block production or join pools. Foundry Digital, the top US-based pool, now carries 29.1% of the total hashrate. The pool produces up to 33% of all BTC for each 100-block interval. BTC corporate miners use reserves to pivot into AI For crypto natives, the mining situation is entirely normalized, with no signs of distressed conditions. However, BTC miners are not relying on block rewards for the long term. Transaction fees produce under $500K per day, even during busy periods, and may be insufficient to sustain operations or renew mining and data centers. BTC mining stocks benefit from the general recovery of the crypto market. The BTC miner index is up in the past quarter, bouncing from the lows in April and March. Miners are still estimating ways to extend their operations, especially after the 2024 halving. Top miners like Mara Holdings, Riot Platform, IREN, and others are also using traditional fundraising to finance their shift into AI computation. Bitcoin miners ( $MARA $IREN $CLSK $CIFR $RIOT ) are raising big cash via equity (50-115% of capital) to survive post-2024 halving.

The companies use their legacy BTC and some new purchases to boost their stock prices and sales in a bid to secure funding for the next few years. Corporate miners are also more efficient, pushing out smaller operations off the market.

According to data from DeFi Llama , the network’s total value locked has reached an all-time high of over 3.08 billion SEI, up significantly from 715 million at the start of the year.

In an analysis published last week, the financial giant’s strategists gave emerging market currencies an overweight recommendation and predicted the market wouldn’t panic over the Israel/Iran conflict, Bloomberg reports . “The next few days will be critical to this, but we would think there is a higher bar for markets to panic.” The recommendation is the opposite of what the investment bank’s strategists predicted earlier this year. Following President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2nd, JPMorgan Chase provided clients with a trade idea that involved flipping bearish on emerging market currencies. They later walked it back in a note in May. “Our UW (underweight) has not worked… We see sufficient arguments that EM FX (foreign exchange) will not weaken versus the USD in the coming period.” Strategists at the bank reportedly anticipated that President Trump’s tariffs would put pressure on foreign markets’ currencies, but failed to predict that there would also be a shift away from US assets, which weakened the dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading at 98.22 at time of writing. The index is up 0.23% in the past day but down about 10% this year.

2025-06-17T14:28:44,"U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Extend Inflow Streak as Institutional Interest Holds Steady","U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted $412.2 million in net inflows on Monday, marking the sixth consecutive day of gains and lifting total cumulative inflows to $46.04 billion. The strong inflow streak began on June 9 and has now drawn in more than $1.8 billion in fresh capital, according to figures compiled by SoSoValue. These inflows have persisted despite ongoing geopolitical instability, including renewed military tensions between Iran and Israel. The run started with a $386.27 million inflow on June 9, followed by a spike to $431.12 million the next day. Midweek activity saw a minor pullback, but interest resumed with $322.60 million on Friday and a fresh surge on Monday. Total net assets across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have reached $132.5 billion. This figure now represents 6.13% of Bitcoin’s entire market capitalization. Meanwhile, daily trading volumes have also remained high, with $3.12 billion worth of trades executed on Monday alone. BlackRock and Fidelity Continue to Lead the ETF Race Among the ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains the frontrunner. It pulled in $266.60 million on Monday alone and has now amassed $50.03 billion in total net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC also performed strongly, adding $82.96 million in net flows. Grayscale’s GBTC, however, lagged behind significantly with just $12.84 million in inflows and continues to reflect a total net outflow of $23.23 billion since its inception. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Taiwan-based Kronos Research, emphasized that institutional investors appear to be focusing on long-term strategies. “Despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, institutions are looking past short-term volatility and focusing on long-term positioning,” Liu told Cointelegraph. He added, “Steady Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect growing trust in BTC’s resilience, accessibility, and role as a hedge in a shifting macro environment.” Bitcoin Price Volatile, But Underlying Structure Intact While ETF inflows remain strong, Bitcoin’s price has faced some turbulence. A surprise Israeli strike on Iran last Friday triggered a broader sell-off, pushing Bitcoin down more than 7% and ending the week in the red. Bitfinex analysts noted that the market showed signs of capitulation, with Net Taker Volume hitting a multi-week low of $197 million. “This selling, however, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation-style setups that often mark local bottoms,” they stated in a report released Monday. They also observed that if Bitcoin can maintain support between $102,000 and $103,000, it may indicate that downward pressure is being absorbed and could suggest a potential rebound in the near term. Despite the brief price dip, the continued inflows into ETFs suggest growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a resilient asset class, even amid uncertain global conditions.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/u-s-bitcoin-etfs-extend-inflow-streak-as-institutional-interest-holds-steady/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T14:20:34,"Russia hits crypto farm in ramp up to illegal mining operators","Law enforcement authorities in Russia have closed down a large crypto mining farm that operated outside the law in the middle of Siberia. The industrial coin minting facility, which occupied almost 30,000 square meters of land, has been targeted amid an ongoing crackdown on illegal mining across the vast country. Russian court bans Bitcoin farm plugged into the power grid without permit A court in Russia’s Krasnoyarsk Krai has stopped the illegal mining of cryptocurrencies for millions of rubles a month, the region’s prosecutor’s office announced. The large coin-producing operation was set up in the city of Nazarovo. The unusual facility, which minted crypto in open air and behind a barbed wire fence, attracted the attention of the local community, RBC Crypto reported on Monday, quoting a press release which was also published on Telegram. Regional authorities said the property was registered as a non-residential building on an industrial site with a total area of 29,800 square meters. However, law enforcement officials established that the land plot had been repurposed. Prosecutors explained: “In reality, the territory is occupied by transformers, power plants, mobile centers and other equipment that was leased, together with a non-existent building, to another organization for 4.6 million rubles (nearly $60,000) a month.” The operator of the illegal mining farm connected the hardware to the city’s power grid without obtaining the proper permits and rights to use the state-owned land. Inspectors also reported violations of fire safety regulations, the article detailed. Initially, the prosecutor’s office demanded that the miner address the registered violations, but their request was ignored. Eventually, a lawsuit was filed, which resulted in the ban of mining operations at the site until these are eliminated. Russia busts large crypto mining farm. Photo: Prosecutor’s Office of Krasnoyarsk. Source: RBC Crypto Russia cracks down on illegal cryptocurrency miners Crypto mining in the Russian Federation, which was legalized last year, has been blamed by local authorities across the country for causing excessive load on power distribution networks, resulting in breakdowns and blackouts. Their concerns have led to seasonal and permanent restrictions on the energy-intensive activity in many parts of the country. But while a blanket ban on mining has already affected almost a dozen Russian regions, a report earlier in June indicated that Moscow is halting its expansion . Citing a drop in tax revenues and decreasing electricity sales, the federal government now wants to shift its focus to targeting illegal mining farms rather than all mining firms. Recently announced legislative changes seek to punish the so-called “gray” miners with hefty fines and crypto confiscation. Back in February of this year, the authorities in Krasnoyarsk Krai, one of the most popular mining destinations in Russia, charged an employee of a local utility with taking 600,000 rubles in bribes to cover up the activities of illegal miners who caused damages exceeding 9 million rubles. This month, engineers from the local energy distributing company in the Russian republic of Buryatia discovered 95 mining rigs hidden in the back of a truck. The improvised mobile mining farm was connected to the power lines supplying electricity to a village in the Pribaikalsky district. This week, police in Ingushetia announced they have detained a man who stole 2.34 million rubles’ worth of electricity to power 65 coin-minting devices illegally tapped into the grid. The mining installation, found in a utility room, had been connected to a substation, bypassing electricity meters. The North Caucasian republic is among the Russian regions where cryptocurrency mining has been completely prohibited until the spring of 2031. The list includes territories from the Far East to the Russia-occupied oblasts of Ukraine. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-17T14:00:50,"Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East","Bitcoin’s recent price activity has been characterized by sharp swings as global uncertainties persist, particularly following the escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran. After plunging by nearly 5% amid the rising geopolitical strain, Bitcoin managed to recover, bouncing back above $105,000 and currently trading around $106,800. The past 24 hours have been highlighted by Bitcoin recovering toward $108,000 briefly again, but with escalating tensions in the Middle East, there’s a good chance it could crash soon. This aligns with an outlook from a crypto analyst, who noted that Bitcoin might crash toward $100,000. Resistance Band Faces Test For Bitcoin According to crypto analyst Pejman_Zwin on the TradingView platform, Bitcoin is hovering within a confluence of resistance and short liquidation zones, stretching from $105,330 to $107,120. This range, he notes, is not only a structural resistance zone but also corresponds with the cumulative short liquidation leverage area.

The charts also reveal the presence of a possible contracting triangle pattern, which is a bearish continuation setup in the context of a larger correction. According to the analyst, if Bitcoin fails to reclaim $106,600 convincingly, the structure could shift from a corrective triangle to a five-wave downward impulse. This would cause a deeper retracement, especially as the price is already forming lower highs within the triangle. As such, the longer Bitcoin lingers in this resistance range without a breakout, the higher the likelihood of a rapid downward move. Bearish And Bull Targets If Bitcoin were to confirm this breakdown, the analyst noted the first major target around the lower boundary of the support zone, which lies between $105,330 and $103,162. This zone is reinforced by the monthly pivot point and also overlaps with the cumulative long liquidation leverage region. The 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart further highlighted a potential short setup from the reversal zone near $107,100 and a projected target close to $104,300.

Further downside could pull the price toward the next support band around $102,600 or even down to $101,000, should liquidation pressure persist. Pejman, on the other hand, pointed out that a sustained breakout above the $107,120 resistance line could initiate a bullish reversal and push Bitcoin back towards the heavy resistance cluster above $108,000. A strong daily close above $108,000 could cancel the bearish outlook. However, failure to break above here could lead to a rejection and another downside move. Although Bitcoin is starting to show some signs of bullishness, its price action is still vulnerable to a quick pullback, especially if the tensions in the Middle East continue to unfold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,638, down 0.02% in the past 24 hours. This subdued price action shows its current consolidation nature.

2025-06-17T13:59:41,"Monster $13 billion Bitcoin short squeeze alert","Bitcoin ( BTC ) is knocking on the door of a historic short squeeze . With the digital asset trading above $105,500, over $13 billion worth of leveraged short positions across major exchanges like Binance , Bybit, and OKX are hanging by a thread, according to fresh data from Coinglass, retrieved by Finbold on June 17. The liquidation heatmap doesn’t lie, if Bitcoin surges past $118,000, we could witness one of the largest mass short liquidations in crypto history. The chart breaks down where leveraged positions are most concentrated—and, more importantly, where they’re most vulnerable. On the right-hand side, the rising green curve represents short liquidation leverage. What makes this setup especially dangerous for shorts is the way the green line steepens past $110,000. That sharp upward curve means a growing pile of leverage is waiting just above the current market price. The moment BTC starts inching toward those levels, a chain reaction could be triggered, trapping late sellers and slingshotting Bitcoin upward. BTC exchange liquidation map. Source: Coinglass In simple terms, this shows how much money traders have bet against Bitcoin going up. If BTC climbs, these short positions start bleeding. And if it climbs fast? They’re forced to close, automatically, by exchanges. That process is called liquidation. Liquidations don’t happen quietly. When shorts get closed, the traders must buy Bitcoin to settle their losses. That sudden burst of buying adds fuel to the fire, pushing prices even higher and forcing more shorts to close. It’s a vicious cycle for the bears. This cascading effect is known as a short squeeze, and right now, the chart is flashing a textbook setup. It’s not just theoretical. We’ve seen it before in past cycles. The 2020 breakout past $20,000? Similar mechanics. The $30,000 rally in early 2021? Same story. Bitcoin short liquidation leverage summary For beginners, this chart might seem intimidating. But here’s the simple takeaway: it shows where leveraged traders are likely to get wiped out. And right now, those at risk are the ones betting against Bitcoin. The fact that $13 billion in short exposure exists just overhead is a strong bullish signal. Not because that money guarantees upward movement, but because it reveals just how unstable the current positioning is. If a catalyst appears, whether ETF inflows, macro easing, or more institutional headlines such as BlackRock, the move could be explosive, not gradual.

2025-06-17T13:50:09,"Ethereum ETFs on-chain holdings at all-time high","Investments in Ethereum are accelerating in the past few weeks, leading the on-chain holdings of major funds to a new all-time high. The ongoing buying shows a clear accumulation trend where institutions are positioning for an ETH rally. The on-chain activity and holdings of Ethereum ETFs suggest the network and the token are nowhere near dead. ETH on-chain holdings for all major ETFs are close to an all-time high, after the last few weeks of accelerated accumulation. BlackRock was the most active buyer, driving the momentum of inflows to Ethereum ETFs. | Source: Dune Analytics Blackrock and Grayscale lead institutional demand for ETH ETF funds have bought over 3.77M ETH, or around 2.97% of the supply, currently above 120M ETH. Alternative data by CryptoQuant points to over 4M ETH acquired by all ETFs, with a market acceleration in June. The funds based on Ethereum have a much lower level of assets under management but stronger accumulation momentum. Inflows have surpassed BTC since the end of May. The ETFs are approaching $1B in accumulation per month. For now, BlackRock and Grayscale remain the biggest holders, with the most rapid new ETH inflows. Grayscale switched to accumulation in the past month, ending the era of divesting its ETH acquired for as low as $90. The accumulation happens at a time when ETH still trades sideways, at around $2,561.97, with a total market dominance of 9.03%. ETH stabilized at around 0.024 BTC, ending its long-term slide. The ETF accumulation is seen as just one of the positive signs for the Ethereum ecosystem, in addition to growing DeFi activity, stablecoin transfers, and general accumulation in both small and whale-sized wallets. ETFs are not the most significant destination for ETH, as many of the tokens are locked in protocols. Currently, Ethereum carries over $63.3B in total value locked, in addition to over 125B in stablecoins. Close to 30% of ETH is staked with validators, while leaving diminishing reserves on exchanges. In total, each week, 16,621 ETH is produced, smaller than one single day of ETF inflows. While Ethereum does not offer the same scarcity as BTC, ETFs still control a significant part of the supply. Ethereum ETFs show growing daily inflows Ethereum ETFs have seen much more lively inflows in the past few days, surpassing the accumulation of BTC. Spot Ethereum ETFs had an almost unbroken period of net daily inflows since the middle of May. This is the longest period of ETF accumulation since the bull rally in March 2024. However, this time, ETH trades at a lower range, after dipping as low as $1,200. Despite this, there is interest in the token, with the potential for a late but outsized rally to a higher price range. One of the possible effects of an ETH rally is the launch of a new altcoin market. Despite expectations for an altcoin rally in Q1, most old tokens failed to break out. ETH is considered the one factor to lift up other tokens and chains. ETF inflows also precede a new period of fund approvals. This time, the most probable new fund will accumulate SOL, as investors seek to tap the growth potential of other crypto platforms.

2025-06-17T13:49:18,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Registers Sharp Drop As Middle East Crisis Worsens","Bitcoin (BTC) made a promising start to the week, surging to an intraday high of $108,944 on Monday. However, the worsening situation in the Middle East prompted a sharp decline as markets turned bearish. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped to $106,806. BTC is down almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $105,897. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, the price has stayed above $105,000. Strategy Announces Latest Bitcoin Purchase Michael Saylor’s Strategy has announced that it purchased 10,100 BTC for approximately $1.05 billion at an average acquisition price of around $104,080 per coin. Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor announced the news in a post on X, stating, “Strategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved a BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/15/2025, we hodl 592,100 acquired for ~$41.84 billion at ~$70,666 per bitcoin.” The latest Bitcoin purchase takes Strategy’s total holdings to a staggering 592,100 BTC , further cementing its place as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Strategy has doubled down on its “buy and hold” strategy, using proceeds from equity and debt financing instead of its at-the-market programs. Notably, it did not sell any stock in the days leading up to its latest acquisition. Strategy’s management is convinced about BTC’s long-term value proposition. However, they acknowledge the risks associated with a highly concentrated treasury allocation. Strategy’s filing warns that the absence of diversification increases the firm’s exposure to BTC’s short-term fluctuations and volatility. “The concentration of our assets in Bitcoin limits our ability to mitigate risk that could otherwise be achieved by holding a more diversified portfolio.” Bank Of America Ranks Bitcoin Among The Most Disruptive Innovations Bank of America has called Bitcoin one of the most disruptive innovations, signaling its potential to shape the global financial ecosystem. The observations were made in a long-term chart outlining 1,000 years of technological and scientific disruptions. The chart highlighted Bitcoin as one of the most consequential innovations in history. The chart highlights key breakthroughs from the invention of the printing press to quantum computing and everything in between. Bank of America Global Research stated that Bitcoin stands out for its challenge to traditional financial systems by introducing a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Its inception is also regarded as the catalyst for the rapid growth of the crypto industry. The chart put Bitcoin alongside innovations like the World Wide Web, microprocessors, and electric vehicles. Bitcoin ETFs Continue Inflow Streak US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows of $412 million on Monday, extending their positive streak to six days despite escalating tensions in the Middle East. The latest inflows take the cumulative inflows to $46 billion. The latest streak of inflows began on June 9 and has attracted a total of $1.8 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. Inflows have persisted despite rising geopolitical tensions across the world, including a renewed conflict between Israel and Iran. As expected, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led inflows, recording over $266 million in net inflows on Monday, with its total accumulation crossing $50 billion. This was followed by Fidelity with inflows of $82 million, and Grayscale, which recorded just 12.84 million in inflows. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer of Kronos Research, stated, “Despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, institutions are looking past short-term volatility and focusing on long-term positioning. Steady Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect growing trust in BTC’s resilience, accessibility, and role as a hedge in a shifting macro environment.” Trump Media To Hold Bitcoin (BTC) And Ethereum (ETH) Trump Media & Technology Group’s ETF will hold BTC and ETH and combine them into a single tradable asset. The company, founded by the Trump family, said it intended to launch the ETF with a quarter of the assets in ETH, with the rest in BTC . It added that the launch is planned for “later this year.” Trump Media & Technology Group initially planned to offer a Bitcoin-only ETF, announcing in May that it was raising funds to acquire Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp drop on Monday as it fell from an intraday high of $108,944 Monday. However, sentiment soured after it emerged that President Trump requested the National Security Council convene in the White House Situation Room. Trump left the G7 early, posting a chilling warning on his Truth Social handle, urging people to evacuate Tehran. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed President Trump’s early departure from the summit in Canada, stating, “Much was accomplished, but because of what’s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.” However, a Bitfinex Alpha report predicts a quick rebound for BTC and the broader crypto market, provided global tensions don’t escalate further. BTC fell over 7% following the Israel-Iran conflict, with the net taker volume also registering a sharp drop to negative $197 million, suggesting widespread panic. Bitfinex analysts stated that such declines in net taker volumes often indicate capitulation, a pattern seen in previous market bottoms. The crypto fear and greed index also slid into “fear” territory. The Bitfinex Alpha report stated, “This selling, however, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation—style setups that often mark local bottoms. If Bitcoin can hold the $102,000–$103,000 zone, it may suggest that selling pressure is being absorbed and that the market could be primed for recovery—assuming geopolitical risks don’t intensify further.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Thursday (June 5) as bearish sentiment increased after it dipped below $105,000. As a result, it fell 3%, dropping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. BTC surged on Monday as it started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 4% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The price fell to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,253. Source: TradingView BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.42% to $108,687. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 3% to $105,828. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $106,106. The price was back in the red on Saturday, dropping 0.59% to $105,482, but registered a marginal rise on Sunday to end the weekend at $105,562. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,944 on Monday as it started the week on a bullish note. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $106,806, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. The current session sees BTC down over 1%, trading around $105,000. Buyers must keep the price above $105,000. A drop below this level could drive BTC toward $100,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana Strategies has planned to raise $1 billion to boost the ecosystem. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 49.01% from its ATH of $ 294.33.

The RSI near 48 hints at the start of recovery but lacks strong momentum. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight. Potential High: $190 Average Price Range: $165 Potential Low: $140 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the derivatives market with $6.74B in open interest, far surpassing other altcoins. The heatmap and high trader positioning signal elevated volatility ahead. Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-06-17T13:48:00,"Dow opens lower as Israel-Iran conflict weighs on investors","Global stocks pared gains on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average opening more than 100 points lower in early trading as Israel and Iran continued attacks against each other. Alongside the Dow, the S&P 500 opened down 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%. These declines came as investors weighed the prospects of a quick truce versus a potential escalation of the Israel-Iran hostilities. U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent remarks and social media posts related to the conflict, as well as his early departure from the G7 summit, stoked fears that a swift ceasefire was unlikely. Trump said in a post on Truth Social : “Publicity seeking President Emmanuel Macron, of France, mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a “cease fire” between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong.” Market reactions were swift. Oil prices jumped 2%, while cryptocurrencies retreated, with Bitcoin (BTC) dipping from above $108,000 to around $105,500. You might also like: Why are Bitcoin and crypto prices going down today? Notably, stocks were showing weakness after signaling massive resilience in the past week. The major U.S. indices showed this with an uptick on June 16 , with the S&P 500 holding above 6,000 despite the missile attacks on Tehran and Tel Aviv. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, weighed in on the market’s performance: US stock resiliency comes from 3 things IMO: 1. SURRENDER: So many investors have given up trying to time mkt. Learned hard way it's near imposs. Do nothing better. 2. MARRAIGE: People are married to their dirt cheap US index funds (see it as a permanent relationship) 3. US… https://t.co/RZrdt3r67N — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 17, 2025 On the data front, new figures released on June 17 showed that U.S. retail sales slipped in May, reflecting a pullback in consumer spending. Retail sales declined by 0.9%, exceeding expectations of a 0.6% drop. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting began Tuesday, with markets closely watching for any shift in language when the FOMC decision is announced on Wednesday, June 18. Analysts broadly expect the Fed to hold interest rates steady.
