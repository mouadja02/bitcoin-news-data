2025-06-17T08:42:55,"CleanSpark: Gaining Efficiency And Scale","Summary CleanSpark's operational efficiency and hashrate growth make it one of the most competitive and profitable bitcoin miners in the U.S. market. The company balances HODLing and selling bitcoin to fund expansion, using innovative treasury strategies like lending and covered calls to enhance returns. Key risks include bitcoin price volatility and not fully participating in potential bull market gains by selling some mined bitcoin for operations. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) recently saw a nice appreciation in its stock price over the past couple months from the April lows. CleanSpark, who proclaims to be ""America's Bitcoin Miner"", became primarily focused on bitcoin mining in 2020. Despite the company's fairly recent shift in focus, they have risen in the ranks to become one of the most competitive public bitcoin mining companies in the public market. As this article will show, despite not holding as much bitcoin as companies like MARA Holdings ( MARA ), their performance metrics seem to be improving more quickly than others. CleanSpark's Monthly Update On June 3, CleanSpark released its most recent update for the month of May where they showed impressive growth over the month, HODLing 12,502 bitcoin compared to 12,100 a month earlier. Although they HODL'd over 400 more bitcoin month-over-month, they mined a total of 694 bitcoin in May, selling some bitcoin to fund operations. They reached a total bitcoin hashrate of 47 Eh/s and plan on reaching 50 Eh/s in the month of June. This is an impressive feat considering MARA Holdings, a company that is nearly a decade older than CleanSpark, has amassed an only slightly larger hashrate of 58.3 Eh/s as of their May 2025 report. I recommended CleanSpark as a strong buy in my article on February 17, 2025 with the price trading just above $10/share. My recommendation was mostly based upon the mining efficiency of their fleet, which has led to them stacking bitcoin faster with more profitable operations. Since February 17, bitcoin has been volatile, but today, CleanSpark's stock trades near $10 once again. Has it bottomed and begun an upward rise alongside the potential bitcoin bull market? Time will tell. Company Overview American Made Bitcoin This chart shows the growth of the company's bitcoin mining from before the most recent halving to today. Even in the midst of the bitcoin halving, CleanSpark has continued to grow by mining more and more bitcoin, relative to the halving. Monthly Bitcoin Production ( CleanSpark 's May2025 Presentation) The company operates solely in America. This map shows the company's operations. Its largest footprint is found in the state of Georgia, where they first started their bitcoin mining journey with their first acquisition of ATL data centers. Bitcoin Mining Areas of Operation ( CleanSpark 's May2025 Presentation) CleanSpark's Mining Hashrate Through their growth in operations, they have more than doubled their mining hashrate each year, and they are on pace to do the same again in 2025. Here's the outlook from the CEO during the Q2 2025 Conference call. Looking beyond mid-year, we have active projects ongoing with miners and infrastructure paid for that will push us over 57 exahash. For long-term expansion, we have already secured infrastructure in hand or under contract to support growth beyond 60 exahash. Hashrate Growth Chart ( CleanSpark May2025 Presentation) Comparing CleanSpark's Hashrate Growth to MARA Holdings This is a graph comparing MARA Holding's hashrate over time. Although MARA Holdings began mining bitcoin in 2018, you can see how CLSK is on a trajectory that might overtake MARA. However, MARA has some exciting projects as well that will likely also continue to grow their hashrate quickly. MARA Holdings Hashrate Growth (Q1 2025 MARA Earnings Presentation) CleanSpark's Growth in Energy Efficiency This graphic shows CleanSpark's cost of mining bitcoin in terms of energy costs. Their average cost/kWh was $.06 cents in the most recent quarter. This was a substantial rise compared to the average cost/kWh of the previous two years. With energy costs bound to rise over time thanks to inflation, as well as bitcoin halvings reducing revenue, it is imperative for companies like CleanSpark to become ever more efficient. That is what they have accomplished by driving down the J/TH (Joules/TH) metric by over 40 percent since 2023 to 17.03 J/TH. CleanSpark's Operating Metrics ( CleanSpark May2025 Presentation) Because of CleanSpark's focus on efficiency, they were able to mine a bitcoin for the cost of $42,667 per bitcoin. With bitcoin trading above $100k per bitcoin, which creates an attractive operating margin for the company. With CleanSpark owning one of the most efficient fleets among public bitcoin mining companies, we can assume this is also one of the lowest costs among companies mining bitcoin. BTC Treasury Management As of April 30, 2025, CleanSpark's bitcoin treasury was valued at $1.13 billion. This is almost double the value that the company held in October 2024, just seven months prior. This was a combination of bitcoin's price appreciation and a nearly 40 percent increase in their bitcoin stack. Bitcoin Holdings Over Time ( CleanSpark May2025 Presentation) CleanSpark Performance Comparison Over Time As of January 2025 CleanSpark (This Article) June 7, 2025 CleanSpark ( Last Article ) Feb 17, 2025 All-In Power Costs 6.0c/kWh 4.6c/kWh Fleet Efficiency 16.71 J/Th 16.15 J/Th Average bitcoin Produced per Day 22.38 20.19 Bitcoin Held 12,502 10,556 Bitcoin Produced 05/2025 694 626 Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding(MM) 280.9 280.8 Total Deployed Hash Rate 45.6 EH/s 40.1 EH/s Market Cap($B) $2.75 $2.95 Quarterly Revenue($M) $181.7 $162.3 Debt-to-Asset Ratio Q3* .29 .27 New Financing Opportunities CleanSpark has begun to become more creative in generating additional revenue and financing from their bitcoin stack. First, they are increasing their Coinbase lending program to $200 million where they borrow using their bitcoin as collateral, which should provide a method for them to HODL greater amounts of their bitcoin. Here was the comment from Coinbase: Coinbase is excited to support CleanSpark and their innovative approach to capital and treasury management in Bitcoin mining,"" said Brett Tejpaul, Head of Coinbase Institutional. ""By deepening our relationship with CleanSpark and offering institutional-grade lending and custody management through our Prime service offering, we're committed to delivering strategic solutions that help CleanSpark thrive in the evolving crypto landscape. Secondly, the company will begin to sell covered calls on some of their bitcoin. Since they have chosen to sell a portion of their bitcoin to finance operations, selling covered calls to capture the premium to spot price only makes sense. The CFO Mike Vermicelli describes the covered call premiums like this from their 2025 Q2 conference call. Bitcoin’s trading around, what, $101,000 right now. So if we were to issue covered calls at the money, so with a strike price of $101,000 one week out, that’s a premium of a little over $2,400 or 2.4%. Risks and Counterarguments Bitcoin's Price Risk One of the biggest risks for CleanSpark is the bitcoin price. This should be obvious to investors, in that if the bitcoin price declines, then CleanSpark's share price will decline as well. This will impact their revenue as well as their balance sheet. But if you believe in bitcoin, then you understand that bitcoin's volatility can work to your advantage if you are patient. Not HODLing All Their Bitcoin Given bitcoin's impressive growth and its potential future growth, a risk that may not be so obvious, is the risk of not HODLing all of the bitcoin that the company mines. This is not a risk in that the company could go down in value, but rather a risk that other companies that HODL all of their bitcoin will perform better. Although CleanSpark's strategy should make them more stable, other bitcoin miners such as MARA have embarked on a bitcoin policy of not selling any of their bitcoin. If in fact we are entering a bitcoin bull market, then the companies that use financial leverage in order to fund operations while not selling any bitcoin, will outperform. As I mentioned, CleanSpark has chosen to hold most of their bitcoin, but to sell some to fund their expansion plans and ongoing operations. If bitcoin were to double or triple in price during a potential bull market, CleanSpark will miss out on some of those relatively quick returns in exchange for reducing balance sheet risk from greater debt levels. Looking at this from another perspective, some investors may appreciate this strategy more than the full HODL strategy. By selling bitcoin to finance operations, it certainly incentivizes CleanSpark to continue being one of, if not the most, efficient bitcoin miners in the market. Acquiring bitcoin via debt and issuing shares could make a bitcoin mining company complacent with their operating performance. The Bitcoin Treasury Companies Another counterargument to CleanSpark and the bitcoin mining industry at large, is the idea that bitcoin treasury companies will outperform bitcoin mining companies. The logic is that bitcoin mining companies have to invest tremendous amounts of capital to acquire the same number of bitcoin per share as companies like MicroStrategy, or as it is now called, Str ategy ( MSTR ). Strategy has experienced so much success, that many everyday companies have begun to follow by adopting bitcoin onto their balance sheets. Although few have tried to copy Strategy by making their company's sole focus being a bitcoin treasury company, there have been several that have begun, such as the future Twenty One Capital company which is waiting to be merged with Cantor Equity Partners ( CEP ). Tariffs Tariffs that increase the cost of bitcoin mining equipment coming from China is another risk. This, no doubt, can have an impact on the company. However, the CEO, Zach Bradford, tried to spin this as a positive in the following statement: In fact, if tariffs persist, we may see opportunities to acquire smaller miners at attractive valuations, particularly those unable to afford next-generation hardware under the new cost structures. This is a clear example of how our infrastructure-first, counter-cyclical strategy continues to generate strategic advantages over peers. Conclusion CleanSpark, among bitcoin mining companies, is one of the better, if not the best, company. If you believe in bitcoin mining, then CleanSpark belongs in your portfolio. They have proven themselves to be driven by continuous improvement, which has positioned them as one of the most efficient bitcoin mining companies. Given that bitcoin is a scarce, finite commodity, a company can only thrive long-term by being focused on continuous improvement. Currently, I think capital markets still have a hunger for bitcoin that the bitcoin treasury companies are positioned to benefit from. With limited competition, treasury companies like Strategy will likely continue to outperform. But bitcoin mining companies should still perform very well. One day, when the market competition among bitcoin treasury companies becomes much tighter, I expect bitcoin mining companies will provide a greater source of alpha for investors. Like I said, I don't think that day is today, but I'm not sure when that will be. Investors who want to invest in bitcoin in the public markets must play their hand and let the chips fall. But if your bet is on bitcoin mining, then CleanSpark is a strong buy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795333-cleanspark-gaining-efficiency-and-scale?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","CLSK",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T08:39:50,"Pay for Your Latte with Bitcoin? SpacePay’s Got You Covered","The post Pay for Your Latte with Bitcoin? SpacePay’s Got You Covered appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ever tried paying for coffee with Bitcoin? Yeah, it’s usually a nightmare. Most places either don’t accept it or make you jump through so many hoops that your latte gets cold before you’re done. But here’s where things get interesting. SpacePay , this fintech company from London, figured out how to let you pay with crypto using the same card machines that are already everywhere. They work with existing Android payment terminals, support more than 325 crypto wallets, and instantly convert everything to regular money so shop owners don’t freak out about price swings. Their $SPY token presale has pulled in over $1.1 million so far, with tokens going for $0.003181 each. Your Morning Latte Just Got a Crypto Upgrade We all know that one friend who owns Bitcoin but can never actually spend it anywhere useful. Coffee shops want these customers, but setting up crypto payments usually costs a fortune and requires a computer science degree to figure out. SpacePay decided to fix this mess. Coffee shop owners can start accepting crypto payments tomorrow using whatever card machine they already have. No expensive upgrades. No confusing setup process. Just a quick software update and they’re ready to go. For customers, it’s dead simple. Pull out your phone, open your favorite crypto wallet, and pay with Ethereum or whatever you’ve got. Takes about the same time as tapping your credit card. Done. This opens up a pretty big opportunity. There are more than 400 million people walking around with crypto in their digital wallets. Most of them would love to actually use it for something other than staring at price charts all day. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1925613304023511376 Here’s How SpacePay Deals with Crypto’s Wild Price Swings Anyone who’s owned cryptocurrency knows the drill. You wake up and your Bitcoin is worth 15% less than when you went to bed. Coffee shop owners hate this uncertainty, and honestly, who can blame them? SpacePay solves this problem in the most straightforward way possible. Customer pays with crypto, SpacePay immediately converts it to dollars or euros or whatever currency the business owner wants. The shop gets regular money. No crypto risk. No sleepless nights worrying about market crashes. This instant conversion thing is probably why business owners actually want to use SpacePay. They get access to crypto-spending customers without any of the usual drama. Plus, SpacePay only charges 0.5% per transaction, which beats most credit card companies by a mile. Think about a busy café processing 500 transactions a day. Those fee savings add up fast. More money stays in the business owner’s pocket instead of going to payment processors. Visit SpacePay Presale What’s the Deal with $SPY Tokens? SpacePay runs on their own token called $SPY. Token holders get to vote on platform changes, which is actually pretty cool if you’re into having a say in how things work. But here’s the part that gets people excited: revenue sharing. As SpacePay processes more transactions, token holders get a cut of the profits. More businesses using SpacePay means more money flowing back to the community. They also do these monthly airdrops for active users. Plus quarterly video calls where you can actually talk to the SpacePay team and ask questions. It feels less like buying tokens and more like joining a community that’s building something together. Early access to new features is another perk. $SPY holders get to test stuff before everyone else. If you’re running a business that accepts crypto payments, getting first dibs on new tools could give you an edge over competitors. Getting This Thing Up and Running SpacePay takes security seriously, which is smart considering how many crypto projects have gone sideways because of hacks. They use proper encryption and spread things across multiple systems instead of putting everything in one place. Setting up SpacePay looks pretty painless for merchants. Connect your Android payment terminal to their network, update the software, and you’re accepting crypto alongside regular cards. No rocket science required. The wallet support is solid too. Whether you’re team MetaMask or prefer something else, SpacePay probably works with it. They support the major cryptocurrencies plus stablecoins, so customers have options while merchants still get predictable fiat currency. Where This Could Go Next SpacePay already has a working product and seems focused on staying compliant with regulations. That’s probably smart given how many crypto companies have run into legal trouble by moving too fast and breaking things. Any business that takes card payments could potentially use SpacePay. Coffee shops, retail stores, restaurants, you name it. The low barrier to entry means even small businesses can get on board without breaking the bank. As more merchants join, the whole thing becomes more useful for everyone. More places to spend crypto means more transactions, which means more revenue to share with token holders. If you want to participate in the $SPY presale, head over to SpacePay’s website and connect your crypto wallet. Tokens are currently priced at $0.003181, and you can pay with various cryptocurrencies or even use a regular bank card if you’re new to the crypto world.

2025-06-17T08:32:54,"Why Bitfinex’s KYC Process Sets the Gold Standard in Crypto Industry","Would you ever lend money to a stranger who emailed you out of the blue? Exactly. Yet that’s the reality of the internet in 2025. Every day, you’re transacting with people you’ve never met, from every corner of the globe. Many are legitimate. Some know exactly how to hide behind layers of fake information. In fact, as the Bitrace Crypto Crime Report 2025 points out, crypto-related losses have already topped $502 million this year , with 63% due to hacks and the rest tied to phishing, rug pulls, and social engineering. Many of these crimes share one thing in common: they exploit weak or non-existent Know Your Customer (KYC) processes on platforms where compliance isn’t a priority. At Bitfinex, not only do we follow global compliance standards, we set the gold standard. Our KYC process is designed to protect users, prevent fraud, and ensure long-term access to a maturing financial system. At Bitfinex, KYC is the backbone of trust. Here, every stranger is verified. Thousands are going through our verification process the same way you did. All to protect you! At Bitfinex, Every Stranger is Verified KYC isn’t about red tape. It’s about responsibility. Without it, criminals can slip through the cracks, using throwaway accounts as launchpads for money laundering and fraud. While some platforms boast “instant access” or “no KYC required,” the underlying reality is often higher risk for users and higher conversion for their bottom line. High-stakes trading competitions, generous bonuses, and heavily hyped (often unvetted) listings, when paired with fast-tracked KYC processes that prioritise speed over thoroughness, are all part of the drive for massive acquisition. According to a 2020 study by blockchain analysis firm CypherTrace , in 2019, about 56% of crypto exchanges still had no KYC at all. That same year, criminals laundered an estimated $3.38 billion in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies As many exchanges prioritise rapid user acquisition and retail volume at all costs, often at the expense of safety, Bitfinex has consistently chosen the route of longevity, transparency, and compliance. Would you trust a bank that let anyone move millions without verifying who they are? Neither would we. Every credible financial platform, whether it’s a bank, brokerage, or crypto exchange, requires identity verification. This is the norm of best financial practices. At Bitfinex, we set the same financial standard for a crypto exchange. Here’s What Strong KYC Looks Like Bitfinex’s process is clear and structured but intentionally thorough: Basic Plus Verification Just upload your ID, confirm your address and phone number, and take a quick selfie. This gives you access to crypto deposits, withdrawals, and spot trading. Intermediate Verification Add a second ID, a proof of address, and complete a short financial form. Perfect if you want higher limits or to unlock margin trading. Full Verification Include a bank statement and a few extra details. Required if you want to deposit or withdraw fiat. This is bank-grade onboarding , built for users operating in a market where billions move daily and where security isn’t optional. Because just like any credible financial institution, we don’t offer advanced tools and global liquidity just to anyone without verifying who’s behind the screen. A Platform Worthy of Professional Traders Registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) while embracing The Original Bitcoin Exchange as our legacy, Bitfinex has been serving professional traders and institutions since 2012. That legacy isn’t built on hype. It’s built on trust. It happened because we took security, regulation, and infrastructure seriously long before it became industry standard. Today, Bitfinex holds approximately 403,000 BTC , worth over $47 billion , making it the second-largest bitcoin reserve among centralized exchanges . This is a signal that the biggest holders in the space continue to choose Bitfinex to move, manage, and secure large-scale capital. On-chain data confirms Bitfinex’s appeal to whales, including a $400 million ETH transfer from two dormant wallets in 2024. These are long-term actors choosing infrastructure built for serious capital. Our KYC process is intentionally rigorous, not just to meet global regulatory standards, but to ensure that all customers on our platform are protected. Our KYC process has been refined, audited, and stress-tested to meet not just where the industry was, but where it’s going. And it’s why Bitfinex continues to attract the most serious participants in the space , those who think long-term and act with intention. Trust Is Earned, Not Fast-Tracked A thorough KYC process is a feature and a high bar we proudly set . And the foundation of wealth building starts with asset security at its roots. In crypto, as in life, the things that are built to last are never the easiest, they’re just the most worth it. At the end of the day, a platform that takes your identity seriously, is far more likely to take your assets seriously too.

2025-06-17T08:32:27,"Pol (MATIC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will MATIC Price Surge to $1?","The post Pol (MATIC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will MATIC Price Surge to $1? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of the Polygon coin is $ 0.21819891 . The MATIC price could reach a maximum of $0.47181 in 2025. POL price with a potential surge may reach a high of $4.94731 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network’s high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL’s price value, too. Through, POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framwork of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin, and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction. Table of contents Overview Polygon Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Polygon Price Action 2026 POL Price Prediction 2027 Polygon Crypto Price Forecast 2028 MATIC Coin Price Projection 2029 Polygon Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Token MATIC Price $ 0.21819891 2.88% Market Cap $ 0.00 Trading Volume $ 1,217,344.7306 Circulating Supply 0.00 All-time High $1.29 Mar 14, 2024 All-time Low $0.1533 Apr 07, 2025 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 As evident on the POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE, its price fell in Q1 2025, along with other altcoins in the market, due to trade deal problems in the US. This led investors to refrain from investing in the entire market and watch from the sidelines. However, in Q2 2025’s April month onwards, momentum started as investors got a glimpse of improving geopolitical situations and other positive factors. However, like every other altcoin, POL price action didn’t have a big rise in early May, and it lost its strength early on after reaching $0.269. Even the RSI has slipped below the median line and has taken rejection from the 14-day SMA smoothing line and is at 40.27. Despite the loss in momentum, the bears have not been dominant yet, and it is consolidating near the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands and key support zone. But if it breaks the support zone’s low of $0.194, then bearish forces will take control and push it down to the $0.15 level. However, if the conditions improve, then the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.4572 could act as a magnet for the POL price to rise. This level also aligns with early 2025’s price action-based high-volume profile level. If it successfully clears the $0.4572 level in June or July, there is a higher chance that the POL price might hit the Fibonacci 0.786 level at $0.6336 and the other at $0.7655 by the end of the year 2025. On the contrary, if the $0.4572 proves to be too strong to break, then there is a strong chance for bears to take over the trend and repel the price from the fibonacci 0.5 level to the lows of 2025.

2025-06-17T08:30:16,"Ethereum Slows Down In June: Historical Data Says More Losses To Come","Ethereum is already seeing a slowdown for the month of June, suggesting that it is sticking to established historical trends for the month. With half of the month already gone, the altcoin is likely to finish out the month in the same trend, and the previous cycle data warns of further price crashes. But how far down will the Ethereum price go before it recovers? Ethereum Fighting The Bears In June According to data from the CryptoRank website, the month of June is the second-worst month for the Ethereum price historically. This comes down to its average and median returns, which sit at -6.56% and -5.65%, respectively, showing that returns for the month are likely to be red. It falls behind only the month of September, which has -10.7% average returns and -13.6% median returns. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Explodes 3,194%: Can It Change The SHIB Price Trajectory?

So far, the month of June 2025 has seen very little gains, with CryptoRank data only showing a 0.20% increase at the time of writing. This suggests a continuation of the established bearish trend, especially with the bear still pushing down the price of Bitcoin, and the rest of the crypto market keeps going down with it. If the altcoin does stick to its historical performance, then it is possible that the price could break below $2,500 before the month is over. However, there is still the possibility of a recovery if the Bitcoin price does continue to rise. Bullish Sentiment Still Strong Despite the bearish trend of June, crypto analysts are still calling for higher prices for Ethereum. One analyst, Crypto Patel, predicts a possible short-term crash if the Ethereum price drops below $2,500. Patel believes $2,000 is next if this happens. However, long-term remains bullish as the crypto analyst believes Ethereum is headed for $10,000. Related Reading: Dormant Ethereum Wallet Awakens After 10 Years With Millions Worth Of ETH Another crypto analyst, Ash Crypto, pointed out that ETH is forming a possible golden cross, just one month after Bitcoin did. But unlike Bitcoin, which usually takes months to play out a golden cross trend, the crypto analyst says Ethereum will begin immediately, and the target from here is $3,500. Crypto analyst Lord of Alts also explained that Ethereum is actually playing out as expected, with three trends. The first is consolidation, then accumulation, before ending in a price expansion. Lord of Alts says ETH is entering this trend again and puts the price as high as $6,000 by 2026.

2025-06-17T08:29:40,"WhiteBIT Coin (WBT) Defies Altcoins’ Crash, Bitcoin (BTC) Stopped at $109K: Market Watch","The latest developments on the Middle East front resulted in enhanced volatility in the cryptocurrency market once again, as bitcoin was stopped at $109,000, pushed south by a few grand, and is trying to recover now. The altcoins are mostly in the red today, aside from WBT, which has extended its massive run. BTC’s Up and Down The geopolitical tension in the Middle East harmed the primary cryptocurrency at the end of the previous business week. At the time, the asset traded close to $108,500, but Israel’s initial attack caught the market off guard, and bitcoin slumped by several grand to under $103,000. Although Iran retaliated on the next day and the attacks have continued, BTC managed to recover some ground during the weekend and stood between $104,000 and $106,000. The start of the current business week was a lot more positive as bitcoin jumped past $107,000 on Monday and kept climbing in the evening to a multi-day peak of $109,000. However, as US President Trump advised for the immediate evacuation of Tehran, BTC slumped back down to under $106,400. It has reclaimed some ground since then and now trades close to $107,000, but it’s still slightly down on a daily scale. Its market cap has dropped to $2.120 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has increased slightly to 61.6%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView WBT Defies the Odds Most altcoins have turned red on a daily scale, led by the recent high-flyer, HYPE. The asset, which charted yet another all-time high yesterday, is down by over 5% since then to $42. Even more painful declines come from the likes of PEPE, PI, TAO, ONDO, ICP, and KAS. SOL, SUI, AVAX, ADA, ETH, DOGE, and LINK are also in the red, albeit in a more modest manner. In contrast, XRP, BNB, TRX, and BCH have charted some gains. WBT stands in a league of its own, having surged by another 30% in the past 24 hours to tap a fresh peak above $50. The total crypto market cap has shed around $40 billion since yesterday and is down to $3.440 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-06-17T08:18:36,"Key Solana Investor Surges 20% as Hype Builds for SOL Layer 2 Solaxy Launch","The Bitcoin strategy continues to dominate the airwaves, but internationally, another cryptocurrency is gaining steam. Hong Kong-based MemeStrategy became the first publicly traded company to invest in Solana. Its stock promptly jumped 20% (and 45% in the last 5 days), an indication of just how much hype is building behind the Solana ecosystem. It’s not a surprise. With Solana meme coin launcher Pump.fun preparing to launch its own token, Bybit aiming for a Solana-based DEX, and Solaxy ($SOLX) wrapping up a $50M+ presale for a Solana Layer-2, the future looks bright. MemeStrategy Bets on $SOL Why Solana? As Asia’s first public digital assets company, MemeStrategy needs to be careful where it puts its cash. So why sink it on $SOL? The company announcement identified three clear reasons: ‘Tapping into a Rapidly Growing Ecosystem’ : There’s a lot of buzz behind Solana, with developers, users, and institutions all aligned to expand the ecosystem ‘Generating Returns through Blockchain Validation’ : Proof-of-Stake allows Meme Strategy to earn returns while holding $SOL ‘Enhancing Asset Allocation and Diversification’ : As a leading altcoin, Solana gives MemeStrategy a chance to diversify in major cryptos The plan highlights how confident MemeStrategy is in the overall health of the Solana blockchain. And they’re not the only ones who’re confident. Bybit Builds Solana DEX, ETFs Ready to Launch Solana has always been a sort of photo-negative of Ethereum, following $ETH into memes and then arguably surpassing it, becoming both a rival and a copycat. Is Solana following the same path with DeFi and DEXs? The recent announcement of a native Solana DEX – known as Byreal – from the Bybit team indicates that may be true. The Byreal mainnet is set to launch in Q3 2025, providing traders with all the necessary tools for a high-powered trading platform, including: CEX + DEX synergy : CEX-grade liquidity with DeFi-native transparency Unified liquidity & speed : Low-slippage and MEV-protected swaps at serious speed The debut of a major Solana DEX would doubtlessly boost the ecosystem that much further. Add in the expansion of ETFs to maybe include $SOL products, and there’s potential for long-term growth and a more immediate boost to $SOL’s price. That makes MemeStrategy’s purchase even more timely. The recent S-1 filing with the SEC , while not giving a clear timeline, is an incredibly bullish sign that major institutional investors are backing Solana. And on top of it all, there are other projects in the works that aim to improve Solana’s ecosystem. The best of them is Solaxy ($SOLX. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Last Chance to Buy First-Ever Solana Layer-2 Solaxy ($SOLX), the first-ever Solana Layer-2, has raised almost $54M and its set to transform the meme coin galaxy on Solana. The project is wrapping up a massive crypto presale with a simple goal – deploy a much-needed Solana upgrade that will get the blockchain truly future-ready. With a multi-chain architecture and token bridge, $SOLX traders can leverage Ethereum’s power and scalability alongside Solana’s innovation and speed to set the stage for an expanded Solana ecosystem. The presale ended yesterday but you can still buy $SOLX until the token claim on June 23. The full bridge deployment is next (the testnet bridge and block explorer are already live). After that comes staking unlock and then the mainnet launch, with full features following shortly. Solaxy is the rare project to successfully combine a meme coin zeitgeist with true utility. And with Solana on the rise, the timing couldn’t be better. After all, what is Solaxy? It’s the future of the Solana blockchain, according to the devs themselves. The token price is $0.001766, so don’t delay. Our own price prediction shows the token could reach $0.032 by the end of the year, delivering massive 1,712% returns to current investors. Visit the Solaxy presale page to get your hands on this red-hot token. DEXs, Strategic Reserves, and Presales: The Future Looks Bright for Solana Solana’s rise is no longer speculative, but strategic. From MemeStrategy’s bold $SOL investment to Bybit’s upcoming DEX and the last rush to buy $SOLX , the momentum behind Solana is accelerating. As institutional confidence builds and infrastructure expands, Solana is positioning itself as a serious contender in the next wave of crypto adoption.

Over the past 48 hours, Bitcoin price action has remained choppy as the asset navigates between a key supply zone and a short-term order block. BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The rejection near the red liquidity area marked by a Change of Character (ChoCH) confirms sellers defending the $108,800–$110,000 range. However, bulls are holding onto structure, with price still above the $106,000 demand zone. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) A closer look at the 4-hour chart shows that Bitcoin price retraced after testing the overhead imbalance zone. Despite the bearish reaction, price has not violated the recent bullish ChoCH support formed near $105,900. The Bollinger Bands show expanding volatility, but the upper band rejection aligns with the local top. Meanwhile, price is hovering near the 20/50/100 EMA cluster between $106,270 and $106,530, keeping the trend neutral in the short term.

2025-06-17T08:10:48,"Elizabeth Warren Slams Stablecoin Bill, Says “This Helps Musk and Trump Get Rich”","The post Elizabeth Warren Slams Stablecoin Bill, Says “This Helps Musk and Trump Get Rich” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill to regulate payment stablecoins , is now at the center of a major controversy. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has raised alarms, warning that billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos could abuse the system if critical loopholes aren’t fixed. Her warning has ignited a heated debate in the crypto community and among lawmakers. So, what exactly is the GENIUS Act , and why is it drawing so much attention? What Is the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is a proposed U.S. Senate bill aiming to establish a federal framework for payment stablecoins. It sets out: Rules for issuance and transparency Reserve requirements for stablecoin providers Clear oversight roles for regulators The bill recently cleared a cloture vote and is now headed for a full Senate floor vote, where several amendments are expected to be considered. Warren’s Warning: “Billionaires Could Track Your Spending” Senator Elizabeth Warren took to X (formerly Twitter) to issue a sharp warning: “If Congress doesn’t fix the GENIUS Act, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos could launch stablecoins that track your purchases, exploit your data, and squeeze out competitors.” Warren’s statement highlights a key concern: if tech giants gain control over both stablecoin issuance and the platforms on which they operate, it could create a dangerous data monopoly. Musk and Bezos Eyeing Stablecoins? Elon Musk Reports suggest Musk’s company X is exploring stablecoin integration through its X Money initiative, with the goal of enabling peer-to-peer payments and reducing transaction fees. Jeff Bezos Speculation is swirling that Amazon is also developing a USD-backed stablecoin , aiming to cut costs and streamline online payments. These potential moves by tech titans are exactly what Warren fears—corporate dominance over digital money and consumer data. The Consumer Risk: Privacy at Stake? Stablecoin transactions are recorded on public blockchains. But if a corporation controls both the stablecoin and the user platform, it could: Connect your wallet to your profile Monitor spending behavior in real-time Use the data for hyper-targeted ads, dynamic pricing, or even sell it to third parties This raises major privacy and surveillance concerns. Trump, Stablecoins, and the Politics of Regulation Senator Warren also warned of another risk: bailouts. If corporate stablecoins crash, taxpayers might be on the hook. Adding fuel to the fire, President Donald Trump is now tied to a controversial stablecoin project. Trump’s Crypto Empire: World Liberty Financial World Liberty Financial (WLF) was launched in 2024 Trump serves as “Chief Crypto Advocate” His sons are listed as “ Web3 Ambassadors.” A Trump-affiliated entity owns 60% of WLF and receives 75% of revenue WLF has raised over $550 million and issued a USD1 stablecoin , backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents. While Trump’s support for crypto aligns with his campaign promises, critics question whether there’s a conflict of interest. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Today: Bitcoin Dips, XRP Pulls Back, Ethereum Lags Ahead of FOMC , Supporters vs Critics: The Stablecoin Divide Not everyone agrees with Warren. Fred Rispoli, a pro-crypto lawyer, argues the GENIUS Act could break big banks’ monopoly on consumer data. Others believe corporate stablecoins could boost innovation and financial inclusion. Critics also accuse Warren of hypocrisy for backing a government-run digital currency with similar data risks. Previous concerns around money laundering, foreign coins, and corporate involvement have been partially addressed in the bill, but the privacy debate remains unresolved. Final Vote Ahead: Will GENIUS Be Rewritten? The GENIUS Act is still evolving. As it heads to a full Senate vote, amendments may reshape its final form.But one thing is clear: the outcome will significantly impact the future of stablecoins in the U.S.—and the power tech giants may (or may not) have over them. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-17T08:05:46,"Bybit & Block Scholes: ETH-BTC volatility hits five-year high as ETH plays catch-up","BitcoinWorld Bybit & Block Scholes: ETH-BTC volatility hits five-year high as ETH plays catch-up DUBAI , UAE , June 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Bybit , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, released a new options volatility report in collaboration with Block Scholes. The report shows a historic volatility divergence between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) during May 2025. Key Highlights: In May 2025 , ETH options exhibited historically high volatility premiums over BTC, driven by ETH’s elevated realized volatility during a major price rally. The ETH-to-BTC implied volatility ratio for short-dated options surged past 2x — reaching a nearly five-year high. BTC’s realized volatility fell below a long-standing 35% floor, breaking a 19-month trend. ETH’s volatility term structure showed persistent inversion, with shorter-dated options pricing higher volatility than longer-dated ones. The implied volatility divergence coincided with ETH’s outperformance, which included a 23% intraday rally amid key market events. ETH-to-BTC Implied Volatility Expands to Five-Year High In May 2025 , a notable dislocation in implied volatility emerged between ETH and BTC options. Implied volatility reflects market expectations for future price movement over an option’s lifespan. At the start of the month, the ETH-to-BTC implied volatility ratio for 7-day options hovered around 1.5 — indicating that ETH options were priced with 50% higher expected volatility than BTC options. By May 16 , the ratio climbed above 2x, reaching a peak not seen since 2020, as BTC’s implied volatility declined to its lowest levels since October 2023 . This drop in BTC volatility broke below the 35% floor that had held for over 19 months, while ETH’s short-tenor implied volatility remained elevated, though slightly below its May 10 high. The volatility spread was particularly pronounced in the 30-day tenor, reaching its widest point since mid-2022. Realized Volatility Trends Underscore the Divergence The sharp divergence in implied volatility was reinforced by trends in realized volatility — a measure of actual historical price movement. In May, ETH’s realized volatility significantly outpaced BTC’s across various tenors, fueling expectations for continued dispersion between the two assets. On May 15 , the 7-day realized volatility ratio between ETH and BTC peaked, closely followed by the implied volatility ratio — suggesting market participants expected ETH’s higher volatility to persist. This trend is not new: the ETH-BTC volatility ratio has been climbing steadily since July 2024 , amid both bull runs and periods of market stress. ETH’s standout performance in May was catalyzed by several factors, including positive US-UK trade news. ETH surged more than 23% on May 8 alone and continued to outperform BTC, which gained approximately 10% during the same period. Despite this momentum, ETH remained over 50% below its January 2025 peak and its all-time high. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BybitReport About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

2025-06-17T07:59:01,"Crypto Market Today: Bitcoin Dips, XRP Pulls Back, Ethereum Lags Ahead of FOMC","The post Crypto Market Today: Bitcoin Dips, XRP Pulls Back, Ethereum Lags Ahead of FOMC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A cloud of uncertainty hangs over global markets as investors brace for the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. With no major policy shifts expected, traders are watching closely for signals on rate cuts, inflation trends, and macro risks. The crypto market, already tense from recent volatility, is showing mixed performance with XRP leading gains among major tokens. Bitcoin Wobbles Amid Geopolitical Tensions Bitcoin briefly topped $108,000 in early U.S. hours on Monday before sliding to $106,500 on profit-taking. It later bounced back above $107,000 during Asian trading on Tuesday. The movement follows Friday’s $1.2 billion in futures liquidations, which forced out overleveraged traders and weighed heavily on altcoins through the weekend. Despite the choppy action, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $1.4 billion in net inflows last week, reinforcing their growing role as stabilizers during volatile periods. Analysts suggest Bitcoin’s slow response to macroeconomic stress could change if investors seek alternative safe-haven assets. “Bitcoin typically lags behind gold and oil during geopolitical events, but if risk sentiment turns, BTC could quickly regain momentum,” said Eugene Cheung of OSL . XRP Takes the Lead as Altcoins Recover While most major altcoins are still recovering from the weekend drawdown, XRP stood out with a strong rebound. XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, is trading at $2.17 with a 0.77% daily gain, backed by a $128.23 billion market cap and $1.74 billion in volume. It continues to hold a strong position, supported by growing interest in institutional banking integration. Ethereum ticked up 1.5% to $2,609 but continued to trail Bitcoin’s ETF-fueled performance. Solana and Tron also posted modest gains, but sentiment across altcoins remains cautious. Meanwhile, Gold and oil surged early Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly urged the evacuation of Tehran during the G7 summit. The geopolitical jolt sent investors rushing into defensive assets, while Bitcoin’s response remained subdued. XRP Outperformed Bitcoin This Cycle, Says Analyst Crypto analyst Nick pointed out that XRP has gained more than 678% since its 2022 low, beating Bitcoin’s 565% rise. He added that XRP’s total gains this cycle have already topped 1,000%, and the rally isn’t over yet. According to him, XRP has outpaced both Bitcoin and Ethereum in this bull run so far. Fed Holds the Spotlight All eyes are now on the Fed. Market watchers expect interest rates to remain unchanged, but the tone of Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks could set the course for crypto and equities alike. With inflation easing and jobs data holding firm, officials may opt for patience, though some, like SignalPlus’ Augustine Fan, believe a dovish tilt could be signaled subtly. The near-term outlook remains tied to the Fed’s message and the unfolding tensions in the Middle East. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-17T07:54:16,"The Blockchain Group raises additional $7.7M to grow Bitcoin treasury","The Blockchain Group has raised an additional €7.2 million, about $7.7 million, to support its plan of becoming Europe’s leading Bitcoin Treasury company. The announcement was made in a June 17 press release by the Paris-listed firm (Euronext: ALTBG.PA), which is pursuing a long-term strategy of increasing the amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) per share it holds. The funding was secured through an “At-The-Market type” capital raise with asset manager TOBAM, where 1.6 million new shares were issued at an average price of €4.49. That price reflected a 20.76% discount from the stock’s June 13 close, due to market volatility during the raise. The capital raise allows The Blockchain Group to continue adding BTC to its balance sheet, as part of a broader treasury strategy that started in late 2024. https://twitter.com/_altbg/status/1934854391451775360?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw You might also like: Michael Saylor’s Strategy strengthens Bitcoin bet with 10,100 BTC purchase This strategy mirrors capital market moves made by firms like Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet, both of which hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. The Blockchain Group is one of the first in Europe to follow this path, aiming to accumulate up to 260,000 BTC, currently about $24 billion, by 2033. The recent capital raise saw TOBAM, through three of its funds, subscribe to all 1.6 million shares. The largest tranche went to the TOBAM Bitcoin CO2 Offset Fund, which acquired over 834,000 shares. The other two funds, the Bitcoin Treasury Opportunities Fund and the Blockchain Equity Fund, took the remaining portion. As a result, TOBAM now holds 3.3% of The Blockchain Group’s capital on a fully diluted basis. The capital raise follows a shareholder vote on June 11 that increased the company’s fundraising capacity to €500 million in nominal value. That resolution passed with over 95% approval, underlining strong investor support for the Bitcoin pivot. On a fully diluted basis, the company’s share count now exceeds 313 million, factoring in all potential conversions from bonds, free share grants, and warrants. The Blockchain Group’s model draws on the idea that Bitcoin is a long-term hedge against inflation and fiat currency risks. The company, which also develops decentralized tech, AI, and data tools, believes BTC can protect shareholder value and offer stronger returns than traditional treasury reserves. The firm joins a growing list of publicly traded companies shifting to a Bitcoin-focused strategy, a trend analysts say could grow to $330 billion in corporate holdings by 2029.

The total amount of Bitcoin in the country’s treasury has thus reached 6,209. El Salvador, the first country in the world to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, reached a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF in December 2024. The agreement stipulated that Bitcoin would be stripped of its official currency status and that the government would halt Bitcoin purchases. However, President Nayib Bukele’s strategy of “buying one Bitcoin a day”, which he launched in 2022, continues. According to the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, a total of 240 more Bitcoins have been purchased since December 19, 2024 (following the IMF agreement). These purchases, calculated at approximately $106,658 each, amount to more than $25 million.

2025-06-17T07:18:16,"Crypto Shows Immunity as Bitcoin Quickly Recovers From Tehran Tensions","Total crypto market capitalization shed around $80 billion over a few hours late on Monday night as Middle East tensions escalated. It fell marginally to around $3.44 trillion as Bitcoin dipped by over $2,000 in a decline to around $106,500 before it immediately started to recover and reclaim $107,000 at the time of writing. The dip was caused by US President Donald Trump calling for the evacuation of Tehran as the exchange of missiles between Israel and Iran continued for a fourth day. Trump Leaves G7 Donald Trump departed the annual G7 meeting in Canada early, telling reporters, “I have to be back early for obvious reasons.” The POTUS also took to his Social Media platform to say that Iran should have signed his “deal” before adding that the country cannot have a nuclear weapon and “everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran.” TRUMP: “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran.” pic.twitter.com/vGygTxuFsg — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 16, 2025 Meanwhile, other nations, including China and Russia, urged their citizens to evacuate Tel Aviv as the military action intensified. The message appeared orchestrated to increase pressure on Iran to come to the negotiating table amid a veiled threat of military intervention. “American forces are maintaining their defensive posture, and that has not changed. We will defend American interests,” White House spokesman Alex Pfeiffer wrote on X while disputing fake news that air strikes were imminent. Odds on the United States taking military action against Iran before the end of this month surged to 67% on blockchain prediction platform Polymarket.

In fact, crypto markets tanked twice as hard when the Trump and Elon Musk bromance collapsed on June 6. Meanwhile, other risk-on assets such as tech stocks are also weathering the storm at the moment. “If there were even a 50% chance of WW3 right now, the S&P 500 wouldn’t be 2% away from a new all-time high,” observed the Kobeissi Letter. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was still trading in the middle of its range-bound channel, where it has been since the beginning of May, and Ethereum had bounced off support at $2,500, so crypto markets are holding up pretty well, all things considered.

2025-06-17T07:00:38,"Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Plummet $61 Billion—Warning Sign for Bitcoin?","On-chain data shows the exchange inflows related to the stablecoins USDT and USDC have seen a sharp plunge. Here’s what this could mean for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Have Dropped Below Yearly Average In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed about the latest trend in the Exchange Inflow of the top two stablecoins in the sector, USDT and USDC. The “Exchange Inflow” refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that’s moving into the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. Generally, investors may deposit their coins into these platforms when they want to trade them away, so a high value on the Exchange Inflow can indicate demand for swapping the cryptocurrency. For volatile assets like Bitcoin, this is something that can naturally be bearish for the price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Must Hold This Level—Or Risk A 30% Price Crash In the case of stablecoins, however, their price doesn’t see any impact from exchange deposits, since it always remains, by definition, stable around whatever fiat currency the asset is tracking. That said, stablecoin inflows aren’t without consequence. Investors usually deposit these assets to swap into a volatile cryptocurrency of their choice. As such, coins like Bitcoin can see a bullish effect from an Exchange Inflow spike related to these fiat-tied tokens. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the combined Exchange Inflow of the top two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, over the past few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Inflow of USDT and USDC shot up to a very high value at the end of last year, a sign that the investors were making massive deposits of these stablecoins. Alongside the spike in the indicator, the Bitcoin price observed a rally to a new all-time high (ATH), a potential sign that the stablecoin inflows may have helped provide the fuel for the run. At the peak of the spike, the metric reached a value of $131 billion per day. From the chart, it’s apparent that since then, the indicator has been following a downward trajectory and today, its value has come down to $70 billion per day. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls This represents a significant decline of $61 billion since the high. Though, while the indicator is indeed notably down compared to the peak, its current level is still high in the context of the wider cycle so far. Naturally, if this drawdown in the stablecoin Exchange Inflow keeps up, it could potentially turn out to be a bearish sign for Bitcoin and other digital assets. That said, even though BTC went down earlier in the year, its price is still above the $100,000 mark right now, a possible sign that investors may simply be entering a phase of consolidation.

2025-06-17T06:40:51,"Crucial Update: US Iran Denial Amidst Middle East Tensions and Crypto Market Impact","BitcoinWorld Crucial Update: US Iran Denial Amidst Middle East Tensions and Crypto Market Impact In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, market sentiment can shift in an instant, often influenced by global events far removed from blockchain technology itself. Recent developments regarding US Iran tensions highlight just how sensitive the digital asset space can be to geopolitical shifts and official statements. What Did the White House Denial Mean for Markets? Reports circulating in some media outlets suggested potential US military actions in Iran. However, a key statement from the White House quickly aimed to clarify the situation. Alex Pfeiffer, Deputy Assistant to the U.S. President and Principal Deputy Communications Director, took to social media platform X to directly address these claims. He explicitly stated that American forces are currently maintaining a defensive posture and emphasized that this stance remains unchanged. His words were unequivocal: “We will defend American interests.” Pfeiffer’s remarks were a direct counterpoint to reports, particularly from Israeli media sources, that had suggested the U.S. was actively conducting attacks within Iran. Such reports, even if unconfirmed, can send ripples through global financial markets, including the crypto market. Adding to the picture of the U.S. military’s stance, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (as reported in the original text, although Pete Hegseth is a Fox News commentator, not the Defense Secretary – assuming this is a factual error in the source text and proceeding with it) had previously announced via X that he had ordered the deployment of additional defensive assets to the Middle East over the preceding weekend. This action underscores the underlying high level of Middle East tensions , even as the White House denied offensive actions. Earlier still, Fox News’ Lawrence Jones had reported on X that President Donald Trump (assuming this refers to a past presidency or a hypothetical scenario based on the source text) had directed the National Security Council to be prepared in the situation room. While this detail speaks to readiness, Pfeiffer’s subsequent statement focused on the *current* posture being defensive, not offensive. Why Does Geopolitical Uncertainty Matter for Crypto? The cryptocurrency market, known for its volatility, is particularly susceptible to periods of geopolitical uncertainty . Unlike traditional assets that might have clearer correlations to economic indicators or specific industry performance, crypto’s value is heavily influenced by sentiment, global liquidity, and risk appetite. Here’s why events like rising US Iran tensions and subsequent official denials or confirmations can have an outsized impact: Risk-Off Sentiment: Heightened tensions often lead investors in traditional markets to move away from ‘riskier’ assets like stocks and sometimes even bonds, seeking perceived safe havens like gold or the US dollar. While Bitcoin is sometimes pitched as ‘digital gold,’ its relatively short history and price swings mean it can also be sold off alongside other risk assets during periods of fear. Liquidity Shifts: Major global events can cause large capital movements. If significant funds are pulled from markets due to fear, crypto can see sell pressure. Narrative Impact: News headlines, especially those concerning potential conflict, can trigger rapid emotional responses from traders, leading to impulsive buying or selling that amplifies price swings. Unpredictability: The very nature of geopolitical events is often unpredictable. This lack of clear forecasting makes markets nervous and prone to overreactions based on partial information or rumors. The quick succession of reports and denials in this specific instance exemplifies this unpredictability. Navigating the Crypto Market Impact For those involved in the digital asset space, understanding the potential crypto market impact of global events is crucial. While the White House denial in this case might have served to calm immediate fears of direct US military action, the underlying tensions in the Middle East persist, as indicated by the deployment of defensive assets. What can crypto investors and traders learn from this situation? Verify Information: In times of heightened tension, misinformation can spread rapidly. Rely on official sources like the White House statement mentioned (via Alex Pfeiffer on X) rather than unverified reports. Assess the Broader Context: A single denial doesn’t erase the underlying geopolitical climate. Consider the ongoing situation, including troop deployments and rhetoric, when evaluating potential market risks. Prepare for Volatility: Accept that geopolitical news can trigger sudden price movements in crypto. This isn’t a reason to panic, but a reminder to have a risk management strategy in place. Avoid Leverage During Uncertainty: High leverage can be wiped out quickly by sudden price swings caused by unexpected news. Consider reducing or avoiding leveraged positions during periods of significant global uncertainty. The White House denial regarding a US attack in Iran is a significant piece of information, but it exists within a larger, complex geopolitical landscape. For the crypto market, it serves as another data point in the ongoing assessment of global risk factors that can influence digital asset prices. Conclusion: Staying Alert in a Connected World The interconnectedness of global finance means that events happening thousands of miles away, from statements made by officials to military postures, can resonate in the cryptocurrency market. The recent US Iran tensions , and the subsequent clarification through the White House denial , underscore the importance of staying informed not just about crypto-specific news, but also about major global political and economic developments. While predicting the exact market reaction to any single event is impossible, understanding the potential for geopolitical uncertainty to increase volatility and shift sentiment is a key part of navigating the digital asset space successfully. As the situation in the Middle East remains fluid, keeping an eye on official communications and market reactions will be vital for crypto participants.

2025-06-17T06:30:47,"Altcoin Season Index Plummets: Crypto Market Enters Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Plummets: Crypto Market Enters Bitcoin Season Are you watching the cryptocurrency market and wondering why Bitcoin seems to be taking center stage? The latest reading from a key industry metric provides a clear answer: we’re currently navigating through what’s known as Bitcoin Season . This shift has significant implications for your portfolio and understanding the broader market dynamics. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index, a popular tool provided by cryptocurrency data giant CoinMarketCap (CMC), offers a snapshot of market sentiment and performance. It helps investors gauge whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are generally outperforming Bitcoin, or vice versa. The index specifically tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over the past 90 days. Here’s how the index breaks down the market phases: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index typically reads 75 or higher. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index typically reads 25 or lower. Neither Season: When the market doesn’t meet the criteria for either Altcoin or Bitcoin Season, typically indicated by index readings between 25 and 75. The index scores range from 1 (strong Bitcoin dominance) to 100 (strong altcoin dominance). Altcoin Season Index Signals Bitcoin Season As of June 17, 2024, at 00:35 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered a reading of just 24. This figure is down one point from the previous day, reinforcing the current market narrative. An index score of 24 falls squarely within the definition of Bitcoin Season , indicating that the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins have failed to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance over the preceding three months. This low reading suggests that capital is currently flowing primarily into Bitcoin, or that altcoins are experiencing stronger selling pressure compared to the market leader. For many investors holding diversified portfolios, this period can be challenging as their altcoin holdings may be underperforming relative to Bitcoin . Understanding Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market Why does the crypto market enter Bitcoin Season ? Several factors can contribute to this phenomenon. Often, during periods of market uncertainty or consolidation after significant price movements, investors tend to flock to Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer, more established asset compared to potentially volatile altcoins. Institutional interest also frequently focuses on Bitcoin first before potentially exploring other large-cap cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s recent performance relative to altcoins is the direct driver of the index’s current reading. While altcoins may see individual pumps or news-driven rallies, the broad trend across the top 100 is one of underperformance against BTC over the 90-day window. This doesn’t mean altcoins are necessarily losing value in absolute terms (though some may be), but rather that their percentage gains (or smaller percentage losses) are not matching Bitcoin’s . Navigating Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season Cycles The crypto market is known for its cyclical nature. Periods of Bitcoin Season are often followed by periods where altcoins catch up or even surge dramatically, leading to Altcoin Season . Understanding these cycles is crucial for investors. During Bitcoin Season, some investors may choose to increase their Bitcoin holdings, while others might see it as an opportunity to accumulate promising altcoins at potentially lower relative prices, anticipating the eventual return of Altcoin Season. Key takeaways for navigating the current market phase: Assess Your Portfolio: Review your allocation between Bitcoin and altcoins. Does it align with your risk tolerance and market outlook? Research Altcoins: Use this period to research projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases that might perform well when market sentiment shifts. Manage Risk: Volatility remains high. Consider setting stop-losses or taking profits where appropriate. While the current Altcoin Season Index reading points firmly to Bitcoin Season, the crypto market is dynamic. Conditions can change rapidly, and a sustained shift in capital flows could eventually pave the way for altcoins to regain momentum. The low reading on the Altcoin Season Index serves as a clear indicator of the prevailing sentiment and performance trends in the crypto market right now. With Bitcoin firmly in the driver’s seat, investors are adapting their strategies to navigate this phase, keeping a close watch for signs of the next shift.

That short-lived rally was driven by easing oil prices after the spike on Friday that followed Israel’s airstrikes on Iran. Both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate settled more than 1% lower during Monday’s session before bouncing back overnight on Trump’s warnings. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Bitcoin remained above $107,000, having retaken that level earlier on Monday. The leading crypto asset didn’t flinch despite the turmoil across equities. At the same time, gold retreated to $3,393, falling below the $3,400 level. Traders had expected the usual safe haven behavior, but Bitcoin held firmer than gold this round, though that isn’t really impressive. By last night, the Israel-Iran war had entered its fourth day. NBC News reported that Iran reached out to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and others asking them to push Trump for a ceasefire. The request reportedly included Iran’s offer to show flexibility on nuclear negotiations if the White House pressured Israel to back down. Trump instead made clear he wouldn’t budge and took a public, hard-line stance. Source: TradingView Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, explained that Israel’s main focus is stopping Iran from becoming a nuclear threat. He added that the longer-term objective may be regime change in Tehran, though it’s unclear whether that’s achievable. Jeff said that while every conflict is unique, data from 25 geopolitical events since 1941—including the Pearl Harbor attack—shows an average stock market drop of 4.6% over about 19 days, with recovery usually taking around 40 days. The current dip in futures may just be the beginning if the escalation continues. Investors are also watching domestic economic data closely. Retail sales numbers for May are due Tuesday, and that could give further insight into consumer demand amid inflation worries. But the real focus is on the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting scheduled for Wednesday. The CME FedWatch tool shows traders are betting heavily that the Fed will keep interest rates steady, sticking with the 4.25% to 4.50% range. That decision, however, may not be enough to calm markets already rattled by events in the Middle East. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-06-17T06:25:28,"Eric Trump Denies Public Role in Tron’s Nasdaq Push Despite Ties to Deal Broker","Key Takeaways: Eric Trump denies any public role in Tron’s Nasdaq listing despite his ties to the firm brokering the deal. Tron plans to go public via a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, backed by a $100M investment. Justin Sun’s growing relationship with the Trump family has raised eyebrows amid a paused SEC investigation. Eric Trump has dismissed reports linking him to a direct role in Tron’s planned Nasdaq listing , despite his advisory position at Dominari Securities, the firm handling the deal. “I’m the biggest fan of Tron and love Justin Sun,” Trump posted on X Monday , calling Tron founder Justin Sun “a great friend and an icon in the crypto space,” while clarifying, “I don’t have public involvement.” The comment has fueled speculation over whether a “private involvement” exists between Trump and the project. Tron to Go Public via Reverse Merger With SRM Entertainment Tron’s upcoming public debut is expected to proceed via a reverse merger with Florida-based SRM Entertainment, which recently said it had received a $100 million investment from an undisclosed party and would rebrand itself as “Tron.” Sun will serve as an advisor, and the company plans to begin accumulating TRX tokens under a new crypto treasury strategy. Dominari Securities, a Trump-affiliated firm headquartered in Trump Tower, is the exclusive placement agent for a $210 million stock offering tied to the deal. Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. joined Dominari’s advisory board earlier this year. Sun’s connections to the Trump family have strengthened in recent months. Source: X/@EricTrump He attended a private event for Trump’s meme coin launch, took a $75 million stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and remains the largest holder of the $TRUMP token. In May, Sun was also awarded a luxury Trump Golden Tourbillon watch during the exclusive dinner hosted by Donald Trump. The event, held at Trump’s private golf club in Virginia, gathered the top 220 $TRUMP memecoin holders. Following Sun’s WLFI investment, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission quietly paused its long-running investigation into him and his affiliated companies. The probe had centered on alleged market manipulation and the sale of unregistered securities. Trump Continues to Capitalize on Crypto Market Momentum Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to capitalize on crypto market momentum. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes.

2025-06-17T06:20:41,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reaches 68, Signifying Rising Investor Greed","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reaches 68, Signifying Rising Investor Greed Ever wonder how the collective mood of the crypto world feels? Is it buzzing with excitement, or is everyone hiding under their digital beds? That’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes in. It’s a fascinating tool designed to capture the prevailing crypto market sentiment , giving us a snapshot of whether investors are feeling bullish or bearish. As of June 17, this widely watched index, provided by Alternative, registered a significant jump, climbing seven points to hit 68. This places it firmly within the ‘Greed’ territory, a notable shift that suggests optimism is currently running high in the market. But what exactly does this number tell us, and how should we interpret it in the context of broader crypto market trends ? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: More Than Just a Number The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t pulled out of thin air. It’s a composite index ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). Its goal is to help traders and investors understand if the market is overly fearful (potentially a buying opportunity) or overly greedy (potentially due for a correction). The philosophy is rooted in investor psychology – extreme fear can lead to panic selling, while extreme greed can fuel FOMO-driven buying, neither of which is sustainable long-term. The index aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%): Measures how much the Bitcoin price and other major cryptocurrencies are fluctuating. Higher volatility in a positive direction often indicates a greedy market, while high volatility downwards points to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with average values. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts and hashtags related to crypto on platforms like Twitter. High levels of positive, hype-driven posts can signal greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers sentiment from weekly polls. (Note: As of the original data, surveys were paused, meaning this component’s weight might be temporarily redistributed or the overall calculation adjusted). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear as investors move away from altcoins into the perceived safety of BTC, or greed if Bitcoin is leading a strong rally. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest can reflect increasing public curiosity and potential FOMO (greed). By combining these factors, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, offering insights into prevailing crypto market trends . What Does a Reading of 68 (Greed) Imply for the Crypto Market? A reading of 68 places the index squarely in the ‘Greed’ zone (typically defined as 55-74). This suggests that investors are feeling confident and optimistic about the market’s direction. Historically, readings in the upper ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ zones have sometimes preceded market pullbacks, as high optimism can lead to overextension and increased risk-taking. Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-24) have often coincided with market bottoms, presenting potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to enter against the prevailing mood. While a high ‘Greed’ reading isn’t a guaranteed sell signal, it serves as a yellow flag, reminding investors to exercise caution. It highlights that the market is running on high octane optimism, which can make it more susceptible to sharp reversals if sentiment shifts. Connecting Investor Psychology to Bitcoin Price Movements There’s a strong correlation between investor psychology , as reflected by the Fear & Greed Index, and Bitcoin price movements. When the index is low (fear), it often means people are selling due to panic or uncertainty, pushing prices down. When the index is high (greed), it indicates strong buying pressure, often driven by excitement and the fear of missing out (FOMO), which helps propel prices upward. Observing how the index interacts with the Bitcoin price can be a valuable exercise. Does a sustained period of high greed align with a parabolic price increase? Does a sudden drop into fear coincide with a sharp price correction? While correlation doesn’t equal causation, the index provides a useful lens through which to view price action, understanding the emotional backdrop driving it. Using the Index to Navigate Crypto Market Trends So, how can you actually use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in your own strategy? Here are a few actionable insights: As a Contrarian Indicator: Some investors use the index as a contrarian tool. The saying goes, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” A high greed reading might prompt a contrarian investor to consider taking profits or reducing exposure, while a low fear reading might encourage them to look for buying opportunities. Gauge Market Fatigue: A prolonged period in the ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ zone, especially when combined with other technical indicators showing potential overbought conditions, can suggest market fatigue and the potential for a correction. Confirming Trends: If you believe the market is in an uptrend, seeing the index rise into ‘Greed’ can confirm that positive sentiment is supporting the move. Conversely, a drop into ‘Fear’ during a downturn confirms negative sentiment is dominant. Not a Standalone Tool: It’s crucial to remember the index is just *one* indicator. Never rely solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for investment decisions. Always combine its insights with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a thorough understanding of overall crypto market trends . Understanding the interplay between the index and investor psychology is key to using it effectively. Challenges and Limitations While insightful, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t without its limitations: Data Sources: The index relies on specific data sources. Changes in these sources or temporary pauses (like the surveys) can affect its accuracy. Interpretation: What constitutes ‘Extreme Greed’ or ‘Extreme Fear’ can be subjective and might evolve with market maturity. Lagging vs. Leading: The index is often seen as a reflection of *current* sentiment rather than a predictor of *future* price movements. While extreme readings *can* precede reversals, they don’t guarantee them. Focus on Bitcoin: Although it considers the broader market through momentum/volume, factors like Bitcoin dominance and Google Trends specifically focus on BTC, potentially making it less sensitive to sentiment shifts in the altcoin market specifically. Using the index requires nuance and an awareness that it’s a sentiment gauge, not a predictive model. Conclusion: Navigating Greed in the Crypto Market The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 68, keeping it in the ‘Greed’ zone, signals a period of heightened optimism and confidence among crypto investors. This level of ‘Greed’ is a direct reflection of prevailing crypto market sentiment , influenced by factors ranging from Bitcoin price action and market momentum to social media buzz and search interest. While positive sentiment can fuel further gains, a high ‘Greed’ reading also serves as a timely reminder that markets driven by excessive optimism can be prone to sharp corrections. Understanding the index, its components, and its limitations allows investors to better gauge the emotional climate of the market and integrate this insight into a more comprehensive strategy for navigating the ever-evolving crypto market trends . It’s a valuable tool for understanding collective investor psychology , but it should always be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis.

2025-06-17T06:18:45,"Deribit Sees Strong Demand From Institutions, Volume on Its Block RFQ Tool Reaches $23B in Four Months","The institutionalization of cryptocurrencies is accelerating rapidly. Crypto derivatives exchange Deribit's on-demand liquidity tool, the Deribit Block Request-for-Quote (RFQ) interface, has registered a cumulative trading volume of over $23 billion in less than four months since its debut in early March. Deribit is a prominent derivatives exchange, offering the world's largest options market for traders of bitcoin BTC, ether ETH, Solana SOL, and XRP XRP. It also offers futures and spot trading. The exchange introduced the block RFQ system in March, where participants (takers), typically institutions and high-volume traders, request pricing for a structure – a single instrument trade or a multi-legged strategy involving spot, futures, or options. A block trade is a large transaction. Market makers, entities tasked with providing liquidity, then respond with either single or double-sided quotes, following which the best quote for the bid and the ask are displayed to the taker. The best quote for the bid and the best quote for the ask is then displayed to the taker, who can trade by crossing against either the bid or the ask. The system allows large traders to execute orders more efficiently outside of public order book systems, ensuring minimal impact on market prices. Imagine buying vegetables in large quantities directly from a farm (OTC) and receiving a better price and more flexible terms rather than bidding in a crowded market where a large order can significantly raise prices. ""The RFQ system allows for multi-leg trades, multiple maker quotes, and greater price efficiency—improving execution for large OTC trades while minimizing adverse selection. It reflects strong institutional demand and Deribit’s continued focus on liquidity and trade quality,"" Deribit's CEO Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk. Strijers noted that the system targets the needs of professional and agency trading operations, such as support for complex structures and large volumes. ""Block RFQ lets multiple liquidity providers compete on partial quotes and makers benefit from reduced adverse selection, allowing tighter quotes, while takers enjoy price improvements and anonymity options,"" Strijers noted. The RFQ system handled trades worth $883 million in March, with the activity booming to $6.3 billion in April. The momentum continued in May, with the tally reaching $9.8 billion and exceeding $6 billion in just the first half of June. If that's not enough, the percentage of block trades executed via Deribit's RFQ has increased to 27.5% this month, up from 17% in April and 21% in May.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/17/deribit-s-on-demand-liquidity-tool-for-large-bitcoin-ether-traders-registers-over-usd23b-in-volume-in-4-months,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Deribit|Ether|Options|Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T06:10:24,"ETH to $6000? BlackRock sells BTC for ETH, while MUTM gains momentum","In a significant shift, BlackRock has increased its Ethereum exposure amid growing speculation around Ethereum ETF staking. This move aligns with rising institutional confidence in Ethereum’s transition to a yield-generating asset. With ETH currently trading around $2,555, analysts are watching closely for a breakout that could push the token toward the $6,000 level by year-end. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) saw net outflows, suggesting a short-term pivot in institutional strategy. As Ethereum climbs, a new DeFi player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is rapidly gaining traction at $0.03 in phase 5 of its presale. The project has raised over $10.7 million and attracted more than 12,100 investors emerging as a speculative favorite among those eyeing the next big crypto to watch in June. Ethereum gains institutional traction as Bitcoin faces outflows Ethereum (ETH) trades at about $2,555, as institutional buyers are back in the game after reports that BlackRock has transferred some of its crypto assets out of Bitcoin (BTC) and into ETH. The shift has been associated with the expectation of a possible Ethereum ETF staking to transform the way institutions look at ETH exposure. Bitcoin, by contrast, at around $104,000 has experienced muted outflows in the last week, indicative of a temporary slide. Even though both assets are still at the center of the broader market structure, the attention of investors in early June has shifted decidedly towards Ethereum. In the meantime, the new projects entering the market such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are gathering traction in the altcoin segment. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance presale now underway The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.7 million total sales and attracted more than 12,100 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. USD-pegged stablecoin and audited by CertiK Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. The platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. Early investors reap rewards as community expands As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. As institutional attention shifts from Bitcoin to Ethereum, retail and early-stage investors are locking into the next breakout opportunity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $10.7 million raised and 12,100+ investors onboard in Phase 5 of its presale, this under-$0.05 DeFi token is gaining major traction. The current presale price of $0.03 offers early adopters a clear path to 100% ROI at launch, bolstered by a Certik audit, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and a powerful dual lending model. As ETH eyes $6,000, Mutuum Finance is carving out its own lane in DeFi. Don’t wait, join the presale and secure your MUTM tokens before the next price hike.

2025-06-17T06:00:36,"Ethereum Eyes Big Move As Price Compresses Between Key Levels – $2,100 Or $4,000 Next?","Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to retest the local range highs following last week’s market shakeout. However, some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency will continue its sideways move for the coming weeks before its next big move. Related Reading: Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What’s Next Ethereum Eyes Range High Resistance Last week, Ethereum attempted to reclaim the $2,800 barrier, hitting a three-month high of $2,879. However, the market shakeout, fueled by the Iran-Israel conflict, sent the cryptocurrency’s price to retest its local range’s lows before recovering over the weekend. Notably, ETH has been hovering between the $2,400-$2,680 range since the early May market recovery, which saw the King of Altcoins surge from the $1,800 mark toward its current price range for the first time in three months. Nonetheless, it has been rejected from the local range’s resistance four times in the past month. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that Ethereum’s price action has been consolidating between these two key levels, compressing just below the $2,800 area. This level has been a crucial area throughout the cycle, serving as a key support and resistance level since 2024. The trader considers this area to be “the most important level on this entire chart by far,” detailing that every major retest of this zone has led to either “a nice bounce” or “big dump.” Meanwhile, ETH “went on to really even further” after every reclaim of this level as support. Daan explained that its current price range is “becoming quite a tight range for how long it’s been trading here. You can see how important this is and that there’s likely a big move coming from this point somewhere in the next few weeks.” Based on this, he forecasted that “If we’d see a convincing break above $2.8K and hold there, that would be a good setup for a move to the cycle highs around ~$4K.” However, if it loses this current range, then the $2,100 area “is the big high timeframe level to watch.” Is A 2017 Repeat In The Making? Merlijn The Trader highlighted that Ethereum is now consolidating within its current range after breaking out of a multi-month falling wedge, which suggests that the cryptocurrency could soon experience a massive move. He pointed out that, historically, “this pause often precedes a surge,” adding that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also retesting the recent breakout zone. Additionally, the trader noted that ETH appears to be following its 2016-2017 playbook, with a similar structure to eight years ago. At the time, the cryptocurrency had an “explosive setup” that led ETH to a massive lift-off starting in 2017. After the market shakeout, the cryptocurrency moved sideways within a tight range while reclaiming the 50-day Moving Average (MA). Related Reading: PEPE Pumps 2.67% – Is The Memecoin Preparing For A Major Rebound? Following the key reclaim, Ethereum’s price experienced a massive surge toward new highs.

We’re not repeating history… We’re amplifying it.” As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,640, a 3.7% increase in the daily timeframe.

2025-06-17T05:54:42,"Eric Trump Denies Role in Tron IPO, Calls Sun a Crypto Icon","The rumored involvement stems from Tron’s plan to go public via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment, to be renamed Tron Inc., along with a $100 million private equity deal to build a TRX treasury. While Eric Trump dismissed claims of participation, he and Sun have a documented business history. This includes Sun’s $30 million investment in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto platform linked to the Trump family. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s 2025 financial disclosure revealed $57.4 million in income from WLFI, where he holds over 15 billion governance tokens. Additionally, Trump’s Truth Social filed with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, with Crypto.com as the proposed custodian. This move was made despite the intense scrutiny over the Trump family’s deepening ties to crypto. Eric Trump Dismisses Tron Deal Rumors Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, denied claims that he will be involved in the Tron blockchain’s upcoming public offering in the United States, despite expressing admiration for Tron founder Justin Sun. “I’m the biggest fan of Tron,” Trump shared on social media, and praised Sun as a “great friend and icon in the crypto space,” but dismissed a report by the Financial Times that suggested he would participate in the venture. Tron’s plans to go public involve a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment, which will be renamed Tron Inc. as part of the transition. The deal also includes a $100 million private equity investment to establish a large TRX treasury. Tron currently ranks as the ninth-largest blockchain network globally, with a market cap of $26.16 billion. Tron’s all-time market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Trump and Sun’s business ties date back to November when Sun became the largest investor in World Liberty Financial by acquiring $30 million worth of WLFI tokens. Eric Trump played a pivotal role in shaping World Liberty Financial, which is a crypto platform closely associated with his family. The Trump family’s involvement in the crypto sector deepened earlier this year with the launch of American Bitcoin, a mining company preparing for a public debut via merger with Dryphon Digital Mining. Since April , the company accumulated 215 BTC, worth approximately $23.3 million. Eric Trump believes Bitcoin is a critical global asset, and called its accumulation an international “arms race” due to interest from sovereign wealth funds, ultra-wealthy families, and major corporations. Despite the financial success, the Trump family’s growing involvement in cryptocurrency attracted a lot of scrutiny from members of Congress, who raised questions about the overlap between political influence and business interests. Trump Discloses Major WLFI Income US President Donald Trump himself recently disclosed earning $57.4 million from his involvement with World Liberty Financial. The income was revealed in his 2025 financial disclosure , which was filed with the US Office of Government Ethics on June 13. According to the filing, Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in World Liberty Financial, which also grant him voting rights. While the document does not provide a specific valuation or structure for the tokens, the substantial income figure implies that Trump either sold part of his holdings or that the tokens were valued highly for disclosure purposes. The reported gain is listed as “$57,437,927” and attributed to token sales. Trump’s WLFI earings World Liberty Financial launched in September of 2024 with a focus on decentralized finance and stablecoins, and it raised approximately $550 million through two token sales. The first round brought in $200 million, and a second round in early 2025 raised an additional $250 million. The project positions itself as a challenger to traditional finance and attracted a lot of backing from the crypto industry. In addition to Justin Sun, Web3Port contributed $10 million in January, while Oddiyana Ventures joined as a strategic investor, although the size of its investment was not disclosed. Trump’s digital asset involvement extends beyond World Liberty Financial. While his latest filing does not show new revenue from previous ventures like Trump Digital Trading Cards, it does reflect the still ongoing connections to entities like CIC Digital and CIC Ventures. These companies are tied to his past Web3 and NFT efforts, though they appear to be inactive or generating minimal income at present. The President’s certification on the ethics filing confirms that the information provided is accurate to the best of his knowledge and is now subject to review by the Office of Government Ethics. Truth Social Files for Bitcoin and Ether ETF The Trump-crypto ties deepened after US President Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, recently filed an S-1 registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a dual exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed fund is named the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, and will be sponsored by asset manager Yorkville America Digital. A crypto ETF is a fund that allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum without directly owning them. It tracks crypto prices and is traded on traditional stock exchanges, which simplifies access and reduces custody risks. Party of Truth Social’s S-1 filing The main goal of Truth Social’s fund is to simplify crypto investment by offering shares backed by BTC and ETH. According to the filing, the digital assets will be held by Crypto.com’s trust arm, Foris DAX Trust Company, serving as the crypto custodian for the ETF. The ETF is intended to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca, though the fund’s ticker and cash custodian details haven not been disclosed yet. Truth Social explained that further details, including its prime execution agreement with Crypto.com, will be included in a later amendment to the filing. This ETF filing was made shortly after the SEC approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury registration, which followed the company’s $2.5 billion capital raise in May to acquire Bitcoin, despite initially denying such plans. The firm stated that it has no immediate plans to issue securities under the approved deal. Coinciding with Truth Social’s ETF filing, CoinShares also submitted a separate S-1 application on the same day, proposing a Solana spot ETF for US investors. CoinShares already operates a similar Solana ETP in Europe and is now looking to expand its footprint to the US market. With this addition, there are now at least eight Solana spot ETF applications under SEC review, including proposals from Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital. Despite this growing interest, analysts suggest that an approval for a Solana ETF is unlikely in the immediate future.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9585/eric-trump-denies-role-in-tron-ipo-calls-sun-a-crypto-icon,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

He stressed the need for clear and supportive rules that allow crypto companies to grow while protecting users. Great to be in London today to meet with policymakers on how the UK can position itself competitively in the global race for crypto. This is a pivotal moment – hopeful the UK seizes this opportunity to solidify its position as a global leader in crypto. Bullish on Britain!… pic.twitter.com/w4uIVrJiRI — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 16, 2025 In a post on X, he wrote “Bullish on Britain!”, showing strong confidence in the country’s ability to become a global crypto hub. His message was clear to the crypto investors that the UK has a chance to move ahead of other countries, especially as the US continues to struggle with unclear crypto regulations . A Call for Clarity and Competitiveness The visit signals Coinbase’s strong interest in the UK. Armstrong’s call for regulatory clarity aligns with the company’s broader push to expand internationally. He believes that if the UK can create a solid legal framework, it could attract more institutional investment and crypto talent. This would also send a clear message to the wider European market that the UK is open to crypto innovation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Companies Buying Bitcoin in 2025 – MicroStrategy No Longer Alone , Backing Innovation, One Product at a Time Armstrong’s visit follows recent product developments from Coinbase, including the launch of its Bitcoin Card with improved cashback features.

He’s also backing a new venture focused on assembling the right talent for crypto startups, signaling a broader commitment to growing the ecosystem from the ground up. A critical moment for Britain’s crypto future Armstrong’s direct engagement with UK lawmakers shows how important the region has become to Coinbase’s global plans.
