2025-06-16T22:50:17,"Truth Social Makes Shocking Move, Files for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs with SEC","BitcoinWorld Truth Social Makes Shocking Move, Files for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs with SEC In an unexpected development, Truth Social, the social media platform founded by former U.S. President Donald Trump , has reportedly taken a significant step into the world of cryptocurrency. According to a report by Walter Bloomberg on X, the company has filed S-1 registration statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for two distinct cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds: the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Ethereum ETF . What Does a Truth Social SEC Filing Mean? An S-1 filing is the initial registration form required by the SEC for new securities that will be sold to the public. For an ETF, this is the first formal step towards potentially launching a publicly traded fund. Filing an S-1 does not guarantee approval, but it signals serious intent to navigate the regulatory process. For Truth Social , known primarily for its social media platform, this move represents a potential diversification into financial products, specifically those tied to the volatile yet popular cryptocurrency market. The filing indicates Truth Social’s interest in offering investors exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ethereum, through a traditional investment vehicle. This could appeal to investors who are interested in crypto but prefer the accessibility and regulatory framework associated with ETFs traded on stock exchanges, rather than buying cryptocurrencies directly on exchanges. Why Would Donald Trump ‘s Company Pursue Crypto ETFs? This move by a company associated with Donald Trump is particularly noteworthy. While Trump has previously expressed skepticism about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, his stance has appeared to soften more recently, especially as crypto and blockchain technology gain mainstream attention and political relevance. Pursuing a Bitcoin ETF and an Ethereum ETF suggests a recognition of the market demand and potential revenue streams associated with these digital assets. Several factors might be at play: Market Demand: The successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 demonstrated significant investor appetite in the U.S. Diversification: It offers Truth Social a potential new business line beyond advertising and subscriptions on its social media platform. Political Angle: Aligning with a popular investment trend could resonate with certain segments of the population, potentially including his supporter base. Revenue Potential: If approved, ETFs generate management fees, which could be a stable source of income. Navigating the Path to a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF The path from S-1 filing to actual ETF launch is complex and requires extensive review and potential revisions based on SEC feedback. The SEC scrutinizes these applications carefully, particularly those involving novel asset classes like cryptocurrencies. Key considerations for the SEC typically include: Investor Protection: Ensuring the fund structure adequately protects investors. Market Manipulation: Assessing the underlying market’s resistance to manipulation. Custody Arrangements: How the actual Bitcoin and Ethereum will be securely held. Valuation: How the fund will accurately value its assets. While spot Bitcoin ETFs are now approved, the regulatory landscape for Ethereum ETF s is still evolving, although many analysts anticipate potential approval later in 2024. A Truth Social-branded ETF would also likely face additional scrutiny given the company’s unique profile and association with a prominent political figure. Potential Impacts of a Truth Social SEC Filing for Crypto ETFs If these ETFs were to be approved and launched, they could have several impacts: Increased Exposure: Provide another avenue for mainstream investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Brand Association: Link the Truth Social brand more directly to the cryptocurrency market, potentially influencing public perception among its user base. Competitive Landscape: Add new players to the growing list of companies offering crypto investment products. Regulatory Precedent: While not setting a new precedent for crypto ETFs themselves, the approval process for a politically affiliated company could be closely watched. It’s important to remember that this is just the initial filing stage. The process can take many months, and there is no guarantee of approval. Investors should approach this news as an indication of intent rather than a finalized product. Conclusion: A Surprising Turn for Truth Social and Crypto Truth Social’s decision to file for Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF products is undoubtedly a surprising development that bridges the worlds of social media, politics, and cryptocurrency. This SEC filing signals the increasing integration of digital assets into traditional finance, even from unexpected corners. Whether these filings will ultimately lead to approved ETFs remains to be seen, but the move itself highlights the growing mainstream acceptance and investment interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s a story that underscores the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of both the tech industry and the digital asset space.

2025-06-16T22:20:27,"MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Soar: $1.05 Billion Acquisition Fuels Confidence","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Soar: $1.05 Billion Acquisition Fuels Confidence MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin whale, has once again made headlines with a colossal purchase of the leading cryptocurrency. Michael Saylor, the executive chairman and vocal Bitcoin advocate, announced the firm’s latest move on social media, revealing an acquisition that further solidifies MicroStrategy’s position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. This significant transaction involved purchasing an additional 10,100 BTC. The cost? A staggering $1.05 billion. This latest addition brings MicroStrategy’s total MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings to an immense 592,100 BTC. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Strategy: Why the Continued Aggression? MicroStrategy’s approach to Bitcoin is anything but conventional for a publicly traded company. Under Michael Saylor’s leadership, the firm adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset starting in August 2020. The core philosophy behind this strategy is the belief that Bitcoin is a superior store of value compared to fiat currencies, offering a hedge against inflation and a potential for significant long-term appreciation. The firm has consistently used various means, including excess cash flow and raising capital through debt and equity offerings, to fund its ongoing Bitcoin acquisitions. This aggressive accumulation strategy is rooted in a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s future as a global digital reserve asset. Key aspects of their strategy include: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin’s fixed supply as protection against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Believing Bitcoin is digital gold, a durable and scarce asset. Corporate Treasury Alternative: Positioning Bitcoin as a more promising asset than traditional cash reserves or low-yield investments. Long-Term Conviction: Holding Bitcoin for the long haul, largely ignoring short-term price volatility. MSTR Bitcoin Holdings: Diving into the Numbers Let’s break down the specifics of MicroStrategy’s impressive Bitcoin portfolio following this latest purchase: As of June 15, 2024, the official announcement provided the following key figures: Latest Purchase Amount: 10,100 BTC Cost of Latest Purchase: Approximately $1.05 billion Average Price for Latest Purchase: Approximately $104,080 per Bitcoin Total Bitcoin Holdings: 592,100 BTC Overall Average Acquisition Price: Approximately $70,666 per Bitcoin Year-to-Date Return on Holdings (as of June 15): 19.1% It’s important to note the average price of this latest acquisition ($104,080) is significantly higher than their overall average acquisition price ($70,666). This indicates MicroStrategy is comfortable accumulating Bitcoin even at elevated price levels, reflecting strong confidence. The total value of their holdings at the overall average price is staggering, and its market value fluctuates with the price of Bitcoin. This massive stake makes MicroStrategy ( MSTR Bitcoin ) the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin by a vast margin, positioning them as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure for many investors. Michael Saylor’s Vision: A Driving Force for Institutional Bitcoin Michael Saylor is synonymous with MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy. He is not just an executive but a passionate evangelist for Bitcoin, frequently speaking at conferences, on podcasts, and across social media platforms about its technological, economic, and societal implications. His unwavering belief and public advocacy have undoubtedly influenced other corporations and investors considering Bitcoin investment . Saylor views Bitcoin as the future of money and a fundamental shift in asset classes. His conviction is so strong that he has steered a successful software company towards becoming primarily a Bitcoin acquisition vehicle, using its business operations partly to fund more buys. His outspoken nature and detailed explanations of his rationale have made him a leading voice in the institutional Bitcoin space. His vision is not just about accumulating Bitcoin for MicroStrategy; it’s about educating the market and encouraging broader adoption. He often discusses Bitcoin’s properties: Scarcity (21 million cap) Decentralization Immutability Programmability These properties, he argues, make it a superior asset for the digital age. Bitcoin Investment: What This Latest Purchase Signals MicroStrategy’s continued large-scale acquisitions send several strong signals to the market: Unwavering Confidence: Buying over $1 billion at a price significantly above their overall average demonstrates profound confidence in Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Sustained Demand: Large corporate buyers like MicroStrategy represent persistent, significant demand that absorbs available supply, especially following events like the Bitcoin halving. Validation: For many traditional investors, MicroStrategy’s consistent purchases serve as validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate and investable asset class. Market Proxy: MSTR’s stock often trades as a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin, and these large buys reinforce that perception, attracting investors seeking indirect exposure. This purchase indicates that despite market fluctuations, major players with a long-term horizon remain committed to accumulating Bitcoin, viewing dips or consolidations as buying opportunities, or in this case, showing willingness to buy even at higher levels. Institutional Bitcoin: The Trend Continues to Grow MicroStrategy was an early pioneer in bringing institutional Bitcoin onto corporate balance sheets. While they remain the most prominent example of a company making Bitcoin its primary treasury asset, the broader trend of institutional adoption has significantly accelerated, particularly with the launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions, including the United States. These ETFs have opened the floodgates for traditional asset managers, wealth advisors, and institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct custody. While MSTR holds Bitcoin directly, the success of Bitcoin ETFs underscores the increasing appetite from the institutional world. MicroStrategy’s continued aggressive stance reinforces the narrative that institutions are not just dipping their toes in; some are diving in headfirst. This trend is crucial for Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class, bringing increased liquidity, stability (potentially, long-term), and mainstream acceptance. Challenges and Considerations While MicroStrategy’s strategy has been profitable to date (as evidenced by their reported 19.1% YTD return as of June 15 on holdings acquired at an average of $70,666), it’s not without risks: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile. A significant downturn could negatively impact MicroStrategy’s balance sheet and stock price. Leverage: The firm has used debt to finance some purchases, adding financial risk. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which could present future challenges. However, MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor have consistently expressed confidence in navigating these challenges, emphasizing their long-term perspective and belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental strength. Actionable Insights for Investors What can individual investors take away from MicroStrategy’s actions? Conviction Matters: MicroStrategy’s strategy highlights the importance of conviction in a high-conviction asset like Bitcoin. Long-Term View: Their approach is a masterclass in long-term holding, looking past short-term price swings. Institutional Interest is Real: MSTR is a prime example of growing institutional adoption, a trend that could significantly impact Bitcoin’s future. Do Your Own Research: While observing institutional moves is insightful, always conduct your own due diligence based on your financial situation and risk tolerance. Summary: MicroStrategy Doubles Down MicroStrategy’s latest acquisition of 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful statement. It underscores Michael Saylor’s unwavering commitment and the firm’s aggressive MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy, bringing their total holdings to a colossal 592,100 BTC. Buying at an average price significantly above their overall cost basis signals strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. As the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy continues to serve as a bellwether for institutional Bitcoin adoption and a unique investment vehicle for those seeking exposure to the asset class through equity. This move reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a legitimate and essential component of diversified portfolios and corporate treasuries in the digital age.

2025-06-16T22:10:30,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Smarter Web Company Secures $37M for Bold Holdings Expansion","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Smarter Web Company Secures $37M for Bold Holdings Expansion In a move that underscores the growing institutional interest in digital assets, UK-based web firm Smarter Web Company has successfully completed a significant funding round. The company announced it raised £29.3 million, which translates to approximately $37.1 million USD at current exchange rates. This funding wasn’t just a standard capital raise; its primary purpose is to fuel the company’s ongoing Bitcoin treasury strategy . The equity offering was notably oversubscribed, exceeding the company’s initial target by a remarkable 95%. This strong investor demand suggests confidence not only in Smarter Web Company’s core business but also potentially in its strategic decision to accumulate Bitcoin. What Does This Equity Offering Mean for Smarter Web Company? The funding was secured through the issuance of new shares priced at £1.80 each. This transaction brings the total number of outstanding shares for the company to 220.5 million. Raising capital via an equity offering allows the company to acquire funds without taking on debt, providing flexibility, particularly when deploying capital into a volatile asset like Bitcoin. The fact that the offering was oversubscribed indicates robust market appetite for shares in companies pursuing innovative treasury management strategies, including the incorporation of digital assets. It signals that a segment of investors is supportive of, or at least willing to bet on, companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Why the Focus on Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? Smarter Web Company is joining a growing list of publicly traded and private companies that are adding Bitcoin to their corporate reserves. This trend, popularized by companies like MicroStrategy, is driven by several factors: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, believing its fixed supply makes it a better store of value than traditional fiat currencies over the long term. Store of Value: Bitcoin is seen by proponents as digital gold, a durable and secure asset that can preserve capital across economic cycles. Potential Appreciation: Companies anticipate that the value of Bitcoin could appreciate significantly over time, providing a potential boost to their balance sheet. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify corporate assets away from traditional cash holdings and financial instruments. Signaling: For some companies, holding Bitcoin can be a signal of innovation and forward-thinking, potentially attracting certain investors and talent. For Smarter Web Company, this funding round specifically earmarks the capital for this strategic accumulation, as highlighted by reports circulating on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) via accounts focused on corporate Bitcoin adoption. Understanding the Bold Bitcoin Investment Strategy A Bitcoin investment by a corporation is a significant decision that involves careful consideration of risk and reward. Unlike holding cash or short-term bonds, Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, subject to rapid and substantial fluctuations. Companies pursuing this strategy typically need to address: Custody Solutions: Securely storing Bitcoin is paramount. This involves choosing between self-custody or using third-party institutional custodians. Accounting Treatment: The accounting rules for holding crypto assets on a balance sheet are still evolving and can be complex. Regulatory Environment: Navigating the varying and sometimes uncertain regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in different jurisdictions. Market Volatility: Managing the risk associated with significant price swings and their potential impact on the company’s financial statements. Smarter Web Company’s decision to raise dedicated funds for this purpose, especially through equity, suggests a strong commitment to making Bitcoin a meaningful part of its financial structure, rather than just allocating existing cash reserves. Smarter Web Company: A New Player in Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? While the original source provides limited detail about Smarter Web Company’s core business, their action places them firmly in the spotlight among firms adopting digital asset strategies. Their successful oversubscribed equity offering demonstrates investor confidence in their plan. The specific amount raised, $37.1 million, allows for a substantial purchase of Bitcoin, depending on market prices at the time of acquisition. This amount is significant enough to make their corporate Bitcoin holdings a noticeable part of their balance sheet, depending on the overall size of the company. This development is another data point illustrating the increasing acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into traditional corporate finance strategies, moving beyond early adopters to potentially more diverse types of companies like Smarter Web Company. What’s Next for Smarter Web Company’s Bitcoin Treasury? Following the successful raise, the immediate next step for Smarter Web Company will be the execution of their purchasing plan. The timing and method of acquiring the Bitcoin will be crucial to their strategy, potentially involving staggered purchases to mitigate volatility risk. The performance of their Bitcoin holdings will likely be a key metric investors monitor going forward, alongside the company’s operational results. This move could potentially influence future fundraising efforts and investor perception. Summary: A Bold Step into Digital Asset Treasury Smarter Web Company’s successful $37.1 million equity raise for the explicit purpose of expanding its Bitcoin treasury strategy is a significant development. It highlights strong investor support for companies integrating digital assets into their financial planning and reinforces the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings . This strategic Bitcoin investment , funded through an oversubscribed equity offering , positions Smarter Web Company as a notable participant in the evolving landscape of corporate finance where digital assets are playing an increasingly important role.

2025-06-16T22:00:32,"Solana ETF Race Ignites: CoinShares Files with SEC, Bringing Total to Eight","BitcoinWorld Solana ETF Race Ignites: CoinShares Files with SEC, Bringing Total to Eight Get ready, crypto world! The pursuit of a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States is picking up serious steam. Just when you thought the focus was solely on Bitcoin and Ethereum, another major player has entered the ring, specifically targeting a Spot Solana ETF . This development signals a significant shift in institutional interest beyond the top two cryptocurrencies. CoinShares Joins the Race for a US Spot Solana ETF In a move that’s capturing headlines across the digital asset space, CoinShares, a prominent European digital asset investment firm, has officially filed for a spot Solana ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This isn’t just any filing; it marks a notable expansion of the push for crypto investment products in the US market. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, shared via his X account, CoinShares’ filing brings the total number of applications for a US spot Solana ETF currently before the SEC to eight. That’s right, eight separate firms are now vying for regulatory approval to offer a product that would allow investors to gain exposure to Solana’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. This surge in CoinShares Solana ETF and other filings underscores growing confidence among financial institutions regarding the potential market demand for Solana-based investment products and perhaps a belief that the regulatory environment is becoming more receptive, following the approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. What Exactly is a Spot Solana ETF and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the concept, let’s break it down. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is an investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like a stock. It typically holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities. A Spot ETF holds the underlying asset directly. In the case of a Spot Solana ETF , the fund would purchase and hold actual SOL tokens. This differs from a Futures ETF , which holds contracts betting on the future price of an asset. The US already has Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs, but the market has shown a strong preference for spot products. Why is a spot version so sought after? Investors generally prefer spot ETFs because their price performance tends to track the underlying asset’s market price more closely than futures-based products. For Solana, a spot ETF would offer several potential benefits: Accessibility: It would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to SOL through regulated brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of crypto exchanges, wallets, and private keys. Familiarity: ETFs are a common and well-understood investment vehicle, making crypto investing less intimidating for mainstream audiences. Liquidity: Trading on major exchanges could provide enhanced liquidity compared to direct purchases on some crypto platforms. Regulatory Oversight: As a regulated product, it would operate under SEC rules, potentially offering investors a greater sense of security. The push for a Spot Solana ETF signifies the market’s view of Solana as a mature enough asset class deserving of mainstream investment products, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Expanding Landscape of SEC Solana ETF Applications CoinShares’ filing didn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s part of a noticeable trend. While the focus was intensely on Bitcoin for years, and then shifted to Ethereum post-Bitcoin ETF approval, Solana has emerged as the next frontier for ETF hopefuls. Eight filings is a substantial number, indicating widespread interest from various financial players. Let’s look at how this compares: Cryptocurrency Current US Spot ETF Status Number of Filings (Approx.) Notable Firms Involved Bitcoin (BTC) Approved (January 2024) 11 currently trading BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Ark Invest, etc. Ethereum (ETH) Approved (May 2024, pending S-1 registration) 8-10 currently filed BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, etc. Solana (SOL) Pending SEC Review 8 currently filed CoinShares, and others (specific filers often emerge over time) The rapid accumulation of SEC Solana ETF applications suggests firms are anticipating either a favorable regulatory shift towards altcoins or are positioning themselves early for potential future approvals. Each filing represents significant legal and administrative effort, highlighting the seriousness of this pursuit. Who is CoinShares and Why Are They Eyeing Solana? CoinShares is a well-established name in the European digital asset investment landscape. They are known for offering a range of crypto investment products, including various exchange-traded products (ETPs) listed on European exchanges, which function similarly to ETFs. Their decision to file for a US spot Solana ETF is strategic. It allows them to tap into the massive US investment market and diversify their product offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Why Solana specifically? Performance and Growth: Solana has been one of the top-performing major cryptocurrencies in recent cycles, attracting significant investor attention. Ecosystem Development: Its network boasts a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols, demonstrating real-world usage and potential. Technological Edge: Solana is known for its high transaction throughput and low fees compared to some other blockchains, appealing to developers and users. Market Cap: It holds a significant position by market capitalization, making it a logical candidate for institutional investment products after Bitcoin and Ethereum. For CoinShares, adding a US CoinShares Solana ETF to their potential lineup makes sense from a competitive standpoint and aligns with growing investor interest in diversified crypto exposure. Navigating the Regulatory Path: Will the SEC Approve a Spot Solana ETF? The big question on everyone’s mind is whether the SEC will actually approve these SEC Solana ETF applications. The path to approval for crypto ETFs in the US has been long and arduous, particularly for spot products. The SEC’s primary concerns have historically revolved around market manipulation, investor protection, and the maturity/surveillance of the underlying crypto markets. While the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs marked a turning point, it doesn’t automatically guarantee a green light for Solana. Key factors the SEC will likely consider include: Market Surveillance: Does the spot Solana market have sufficient surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets (like CME futures) to detect and prevent manipulation? This was a key hurdle for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market Size and Liquidity: Is the Solana market large and liquid enough to support a large-scale ETF without being easily manipulated? Solana’s Classification: While the SEC hasn’t explicitly classified SOL as a security, some officials have hinted at certain cryptocurrencies (other than Bitcoin) potentially falling under securities law. This remains a significant potential obstacle. Political and Legal Pressure: The approvals of BTC and ETH ETFs were partly influenced by court decisions and increasing political pressure. Similar factors could play a role for Solana. The timeline for a decision is uncertain. Filings typically undergo a review process with potential delays and comment periods. While eight filings show strong industry intent, the SEC’s final decision will depend on their assessment of Solana’s market characteristics and regulatory framework. Potential Benefits and Challenges of Spot Solana ETFs Let’s summarize the potential upside and downside of these Spot Solana ETF efforts. Potential Benefits: Increased Capital Inflow: ETFs could unlock significant capital from traditional finance that has been hesitant to enter crypto directly. Price Discovery: Increased trading volume on regulated exchanges could improve price discovery for SOL. Mainstream Adoption: Further legitimizes Solana as an asset class in the eyes of traditional investors and institutions. Enhanced Investor Access: Simplifies the process of investing in Solana for a broader audience. Potential Challenges & Risks: Regulatory Hurdles: As mentioned, SEC approval is not guaranteed, especially given potential security classification concerns. Market Volatility: Solana, like all cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile. An ETF would expose investors to this risk. Technical Risks: Concerns about potential network outages or technical issues specific to the Solana blockchain could be a factor. Fees: ETFs come with management fees, which can eat into returns over time. Centralization Concerns: Holding large amounts of SOL in an ETF could raise questions about concentration risk. Despite the challenges, the sheer number of Crypto ETF Filings for Solana indicates that financial firms see a compelling opportunity and believe the regulatory landscape is evolving favorably. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto ETF Filings Trend? The focus on Solana after Bitcoin and Ethereum is a strong indicator that financial institutions are looking beyond the top two. If a spot Solana ETF were to be approved, it could pave the way for ETFs based on other prominent altcoins, provided they meet the SEC’s standards regarding market size, liquidity, and regulatory compliance. This trend signifies a maturation of the crypto market in the eyes of traditional finance. It’s moving from a niche, speculative asset class to one where diverse investment products are being sought and developed. The competition among firms like CoinShares to be among the first to market with a Solana product highlights the perceived demand. The increase in Crypto ETF Filings for various assets reflects a broader movement towards making digital assets more accessible and integrated into traditional investment portfolios. It’s a testament to the growing recognition of the value and potential of blockchain technology and its associated assets. Actionable Insights for Readers So, what should you take away from this development? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on the SEC’s decisions regarding these Solana ETF applications. Regulatory news is a major market driver. Understand the Product: If approved, understand how a Spot Solana ETF works, its fees, and how it tracks the price of SOL before investing. Assess Solana Itself: An ETF is just a wrapper. Your investment’s performance will ultimately depend on Solana’s fundamentals, adoption, and market dynamics. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Solana and other cryptocurrencies are volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a diversified approach to crypto investing. The filing by CoinShares is an exciting step, adding another layer of anticipation to the ongoing story of crypto integration into traditional finance. A Compelling Summary: The Solana ETF Race is On CoinShares’ filing for a US Spot Solana ETF is more than just another news item; it’s a clear signal that the institutional spotlight is broadening beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. With eight firms now officially seeking approval from the SEC for a product that would offer direct exposure to Solana’s price, the race is undeniably heating up. While regulatory approval is far from guaranteed, facing significant hurdles related to market surveillance and asset classification, the sheer volume of Solana ETF applications reflects strong confidence in Solana’s potential and the growing demand for accessible crypto investment vehicles in the US. This trend, exemplified by the CoinShares Solana ETF filing, is a crucial development for the crypto market, potentially paving the way for greater institutional adoption and mainstream investor participation in assets like Solana.

The phone will be made in the U.S. and will include bundled services like telemedicine and global texting. Trump Media & Technology Group, the operator behind Truth Social and Truth+, has filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a new Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF . According to the company’s June 16 announcement , the ETF will directly hold both Bitcoin and Ethereum, allocating 75% of its assets to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum. ETF to Hold Bitcoin and Ether in Direct Custody The new digital asset investment product, once approved, will be listed on NYSE Arca. Crypto.com has been named as the sole custodian and prime execution agent. It will also provide staking and liquidity services. The ETF’s launch is subject to the SEC’s clearance of the Form S-1 registration and a separate Form 19b-4. Yorkville America Digital will also act as the ETF’s sponsor. While no launch date has been confirmed, the decision to work with established infrastructure providers like Crypto.com may help the product withstand regulatory scrutiny. If approved, the ETF could add a new dimension to the political and financial profile of the Trump Media brand. $499 Trump-Branded Smartphone Set for September Launch The Trump Organization introduced a new mobile service and smartphone today under the brand “Trump Mobile,” marking the latest in a series of consumer-facing ventures targeting conservative audiences. Announced during a media event at Trump Tower, the $499 device will be available starting in September, alongside a monthly service plan priced at $47.45 as a reference to Trump’s current role as the 47th U.S. president. BREAKING: The Trump Organization announced Trump Mobile, which will offer 5G service starting at $47.45 through the 3 major carriers and will be releasing a phone in August called the “T1 Phone.” The phone is described as “a sleek, gold smartphone engineered for performance and… pic.twitter.com/jhtXRLveJZ — RedWave Press (@RedWave_Press) June 16, 2025 The company stated that the phones will be manufactured in the U.S. and supported by domestic call centers. Donald Trump Jr. said the offering will include bundled services such as telemedicine, international texting, and roadside assistance. “We are going to be introducing an entire package of products where people can come and they can get telemedicine on their phones for one flat monthly fee, roadside assistance on their cars, unlimited texting to 100 countries around the world,” he said at the event. The phone and network are operated under a trademark licensing agreement, with the Trump Organization not directly involved in hardware design or telecom infrastructure. DTTM Operations, which manages Trump’s intellectual property, has filed trademark applications for telecom services and accessories. Trump-linked ventures are expanding into sectors with high consumer turnover, including mobile devices and digital asset products. The latest filings and launches show a coordinated push to establish diversified commercial footprints in retail finance and telecom under a unified brand identity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could the SEC’s ongoing scrutiny of crypto products affect the ETF’s approval? Although multiple spot crypto ETFs have been approved in 2024 and 2025, each filing is reviewed individually. Political affiliations or branding have no formal bearing, but high visibility may invite added regulatory attention. What role does Crypto.com play beyond custody? Crypto.com will also act as a staking provider and execution agent. This means it will handle trade execution and potentially generate yield on the Ethereum portion of the holdings through staking services. Could regulatory scrutiny increase due to the Trump brand’s involvement? Political affiliations can intensify attention from both regulators and advocacy groups, particularly if the product garners outsized media visibility or operates in sensitive sectors like finance or telecommunications.

2025-06-16T21:30:15,"JPMorgan has filed a crypto-related trademark application for “JPMD""","According to multiple reports, JPMorgan Chase, the world’s largest bank by assets, has filed a trademark for “JPMD.” The document identifies JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the owner and cites the bank’s Columbus, Ohio, address. There is speculation that the filing is for a new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, potentially named “JPMorgan Dollar” because the trademark application covers trading, exchange, transfer, and payment services tied to virtual currency, digital tokens, and blockchain-enabled money. Excerpts from JPMorgan Chase’s reported trademark filing for a potential “JPMD” stablecoin. Source: @tier10k Banks want to compete with crypto-native stablecoin issuers Stablecoin issuers like Tether have grown in influence and popularity in recent months as the world has woken up to the potential of stablecoins. Where they are concerned, issuers act like traditional banks, effectively taking their place. However, the banks are not going out without a fight. In May, reports claimed that JPMorgan , Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo were discussing a joint stablecoin initiative. Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian confirmed the talks, indicating that discussions have advanced beyond early speculation. The reports highlighted the desire of these banks to compete directly with crypto-native issuers as they view dollar-backed tokens as a strategic tool for providing instant liquidity and hedging market volatility. JPMorgan accepts spot Bitcoin ETFs as collateral for loans The trademark application comes after JPMorgan started accepting spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as loan collateral. According to June 4 reports, the program will begin with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and expand to include trading and wealth-management clients. The bank has also decided to include digital asset holdings when calculating a client’s net worth, treating them alongside equities, vehicles, and fine art during credit reviews. The Bitcoin collateral program and the “JPMD” filing are signs that the nation’s largest bank is thawing towards crypto, and while the bank is yet to announce a consumer-facing token, the trademark language mirrors the functions of a dollar-backed stablecoin . Working together, large banks in the U.S. could come to control issuance and settlement while applying the compliance standards that already exist in traditional finance. The JPMorgan filing and the multibank talks are proof that large financial institutions will continue to integrate digital assets into their core lending and payment operations. It is an innovative move, but some users on X have tagged it as an attempt to remain relevant in the shifting landscape of the financial world. The trademark filing is recent, and details remain speculative. However, one thing is certain; regulatory developments and market demand will most likely have much to do with shaping JPMD’s trajectory.

Bitcoin BTC has risen 3.1% in the last 24 hours and is now trading for $108,600, only a couple of thousand dollars below its all-time record. It certainly wasn’t alone in its ascension. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — is up 4.3% in the same period of time, buoyed by strong performances from XRP and chainlink LINK, which both notched 6-7% gains, and most other tokens rising at least 3%. A check at traditional markets shows that risk appetite has returned after last week's jitters on Israel and Iran launching missiles. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes bounced 0.9% and 1.4%, while safe haven gold declined 1.5%. Crypto stocks also joined the surge. Coinbase (COIN) and Circle (CRCL) closed the day 7.7% and 13% in the green. Among bitcoin miners, Bitdeer (BTDR) and Hut 8 (HUT) gained 6.9% and 5.6% respectively. Remarkably, one of the only equities in the red was Strategy (MSTR), which lost almost 0.2%, while rival bitcoin treasury companies Metaplanet rose 25% on the Japanese stock market. Positive crypto-related news added further fuel to today's rally: JPMorgan has filed a trademark application for a product that seeks to offer digital asset services such as trading, exchange, payment services and issuance. Meanwhile, asset manager Purpose is set to launch its spot XRP exchange-traded fund in Canada as momentum for altcoin-focused ETFs grows. When altcoin season? While today's altcoin outperformance may have inspired some traders' hope for an imminent alt season, Nansen research analyst Nicolai Søndergaard poured cold water on such expectations. It's still bitcoin that's leading the market, he said, with strength often tracing back to the largest crypto's performance. ""BTC has mostly served as a trigger for altcoins,"" Søndergaard. ""Some alts also do well. BTC breaks an ATH? The market likes that."" Some profits from BTC's rise to fresh record high may have trickled down to other cryptos, while some sectors such as DeFi have enjoyed short-term bursts of outperformance. ""These have, however, not been prolonged runs for alts, and looking at the grand scheme of things, most alts have been bleeding for some time,"" he said. The focus is still very much on BTC."" Bitcoin's strong rebound from Friday's low could bode well for the crypto market. Bitfinex analysts noted that the sentiment index Fear and Greed Index dropped into “Fear” territory last week, while Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume showed aggressive selling. ""This behavior, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation-style setups that often mark local bottoms,” the analysts said. ""If BTC can hold the $102,000-$103,000 zone, it may suggest that selling pressure is being absorbed and that the market could be primed for recovery."" Eyes on the Fed and Powell From a macro lens, attention is squarely on the Federal Reserve and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference. Investors overwhelmingly expect the Fed to keep benchmark rates steady this week and the following meeting in July, according to the CME FedWatch tool , market participants will focus on Powell's remarks about clues on how policymakers navigate inflation and job market pressures. ""Powell’s tone, not the rate decision, will drive volatility,"" digital asset analytics firm Swissblock said in a Monday note. ""Expect whiplash trading across commodities, yields and risk assets.""",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/16/btc-tops-108k-on-jpmorgan-crypto-filing-xrp-rallies-on-etf-news,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Markets|Market Wrap|market analysis|Bitcoin|XRP|FOMC|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T21:19:39,"Bitcoin Defies Middle East Turmoil, Climbs to $107.7K as ETF Inflows Hold Firm","Key Takeaways: Bitcoin rebounded from Friday’s dip, rising from $102,800 to $107,700 despite Middle East tensions. QCP Capital reported muted volatility and strong ETF inflows, suggesting no broad risk-off shift. Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson proposed using $100 million in treasury funds to purchase BTC and stablecoins. Bitcoin recovered after briefly dropping on Friday following Israel’s attack on Iran, trading from a low of $102,800 back to $107,700 on Monday . A report by QCP Capital published on June 16 noted that the pullback was limited in scope, and the asset held above the $100,000 threshold. It compared the reaction to a sharper drop in April 2024, when a similar situation triggered a decline of over 8 percent. Asia Colour – 16 June 25 1/ $BTC has held up impressively despite rising Middle East tensions. After dipping to 102.8k on Friday following Iran-Israel headlines, it has since recovered to 107k, mirroring rebounds in US equity futures and large-cap tokens. — QCP (@QCPgroup) June 16, 2025 Bitcoin Market Remains Composed Institutional flows remained steady during the episode. Spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to log weekly inflows, and entities such as Metaplanet and Strategy were reported to have added to their holdings over the weekend. QCP said implied volatility in the Bitcoin options markets remained muted, with front-end levels staying under 40. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index also remained near 20, indicating no broad shift into defensive positioning across risk assets. Traders cited stable activity in U.S. Treasuries and Asian government bonds as evidence that risk-off sentiment had not fully set in. While the risk of escalation remains, the report said current price behavior indicates the asset’s evolving response to geopolitical shocks. It noted that the price remains less than 6 percent below its all-time high. Some market participants believe continued global uncertainty could sustain demand for Bitcoin in the medium term, particularly amid concern over sovereign debt exposure and currency risk. Cardano Considers Treasury Shift Toward BTC and Stablecoins Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently proposed converting $100 million worth of ADA from the protocol’s treasury into a mix of stablecoins and Bitcoin. The plan outlines the use of Bitcoin to support emerging BTC-DeFi applications developed on Cardano sidechains and partner networks. Hoskinson said the funds could be deployed gradually using over-the-counter (OTC) and time-weighted execution strategies to avoid disrupting ADA’s market price. He stated that Cardano’s liquidity is sufficient to absorb the reallocation without causing volatility. Hoskinson added that upcoming features like native token support and partner chains require treasury mechanisms that go beyond single-asset reserves. A formal proposal is expected ahead of the Rare Evo conference later this year. Bitcoin is being used in more treasury and liquidity strategies across both centralized and decentralized systems. Some DeFi protocols have started allocating to BTC to counter the effects of native token dilution or to back multi-asset reserves. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does low implied volatility in options markets affect Bitcoin’s price behavior? Low implied volatility typically indicates reduced expectations of sudden price swings, suggesting that traders do not foresee sharp reactions to ongoing geopolitical risks. Why are some DeFi protocols introducing BTC into their treasuries? Incorporating BTC can provide a more stable reserve asset, diversify treasury holdings, and help offset inflationary pressure from excessive native token issuance. What role do governance upgrades play in treasury diversification efforts? New governance models, including elected boards and portfolio mandates, help protocols manage multi-asset reserves transparently and reduce concentration risk in single tokens.

This comes off as a bold step from the firm, but as Bryan Armour, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, has stated, this path may be rough. Here Comes Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF In a new filing submitted to the US SEC on Monday, Trump Media noted its partnership with Yorkville America Digital, stating its intention to launch a joint Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. This proposed fund is to be launched under the Truth Social name. Crypto.com will act as a custodian, execution agent, and liquidity provider. According to the plan, the fund’s holdings ratio for Bitcoin and Ethereum will be 75% and 25%, respectively. Like several other applicants, Truth Media still has to wait for the Commission to decide on its filing. Once the green light is issued, the shares will be listed on NYSE Arca, the company wrote in its statement. Trump Media Files to Launch Truth Social Bitcoin ETF Explicitly, this is not the first deal between Trump Media and Yorkville America. For perspective, the latter was the sponsor for the standalone Bitcoin ETF application that Trump Media made about two weeks ago. This was after the Trump-related firm announced that it had raised nearly $2.5 billion from about 50 institutional investors in a private placement deal. Hence, the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF is the second crypto ETF filing from the social media company in less than two weeks. The individual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF market is already saturated, even though the US niche is barely a year old. Therefore, Trump Media’s fund may have to strive to secure a reasonable market share when approved. BlackRock IBIT Leads Crypto ETF Flows The top asset management firm BlackRock, controls much of the crypto ETF market share. For almost every inflow, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to lead this rise . Beyond crypto funds, it has secured a position amongst the top five ETFs in the United States, surpassing even SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). Its Ethereum ETF is also performing well in the market, even with the fluctuations that ETH has been experiencing recently.

According to the expert, Bitcoin’s current rally may be the final phase of its first true institutional cycle—and the aftermath could send prices crashing to as low as $30,000. Bitcoin Bull Market Enters Final Stage A crypto analyst, identified as ‘MrParaBULLic’ on X (formerly Twitter), has issued a stark warning that the current Bitcoin bull market could be in the last stages of crypto’s first macro cycle. Despite trading around $106,616 at press time, the analyst expects BTC to top out soon, followed by a potentially devastating bear market that could push prices down to $34,932. Using the Elliott Wave theory , the analyst presented a chart, suggesting that Bitcoin is completing its fifth and final microwave in a classic five-wave impulse cycle. The latest surge, now pushing six figures, appears to represent Wave 5 , which is typically the last impulse move before a broader market reset. While MrParaBULLic has not pinpointed the exact peak in his chart, he anticipates that Bitcoin will experience a short-term bullish continuation before a sharp reversal unfolds. The analyst highlights that this level of upward movement, paired with heavy institutional involvement and narrative-driven conviction, creates what they describe as the “greatest euphoria trap ever.” The market expert also counters the idea that Bitcoin could be immune to deep corrections, highlighting the structural nature of its cycles—where previous bull runs , including those in 2013, 2017, and 2021 were each followed by sharp 80-90% drawdowns from their respective tops. Based to the analysis, institutional adoption has not invalidated this historical tendency, and in fact, it may be masking steeper risks . On the chart, $88,115 is marked as a key support zone that, once broken, could trigger cascading liquidations and a historic crash toward $34,932 or lower. This drop, if realized, would represent a 70-90% retracement from current levels, mirroring the brutal post-peak declines seen in earlier cycles . In response to the crypto community’s curiosity about his bearish $30,000 target, Mr. ParaBULLic emphasized that market expectations tend to provide liquidity at important support. When these expectations fail, the drawdown accelerates, creating conditions for a true macro market reset. Bitcoin Could Top Above $200,000 This Cycle As his bold forecast of an impending bear market caught the attention of the crypto community, many members responded with questions, asking when the Bitcoin price could top out and the time frame for this parabolic rally. MrParaBULLic shared that Bitcoin is expected to complete its bullish trajectory within five to eight months, after which a sharp shift in market structure is anticipated. The market expert also expressed confidence that Bitcoin’s final cycle top is still ahead, projecting a strong climb beyond the $200,000 mark before the bear market officially begins. This outlook also introduces a bullish window for altcoins , which the analyst predicts could rally explosively within the next 6-12 months after Bitcoin tops out.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-headed-for-30000/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|altcoins|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Bullish Continuation|MrParaBULLic",cryptocompare

The flagship coin broke out of a consolidation formed during the weekend after teasing potential capitulation following the Middle East tension. As a result of today’s rebound, optimism of further market rally increased traders’ greed. Moreover, Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market are well-positioned to benefit from the rising global money supply amid anticipated Quantitative Easing (QE) in the United States. Major Forces Behind Bitcoin Rebound Bitcoin price recorded bullish sentiment on Monday after Gold price posted its highest daily close on Sunday. The flagship coin has continued to benefit from macroeconomic tailwinds amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine. The demand for Bitcoin by institutional investors remains elevated as shown by its gradual decline of the overall supply on cryptocurrency exchanges. As Coinpedia reported, Strategy and Metaplanet have continued to lead other companies to aggressively accumulate more BTCs for their respective treasuries. According to market data analysis by CoinShares , Bitcoin led all the other digital asset investment products in net cash inflow last week with about $1.3 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s volatility will continue in the coming days as the Fed prepares to release the FOMC Statement and its benchmark interest rate. BTC Price Analysis and Short-term Expectation In the daily timeframe, BTC price has been consolidating in a symmetrical triangular pattern since hitting its all-time high of around $112k in mid-May. The short-term bullish expectations for Bitcoin remain palpable, especially after a consistent rebound above $107k in the past 24 hours. The bullish sentiment is also bolstered by the 1-hour MACD line, which has already crossed above the zero line. Additionally, the 1-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI ) has already rallied about the 70 percent level, which suggests the bulls are in control of the market. However, if BTC price retraces and consistently closes below the support range between $101k and $104k, a rejuvenated bearish sentiment will be confirmed.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-rebounds-above-108k-on-heightened-institutional-demand-is-it-a-dead-cat-bounce/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T20:51:03,"SharpLink Gaming: Ethereum Strategy Brings Upside, But Dilution Clouds The Path","Summary SharpLink Gaming recently purchased 176,271 ETH for $463 million, positioning itself as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, and effectively pivoting into a crypto treasury strategy similar to MicroStrategy’s. SBET faces significant dilution risk, with over 70 million potentially dilutive securities against a float of just ~2.3 million shares, contributing to recent sharp declines in its stock price. Despite the dilution overhang, SBET trades at just 1.19× its ETH per-share value, far below peers like MSTR and Metaplanet, suggesting a relatively fair valuation to underlying crypto assets. With low float, high volatility, and significant overhang from registered PIPE shares and an active $1B ATM shelf, short-term risks are elevated, but ETH bulls may see long-term upside. The last year has been a transformational one for Wall Street crypto exposure. The spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs launch in January last year was the inflection point, then the spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD) ETFs followed, then more recently the Circle ( CRCL ) IPO (which garnered much attention), and the regulatory clarity of stablecoins accelerated Wall Street’s embrace of crypto asset exposure the more. Now, even retail giants like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Walmart ( WMT ) are experimenting with their own stablecoin . On an institutional level of exposure to crypto, the treasury strategy based on a crypto asset has been made popular by Michael Saylor’s Strategy ( MSTR ). Today, you can count a dozen plus companies, in the U.S. and outside the U.S., adopting the crypto-backed treasury strategy. Bitcoin has been the default choice for companies seeking balance sheet exposure to crypto assets. Over 90% of companies pursuing a treasury allocation have Bitcoin as their anchor asset. Attention is, however, now turning to other “tried and tested” crypto assets lately. Ethereum, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, is emerging as the next logical choice for companies’ crypto-linked treasury. SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET ) is leaning into Ethereum the way MSTR did with Bitcoin. SharpLink is now the largest corporate holder of ETH, with 176,271 ETH purchased for $463 million recently. The company is allocating a portion of its balance sheet to ETH and aligning its product and partnership strategy with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. SharpLink Gaming - Company Overview Before we make sense of SharpLink’s present, we need an understanding of the company's origins and evolution. SharpLink was Founded in 2019, and originally began as a digital sports media and performance marketing firm focused on connecting sports fans with sports betting and fantasy sports platforms. The company grew its footprint by powering real-time odds integrations and affiliate services across U.S. sports content networks. In 2021, SharpLink merged with the Israeli telecom billing software provider , Mer Telemanagement Solutions Ltd, listed then on Nasdaq with the ticker MTSL. The merger enabled SharpLink to inherit a public listing, and the ticker symbol of the merged company was changed to SBET. This provided SharpLink the strategic springboard into the U.S. public markets under the ticker SBET. Following the transition, SharpLink expanded into the iGaming infrastructure space, building B2B solutions aimed at enabling sportsbooks, teams, and media partners to embed betting functionality into digital experiences. Over the years, the company has navigated shifting regulatory tides in the U.S., adapted to media-tech convergence, and now in a bold pivot recently, SharpLink is focusing on Ethereum as both a balance sheet asset and strategic alignment framework. SharpLink initiated its purchase of Ethereum for corporate treasury lately with 176,271 ETH purchased for $463 million after the successful closing of a PIPE funding earlier this month. The funding was led by ConsenSys, one of the most important companies in the Ethereum ecosystem - this further cements SharpLink’s Ethereum-first strategy. The initiating purchase of such a substantial amount of ETH could present a new narrative and valuation framework for SharpLink, following months of downward pressure and investor uncertainty for the stock. Companies aggressively pursuing corporate strategy focused crypto assets have been enjoying outsized re-ratings and growing retail and institutional interest. Prime example is MSTR, trading at around 80% premium to its BTC net asset value despite posting ongoing net losses. Defi Development Corp., formerly Janover, ( DFDV ) adopted a Solana ( SOL-USD ) treasury strategy and has seen a re-rating as a result, triggering a parabolic surge; the stock is currently up about 500% since the SOL strategy pivot and up over 3,000% YTD. SBET has been underwater for long, before the pivot to ETH corporate treasury strategy recently. A 1-for-12 reverse stock split was effected for SBET last month to save the stock from losing compliance with Nasdaq’s $1 minimum bid price requirement as the stock has been trading under $1. That mechanical fix was important for SharpLink by preserving SBET Nasdaq listing just ahead of the pivot into the Ethereum treasury strategy. SBET’s Volatility: Risks Meet Crypto Assets Treasury Opportunity Crypto-tied stocks are no stranger to volatility, and SBET's case is even more accentuated due to low float. SBET float has been highly compressed over the years. First, there was a 1-for-10 stock split in April 2023 in which SBET shares outstanding were consolidated from 26.9 million shares to 2.69 million shares. About 5 million more shares were issued over time after the 1-for-10 split (take note of the dilution). And as of the more recent 1-for-12 split in May 2025, shares were further consolidated from around 7.9 million shares to around 660,000 shares. After the 1-for-12 reverse stock split, there have been a series of fundraisings and share issuances. In the context of the PIPE offering earmarked for the purchase of treasury ETH mentioned earlier, $425 million was raised and ~69.1 million shares and related warrants were issued. Another $4.5 million public offering took place on May 20 in which 34,000 shares and 1.49 million pre-funded warrants were issued. Then an additional $79 million was raised between June 2 and June 12 under the $1 billion ATM shelf offering through the issuance of 1.6 million common shares. The shares of the PIPE offering were initially restricted from immediate trading due to registration rights agreements (until recently). Of the $4.5 million raised in the May public offering, only 34,000 shares were immediately tradable. And 1.6 million shares from the ATM raise were also immediately tradable. When we add that to the existing 660,000 shares outstanding as of the stock split, we get a current float of approximately 2.3 million shares. Now, summing up the total share and warrant count from the post reverse split capital raises - 69.1 million from the PIPE offering, 1.6 million via ATM, 34,000 shares plus 1.49 million pre-funded warrants from the May public offering, and ~660 thousand outstanding during the reverse split - over 70 million additional potentially dilutive securities have been added since. Considering the scale and overhang of the existing dilutive shares and a mere float of ~2.3 million shares, this ultra-low float relative to a large fully diluted share count is a recipe for wild volatility. And this further amplifies the downside risk when these potentially dilutive securities become eligible for trading or exercised, pressuring the stock with dilution. Seeking Alpha SBET saw a steep decline of over 70% last week despite the announcement of the 176,271 ETH purchase, which was an absolute divergence from the trend of treasury strategy announcements typically acting as short-term bullish catalysts for companies initiating crypto treasury purchases. The causes of the steep price dip were directly related to the dilution concerns I’ve discussed in detail in the preceding paragraphs. Investors developed anxiety surrounding the stock’s dilution after SharpLink filed an S-3 registration statement last week. Then that led to some sell-off which was further exacerbated due to the low float, making the price plunge dramatically. Basically, shares and pre-funded warrants from the PIPE placement in May were registered for resale in the S-3, lifting the registration rights restrictions on them. The “Sword of Damocles” effect kicked in, as investors rightly gauged the ~70 million shares supply overhang as a potential threat to share price stability, and the high potential for future dilution and selling pressure against the current low float. Josepg Lubin post (X) Consensys led the PIPE financing and was the largest investor in the PIPE . Joseph Lubin, the founder of Consensys and co-founder of Ethereum, released a statement on X allaying fears of potential immediate selloff by the PIPE investors. While that may seem an encouraging gesture, I don't think it will fully allay investors' fears of the effects of dilution as float remains this low. It will take a while before the market absorbs all that dilution and increases the float. As SBET fell below $10 last Friday from last week’s high of $37, I think investors should not rule out the possibility of it revisiting $1. Though I feel this is not likely, it should not be ruled out because of the convergence of risks, including a new-found crypto-link volatility for SBET given the company’s balance sheet is now heavily exposed to ETH, and also the potential for PIPE investors to exit positions now that their shares are registered, and the mechanical weight of more dilution being priced in. Let's not also forget that of the $1 billion ATM shelf offering (mentioned earlier), only $79 million has been raised so far, leaving potential to raise an additional $921 million. SBET is shaping up to be a potential dilution machine. Beyond the dilution and low float overhang, a comp analysis of SBET’s crypto assets holdings shows that it is still reasonably valued based on its underlying crypto assets. I've included SBET into a table of companies I track (which comprises Bitcoin miners and companies pursuing a crypto asset treasury strategy) based on their crypto exposure on balance sheet and their price-to-hodl ratio (stock price against the per-share value of their crypto holdings). P/Hold comparison (Author) SBET is currently trading at 1.76x to its treasury holdings. As of last Friday's dip when the stock tumbled to ~$9, it was trading at a much more attractive 1.19x P/Hodl. SBET has quickly re-rated off that lower valuation; this further shows the potential for volatility I’ve talked about so far. SharpLink also has a slight advantage over companies pursuing pure BTC strategy because of the ability to stake ETH. I’m labeling this advantage as a “slight” one because BTC’s demand and sheer institutional dominance remains over ETH and other assets. As of the latest filing, SharpLink disclosed that over 95% of its ETH holdings are currently deployed in staking services. At a current APY of around 4%, that's ~6,695 ETH extra from staking rewards annually, and a potential $17.6 million addition to SharpLink’s balance sheet at current ETH prices. Takeaway SBET embodies both dilution risk and a slight valuation attractiveness to net asset value. There is potential downside for SBET because of dilution risk and low float (the bad), and also potential upside as its premium to underlying assets is still reasonable (the good), and also potentially “the ugly” if, for some reason, the stock falls near $1 again. As I’ve discussed, SBET faces near-term supply overhang and severe dilution risks (both from the registered PIPE shares and the unused capacity left in the ATM offering). Based on these factors, I’m initiating coverage with a Hold, with an open stance to watch how the stock absorbs the supply overhang in the coming weeks and months. However, If you're an ETH maxi and comfortable with what I’d call leveraged ETH exposure through a volatile equity, taking some position could be worth it in the long term, if ETH keeps momentum and the company navigates its share count headwinds well.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795256-sharplink-gaming-ethereum-strategy-brings-upside-but-dilution-clouds-the-path?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING","MSTR|BTC-USD|ETH-USD|SOL-USD|SBET",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T20:50:52,"Bitcoin Consolidates Above $100K as Institutional Buying Persists and Liquidity Cools","Even as liquidity inflows to centralized exchanges have declined markedly, the most important players in this space continue to double down on their Bitcoin investments. This past week saw MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, two prominent corporate Bitcoin holders, add to their substantial BTC balances. They purchased a combined 19,452 Bitcoins at an average price of about $29,500. These purchases of Bitcoin, in amounts that are impossible to disguise, not only demonstrate the long-term viability of Bitcoin as a monetary asset but also strongly counteract the narrative that Bitcoin is in a “bear market.” Bitcoin ($BTC) remains solidly ensconced above $100,000. This seems to be the foundation of a market momentarily dedicating itself to base-building. Quite the contrary to Bitcoin’s $BTC prior pattern of forsaking range-bound sideways trading, the current price action looks concerted to establish a base above the $100,000 price level. MicroStrategy and Metaplanet Continue Relentless Accumulation MicroStrategy, which holds the most Bitcoin of any institution, made news once more with its latest acquisition. The Tysons Corner, VA, company, headed by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, bought another 10,100 BTC, worth about $1.05 billion, at an average price of $104,080 per coin. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin total now is a hug 592,100 BTC, and that’s worth $63.2 billion at current prices. The average entry price for MicroStrategy is 70,666, which means it has an unrealized profit of roughly $21.37 billion. This brings us to the purchase made not too long ago, which was not for the sake of trying to impress investors or anything along those lines but rather for the company to keep doing what it has been doing and to keep cementing that path. MicroStrategy( @Strategy ) bought another 10,100 $BTC ($1.05B) at an average price of $104,080 last week. #Strategy currently holds 592,100 $BTC ($63.2B), with an average buying price of $70,666 and an unrealized profit of $21.37B. https://t.co/k0MMvMpgDQ pic.twitter.com/ic4td6g3Zu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 16, 2025 At the same time, the Japanese investment firm Metaplanet—like MicroStrategy, a steadfast advocate for Bitcoin—has also grown its BTC stash. The firm recently picked up another 1,112 BTC for $116.5 million—and at an average price of $104,760, that makes it the second most recent buyer of 1000+ BTC at a price above $100,000. Metaplanet’s total holdings now stand at 10,000 BTC, with a valuation around $1.065 billion and an average acquisition price that has fallen to around $96,000. Purchasing either of these items shows that institutions have a lot of faith in Bitcoin’s long-term worth. And this is happening even though the market seems somewhat lackluster these days. Metaplanet( @Metaplanet_JP ) bought another 1,112 $BTC ($116.5M) at $104,760. Metaplanet currently holds 10,000 $BTC ($1.06B), with an average buying price of $96,015. https://t.co/LRlXDOEoNK pic.twitter.com/rFlitaYIrP — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 16, 2025 Exchange Liquidity Declines from December Highs Although institutional buying stays robust, inflows of exchange-directed liquidity have dropped significantly since their peak in December 2024. At that time, when Bitcoin was trading from $98,000 to $100,000, the average daily inflows of stablecoins (such as USDT and USDC) into centralized exchanges reached an all-time high of $131 billion. As of June 2025, however, that number has dropped to approximately $70 billion per day—a $61 billion decrease from the peak and $5 billion below the 365-day moving average of $75 billion. Although this marks a clear reduction in market liquidity, current levels still sit well above those seen at the beginning of the bull cycle. In December 2024, when BTC was trading between $98K and $100K, average daily inflows of USDT and USDC into all centralized exchanges (CEXs) reached a record high of $131B. By June, that figure had dropped to $70B per day – $5B below the 365-day average of $75B and $61B below the… pic.twitter.com/ri8KdCVu38 — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 16, 2025 This trend indicates that although the speculative fervor may have cooled, this has not led to any substantial outflows or profit-taking that could be described as widespread. It seems, instead, that market participants are more willing than before to just sit tight and hold their positions, even as they begin to exit from trading altogether. Market Enters Consolidation Phase Ahead of Next Move Bitcoin is holding above $100,000 and continuing institutional accumulation means the price may be in a healthy resetting state. The intense bullish price action, however, could mean we are entering a bearish consolidation phase with a potential move dipping below $100,000 next. This phase is sometimes referred to as base-building; it is where long-term holders persist in amassing their assets, and where we see speculative excesses gradually filtered out. If large-scale buyers like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet are still using this prolonged bottoming to increase their exposure, then it suggests they and we are operating under the belief that Bitcoin is markedly undervalued—even at these six-figure levels. In addition, the price of Bitcoin being so resilient in the face of declining liquidity shows what a strong demand there is for the asset and how deeply held the conviction is that it will continue to appreciate. Most Bitcoin owners aren’t even thinking about sell orders, much less panic sell or asset rotation. What most market participants seem content with is to just wait out the lull. Conclusion Although centralized exchange liquidity has clearly taken a hit from its December peak, when it recorded over $12 billion in total order book depth, the Bitcoin price has held up relatively well. Bitcoin price stability paints a long-term bullish picture. With Bitcoin solidly above $100K, the market seems to have entered a strategic holding pattern—one that could lay the groundwork for a much more powerful uptrend.

Top Analysts Weigh In","Bitcoin (BTC) is holding firm near the $105,000 mark, posting a modest 2.6% gain over the past 30 days despite near-flat movement this week. This quiet resilience comes as conflicting macro signals, particularly from oil markets , fuel speculation about whether Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating for a breakout or masking a deeper shift toward altcoins. Top analysts are now closely watching Ethereum, XRP, and emerging microcaps like FloppyPepe (FPPE) for signs of capital rotation amid the growing tension. Bitcoin (BTC) Eyes Recovery Amid Volatile Oil Signals Bitcoin (BTC) is currently hovering around $105,097, steady despite a volatile macro backdrop marked by a dramatic 14% spike in crude oil futures. This surge, reflected in a sharp climb to $77.57 per barrel, has introduced uncertainty across global markets, with energy prices historically playing a key role in shaping investor risk appetite. While some analysts are split on whether rising oil is inflationary or a symptom of broader geopolitical stress, crypto traders on X are leaning bullish. A widely-circulated BTC/USDT chart shows Bitcoin (BTC) forming a textbook double bottom around $102,900, suggesting the recent pullback may be a shakeout before a larger leg upward. Macro Shakeouts And Altcoin Ripples: Enter FloppyPepe (FPPE) As oil prices climb, whether due to inflationary pressure or geopolitical turbulence, Bitcoin’s (BTC) ability to hold the $105K level is shifting the crypto narrative from fear to strategic positioning. This backdrop has analysts eyeing smaller-cap assets like FloppyPepe (FPPE) , whose presale, priced at just $0.00000035 and launched after a $907,200 private raise, perfectly aligns with Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential breakout and the hunt for asymmetric upside. What truly positions FloppyPepe (FPPE) for major growth isn’t just timing, it’s its real, functional utility. With AI tools like FloppyX , FloppyAI , and Meme-o-Matic already in beta via Telegram, users are actively generating viral content, automating storytelling, and launching full-scale marketing strategies in real time. These tools offer tangible value to meme creators, marketers, and crypto influencers, giving the project a unique edge in utility-driven adoption. As these tools gain traction through live beta testing, meme contests, and creator campaigns, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) ecosystem is rapidly expanding across Telegram, X, and YouTube. Influencer amplification from names like Nass Crypto and David In Crypto is boosting this momentum, solidifying the project as a microcap primed for exponential growth. The Presale Storm: 80% Bonus And Accessible Entry Fuel Frenzy FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale isn’t just well-timed, it’s creating a frenzy of strategic accumulation. With an 80% bonus currently active, the opportunity to maximize holdings at just $0.00000035 is driving rapid participation. Retroactive bonuses for early backers have only strengthened trust, reinforcing investor confidence while amplifying buying pressure.

Analysts Spotlight FloppPepe (FPPE) As The Altcoin Presale To Watch As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to test macro thresholds and flirt with technical breakout structures amid the oil price surge, institutional and retail traders alike are scanning for high-upside altcoins to rotate into. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has emerged as a top contender, backed by functional AI technology, robust floppynomics, and a community-first ethos that fuels its growth. With an 80% bonus still live and presale momentum building, early participants are locking in deep-value allocations ahead of major growth drivers like Uniswap listings and exchange platform integrations. The project’s smart contract is fully audited by SolidProof, reinforcing investor confidence in its security and long-term integrity.

The ETF’s Setup In a Form S-1 submitted Monday, the proposed “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, B.T.” would have a holdings ratio of 75% BTC and 25% ETH, with Singapore-based exchange Crypto.com serving as the custodian, execution agent, and liquidity provider. Trump Media and Technology Group signaled its intent to issue a crypto exchange-traded fund earlier this month as it filed paperwork for a fund focused solely on Bitcoin, called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. The new ETF seeks to offer traditional investors exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether by giving them shares backed by the crypto assets, eliminating the intricacies related to buying and storing the tokens themselves. The ETF shares are proposed to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca (NYSE Arca), per the Monday filing. The product fees are yet to be disclosed. The inclusion of Ethereum aligns with the Trump family’s crypto activity; World Liberty Financial holds over 95% of its assets on the Ethereum blockchain, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF would join a crowded and competitive market already dominated by nearly a dozen established asset managers, including BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin Trust holds a whopping $70 billion in assets on behalf of its clients — accounting for roughly 3.37% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Trump Deepens Crypto Fray The latest filing furthers the Trump Media and Technology Group’s deepening involvement with crypto. In late May, it raised $2.32 billion to build its own BTC treasury, though the firm has not yet announced any Bitcoin acquisitions. Moreover, Trump’s family has become linked to a slew of crypto projects as the President’s administration eases restrictions on the hot sector. As you may recall, President Trump debuted an official meme coin on the Solana blockchain back in January, just days before his swearing-in. Before that was the launch of the Ethereum decentralized finance platform World Liberty Financial, which has since unveiled its own governance token and stablecoin .",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trumps-truth-social-continues-crypto-push-with-dual-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etf-filing/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Bitcoin|Ethereum|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin treasuries are becoming increasingly attractive for both crypto and tradFi firms.

Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp downturn following the recent conflict between Israel and Iran, triggering a wave of risk-off sentiment among investors. However, according to a Bitfinex Alpha report published on June 16, the market may be positioned for a recovery, provided global tensions do not escalate further. While Bitcoin started the previous week on a strong note, rising 4.7% and testing its all-time high at $109,590, the unexpected Israeli strikes on Iran on June 13 unexpected Israeli strikes on Iran and the subsequent retaliations made traders much more risk-averse. Investors panicked, but Bitcoin remained resilient: Bitfinex Alpha A spike in oil prices, driven by concerns that a broader conflict could disrupt oil production, further added to macroeconomic uncertainty. Following the attacks, Bitcoin fell 7.3%, coinciding with a sharp drop in net taker volume to negative $197 million — a level suggesting widespread panic in the market. Bitcoin net taker volume | Source: Bitfinex According to Bitfinex analysts, such sharp declines in net taker volume often indicate capitulation, a pattern seen in previous market bottoms. The crypto fear and greed index also slid quickly into “fear” territory, reinforcing the narrative of a likely local bottom.

If Bitcoin can hold the $102,000–$103,000 zone, it may suggest that selling pressure is being absorbed and that the market could be primed for recovery—assuming geopolitical risks don’t intensify further,” Bitfinex Alpha report. Despite the panic, the overall market correction has been relatively mild. Bitcoin saw a 9% peak-to-trough decline — much smaller than previous major drawdowns. Bitfinex notes that this trading range has been observed in nearly half of the sessions during the current cycle, suggesting that recent volatility remains within typical bounds. If the $102,000 support zone holds and macro conditions stabilize, the current setup could pave the way for a renewed bullish trend.

In a press release , Trump Media says its previous registration filing with the SEC has been declared effective by the regulator on June 13th, allowing the company to move forward with a prospectus. Trump Media previously filed with the SEC to adopt a Bitcoin treasury because it views BTC as an “apex instrument of financial freedom.” Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s CEO and President, said that investing in BTC would “help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and US firms.” A BTC treasury would also be useful for subscription payments, a utility token and other planned transactions across the company’s subsidiaries – Truth Social and Truth+ – according to Nunes. Says Nunes, “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities. By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our FinTech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to a new S-1 Filing with the SEC, President Trump’s Truth Social, a social media network, has filed for a new BTC/ETH ETF.

In early March, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he directed the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets “to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA.” Politico, citing “two people familiar with the incident,” reported that Trump was goaded into making the post by an employee of the lobbying firm Ballard Partners. The unnamed employee reportedly “buttonholed” Trump at Mar-a-Lago and encouraged him multiple times to publish the post, even providing him with the text of a message she thought the president should write.

After last week’s failed breakout above resistance, ETH has retraced yet again, struggling to build sustained momentum. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified market uncertainty, contributing to spikes in volatility across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation – Details Despite the macro headwinds, Ethereum bulls continue to defend key support levels, preventing a deeper breakdown. The $2,400 zone has acted as a strong floor in recent weeks, absorbing sell pressure and keeping ETH within its current trading range. Meanwhile, the $2,800 resistance remains the major hurdle to reclaim for a bullish breakout scenario. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical outlook suggesting that Ethereum is still consolidating below a key resistance area. This structure indicates that ETH is coiling before its next major move. The window for a potential breakout narrows as price tightens within this established range. Ethereum Prepares To Move Ethereum has pushed into a critical price zone, with bulls attempting to hold the $2,600–$2,700 range after recent volatility. The asset has shown resilience, rebounding from last week’s lows and re-entering the mid-range of its multi-week consolidation. With price action once again approaching the $2,800 resistance level, market participants are eyeing a potential breakout that could open the door to $3,000 and beyond. Analysts remain divided. On one side, bullish momentum and improving market sentiment suggest ETH is preparing for a larger move. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger aggressive buying and initiate a broader altcoin rally. Many investors are positioning themselves in anticipation of a rotation from Bitcoin into high-beta assets like Ethereum, hoping to ride the next phase of the cycle. On the other side, caution persists. Some technical analysts argue that Ethereum may still be at risk of losing steam, especially if the price gets rejected again at resistance. A failure to maintain the current range could result in a retracement toward $2,400 support or even lower, shaking out weak hands. According to a recent technical update from Jelle, Ethereum remains locked in consolidation just below its key resistance zone. The analysis points to a tightening structure where the window of opportunity is closing. If ETH breaks above this zone, it could ignite fireworks across the altcoin market. With global uncertainty still present and traders closely watching resistance levels, Ethereum’s next move could define the pace of the broader market. Whether it’s a breakout or a breakdown, the coming days are likely to be pivotal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Critical $104K Support – Eyes On $97K If It Breaks ETH Price Action: Technical Details Ethereum is currently trading at $2,606, maintaining a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800 as shown in the 12-hour chart. After multiple rejections around the $2,800 zone, the asset is struggling to break through this resistance level decisively. Despite the volatility triggered by macroeconomic uncertainty and Middle East conflict, ETH has managed to defend the $2,500 area, supported by a rising 100-period moving average. The recent bounce from the lower end of the range suggests that bulls are still active, stepping in to defend critical structure. However, volume remains relatively muted, indicating that buyers are cautious and awaiting confirmation before initiating larger positions. Meanwhile, the 50-period moving average remains above the 200-period MA, hinting at a medium-term bullish bias if support continues to hold.

If the range breaks to the downside, the $2,400 zone is the next level to watch for demand.

2025-06-16T19:19:36,"Tron’s $210m Nasdaq play is real. Eric Trump’s role? Not so much.","As Justin Sun’s TRON enters into a $210 million reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, Eric Trump has publicly distanced himself from Dominari Securities, the firm brokering the deal. The Trump-linked bank’s role is drawing scrutiny amid Sun’s expanding investments in crypto ventures associated with the Trump orbit. The reported reverse merger between TRON and Florida-based SRM Entertainment marks one of the more unusual public debuts in recent crypto history: a blockchain empire going public not through a traditional IPO, but by absorbing a small-cap toy maker with licensing deals across Disney, Universal, and SeaWorld. Structured as a private placement, the deal involves a $100 million upfront investment and warrants valuing the transaction at $210 million. As part of the agreement, SRM Entertainment will rebrand as Tron Inc., effectively giving Sun’s blockchain project a backdoor entry onto the Nasdaq. The intrigue deepens with the players behind the scenes. Dominari Securities, the boutique investment bank arranging the offering, has well-documented ties to the Trump family. Read more: Trump’s Truth Social joins ETF race with dual Bitcoin and Ethereum product According to a June 16 CNBC report, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump joined Dominari’s parent company’s advisory board earlier this year. Yet within hours of the report linking Dominari to the TRON-SRM deal, Eric Trump took to X to deny any “public involvement” with the firm, calling the narrative “inaccurate.” . @tier10k I’m the biggest fan of Tron and love @justinsuntron – he is a great friend and an icon in the crypto space. That said the below is inaccurate – I don’t have public involvement in this company. https://t.co/CDt0uudY1s — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) June 16, 2025 Damage control or strategic retreat? Eric Trump’s swift denial raises more questions than it answers. His June 16 tweet directly addressed the report tying his family to the TRON-SRM merger. But the phrasing—“I don’t have public involvement in this company”—leaves room for interpretation. What about involvement behind closed doors? With Dominari brokering one of the year’s most controversial crypto deals, the denial reads like a strategic retreat. The optics were problematic: Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire facing an SEC fraud case that has lost momentum under the Trump administration, invests nearly $100 million into Trump-aligned crypto ventures. Then, a Trump-linked bank steps in to help him go public. The timing is critical. Sun’s investments in Trump-backed ventures, including World Liberty Financial and the MAGA meme token, had already drawn scrutiny. Now, with Dominari at the center of the merger, the narrative risks shifting from business strategy to political patronage. Eric Trump’s denial may be a preemptive move to blunt regulatory or media backlash. Still, in crypto markets, where perception often drives sentiment, the damage may already be done. SRM stock surged 460 percent on news of the merger. But if investors start questioning who’s really pulling the strings, that volatility could just as quickly reverse course.

The altcoin, often dubbed “digital silver”, has failed to rally alongside top cryptocurrencies, with its price recently constrained below $140 since dropping below in January 2022. In the past few months, buyers have looked to strengthen in the $80-$100 range. Per CoinMarketCap data, LTC traded around $88.28, green on the day but in the red over the past week and month. Litecoin network surges to 30 million transactions in 2025 While not as impressive as some outperformers, the LTC price currently reflects renewed investor enthusiasm, fueled by spot ETF anticipation and network growth milestones. Among this is Litecoin network’s run to over 30 million transactions year-to-date. Litecoin Foundation shared the milestone in a post, noting the network has processed over 30 million transactions in 2025 so far. This translates to an average of over one million transactions per week, underscoring the network’s robust adoption as a payment method. Litecoin Foundation ⚡️ @LTCFoundation · Follow JUST IN: The Litecoin Network has completed 30 million transactions YTD in 2025!! Averaging well over a million transactions per week! #Litecoin ⚡️ What’s in your wallet? #MondayMotivation Watch on Twitter View replies 6:16 pm · 16 Jun 2025 85 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies Data from IntoTheBlock highlights a surge in large transactions, with over $1.2 billion in LTC moved in single transactions exceeding $100,000 during recent peak periods. This activity reflects growing confidence among institutional and high-net-worth investors. Litecoin’s likely price breakout could benefit from these massive transaction counts. Also set to play a huge role in holder sentiment is the growing expectations for a spot Litecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Currently, Litecoin, Solana, and XRP are among the altcoins with several spot ETF applications before the SEC. Sentiment is high across the market as Polymarket traders bet on huge odds that the SEC will approve these spot ETFs before the end of the year. Analysts, including Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, say the chances that the SEC approves these funds are very high. Potentially, they see a launch for LTC and others by October 2025. Given the anticipation, price appreciation could follow news of trading dates. Litecoin price forecast Litecoin’s price action suggests a potential bullish reversal. The token has bounced off the $80 support level on multiple occasions in the past month. A bullish pattern in the form of a rising channel gives bulls an upper hand. The daily chart also has the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trending upward, indicating increasing buying pressure. A similar outlook is possible given the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which signals a bullish crossover. Key price levels to watch are $100 on the upside and $80 on the downside. A breakout above or below will be crucial to either bulls or bears.
