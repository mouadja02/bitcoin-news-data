2025-06-17T07:59:01,"Crypto Market Today: Bitcoin Dips, XRP Pulls Back, Ethereum Lags Ahead of FOMC","The post Crypto Market Today: Bitcoin Dips, XRP Pulls Back, Ethereum Lags Ahead of FOMC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A cloud of uncertainty hangs over global markets as investors brace for the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. With no major policy shifts expected, traders are watching closely for signals on rate cuts, inflation trends, and macro risks. The crypto market, already tense from recent volatility, is showing mixed performance with XRP leading gains among major tokens. Bitcoin Wobbles Amid Geopolitical Tensions Bitcoin briefly topped $108,000 in early U.S. hours on Monday before sliding to $106,500 on profit-taking. It later bounced back above $107,000 during Asian trading on Tuesday. The movement follows Friday‚Äôs $1.2 billion in futures liquidations, which forced out overleveraged traders and weighed heavily on altcoins through the weekend. Despite the choppy action, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $1.4 billion in net inflows last week, reinforcing their growing role as stabilizers during volatile periods. Analysts suggest Bitcoin‚Äôs slow response to macroeconomic stress could change if investors seek alternative safe-haven assets. ‚ÄúBitcoin typically lags behind gold and oil during geopolitical events, but if risk sentiment turns, BTC could quickly regain momentum,‚Äù said Eugene Cheung of OSL. XRP Takes the Lead as Altcoins Recover While most major altcoins are still recovering from the weekend drawdown, XRP stood out with a strong rebound. XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, is trading at $2.17 with a 0.77% daily gain, backed by a $128.23 billion market cap and $1.74 billion in volume. It continues to hold a strong position, supported by growing interest in institutional banking integration. Ethereum ticked up 1.5% to $2,609 but continued to trail Bitcoin‚Äôs ETF-fueled performance. Solana and Tron also posted modest gains, but sentiment across altcoins remains cautious. Meanwhile, Gold and oil surged early Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly urged the evacuation of Tehran during the G7 summit. The geopolitical jolt sent investors rushing into defensive assets, while Bitcoin‚Äôs response remained subdued. XRP Outperformed Bitcoin This Cycle, Says Analyst Crypto analyst Nick pointed out that XRP has gained more than 678% since its 2022 low, beating Bitcoin‚Äôs 565% rise. He added that XRP‚Äôs total gains this cycle have already topped 1,000%, and the rally isn‚Äôt over yet. According to him, XRP has outpaced both Bitcoin and Ethereum in this bull run so far. Fed Holds the Spotlight All eyes are now on the Fed. Market watchers expect interest rates to remain unchanged, but the tone of Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs remarks could set the course for crypto and equities alike. With inflation easing and jobs data holding firm, officials may opt for patience, though some, like SignalPlus‚Äô Augustine Fan, believe a dovish tilt could be signaled subtly. The near-term outlook remains tied to the Fed‚Äôs message and the unfolding tensions in the Middle East.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-market-today-bitcoin-dips-xrp-pulls-back-ethereum-lags-ahead-of-fomc/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T07:54:16,"The Blockchain Group raises additional $7.7M to grow Bitcoin treasury","The Blockchain Group has raised an additional ‚Ç¨7.2 million, about $7.7 million, to support its plan of becoming Europe‚Äôs leading Bitcoin Treasury company. The announcement was made in a June 17 press release by the Paris-listed firm (Euronext: ALTBG.PA), which is pursuing a long-term strategy of increasing the amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) per share it holds. The funding was secured through an ‚ÄúAt-The-Market type‚Äù capital raise with asset manager TOBAM, where 1.6 million new shares were issued at an average price of ‚Ç¨4.49. That price reflected a 20.76% discount from the stock‚Äôs June 13 close, due to market volatility during the raise. The capital raise allows The Blockchain Group to continue adding BTC to its balance sheet, as part of a broader treasury strategy that started in late 2024. üü†The Blockchain Group announces a capital increase totalling ~‚Ç¨7.2 million at an average price of ~‚Ç¨4.49 per share as part of its ‚ÄúATM-type‚Äù capital increase program with TOBAM to pursue its Bitcoin Treasury Company strategy‚ö°Ô∏è Full Press Release (EN): https://t.co/KHPHTT0eeB ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/f2xgxbi8Ez ‚Äî The Blockchain Group (@_ALTBG) June 17, 2025 You might also like: Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy strengthens Bitcoin bet with 10,100 BTC purchase This strategy mirrors capital market moves made by firms like Strategy and Japan‚Äôs Metaplanet, both of which hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. The Blockchain Group is one of the first in Europe to follow this path, aiming to accumulate up to 260,000 BTC, currently about $24 billion, by 2033. The recent capital raise saw TOBAM, through three of its funds, subscribe to all 1.6 million shares. The largest tranche went to the TOBAM Bitcoin CO2 Offset Fund, which acquired over 834,000 shares. The other two funds, the Bitcoin Treasury Opportunities Fund and the Blockchain Equity Fund, took the remaining portion. As a result, TOBAM now holds 3.3% of The Blockchain Group‚Äôs capital on a fully diluted basis. The capital raise follows a shareholder vote on June 11 that increased the company‚Äôs fundraising capacity to ‚Ç¨500 million in nominal value. That resolution passed with over 95% approval, underlining strong investor support for the Bitcoin pivot. On a fully diluted basis, the company‚Äôs share count now exceeds 313 million, factoring in all potential conversions from bonds, free share grants, and warrants. The Blockchain Group‚Äôs model draws on the idea that Bitcoin is a long-term hedge against inflation and fiat currency risks. The company, which also develops decentralized tech, AI, and data tools, believes BTC can protect shareholder value and offer stronger returns than traditional treasury reserves. The firm joins a growing list of publicly traded companies shifting to a Bitcoin-focused strategy, a trend analysts say could grow to $330 billion in corporate holdings by 2029.

El Salvador, the first country in the world to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, reached a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF in December 2024.

Here‚Äôs what this could mean for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Have Dropped Below Yearly Average In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed about the latest trend in the Exchange Inflow of the top two stablecoins in the sector, USDT and USDC. The ‚ÄúExchange Inflow‚Äù refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that‚Äôs moving into the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. Generally, investors may deposit their coins into these platforms when they want to trade them away, so a high value on the Exchange Inflow can indicate demand for swapping the cryptocurrency. For volatile assets like Bitcoin, this is something that can naturally be bearish for the price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Must Hold This Level‚ÄîOr Risk A 30% Price Crash In the case of stablecoins, however, their price doesn‚Äôt see any impact from exchange deposits, since it always remains, by definition, stable around whatever fiat currency the asset is tracking. That said, stablecoin inflows aren‚Äôt without consequence. Investors usually deposit these assets to swap into a volatile cryptocurrency of their choice. As such, coins like Bitcoin can see a bullish effect from an Exchange Inflow spike related to these fiat-tied tokens. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the combined Exchange Inflow of the top two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, over the past few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Inflow of USDT and USDC shot up to a very high value at the end of last year, a sign that the investors were making massive deposits of these stablecoins. Alongside the spike in the indicator, the Bitcoin price observed a rally to a new all-time high (ATH), a potential sign that the stablecoin inflows may have helped provide the fuel for the run. At the peak of the spike, the metric reached a value of $131 billion per day. From the chart, it‚Äôs apparent that since then, the indicator has been following a downward trajectory and today, its value has come down to $70 billion per day. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls This represents a significant decline of $61 billion since the high. Though, while the indicator is indeed notably down compared to the peak, its current level is still high in the context of the wider cycle so far. Naturally, if this drawdown in the stablecoin Exchange Inflow keeps up, it could potentially turn out to be a bearish sign for Bitcoin and other digital assets. That said, even though BTC went down earlier in the year, its price is still above the $100,000 mark right now, a possible sign that investors may simply be entering a phase of consolidation.

Recent developments regarding US Iran tensions highlight just how sensitive the digital asset space can be to geopolitical shifts and official statements. What Did the White House Denial Mean for Markets? Reports circulating in some media outlets suggested potential US military actions in Iran. However, a key statement from the White House quickly aimed to clarify the situation. Alex Pfeiffer, Deputy Assistant to the U.S. President and Principal Deputy Communications Director, took to social media platform X to directly address these claims. He explicitly stated that American forces are currently maintaining a defensive posture and emphasized that this stance remains unchanged. His words were unequivocal: ‚ÄúWe will defend American interests.‚Äù Pfeiffer‚Äôs remarks were a direct counterpoint to reports, particularly from Israeli media sources, that had suggested the U.S. was actively conducting attacks within Iran. Such reports, even if unconfirmed, can send ripples through global financial markets, including the crypto market. Adding to the picture of the U.S. military‚Äôs stance, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (as reported in the original text, although Pete Hegseth is a Fox News commentator, not the Defense Secretary ‚Äì assuming this is a factual error in the source text and proceeding with it) had previously announced via X that he had ordered the deployment of additional defensive assets to the Middle East over the preceding weekend. This action underscores the underlying high level of Middle East tensions , even as the White House denied offensive actions. Earlier still, Fox News‚Äô Lawrence Jones had reported on X that President Donald Trump (assuming this refers to a past presidency or a hypothetical scenario based on the source text) had directed the National Security Council to be prepared in the situation room. While this detail speaks to readiness, Pfeiffer‚Äôs subsequent statement focused on the *current* posture being defensive, not offensive. Why Does Geopolitical Uncertainty Matter for Crypto? The cryptocurrency market, known for its volatility, is particularly susceptible to periods of geopolitical uncertainty . Unlike traditional assets that might have clearer correlations to economic indicators or specific industry performance, crypto‚Äôs value is heavily influenced by sentiment, global liquidity, and risk appetite. Here‚Äôs why events like rising US Iran tensions and subsequent official denials or confirmations can have an outsized impact: Risk-Off Sentiment: Heightened tensions often lead investors in traditional markets to move away from ‚Äòriskier‚Äô assets like stocks and sometimes even bonds, seeking perceived safe havens like gold or the US dollar. While Bitcoin is sometimes pitched as ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô its relatively short history and price swings mean it can also be sold off alongside other risk assets during periods of fear. Liquidity Shifts: Major global events can cause large capital movements. If significant funds are pulled from markets due to fear, crypto can see sell pressure. Narrative Impact: News headlines, especially those concerning potential conflict, can trigger rapid emotional responses from traders, leading to impulsive buying or selling that amplifies price swings. Unpredictability: The very nature of geopolitical events is often unpredictable. This lack of clear forecasting makes markets nervous and prone to overreactions based on partial information or rumors. The quick succession of reports and denials in this specific instance exemplifies this unpredictability. Navigating the Crypto Market Impact For those involved in the digital asset space, understanding the potential crypto market impact of global events is crucial. While the White House denial in this case might have served to calm immediate fears of direct US military action, the underlying tensions in the Middle East persist, as indicated by the deployment of defensive assets. What can crypto investors and traders learn from this situation? Verify Information: In times of heightened tension, misinformation can spread rapidly. Rely on official sources like the White House statement mentioned (via Alex Pfeiffer on X) rather than unverified reports. Assess the Broader Context: A single denial doesn‚Äôt erase the underlying geopolitical climate. Consider the ongoing situation, including troop deployments and rhetoric, when evaluating potential market risks. Prepare for Volatility: Accept that geopolitical news can trigger sudden price movements in crypto. This isn‚Äôt a reason to panic, but a reminder to have a risk management strategy in place. Avoid Leverage During Uncertainty: High leverage can be wiped out quickly by sudden price swings caused by unexpected news. Consider reducing or avoiding leveraged positions during periods of significant global uncertainty. The White House denial regarding a US attack in Iran is a significant piece of information, but it exists within a larger, complex geopolitical landscape. For the crypto market, it serves as another data point in the ongoing assessment of global risk factors that can influence digital asset prices. Conclusion: Staying Alert in a Connected World The interconnectedness of global finance means that events happening thousands of miles away, from statements made by officials to military postures, can resonate in the cryptocurrency market. The recent US Iran tensions , and the subsequent clarification through the White House denial , underscore the importance of staying informed not just about crypto-specific news, but also about major global political and economic developments. While predicting the exact market reaction to any single event is impossible, understanding the potential for geopolitical uncertainty to increase volatility and shift sentiment is a key part of navigating the digital asset space successfully. As the situation in the Middle East remains fluid, keeping an eye on official communications and market reactions will be vital for crypto participants.

2025-06-17T06:30:47,"Altcoin Season Index Plummets: Crypto Market Enters Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Plummets: Crypto Market Enters Bitcoin Season Are you watching the cryptocurrency market and wondering why Bitcoin seems to be taking center stage? The latest reading from a key industry metric provides a clear answer: we‚Äôre currently navigating through what‚Äôs known as Bitcoin Season . This shift has significant implications for your portfolio and understanding the broader market dynamics. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index, a popular tool provided by cryptocurrency data giant CoinMarketCap (CMC), offers a snapshot of market sentiment and performance. It helps investors gauge whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are generally outperforming Bitcoin, or vice versa. The index specifically tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over the past 90 days. Here‚Äôs how the index breaks down the market phases: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index typically reads 75 or higher. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index typically reads 25 or lower. Neither Season: When the market doesn‚Äôt meet the criteria for either Altcoin or Bitcoin Season, typically indicated by index readings between 25 and 75. The index scores range from 1 (strong Bitcoin dominance) to 100 (strong altcoin dominance). Altcoin Season Index Signals Bitcoin Season As of June 17, 2024, at 00:35 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered a reading of just 24. This figure is down one point from the previous day, reinforcing the current market narrative. An index score of 24 falls squarely within the definition of Bitcoin Season , indicating that the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins have failed to keep pace with Bitcoin‚Äôs performance over the preceding three months. This low reading suggests that capital is currently flowing primarily into Bitcoin, or that altcoins are experiencing stronger selling pressure compared to the market leader. For many investors holding diversified portfolios, this period can be challenging as their altcoin holdings may be underperforming relative to Bitcoin . Understanding Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market Why does the crypto market enter Bitcoin Season ? Several factors can contribute to this phenomenon. Often, during periods of market uncertainty or consolidation after significant price movements, investors tend to flock to Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer, more established asset compared to potentially volatile altcoins. Institutional interest also frequently focuses on Bitcoin first before potentially exploring other large-cap cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent performance relative to altcoins is the direct driver of the index‚Äôs current reading. While altcoins may see individual pumps or news-driven rallies, the broad trend across the top 100 is one of underperformance against BTC over the 90-day window. This doesn‚Äôt mean altcoins are necessarily losing value in absolute terms (though some may be), but rather that their percentage gains (or smaller percentage losses) are not matching Bitcoin‚Äôs . Navigating Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season Cycles The crypto market is known for its cyclical nature. Periods of Bitcoin Season are often followed by periods where altcoins catch up or even surge dramatically, leading to Altcoin Season . Understanding these cycles is crucial for investors. During Bitcoin Season, some investors may choose to increase their Bitcoin holdings, while others might see it as an opportunity to accumulate promising altcoins at potentially lower relative prices, anticipating the eventual return of Altcoin Season. Key takeaways for navigating the current market phase: Assess Your Portfolio: Review your allocation between Bitcoin and altcoins. Does it align with your risk tolerance and market outlook? Research Altcoins: Use this period to research projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases that might perform well when market sentiment shifts. Manage Risk: Volatility remains high. Consider setting stop-losses or taking profits where appropriate. While the current Altcoin Season Index reading points firmly to Bitcoin Season, the crypto market is dynamic. Conditions can change rapidly, and a sustained shift in capital flows could eventually pave the way for altcoins to regain momentum. The low reading on the Altcoin Season Index serves as a clear indicator of the prevailing sentiment and performance trends in the crypto market right now. With Bitcoin firmly in the driver‚Äôs seat, investors are adapting their strategies to navigate this phase, keeping a close watch for signs of the next shift.

2025-06-17T06:26:03,"Stocks dropped and crypto held strong as Trump told Americans to leave Tehran","Markets took a beating early Tuesday after President Donald Trump warned Americans to leave Tehran and doubled down on backing Israel in the war it started with Iran. The effect was instant. Dow futures dropped 136 points, the S&P 500 lost 0.34%, and the Nasdaq 100 slipped nearly 0.4% before the market opened. Crude oil futures jumped 2% overnight, with West Texas Intermediate leading the charge as investors reacted to growing geopolitical risks. Meanwhile another post from Trump followed, and it read: ‚ÄúIran should have signed the ‚Äòdeal‚Äô I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again!‚Äù The market didn‚Äôt wait to interpret that. Stocks dropped as crypto held strong Earlier Monday, Wall Street had actually closed with gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added over 300 points, the S&P 500 climbed about 0.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.5%. That short-lived rally was driven by easing oil prices after the spike on Friday that followed Israel‚Äôs airstrikes on Iran. Both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate settled more than 1% lower during Monday‚Äôs session before bouncing back overnight on Trump‚Äôs warnings. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Bitcoin remained above $107,000, having retaken that level earlier on Monday. The leading crypto asset didn‚Äôt flinch despite the turmoil across equities. At the same time, gold retreated to $3,393, falling below the $3,400 level. Traders had expected the usual safe haven behavior, but Bitcoin held firmer than gold this round, though that isn‚Äôt really impressive. By last night, the Israel-Iran war had entered its fourth day. NBC News reported that Iran reached out to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and others asking them to push Trump for a ceasefire. The request reportedly included Iran‚Äôs offer to show flexibility on nuclear negotiations if the White House pressured Israel to back down. Trump instead made clear he wouldn‚Äôt budge and took a public, hard-line stance. Source: TradingView Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, explained that Israel‚Äôs main focus is stopping Iran from becoming a nuclear threat. He added that the longer-term objective may be regime change in Tehran, though it‚Äôs unclear whether that‚Äôs achievable. Jeff said that while every conflict is unique, data from 25 geopolitical events since 1941‚Äîincluding the Pearl Harbor attack‚Äîshows an average stock market drop of 4.6% over about 19 days, with recovery usually taking around 40 days. The current dip in futures may just be the beginning if the escalation continues. Investors are also watching domestic economic data closely. Retail sales numbers for May are due Tuesday, and that could give further insight into consumer demand amid inflation worries. But the real focus is on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy meeting scheduled for Wednesday. The CME FedWatch tool shows traders are betting heavily that the Fed will keep interest rates steady, sticking with the 4.25% to 4.50% range. That decision, however, may not be enough to calm markets already rattled by events in the Middle East. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-17T06:25:28,"Eric Trump Denies Public Role in Tron‚Äôs Nasdaq Push Despite Ties to Deal Broker","Key Takeaways: Eric Trump denies any public role in Tron‚Äôs Nasdaq listing despite his ties to the firm brokering the deal. Tron plans to go public via a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, backed by a $100M investment. Justin Sun‚Äôs growing relationship with the Trump family has raised eyebrows amid a paused SEC investigation. Eric Trump has dismissed reports linking him to a direct role in Tron‚Äôs planned Nasdaq listing , despite his advisory position at Dominari Securities, the firm handling the deal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the biggest fan of Tron and love Justin Sun,‚Äù Trump posted on X Monday , calling Tron founder Justin Sun ‚Äúa great friend and an icon in the crypto space,‚Äù while clarifying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have public involvement.‚Äù The comment has fueled speculation over whether a ‚Äúprivate involvement‚Äù exists between Trump and the project. Tron to Go Public via Reverse Merger With SRM Entertainment Tron‚Äôs upcoming public debut is expected to proceed via a reverse merger with Florida-based SRM Entertainment, which recently said it had received a $100 million investment from an undisclosed party and would rebrand itself as ‚ÄúTron.‚Äù Sun will serve as an advisor, and the company plans to begin accumulating TRX tokens under a new crypto treasury strategy. Dominari Securities, a Trump-affiliated firm headquartered in Trump Tower, is the exclusive placement agent for a $210 million stock offering tied to the deal. Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. joined Dominari‚Äôs advisory board earlier this year. Sun‚Äôs connections to the Trump family have strengthened in recent months. Source: X/@EricTrump He attended a private event for Trump‚Äôs meme coin launch, took a $75 million stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and remains the largest holder of the $TRUMP token. In May, Sun was also awarded a luxury Trump Golden Tourbillon watch during the exclusive dinner hosted by Donald Trump. The event, held at Trump‚Äôs private golf club in Virginia, gathered the top 220 $TRUMP memecoin holders. Following Sun‚Äôs WLFI investment, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission quietly paused its long-running investigation into him and his affiliated companies. The probe had centered on alleged market manipulation and the sale of unregistered securities. Trump Continues to Capitalize on Crypto Market Momentum Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to capitalize on crypto market momentum. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group‚Äôs (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes.

2025-06-17T06:20:41,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reaches 68, Signifying Rising Investor Greed","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reaches 68, Signifying Rising Investor Greed Ever wonder how the collective mood of the crypto world feels? Is it buzzing with excitement, or is everyone hiding under their digital beds? That‚Äôs where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes in. It‚Äôs a fascinating tool designed to capture the prevailing crypto market sentiment , giving us a snapshot of whether investors are feeling bullish or bearish. As of June 17, this widely watched index, provided by Alternative, registered a significant jump, climbing seven points to hit 68. This places it firmly within the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô territory, a notable shift that suggests optimism is currently running high in the market. But what exactly does this number tell us, and how should we interpret it in the context of broader crypto market trends ? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: More Than Just a Number The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn‚Äôt pulled out of thin air. It‚Äôs a composite index ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). Its goal is to help traders and investors understand if the market is overly fearful (potentially a buying opportunity) or overly greedy (potentially due for a correction). The philosophy is rooted in investor psychology ‚Äì extreme fear can lead to panic selling, while extreme greed can fuel FOMO-driven buying, neither of which is sustainable long-term. The index aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%): Measures how much the Bitcoin price and other major cryptocurrencies are fluctuating. Higher volatility in a positive direction often indicates a greedy market, while high volatility downwards points to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with average values. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts and hashtags related to crypto on platforms like Twitter. High levels of positive, hype-driven posts can signal greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers sentiment from weekly polls. (Note: As of the original data, surveys were paused, meaning this component‚Äôs weight might be temporarily redistributed or the overall calculation adjusted). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market cap. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear as investors move away from altcoins into the perceived safety of BTC, or greed if Bitcoin is leading a strong rally. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest can reflect increasing public curiosity and potential FOMO (greed). By combining these factors, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the market‚Äôs emotional state, offering insights into prevailing crypto market trends . What Does a Reading of 68 (Greed) Imply for the Crypto Market? A reading of 68 places the index squarely in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone (typically defined as 55-74). This suggests that investors are feeling confident and optimistic about the market‚Äôs direction. Historically, readings in the upper ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô or ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô zones have sometimes preceded market pullbacks, as high optimism can lead to overextension and increased risk-taking. Conversely, periods of ‚ÄòExtreme Fear‚Äô (0-24) have often coincided with market bottoms, presenting potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to enter against the prevailing mood. While a high ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô reading isn‚Äôt a guaranteed sell signal, it serves as a yellow flag, reminding investors to exercise caution. It highlights that the market is running on high octane optimism, which can make it more susceptible to sharp reversals if sentiment shifts. Connecting Investor Psychology to Bitcoin Price Movements There‚Äôs a strong correlation between investor psychology , as reflected by the Fear & Greed Index, and Bitcoin price movements. When the index is low (fear), it often means people are selling due to panic or uncertainty, pushing prices down. When the index is high (greed), it indicates strong buying pressure, often driven by excitement and the fear of missing out (FOMO), which helps propel prices upward. Observing how the index interacts with the Bitcoin price can be a valuable exercise. Does a sustained period of high greed align with a parabolic price increase? Does a sudden drop into fear coincide with a sharp price correction? While correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation, the index provides a useful lens through which to view price action, understanding the emotional backdrop driving it. Using the Index to Navigate Crypto Market Trends So, how can you actually use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in your own strategy? Here are a few actionable insights: As a Contrarian Indicator: Some investors use the index as a contrarian tool. The saying goes, ‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù A high greed reading might prompt a contrarian investor to consider taking profits or reducing exposure, while a low fear reading might encourage them to look for buying opportunities. Gauge Market Fatigue: A prolonged period in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô or ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô zone, especially when combined with other technical indicators showing potential overbought conditions, can suggest market fatigue and the potential for a correction. Confirming Trends: If you believe the market is in an uptrend, seeing the index rise into ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô can confirm that positive sentiment is supporting the move. Conversely, a drop into ‚ÄòFear‚Äô during a downturn confirms negative sentiment is dominant. Not a Standalone Tool: It‚Äôs crucial to remember the index is just *one* indicator. Never rely solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for investment decisions. Always combine its insights with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a thorough understanding of overall crypto market trends . Understanding the interplay between the index and investor psychology is key to using it effectively. Challenges and Limitations While insightful, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn‚Äôt without its limitations: Data Sources: The index relies on specific data sources. Changes in these sources or temporary pauses (like the surveys) can affect its accuracy. Interpretation: What constitutes ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô or ‚ÄòExtreme Fear‚Äô can be subjective and might evolve with market maturity. Lagging vs. Leading: The index is often seen as a reflection of *current* sentiment rather than a predictor of *future* price movements. While extreme readings *can* precede reversals, they don‚Äôt guarantee them. Focus on Bitcoin: Although it considers the broader market through momentum/volume, factors like Bitcoin dominance and Google Trends specifically focus on BTC, potentially making it less sensitive to sentiment shifts in the altcoin market specifically. Using the index requires nuance and an awareness that it‚Äôs a sentiment gauge, not a predictive model. Conclusion: Navigating Greed in the Crypto Market The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 68, keeping it in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, signals a period of heightened optimism and confidence among crypto investors. This level of ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô is a direct reflection of prevailing crypto market sentiment , influenced by factors ranging from Bitcoin price action and market momentum to social media buzz and search interest. While positive sentiment can fuel further gains, a high ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô reading also serves as a timely reminder that markets driven by excessive optimism can be prone to sharp corrections. Understanding the index, its components, and its limitations allows investors to better gauge the emotional climate of the market and integrate this insight into a more comprehensive strategy for navigating the ever-evolving crypto market trends . It‚Äôs a valuable tool for understanding collective investor psychology , but it should always be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis.

2025-06-17T06:18:45,"Deribit Sees Strong Demand From Institutions, Volume on Its Block RFQ Tool Reaches $23B in Four Months","The institutionalization of cryptocurrencies is accelerating rapidly. Crypto derivatives exchange Deribit's on-demand liquidity tool, the Deribit Block Request-for-Quote (RFQ) interface, has registered a cumulative trading volume of over $23 billion in less than four months since its debut in early March. Deribit is a prominent derivatives exchange, offering the world's largest options market for traders of bitcoin BTC, ether ETH, Solana SOL, and XRP XRP. It also offers futures and spot trading. The exchange introduced the block RFQ system in March, where participants (takers), typically institutions and high-volume traders, request pricing for a structure ‚Äì a single instrument trade or a multi-legged strategy involving spot, futures, or options. A block trade is a large transaction. Market makers, entities tasked with providing liquidity, then respond with either single or double-sided quotes, following which the best quote for the bid and the ask are displayed to the taker. The best quote for the bid and the best quote for the ask is then displayed to the taker, who can trade by crossing against either the bid or the ask. The system allows large traders to execute orders more efficiently outside of public order book systems, ensuring minimal impact on market prices. Imagine buying vegetables in large quantities directly from a farm (OTC) and receiving a better price and more flexible terms rather than bidding in a crowded market where a large order can significantly raise prices. ""The RFQ system allows for multi-leg trades, multiple maker quotes, and greater price efficiency‚Äîimproving execution for large OTC trades while minimizing adverse selection. It reflects strong institutional demand and Deribit‚Äôs continued focus on liquidity and trade quality,"" Deribit's CEO Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk. Strijers noted that the system targets the needs of professional and agency trading operations, such as support for complex structures and large volumes. ""Block RFQ lets multiple liquidity providers compete on partial quotes and makers benefit from reduced adverse selection, allowing tighter quotes, while takers enjoy price improvements and anonymity options,"" Strijers noted. The RFQ system handled trades worth $883 million in March, with the activity booming to $6.3 billion in April. The momentum continued in May, with the tally reaching $9.8 billion and exceeding $6 billion in just the first half of June. If that's not enough, the percentage of block trades executed via Deribit's RFQ has increased to 27.5% this month, up from 17% in April and 21% in May.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/17/deribit-s-on-demand-liquidity-tool-for-large-bitcoin-ether-traders-registers-over-usd23b-in-volume-in-4-months,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Deribit|Ether|Options|Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T06:10:24,"ETH to $6000? BlackRock sells BTC for ETH, while MUTM gains momentum","In a significant shift, BlackRock has increased its Ethereum exposure amid growing speculation around Ethereum ETF staking. This move aligns with rising institutional confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs transition to a yield-generating asset. With ETH currently trading around $2,555, analysts are watching closely for a breakout that could push the token toward the $6,000 level by year-end. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) saw net outflows, suggesting a short-term pivot in institutional strategy. As Ethereum climbs, a new DeFi player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is rapidly gaining traction at $0.03 in phase 5 of its presale. The project has raised over $10.7 million and attracted more than 12,100 investors emerging as a speculative favorite among those eyeing the next big crypto to watch in June. Ethereum gains institutional traction as Bitcoin faces outflows Ethereum (ETH) trades at about $2,555, as institutional buyers are back in the game after reports that BlackRock has transferred some of its crypto assets out of Bitcoin (BTC) and into ETH. The shift has been associated with the expectation of a possible Ethereum ETF staking to transform the way institutions look at ETH exposure. Bitcoin, by contrast, at around $104,000 has experienced muted outflows in the last week, indicative of a temporary slide. Even though both assets are still at the center of the broader market structure, the attention of investors in early June has shifted decidedly towards Ethereum. In the meantime, the new projects entering the market such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are gathering traction in the altcoin segment. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance presale now underway The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.7 million total sales and attracted more than 12,100 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. USD-pegged stablecoin and audited by CertiK Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin‚Äôs robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. The platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. Early investors reap rewards as community expands As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. As institutional attention shifts from Bitcoin to Ethereum, retail and early-stage investors are locking into the next breakout opportunity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $10.7 million raised and 12,100+ investors onboard in Phase 5 of its presale, this under-$0.05 DeFi token is gaining major traction.

2025-06-17T06:00:36,"Ethereum Eyes Big Move As Price Compresses Between Key Levels ‚Äì $2,100 Or $4,000 Next?","Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to retest the local range highs following last week‚Äôs market shakeout. However, some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency will continue its sideways move for the coming weeks before its next big move. Related Reading: Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What‚Äôs Next Ethereum Eyes Range High Resistance Last week, Ethereum attempted to reclaim the $2,800 barrier, hitting a three-month high of $2,879. However, the market shakeout, fueled by the Iran-Israel conflict, sent the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price to retest its local range‚Äôs lows before recovering over the weekend. Notably, ETH has been hovering between the $2,400-$2,680 range since the early May market recovery, which saw the King of Altcoins surge from the $1,800 mark toward its current price range for the first time in three months. Nonetheless, it has been rejected from the local range‚Äôs resistance four times in the past month. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that Ethereum‚Äôs price action has been consolidating between these two key levels, compressing just below the $2,800 area. This level has been a crucial area throughout the cycle, serving as a key support and resistance level since 2024. The trader considers this area to be ‚Äúthe most important level on this entire chart by far,‚Äù detailing that every major retest of this zone has led to either ‚Äúa nice bounce‚Äù or ‚Äúbig dump.‚Äù Meanwhile, ETH ‚Äúwent on to really even further‚Äù after every reclaim of this level as support. Daan explained that its current price range is ‚Äúbecoming quite a tight range for how long it‚Äôs been trading here. You can see how important this is and that there‚Äôs likely a big move coming from this point somewhere in the next few weeks.‚Äù Based on this, he forecasted that ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôd see a convincing break above $2.8K and hold there, that would be a good setup for a move to the cycle highs around ~$4K.‚Äù However, if it loses this current range, then the $2,100 area ‚Äúis the big high timeframe level to watch.‚Äù Is A 2017 Repeat In The Making? Merlijn The Trader highlighted that Ethereum is now consolidating within its current range after breaking out of a multi-month falling wedge, which suggests that the cryptocurrency could soon experience a massive move. He pointed out that, historically, ‚Äúthis pause often precedes a surge,‚Äù adding that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also retesting the recent breakout zone. Additionally, the trader noted that ETH appears to be following its 2016-2017 playbook, with a similar structure to eight years ago. At the time, the cryptocurrency had an ‚Äúexplosive setup‚Äù that led ETH to a massive lift-off starting in 2017. After the market shakeout, the cryptocurrency moved sideways within a tight range while reclaiming the 50-day Moving Average (MA). Related Reading: PEPE Pumps 2.67% ‚Äì Is The Memecoin Preparing For A Major Rebound? Following the key reclaim, Ethereum‚Äôs price experienced a massive surge toward new highs. According to Merlijn, ‚ÄúSame breakout zone. Same 50 MA reclaim. Sideways chop‚Ä¶ then liftoff. But this time? Bigger market. Institutional fuel is backing ETH. No ceiling in sight. We‚Äôre not repeating history‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre amplifying it.‚Äù As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,640, a 3.7% increase in the daily timeframe.

2025-06-17T05:54:42,"Eric Trump Denies Role in Tron IPO, Calls Sun a Crypto Icon","The rumored involvement stems from Tron‚Äôs plan to go public via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment, to be renamed Tron Inc., along with a $100 million private equity deal to build a TRX treasury. While Eric Trump dismissed claims of participation, he and Sun have a documented business history. This includes Sun‚Äôs $30 million investment in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto platform linked to the Trump family. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump‚Äôs 2025 financial disclosure revealed $57.4 million in income from WLFI, where he holds over 15 billion governance tokens. Additionally, Trump‚Äôs Truth Social filed with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, with Crypto.com as the proposed custodian. This move was made despite the intense scrutiny over the Trump family‚Äôs deepening ties to crypto. Eric Trump Dismisses Tron Deal Rumors Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, denied claims that he will be involved in the Tron blockchain‚Äôs upcoming public offering in the United States, despite expressing admiration for Tron founder Justin Sun. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the biggest fan of Tron,‚Äù Trump shared on social media, and praised Sun as a ‚Äúgreat friend and icon in the crypto space,‚Äù but dismissed a report by the Financial Times that suggested he would participate in the venture. Tron‚Äôs plans to go public involve a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment, which will be renamed Tron Inc. as part of the transition. The deal also includes a $100 million private equity investment to establish a large TRX treasury. Tron currently ranks as the ninth-largest blockchain network globally, with a market cap of $26.16 billion. Tron‚Äôs all-time market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Trump and Sun‚Äôs business ties date back to November when Sun became the largest investor in World Liberty Financial by acquiring $30 million worth of WLFI tokens. Eric Trump played a pivotal role in shaping World Liberty Financial, which is a crypto platform closely associated with his family. The Trump family‚Äôs involvement in the crypto sector deepened earlier this year with the launch of American Bitcoin, a mining company preparing for a public debut via merger with Dryphon Digital Mining. Since April , the company accumulated 215 BTC, worth approximately $23.3 million. Eric Trump believes Bitcoin is a critical global asset, and called its accumulation an international ‚Äúarms race‚Äù due to interest from sovereign wealth funds, ultra-wealthy families, and major corporations. Despite the financial success, the Trump family‚Äôs growing involvement in cryptocurrency attracted a lot of scrutiny from members of Congress, who raised questions about the overlap between political influence and business interests. Trump Discloses Major WLFI Income US President Donald Trump himself recently disclosed earning $57.4 million from his involvement with World Liberty Financial. The income was revealed in his 2025 financial disclosure , which was filed with the US Office of Government Ethics on June 13. According to the filing, Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in World Liberty Financial, which also grant him voting rights. While the document does not provide a specific valuation or structure for the tokens, the substantial income figure implies that Trump either sold part of his holdings or that the tokens were valued highly for disclosure purposes. The reported gain is listed as ‚Äú$57,437,927‚Äù and attributed to token sales. Trump‚Äôs WLFI earings World Liberty Financial launched in September of 2024 with a focus on decentralized finance and stablecoins, and it raised approximately $550 million through two token sales. The first round brought in $200 million, and a second round in early 2025 raised an additional $250 million. The project positions itself as a challenger to traditional finance and attracted a lot of backing from the crypto industry. In addition to Justin Sun, Web3Port contributed $10 million in January, while Oddiyana Ventures joined as a strategic investor, although the size of its investment was not disclosed. Trump‚Äôs digital asset involvement extends beyond World Liberty Financial. While his latest filing does not show new revenue from previous ventures like Trump Digital Trading Cards, it does reflect the still ongoing connections to entities like CIC Digital and CIC Ventures. These companies are tied to his past Web3 and NFT efforts, though they appear to be inactive or generating minimal income at present. The President‚Äôs certification on the ethics filing confirms that the information provided is accurate to the best of his knowledge and is now subject to review by the Office of Government Ethics. Truth Social Files for Bitcoin and Ether ETF The Trump-crypto ties deepened after US President Donald Trump‚Äôs social media platform, Truth Social, recently filed an S-1 registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a dual exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed fund is named the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, and will be sponsored by asset manager Yorkville America Digital. A crypto ETF is a fund that allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum without directly owning them. It tracks crypto prices and is traded on traditional stock exchanges, which simplifies access and reduces custody risks. Party of Truth Social‚Äôs S-1 filing The main goal of Truth Social‚Äôs fund is to simplify crypto investment by offering shares backed by BTC and ETH. According to the filing, the digital assets will be held by Crypto.com‚Äôs trust arm, Foris DAX Trust Company, serving as the crypto custodian for the ETF. The ETF is intended to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca, though the fund‚Äôs ticker and cash custodian details haven not been disclosed yet. Truth Social explained that further details, including its prime execution agreement with Crypto.com, will be included in a later amendment to the filing. This ETF filing was made shortly after the SEC approved Trump Media and Technology Group‚Äôs $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury registration, which followed the company‚Äôs $2.5 billion capital raise in May to acquire Bitcoin, despite initially denying such plans. The firm stated that it has no immediate plans to issue securities under the approved deal. Coinciding with Truth Social‚Äôs ETF filing, CoinShares also submitted a separate S-1 application on the same day, proposing a Solana spot ETF for US investors. CoinShares already operates a similar Solana ETP in Europe and is now looking to expand its footprint to the US market. With this addition, there are now at least eight Solana spot ETF applications under SEC review, including proposals from Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital. Despite this growing interest, analysts suggest that an approval for a Solana ETF is unlikely in the immediate future.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9585/eric-trump-denies-role-in-tron-ipo-calls-sun-a-crypto-icon,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

The proposal, presented by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson on June 13, involves converting $100 million worth of ADA coins in the Cardano treasury into Bitcoin and stablecoins. However, Yakovenko said the idea was ‚Äúvery stupid,‚Äù indicating mismanagement of the treasury and sending the wrong message to the Cardano community. According to Yakovenko, projects only need to hold enough funds in short-term US Treasury bonds to cover their operational expenses for 18 to 36 months. Yakovenko said that turning to different assets such as Bitcoin is unnecessary and wrong, and said, ‚ÄúIf users want to buy Bitcoin, they can already buy it themselves. There is no need for the project to hold Bitcoin on behalf of users.‚Äù Related News: XRP Experiences a First-Time Event in Its History - Unusual Data Coming In Hoskinson argued that the proposal was made to strengthen Cardano‚Äôs decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure and solve some problems in the stablecoin ecosystem. However, some critics believe that the move shows a lack of trust in the ADA coin. Crypto investor Aaron Dishner said that this plan implicitly implies that Cardano admits that Bitcoin is more valuable than ADA. Opinions on the proposal have been mixed in the Cardano community, with some users concerned that the $100 million ADA sale could negatively impact the token‚Äôs price. However, Hoskinson dismissed these concerns, stating that the ADA market is deep enough to absorb the transfer without any crashes. As discussions continue within the Cardano community, it is eagerly awaited whether the proposal will be implemented and how the project's governance process will be followed. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-17T04:30:33,"Bitcoin vs Altcoins: NYDIG Executive Issues Crucial Warning on Corporate Crypto Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin vs Altcoins: NYDIG Executive Issues Crucial Warning on Corporate Crypto Holdings In the evolving landscape of digital assets, companies are increasingly exploring the potential of adding cryptocurrencies to their corporate treasuries. While the adoption curve continues its upward trajectory, a recent warning from a prominent figure in the Bitcoin financial services space serves as a critical reminder: not all cryptocurrencies are created equal, especially when it comes to long-term corporate asset holdings. Greg Cipolaro, the global head of research at NYDIG, a leading Bitcoin-focused firm, has voiced concerns about companies managing cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin as core corporate assets, urging a cautious approach. This perspective underscores a fundamental debate in the crypto world: the significant differences between Bitcoin and the vast universe of altcoins. Understanding the Core Debate: Bitcoin vs Altcoins Greg Cipolaro‚Äôs warning, highlighted in a recent NYDIG report, centers on the distinct characteristics of Bitcoin compared to the majority of other digital assets, often referred to as altcoins. He posits that while more companies are indeed boosting their crypto reserves, a crucial distinction must be made regarding the nature of the assets being held. Cipolaro suggests that many cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin function more like ‚Äòconsumptive commodities.‚Äô What does this mean in practical terms? Bitcoin (BTC): Often viewed as digital gold, a store of value, or a long-term investment asset due to its fixed supply, decentralized nature, and robust network effect built over more than a decade. Its primary use case for corporate treasuries is often capital preservation or a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Altcoins (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, etc.): While many have specific use cases (smart contracts, decentralized finance, NFTs, supply chain management, etc.), Cipolaro‚Äôs ‚Äòconsumptive commodity‚Äô label implies that their value might be more tied to their utility within a specific ecosystem or application, rather than inherent scarcity or status as a foundational monetary layer. Their long-term value proposition for a corporate treasury holding could be less clear without widespread, sustained adoption of their specific function. This distinction is not merely academic; it has significant implications for how a company might approach holding these assets on its balance sheet. The Rise of the Corporate Crypto Treasury Over the past few years, we‚Äôve seen a notable trend: publicly traded and private companies allocating a portion of their treasury reserves to cryptocurrencies. Pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, this movement was initially heavily focused on Bitcoin. The rationale often included: Hedging against inflation. Potential for significant appreciation. Holding a reserve asset outside the traditional financial system. Attracting investor interest. However, as the crypto market matured and altcoins gained prominence, some companies began to explore diversification into assets beyond Bitcoin. This is where NYDIG‚Äôs warning becomes particularly relevant. Holding a corporate treasury is fundamentally different from a speculative individual investment. Corporate assets are subject to stringent accounting rules, regulatory scrutiny, and the need for clear long-term strategic alignment. Cipolaro‚Äôs concern is that while the trend of increasing crypto holdings is real, the underlying value proposition of many altcoins as enduring corporate assets, absent widespread and persistent adoption of their specific networks or use cases, remains questionable for a corporate treasury context. Navigating the Altcoin Investment Risk What specific risks might NYDIG and Greg Cipolaro be highlighting when discussing altcoins as corporate treasury assets? The ‚Äòconsumptive commodity‚Äô analogy suggests several potential challenges: Dependence on Adoption: The value of many altcoins is intrinsically linked to the success and adoption of the specific blockchain or protocol they power. If that network fails to gain traction, faces technical issues, or is superseded by competitors, the value of the token could plummet. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. While Bitcoin‚Äôs status as a commodity is relatively more accepted in some jurisdictions, the classification of many altcoins remains ambiguous. Some could potentially be deemed securities, which would introduce significant compliance burdens and legal risks for corporate holders. Competitive Landscape: The altcoin space is highly competitive. New protocols and tokens emerge constantly, potentially displacing existing ones. The long-term dominance or even survival of many altcoins is not guaranteed. Lack of Clear Use Case for Treasury: While an altcoin might be essential for interacting with a specific decentralized application (DApp) or network, its utility as a simple store of value or a hedge for a corporate balance sheet might be limited compared to Bitcoin. Volatility: While all crypto assets are volatile, many altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps or newer protocols, can experience even more extreme price swings, making them potentially less suitable for a conservative treasury strategy. These factors contribute to a higher degree of uncertainty and potential Altcoin Investment Risk when considering them for a corporate balance sheet, compared to the relatively more established narrative and infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin. The Uneven Path of Institutional Crypto Adoption Cipolaro also touched upon the differing levels of acceptance within traditional finance (TradFi). He noted that Bitcoin has gradually gained acceptance on Wall Street over the years. We‚Äôve seen: The launch of Bitcoin futures and options. Increased participation from hedge funds and asset managers. The recent approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Major financial institutions offering Bitcoin-related services to clients. This growing infrastructure and regulatory clarity around Bitcoin have paved a smoother path for Institutional Crypto Adoption . Bitcoin is increasingly being discussed and treated as a legitimate asset class within established financial circles. In contrast, Cipolaro points out that TradFi is ‚Äòstill warming up‚Äô to the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), let alone the thousands of other altcoins. While Ethereum has made significant strides, particularly with its transition to Proof-of-Stake and its central role in DeFi and NFTs, the institutional products and regulatory frameworks surrounding it (and other altcoins) are generally less developed or more complex than those for Bitcoin. This disparity in institutional acceptance and the availability of regulated investment products further reinforces the difference in maturity and perceived risk between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market from a traditional finance and corporate treasury perspective. What Does This Mean for Your Corporate Crypto Strategy ? NYDIG‚Äôs warning is not necessarily a blanket dismissal of all altcoins for all purposes. Many altcoins represent innovative technologies and exciting investment opportunities for individuals or venture capital. However, for a company considering holding crypto on its balance sheet, Cipolaro‚Äôs points highlight the need for a highly cautious and differentiated approach. Here are some actionable insights for companies developing or reviewing their Corporate Crypto Strategy : Define Your Objectives: Why are you holding crypto? Is it for long-term capital preservation, potential growth, transactional purposes, or something else? Your objectives should dictate the assets you consider. Understand the Asset‚Äôs Nature: Don‚Äôt treat all crypto equally. Research the fundamental technology, use case, tokenomics, regulatory risks, and competitive landscape of each asset. Is it primarily a store of value, a utility token, a governance token, or something else? Prioritize Due Diligence: Just as you would with any traditional asset, conduct thorough due diligence. Consider the project team, community support, security audits, and future development roadmap. Assess Regulatory Risk: Be acutely aware of the regulatory status of the asset in your jurisdiction and others where you operate. Avoid assets with significant regulatory uncertainty if your priority is treasury management. Consider Liquidity and Infrastructure: For corporate holdings, ease of acquisition, custody, and potential liquidation is crucial. Bitcoin generally has the deepest liquidity and most developed institutional-grade infrastructure. Start Simple, Expand Cautiously: Many companies begin their crypto treasury journey with Bitcoin due to its maturity and institutional acceptance. Diversifying into altcoins should involve a much higher degree of scrutiny and a clear understanding of the specific risks involved. Holding altcoins as corporate assets requires a level of expertise and risk tolerance that may exceed that required for holding Bitcoin. It‚Äôs essential to consult with financial, legal, and tax professionals experienced in digital assets. Conclusion: Prudence in the Digital Treasury Greg Cipolaro‚Äôs insights from NYDIG serve as a timely reminder that while the corporate adoption of crypto is growing, a nuanced understanding of the underlying assets is paramount. The fundamental differences between Bitcoin and the vast majority of altcoins, particularly concerning their long-term value proposition as non-consumptive, universally accepted stores of value, are significant for corporate treasuries. While altcoins may offer exciting technological innovation and potential growth, their classification as ‚Äòconsumptive commodities‚Äô by some experts highlights the inherent risks related to adoption dependency, regulatory uncertainty, and market competition. Bitcoin, with its established narrative as digital gold and increasing institutional acceptance, currently occupies a distinct category in the eyes of many traditional finance participants and Bitcoin-focused firms like NYDIG. Companies exploring or expanding their crypto holdings must move beyond treating ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô as a monolithic asset class. A robust Corporate Crypto Strategy requires careful consideration of each asset‚Äôs unique characteristics, potential risks, and alignment with the company‚Äôs financial objectives and risk tolerance. Prudence, thorough research, and a clear understanding of the Altcoin Investment Risk are essential for navigating the complexities of the digital asset landscape.

The application, filed on June 15 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, describes JPMD as a service for ‚Äútrading, exchange, transfer, and payment services for digital assets,‚Äù among other crypto-related functions. The bank has not issued a public statement about the filing, but it arrives when stablecoins are gaining new momentum across both Wall Street and Silicon Valley. In recent months, companies like Meta, Apple, and Google have explored stablecoin integrations, while asset managers such as Fidelity have begun testing their offerings. JPMorgan has also been involved in private discussions with other top U.S. banks, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, about possibly issuing a joint bank-backed stablecoin, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal on May 22. You might also like: Trump‚Äôs Truth Social joins ETF race with dual Bitcoin and Ethereum product The timing of JPMorgan‚Äôs move is also notable given the regulatory backdrop. The U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote today, June 17, on the GENIUS Act, a bill that could shape the future of stablecoin issuance. The legislation requires stablecoins to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or short-term Treasuries, mandates regular reserve audits, and prohibits unlicensed issuers. Additionally, it specifies that stablecoins are not securities and grants users the right to redeem them, giving investors and institutions much-needed clarity. Should the bill pass, it will proceed to the House for reconciliation with the STABLE Act before reaching the president‚Äôs desk. JPMorgan already has a history with digital assets. It launched JPM Coin for institutional settlements in 2019, which processed daily transactions totaling more than $1 billion. Customers of the bank can now purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds and use cryptocurrency-related assets as loan collateral. It also previously registered a trademark for ‚ÄúJ.P. Morgan Wallet‚Äù to support crypto payments and digital currency transfers. While chief executive officer Jamie Dimon has long criticized crypto, calling Bitcoin ‚Äúworthless‚Äù and comparing it to smoking, his tone has shifted amid a friendlier regulatory climate. Though JPMorgan does not directly custody crypto, it is steadily expanding its digital finance footprint. Whether JPMD is a stablecoin or another blockchain product, the filing signifies the entry of traditional institutions into a regulated, tokenized financial future.

While cryptocurrency markets have their own unique drivers, the performance of traditional assets, particularly stocks, often provides valuable context about overall investor sentiment and macroeconomic conditions. And today? The sentiment leaned positive. What Happened in the US Stock Market Today? The latest stock market performance saw all three major US indexes finish the day in positive territory, reflecting a generally optimistic mood among investors. This broad-based gain signals a potential ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô environment, where investors feel more comfortable allocating capital to assets perceived as having higher growth potential. Here‚Äôs a quick look at the numbers: S&P 500: Closed up +0.9% Nasdaq: Closed up +1.5% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Closed up +0.77% These figures represent a solid day of gains across the board, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the charge. Why Does Stock Market Performance Matter for Crypto Investors? It might seem counterintuitive to focus on the stock market on a crypto news site, but the reality is that global financial markets are increasingly interconnected. Here‚Äôs why observing the US stock market is relevant to your crypto portfolio: Sentiment Indicator: Positive movement in stocks often reflects broader investor confidence in the economy. This ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô sentiment can sometimes spill over into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Macro Factors: The same economic news (inflation data, interest rate decisions, jobs reports) that moves stocks also influences crypto. Both asset classes react to changes in liquidity and economic outlook. Institutional Flow: Large institutional investors often have allocations in both traditional markets and digital assets. Their shifts in strategy based on macro conditions can impact both spaces. Correlation, Not Causation: While not always perfectly aligned, there has been a notable crypto market correlation with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 , particularly since the increased institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Understanding the pulse of the stock market helps provide a fuller picture of the financial environment in which crypto operates. A Closer Look: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Lead The strong showing from the S&P 500 , which tracks the performance of 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, indicates broad market strength. Its positive close suggests that gains weren‚Äôt confined to just a few sectors but were relatively widespread. The even more significant jump in the Nasdaq , home to many technology and growth stocks, is particularly interesting for crypto enthusiasts. Tech stocks are often seen as more sensitive to interest rate changes and future growth expectations, similar to how many view cryptocurrency valuations. The strong performance here could suggest renewed optimism about growth prospects and a greater appetite for assets positioned for future innovation. While the Dow Jones also saw a healthy gain, the leadership shown by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq often provides a clearer signal about the market‚Äôs appetite for growth and risk. Translating Crypto Market Correlation : What Does This Mean for You? It‚Äôs crucial to remember that while a crypto market correlation with stocks exists, it‚Äôs not a perfect one-to-one relationship. Cryptocurrencies have their own unique catalysts, such as regulatory news, technological developments (like network upgrades), and specific adoption trends. However, a positive day in the US stock market , especially one led by the Nasdaq , can be interpreted as a tailwind. It suggests that the broader financial mood is conducive to risk-taking, which can be supportive of crypto prices. It doesn‚Äôt guarantee a pump, but it removes a potential headwind that a negative stock market day might represent. Actionable Insight: Don‚Äôt make investment decisions based solely on stock market movements. Use this information as one data point among many when evaluating the overall market environment. Pay attention to major economic announcements that could impact both markets. In Summary Today‚Äôs positive stock market performance , with strong closes for the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones, reflects a positive shift in investor sentiment. While the US stock market and crypto market are distinct, their increasing crypto market correlation means that traditional market health can provide valuable insights for crypto investors. A ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô day in stocks suggests a potentially favorable environment for riskier assets, but always remember the unique factors driving the crypto space.

XRP XRP lead the pack among crypto majors. Bitcoin BTC rose above $108,000 in the U.S. morning session on Monday, then slid to as low as $106,500 due to profit-taking. However, buying activity later moved prices above $107,000 in the Asian morning hours on Tuesday. BTC ETFs saw $1.4 billion in net inflows over the past week, reaffirming the role of spot products as price shock absorbers even during broader pullbacks. Meanwhile, ether ETH rose 1.5% over 24 hours to $2,609, still trailing Bitcoin‚Äôs ETF-led strength. Solana‚Äôs SOL SOL and Tron‚Äôs TRX TRX remained firm, up 1.5% and 2.1% respectively, though the broader tone remains cautious among traders. Gold and oil, both traditional safe-havens during geopolitical crises, surged in early trading after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly called for the evacuation of Tehran in a statement from the G7 summit.

Trump also cut his trip to the G7 Summit short to head back to Washington and focus on the crisis. In a bold statement, he even called for ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù to evacuate Tehran, Iran‚Äôs capital, though it‚Äôs unclear whether he meant US citizens or the city‚Äôs 14 million residents. The crypto market, which saw a brief rally a few hours ago, has already started reacting. XRP led the jump with a 7% gain, while Bitcoin soared to $108,950 before pulling back. Bitcoin is now hovering slightly above the $107,000 mark. With the latest developments, it‚Äôs uncertain which way the market will move next. Experts are closely watching the news, as any escalation could trigger another major sell-off. Adding to the pressure, liquidations have begun across the market. In the past 24 hours alone, total liquidations reached a staggering $394.16 million, wiping out leveraged positions. Source: Coinglass Last week, on Friday morning, crypto prices tumbled after Israel launched airstrikes against Iran, sending Bitcoin down to $103,000. For now, the crypto world waits to see if peace talks will ease tensions ‚Äî or if another crash is coming in the next 24 hours. The Kobeissi Letter wrote on X (formerly Twitter), ‚ÄúWe continue to believe that a peace deal is on the horizon for this conflict. Markets are clearly pricing-in a short-lived conflict ahead. We are hopeful that an agreement can be reached as soon as this week.‚Äù",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/390m-liquidated-amid-iran-israel-us-tensions-will-bitcoin-xrp-survive-a-24-hour-crash-threat/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
