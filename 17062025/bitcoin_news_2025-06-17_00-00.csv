2025-06-16T21:43:20,"Trump’s Truth Social Wants to Launch a Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF – Here’s What That Could Mean","Key Takeaways: Trump Media & Technology Group has filed to launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, with Crypto.com as custodian and Yorkville America Digital as sponsor. The ETF will allocate 75% to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum, pending SEC approval. The Trump Organization announced a $499 smartphone and mobile service under the “Trump Mobile” brand. The phone will be made in the U.S. and will include bundled services like telemedicine and global texting. Trump Media & Technology Group, the operator behind Truth Social and Truth+, has filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a new Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF . According to the company’s June 16 announcement , the ETF will directly hold both Bitcoin and Ethereum, allocating 75% of its assets to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum. ETF to Hold Bitcoin and Ether in Direct Custody The new digital asset investment product, once approved, will be listed on NYSE Arca. Crypto.com has been named as the sole custodian and prime execution agent. It will also provide staking and liquidity services. The ETF’s launch is subject to the SEC’s clearance of the Form S-1 registration and a separate Form 19b-4. Yorkville America Digital will also act as the ETF’s sponsor. While no launch date has been confirmed, the decision to work with established infrastructure providers like Crypto.com may help the product withstand regulatory scrutiny. If approved, the ETF could add a new dimension to the political and financial profile of the Trump Media brand. $499 Trump-Branded Smartphone Set for September Launch The Trump Organization introduced a new mobile service and smartphone today under the brand “Trump Mobile,” marking the latest in a series of consumer-facing ventures targeting conservative audiences. Announced during a media event at Trump Tower, the $499 device will be available starting in September, alongside a monthly service plan priced at $47.45 as a reference to Trump’s current role as the 47th U.S. president. BREAKING: The Trump Organization announced Trump Mobile, which will offer 5G service starting at $47.45 through the 3 major carriers and will be releasing a phone in August called the “T1 Phone.” The phone is described as “a sleek, gold smartphone engineered for performance and… pic.twitter.com/jhtXRLveJZ — RedWave Press (@RedWave_Press) June 16, 2025 The company stated that the phones will be manufactured in the U.S. and supported by domestic call centers. Donald Trump Jr. said the offering will include bundled services such as telemedicine, international texting, and roadside assistance. “We are going to be introducing an entire package of products where people can come and they can get telemedicine on their phones for one flat monthly fee, roadside assistance on their cars, unlimited texting to 100 countries around the world,” he said at the event. The phone and network are operated under a trademark licensing agreement, with the Trump Organization not directly involved in hardware design or telecom infrastructure. DTTM Operations, which manages Trump’s intellectual property, has filed trademark applications for telecom services and accessories. Trump-linked ventures are expanding into sectors with high consumer turnover, including mobile devices and digital asset products. The latest filings and launches show a coordinated push to establish diversified commercial footprints in retail finance and telecom under a unified brand identity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could the SEC’s ongoing scrutiny of crypto products affect the ETF’s approval? Although multiple spot crypto ETFs have been approved in 2024 and 2025, each filing is reviewed individually. Political affiliations or branding have no formal bearing, but high visibility may invite added regulatory attention. What role does Crypto.com play beyond custody? Crypto.com will also act as a staking provider and execution agent. This means it will handle trade execution and potentially generate yield on the Ethereum portion of the holdings through staking services. Could regulatory scrutiny increase due to the Trump brand’s involvement? Political affiliations can intensify attention from both regulators and advocacy groups, particularly if the product garners outsized media visibility or operates in sensitive sectors like finance or telecommunications.

2025-06-16T21:30:15,"JPMorgan has filed a crypto-related trademark application for “JPMD""","According to multiple reports, JPMorgan Chase, the world’s largest bank by assets, has filed a trademark for “JPMD.” The document identifies JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the owner and cites the bank’s Columbus, Ohio, address. There is speculation that the filing is for a new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, potentially named “JPMorgan Dollar” because the trademark application covers trading, exchange, transfer, and payment services tied to virtual currency, digital tokens, and blockchain-enabled money. Excerpts from JPMorgan Chase’s reported trademark filing for a potential “JPMD” stablecoin. Source: @tier10k Banks want to compete with crypto-native stablecoin issuers Stablecoin issuers like Tether have grown in influence and popularity in recent months as the world has woken up to the potential of stablecoins. Where they are concerned, issuers act like traditional banks, effectively taking their place. However, the banks are not going out without a fight. In May, reports claimed that JPMorgan , Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo were discussing a joint stablecoin initiative. Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian confirmed the talks, indicating that discussions have advanced beyond early speculation. The reports highlighted the desire of these banks to compete directly with crypto-native issuers as they view dollar-backed tokens as a strategic tool for providing instant liquidity and hedging market volatility. JPMorgan accepts spot Bitcoin ETFs as collateral for loans The trademark application comes after JPMorgan started accepting spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as loan collateral. According to June 4 reports, the program will begin with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and expand to include trading and wealth-management clients. The bank has also decided to include digital asset holdings when calculating a client’s net worth, treating them alongside equities, vehicles, and fine art during credit reviews. The Bitcoin collateral program and the “JPMD” filing are signs that the nation’s largest bank is thawing towards crypto, and while the bank is yet to announce a consumer-facing token, the trademark language mirrors the functions of a dollar-backed stablecoin . Working together, large banks in the U.S. could come to control issuance and settlement while applying the compliance standards that already exist in traditional finance. The JPMorgan filing and the multibank talks are proof that large financial institutions will continue to integrate digital assets into their core lending and payment operations. It is an innovative move, but some users on X have tagged it as an attempt to remain relevant in the shifting landscape of the financial world. The trademark filing is recent, and details remain speculative. However, one thing is certain; regulatory developments and market demand will most likely have much to do with shaping JPMD’s trajectory.

QCP Capital reported muted volatility and strong ETF inflows, suggesting no broad risk-off shift. Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson proposed using $100 million in treasury funds to purchase BTC and stablecoins. Bitcoin recovered after briefly dropping on Friday following Israel’s attack on Iran, trading from a low of $102,800 back to $107,700 on Monday . A report by QCP Capital published on June 16 noted that the pullback was limited in scope, and the asset held above the $100,000 threshold. It compared the reaction to a sharper drop in April 2024, when a similar situation triggered a decline of over 8 percent. Asia Colour – 16 June 25 1/ $BTC has held up impressively despite rising Middle East tensions. After dipping to 102.8k on Friday following Iran-Israel headlines, it has since recovered to 107k, mirroring rebounds in US equity futures and large-cap tokens. — QCP (@QCPgroup) June 16, 2025 Bitcoin Market Remains Composed Institutional flows remained steady during the episode. Spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to log weekly inflows, and entities such as Metaplanet and Strategy were reported to have added to their holdings over the weekend. QCP said implied volatility in the Bitcoin options markets remained muted, with front-end levels staying under 40. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index also remained near 20, indicating no broad shift into defensive positioning across risk assets. Traders cited stable activity in U.S. Treasuries and Asian government bonds as evidence that risk-off sentiment had not fully set in. While the risk of escalation remains, the report said current price behavior indicates the asset’s evolving response to geopolitical shocks. It noted that the price remains less than 6 percent below its all-time high. Some market participants believe continued global uncertainty could sustain demand for Bitcoin in the medium term, particularly amid concern over sovereign debt exposure and currency risk. Cardano Considers Treasury Shift Toward BTC and Stablecoins Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently proposed converting $100 million worth of ADA from the protocol’s treasury into a mix of stablecoins and Bitcoin. The plan outlines the use of Bitcoin to support emerging BTC-DeFi applications developed on Cardano sidechains and partner networks. Hoskinson said the funds could be deployed gradually using over-the-counter (OTC) and time-weighted execution strategies to avoid disrupting ADA’s market price. He stated that Cardano’s liquidity is sufficient to absorb the reallocation without causing volatility. Hoskinson added that upcoming features like native token support and partner chains require treasury mechanisms that go beyond single-asset reserves. A formal proposal is expected ahead of the Rare Evo conference later this year. Bitcoin is being used in more treasury and liquidity strategies across both centralized and decentralized systems. Some DeFi protocols have started allocating to BTC to counter the effects of native token dilution or to back multi-asset reserves. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does low implied volatility in options markets affect Bitcoin’s price behavior? Low implied volatility typically indicates reduced expectations of sudden price swings, suggesting that traders do not foresee sharp reactions to ongoing geopolitical risks. Why are some DeFi protocols introducing BTC into their treasuries? Incorporating BTC can provide a more stable reserve asset, diversify treasury holdings, and help offset inflationary pressure from excessive native token issuance. What role do governance upgrades play in treasury diversification efforts? New governance models, including elected boards and portfolio mandates, help protocols manage multi-asset reserves transparently and reduce concentration risk in single tokens.

2025-06-16T21:15:58,"Trump Media Plans to Debut a Dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF","Trump Media & Technology Group has submitted its filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This comes off as a bold step from the firm, but as Bryan Armour, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, has stated, this path may be rough. Here Comes Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF In a new filing submitted to the US SEC on Monday, Trump Media noted its partnership with Yorkville America Digital, stating its intention to launch a joint Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. This proposed fund is to be launched under the Truth Social name. Crypto.com will act as a custodian, execution agent, and liquidity provider. According to the plan, the fund’s holdings ratio for Bitcoin and Ethereum will be 75% and 25%, respectively. Like several other applicants, Truth Media still has to wait for the Commission to decide on its filing. Once the green light is issued, the shares will be listed on NYSE Arca, the company wrote in its statement. Trump Media Files to Launch Truth Social Bitcoin ETF Explicitly, this is not the first deal between Trump Media and Yorkville America. For perspective, the latter was the sponsor for the standalone Bitcoin ETF application that Trump Media made about two weeks ago. This was after the Trump-related firm announced that it had raised nearly $2.5 billion from about 50 institutional investors in a private placement deal. Hence, the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF is the second crypto ETF filing from the social media company in less than two weeks. The individual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF market is already saturated, even though the US niche is barely a year old. Therefore, Trump Media’s fund may have to strive to secure a reasonable market share when approved. BlackRock IBIT Leads Crypto ETF Flows The top asset management firm BlackRock, controls much of the crypto ETF market share. For almost every inflow, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to lead this rise . Beyond crypto funds, it has secured a position amongst the top five ETFs in the United States, surpassing even SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). Its Ethereum ETF is also performing well in the market, even with the fluctuations that ETH has been experiencing recently.

2025-06-16T21:00:34,"Analyst Predicts Last Bitcoin Bull Market, Says Price Is Headed For $30,000","A prominent crypto analyst has ignited debate across the digital asset community with a bold macro prediction for the Bitcoin bull market . According to the expert, Bitcoin’s current rally may be the final phase of its first true institutional cycle—and the aftermath could send prices crashing to as low as $30,000. Bitcoin Bull Market Enters Final Stage A crypto analyst, identified as ‘MrParaBULLic’ on X (formerly Twitter), has issued a stark warning that the current Bitcoin bull market could be in the last stages of crypto’s first macro cycle. Despite trading around $106,616 at press time, the analyst expects BTC to top out soon, followed by a potentially devastating bear market that could push prices down to $34,932. Using the Elliott Wave theory , the analyst presented a chart, suggesting that Bitcoin is completing its fifth and final microwave in a classic five-wave impulse cycle. The latest surge, now pushing six figures, appears to represent Wave 5 , which is typically the last impulse move before a broader market reset. While MrParaBULLic has not pinpointed the exact peak in his chart, he anticipates that Bitcoin will experience a short-term bullish continuation before a sharp reversal unfolds. The analyst highlights that this level of upward movement, paired with heavy institutional involvement and narrative-driven conviction, creates what they describe as the “greatest euphoria trap ever.” The market expert also counters the idea that Bitcoin could be immune to deep corrections, highlighting the structural nature of its cycles—where previous bull runs , including those in 2013, 2017, and 2021 were each followed by sharp 80-90% drawdowns from their respective tops. Based to the analysis, institutional adoption has not invalidated this historical tendency, and in fact, it may be masking steeper risks . On the chart, $88,115 is marked as a key support zone that, once broken, could trigger cascading liquidations and a historic crash toward $34,932 or lower. This drop, if realized, would represent a 70-90% retracement from current levels, mirroring the brutal post-peak declines seen in earlier cycles . In response to the crypto community’s curiosity about his bearish $30,000 target, Mr. ParaBULLic emphasized that market expectations tend to provide liquidity at important support. When these expectations fail, the drawdown accelerates, creating conditions for a true macro market reset. Bitcoin Could Top Above $200,000 This Cycle As his bold forecast of an impending bear market caught the attention of the crypto community, many members responded with questions, asking when the Bitcoin price could top out and the time frame for this parabolic rally. MrParaBULLic shared that Bitcoin is expected to complete its bullish trajectory within five to eight months, after which a sharp shift in market structure is anticipated. The market expert also expressed confidence that Bitcoin’s final cycle top is still ahead, projecting a strong climb beyond the $200,000 mark before the bear market officially begins. This outlook also introduces a bullish window for altcoins , which the analyst predicts could rally explosively within the next 6-12 months after Bitcoin tops out.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-headed-for-30000/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|altcoins|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Bullish Continuation|MrParaBULLic",cryptocompare

The flagship coin broke out of a consolidation formed during the weekend after teasing potential capitulation following the Middle East tension. As a result of today’s rebound, optimism of further market rally increased traders’ greed. Moreover, Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market are well-positioned to benefit from the rising global money supply amid anticipated Quantitative Easing (QE) in the United States. Major Forces Behind Bitcoin Rebound Bitcoin price recorded bullish sentiment on Monday after Gold price posted its highest daily close on Sunday. The flagship coin has continued to benefit from macroeconomic tailwinds amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine. The demand for Bitcoin by institutional investors remains elevated as shown by its gradual decline of the overall supply on cryptocurrency exchanges. As Coinpedia reported, Strategy and Metaplanet have continued to lead other companies to aggressively accumulate more BTCs for their respective treasuries. According to market data analysis by CoinShares , Bitcoin led all the other digital asset investment products in net cash inflow last week with about $1.3 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s volatility will continue in the coming days as the Fed prepares to release the FOMC Statement and its benchmark interest rate. BTC Price Analysis and Short-term Expectation In the daily timeframe, BTC price has been consolidating in a symmetrical triangular pattern since hitting its all-time high of around $112k in mid-May. The short-term bullish expectations for Bitcoin remain palpable, especially after a consistent rebound above $107k in the past 24 hours. The bullish sentiment is also bolstered by the 1-hour MACD line, which has already crossed above the zero line. Additionally, the 1-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI ) has already rallied about the 70 percent level, which suggests the bulls are in control of the market. However, if BTC price retraces and consistently closes below the support range between $101k and $104k, a rejuvenated bearish sentiment will be confirmed.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-rebounds-above-108k-on-heightened-institutional-demand-is-it-a-dead-cat-bounce/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T20:51:03,"SharpLink Gaming: Ethereum Strategy Brings Upside, But Dilution Clouds The Path","Summary SharpLink Gaming recently purchased 176,271 ETH for $463 million, positioning itself as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, and effectively pivoting into a crypto treasury strategy similar to MicroStrategy’s. SBET faces significant dilution risk, with over 70 million potentially dilutive securities against a float of just ~2.3 million shares, contributing to recent sharp declines in its stock price. Despite the dilution overhang, SBET trades at just 1.19× its ETH per-share value, far below peers like MSTR and Metaplanet, suggesting a relatively fair valuation to underlying crypto assets. With low float, high volatility, and significant overhang from registered PIPE shares and an active $1B ATM shelf, short-term risks are elevated, but ETH bulls may see long-term upside. The last year has been a transformational one for Wall Street crypto exposure. The spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs launch in January last year was the inflection point, then the spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD) ETFs followed, then more recently the Circle ( CRCL ) IPO (which garnered much attention), and the regulatory clarity of stablecoins accelerated Wall Street’s embrace of crypto asset exposure the more. Now, even retail giants like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Walmart ( WMT ) are experimenting with their own stablecoin . On an institutional level of exposure to crypto, the treasury strategy based on a crypto asset has been made popular by Michael Saylor’s Strategy ( MSTR ). Today, you can count a dozen plus companies, in the U.S. and outside the U.S., adopting the crypto-backed treasury strategy. Bitcoin has been the default choice for companies seeking balance sheet exposure to crypto assets. Over 90% of companies pursuing a treasury allocation have Bitcoin as their anchor asset. Attention is, however, now turning to other “tried and tested” crypto assets lately. Ethereum, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, is emerging as the next logical choice for companies’ crypto-linked treasury. SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET ) is leaning into Ethereum the way MSTR did with Bitcoin. SharpLink is now the largest corporate holder of ETH, with 176,271 ETH purchased for $463 million recently. The company is allocating a portion of its balance sheet to ETH and aligning its product and partnership strategy with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. SharpLink Gaming - Company Overview Before we make sense of SharpLink’s present, we need an understanding of the company's origins and evolution. SharpLink was Founded in 2019, and originally began as a digital sports media and performance marketing firm focused on connecting sports fans with sports betting and fantasy sports platforms. The company grew its footprint by powering real-time odds integrations and affiliate services across U.S. sports content networks. In 2021, SharpLink merged with the Israeli telecom billing software provider , Mer Telemanagement Solutions Ltd, listed then on Nasdaq with the ticker MTSL. The merger enabled SharpLink to inherit a public listing, and the ticker symbol of the merged company was changed to SBET. This provided SharpLink the strategic springboard into the U.S. public markets under the ticker SBET. Following the transition, SharpLink expanded into the iGaming infrastructure space, building B2B solutions aimed at enabling sportsbooks, teams, and media partners to embed betting functionality into digital experiences. Over the years, the company has navigated shifting regulatory tides in the U.S., adapted to media-tech convergence, and now in a bold pivot recently, SharpLink is focusing on Ethereum as both a balance sheet asset and strategic alignment framework. SharpLink initiated its purchase of Ethereum for corporate treasury lately with 176,271 ETH purchased for $463 million after the successful closing of a PIPE funding earlier this month. The funding was led by ConsenSys, one of the most important companies in the Ethereum ecosystem - this further cements SharpLink’s Ethereum-first strategy. The initiating purchase of such a substantial amount of ETH could present a new narrative and valuation framework for SharpLink, following months of downward pressure and investor uncertainty for the stock. Companies aggressively pursuing corporate strategy focused crypto assets have been enjoying outsized re-ratings and growing retail and institutional interest. Prime example is MSTR, trading at around 80% premium to its BTC net asset value despite posting ongoing net losses. Defi Development Corp., formerly Janover, ( DFDV ) adopted a Solana ( SOL-USD ) treasury strategy and has seen a re-rating as a result, triggering a parabolic surge; the stock is currently up about 500% since the SOL strategy pivot and up over 3,000% YTD. SBET has been underwater for long, before the pivot to ETH corporate treasury strategy recently. A 1-for-12 reverse stock split was effected for SBET last month to save the stock from losing compliance with Nasdaq’s $1 minimum bid price requirement as the stock has been trading under $1. That mechanical fix was important for SharpLink by preserving SBET Nasdaq listing just ahead of the pivot into the Ethereum treasury strategy. SBET’s Volatility: Risks Meet Crypto Assets Treasury Opportunity Crypto-tied stocks are no stranger to volatility, and SBET's case is even more accentuated due to low float. SBET float has been highly compressed over the years. First, there was a 1-for-10 stock split in April 2023 in which SBET shares outstanding were consolidated from 26.9 million shares to 2.69 million shares. About 5 million more shares were issued over time after the 1-for-10 split (take note of the dilution). And as of the more recent 1-for-12 split in May 2025, shares were further consolidated from around 7.9 million shares to around 660,000 shares. After the 1-for-12 reverse stock split, there have been a series of fundraisings and share issuances. In the context of the PIPE offering earmarked for the purchase of treasury ETH mentioned earlier, $425 million was raised and ~69.1 million shares and related warrants were issued. Another $4.5 million public offering took place on May 20 in which 34,000 shares and 1.49 million pre-funded warrants were issued. Then an additional $79 million was raised between June 2 and June 12 under the $1 billion ATM shelf offering through the issuance of 1.6 million common shares. The shares of the PIPE offering were initially restricted from immediate trading due to registration rights agreements (until recently). Of the $4.5 million raised in the May public offering, only 34,000 shares were immediately tradable. And 1.6 million shares from the ATM raise were also immediately tradable. When we add that to the existing 660,000 shares outstanding as of the stock split, we get a current float of approximately 2.3 million shares. Now, summing up the total share and warrant count from the post reverse split capital raises - 69.1 million from the PIPE offering, 1.6 million via ATM, 34,000 shares plus 1.49 million pre-funded warrants from the May public offering, and ~660 thousand outstanding during the reverse split - over 70 million additional potentially dilutive securities have been added since. Considering the scale and overhang of the existing dilutive shares and a mere float of ~2.3 million shares, this ultra-low float relative to a large fully diluted share count is a recipe for wild volatility. And this further amplifies the downside risk when these potentially dilutive securities become eligible for trading or exercised, pressuring the stock with dilution. Seeking Alpha SBET saw a steep decline of over 70% last week despite the announcement of the 176,271 ETH purchase, which was an absolute divergence from the trend of treasury strategy announcements typically acting as short-term bullish catalysts for companies initiating crypto treasury purchases. The causes of the steep price dip were directly related to the dilution concerns I’ve discussed in detail in the preceding paragraphs. Investors developed anxiety surrounding the stock’s dilution after SharpLink filed an S-3 registration statement last week. Then that led to some sell-off which was further exacerbated due to the low float, making the price plunge dramatically. Basically, shares and pre-funded warrants from the PIPE placement in May were registered for resale in the S-3, lifting the registration rights restrictions on them. The “Sword of Damocles” effect kicked in, as investors rightly gauged the ~70 million shares supply overhang as a potential threat to share price stability, and the high potential for future dilution and selling pressure against the current low float. Josepg Lubin post (X) Consensys led the PIPE financing and was the largest investor in the PIPE . Joseph Lubin, the founder of Consensys and co-founder of Ethereum, released a statement on X allaying fears of potential immediate selloff by the PIPE investors. While that may seem an encouraging gesture, I don't think it will fully allay investors' fears of the effects of dilution as float remains this low. It will take a while before the market absorbs all that dilution and increases the float. As SBET fell below $10 last Friday from last week’s high of $37, I think investors should not rule out the possibility of it revisiting $1. Though I feel this is not likely, it should not be ruled out because of the convergence of risks, including a new-found crypto-link volatility for SBET given the company’s balance sheet is now heavily exposed to ETH, and also the potential for PIPE investors to exit positions now that their shares are registered, and the mechanical weight of more dilution being priced in. Let's not also forget that of the $1 billion ATM shelf offering (mentioned earlier), only $79 million has been raised so far, leaving potential to raise an additional $921 million. SBET is shaping up to be a potential dilution machine. Beyond the dilution and low float overhang, a comp analysis of SBET’s crypto assets holdings shows that it is still reasonably valued based on its underlying crypto assets. I've included SBET into a table of companies I track (which comprises Bitcoin miners and companies pursuing a crypto asset treasury strategy) based on their crypto exposure on balance sheet and their price-to-hodl ratio (stock price against the per-share value of their crypto holdings). P/Hold comparison (Author) SBET is currently trading at 1.76x to its treasury holdings. As of last Friday's dip when the stock tumbled to ~$9, it was trading at a much more attractive 1.19x P/Hodl. SBET has quickly re-rated off that lower valuation; this further shows the potential for volatility I’ve talked about so far. SharpLink also has a slight advantage over companies pursuing pure BTC strategy because of the ability to stake ETH. I’m labeling this advantage as a “slight” one because BTC’s demand and sheer institutional dominance remains over ETH and other assets. As of the latest filing, SharpLink disclosed that over 95% of its ETH holdings are currently deployed in staking services. At a current APY of around 4%, that's ~6,695 ETH extra from staking rewards annually, and a potential $17.6 million addition to SharpLink’s balance sheet at current ETH prices. Takeaway SBET embodies both dilution risk and a slight valuation attractiveness to net asset value. There is potential downside for SBET because of dilution risk and low float (the bad), and also potential upside as its premium to underlying assets is still reasonable (the good), and also potentially “the ugly” if, for some reason, the stock falls near $1 again. As I’ve discussed, SBET faces near-term supply overhang and severe dilution risks (both from the registered PIPE shares and the unused capacity left in the ATM offering). Based on these factors, I’m initiating coverage with a Hold, with an open stance to watch how the stock absorbs the supply overhang in the coming weeks and months. However, If you're an ETH maxi and comfortable with what I’d call leveraged ETH exposure through a volatile equity, taking some position could be worth it in the long term, if ETH keeps momentum and the company navigates its share count headwinds well.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795256-sharplink-gaming-ethereum-strategy-brings-upside-but-dilution-clouds-the-path?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING","MSTR|BTC-USD|ETH-USD|SOL-USD|SBET",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T20:50:52,"Bitcoin Consolidates Above $100K as Institutional Buying Persists and Liquidity Cools","Even as liquidity inflows to centralized exchanges have declined markedly, the most important players in this space continue to double down on their Bitcoin investments. This past week saw MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, two prominent corporate Bitcoin holders, add to their substantial BTC balances. They purchased a combined 19,452 Bitcoins at an average price of about $29,500. These purchases of Bitcoin, in amounts that are impossible to disguise, not only demonstrate the long-term viability of Bitcoin as a monetary asset but also strongly counteract the narrative that Bitcoin is in a “bear market.” Bitcoin ($BTC) remains solidly ensconced above $100,000. This seems to be the foundation of a market momentarily dedicating itself to base-building. Quite the contrary to Bitcoin’s $BTC prior pattern of forsaking range-bound sideways trading, the current price action looks concerted to establish a base above the $100,000 price level. MicroStrategy and Metaplanet Continue Relentless Accumulation MicroStrategy, which holds the most Bitcoin of any institution, made news once more with its latest acquisition. The Tysons Corner, VA, company, headed by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, bought another 10,100 BTC, worth about $1.05 billion, at an average price of $104,080 per coin. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin total now is a hug 592,100 BTC, and that’s worth $63.2 billion at current prices. The average entry price for MicroStrategy is 70,666, which means it has an unrealized profit of roughly $21.37 billion. This brings us to the purchase made not too long ago, which was not for the sake of trying to impress investors or anything along those lines but rather for the company to keep doing what it has been doing and to keep cementing that path. MicroStrategy( @Strategy ) bought another 10,100 $BTC ($1.05B) at an average price of $104,080 last week. #Strategy currently holds 592,100 $BTC ($63.2B), with an average buying price of $70,666 and an unrealized profit of $21.37B. https://t.co/k0MMvMpgDQ pic.twitter.com/ic4td6g3Zu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 16, 2025 At the same time, the Japanese investment firm Metaplanet—like MicroStrategy, a steadfast advocate for Bitcoin—has also grown its BTC stash. The firm recently picked up another 1,112 BTC for $116.5 million—and at an average price of $104,760, that makes it the second most recent buyer of 1000+ BTC at a price above $100,000. Metaplanet’s total holdings now stand at 10,000 BTC, with a valuation around $1.065 billion and an average acquisition price that has fallen to around $96,000. Purchasing either of these items shows that institutions have a lot of faith in Bitcoin’s long-term worth. And this is happening even though the market seems somewhat lackluster these days. Metaplanet( @Metaplanet_JP ) bought another 1,112 $BTC ($116.5M) at $104,760. Metaplanet currently holds 10,000 $BTC ($1.06B), with an average buying price of $96,015. https://t.co/LRlXDOEoNK pic.twitter.com/rFlitaYIrP — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 16, 2025 Exchange Liquidity Declines from December Highs Although institutional buying stays robust, inflows of exchange-directed liquidity have dropped significantly since their peak in December 2024. At that time, when Bitcoin was trading from $98,000 to $100,000, the average daily inflows of stablecoins (such as USDT and USDC) into centralized exchanges reached an all-time high of $131 billion. As of June 2025, however, that number has dropped to approximately $70 billion per day—a $61 billion decrease from the peak and $5 billion below the 365-day moving average of $75 billion. Although this marks a clear reduction in market liquidity, current levels still sit well above those seen at the beginning of the bull cycle. In December 2024, when BTC was trading between $98K and $100K, average daily inflows of USDT and USDC into all centralized exchanges (CEXs) reached a record high of $131B. By June, that figure had dropped to $70B per day – $5B below the 365-day average of $75B and $61B below the… pic.twitter.com/ri8KdCVu38 — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 16, 2025 This trend indicates that although the speculative fervor may have cooled, this has not led to any substantial outflows or profit-taking that could be described as widespread. It seems, instead, that market participants are more willing than before to just sit tight and hold their positions, even as they begin to exit from trading altogether. Market Enters Consolidation Phase Ahead of Next Move Bitcoin is holding above $100,000 and continuing institutional accumulation means the price may be in a healthy resetting state. The intense bullish price action, however, could mean we are entering a bearish consolidation phase with a potential move dipping below $100,000 next. This phase is sometimes referred to as base-building; it is where long-term holders persist in amassing their assets, and where we see speculative excesses gradually filtered out. If large-scale buyers like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet are still using this prolonged bottoming to increase their exposure, then it suggests they and we are operating under the belief that Bitcoin is markedly undervalued—even at these six-figure levels. In addition, the price of Bitcoin being so resilient in the face of declining liquidity shows what a strong demand there is for the asset and how deeply held the conviction is that it will continue to appreciate. Most Bitcoin owners aren’t even thinking about sell orders, much less panic sell or asset rotation. What most market participants seem content with is to just wait out the lull. Conclusion Although centralized exchange liquidity has clearly taken a hit from its December peak, when it recorded over $12 billion in total order book depth, the Bitcoin price has held up relatively well. Bitcoin price stability paints a long-term bullish picture. With Bitcoin solidly above $100K, the market seems to have entered a strategic holding pattern—one that could lay the groundwork for a much more powerful uptrend.

2025-06-16T20:35:38,"Bitcoin Holds $105,000 As Oil Signals Send Mixed Messages – But For How Long? Top Analysts Weigh In","Bitcoin (BTC) is holding firm near the $105,000 mark, posting a modest 2.6% gain over the past 30 days despite near-flat movement this week. This quiet resilience comes as conflicting macro signals, particularly from oil markets , fuel speculation about whether Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating for a breakout or masking a deeper shift toward altcoins. Top analysts are now closely watching Ethereum, XRP, and emerging microcaps like FloppyPepe (FPPE) for signs of capital rotation amid the growing tension. Bitcoin (BTC) Eyes Recovery Amid Volatile Oil Signals Bitcoin (BTC) is currently hovering around $105,097, steady despite a volatile macro backdrop marked by a dramatic 14% spike in crude oil futures. This surge, reflected in a sharp climb to $77.57 per barrel, has introduced uncertainty across global markets, with energy prices historically playing a key role in shaping investor risk appetite. While some analysts are split on whether rising oil is inflationary or a symptom of broader geopolitical stress, crypto traders on X are leaning bullish. A widely-circulated BTC/USDT chart shows Bitcoin (BTC) forming a textbook double bottom around $102,900, suggesting the recent pullback may be a shakeout before a larger leg upward. Macro Shakeouts And Altcoin Ripples: Enter FloppyPepe (FPPE) As oil prices climb, whether due to inflationary pressure or geopolitical turbulence, Bitcoin’s (BTC) ability to hold the $105K level is shifting the crypto narrative from fear to strategic positioning. This backdrop has analysts eyeing smaller-cap assets like FloppyPepe (FPPE) , whose presale, priced at just $0.00000035 and launched after a $907,200 private raise, perfectly aligns with Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential breakout and the hunt for asymmetric upside. What truly positions FloppyPepe (FPPE) for major growth isn’t just timing, it’s its real, functional utility. With AI tools like FloppyX , FloppyAI , and Meme-o-Matic already in beta via Telegram, users are actively generating viral content, automating storytelling, and launching full-scale marketing strategies in real time. These tools offer tangible value to meme creators, marketers, and crypto influencers, giving the project a unique edge in utility-driven adoption. As these tools gain traction through live beta testing, meme contests, and creator campaigns, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) ecosystem is rapidly expanding across Telegram, X, and YouTube. Influencer amplification from names like Nass Crypto and David In Crypto is boosting this momentum, solidifying the project as a microcap primed for exponential growth. The Presale Storm: 80% Bonus And Accessible Entry Fuel Frenzy FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale isn’t just well-timed, it’s creating a frenzy of strategic accumulation. With an 80% bonus currently active, the opportunity to maximize holdings at just $0.00000035 is driving rapid participation. Retroactive bonuses for early backers have only strengthened trust, reinforcing investor confidence while amplifying buying pressure.

Analysts Spotlight FloppPepe (FPPE) As The Altcoin Presale To Watch As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to test macro thresholds and flirt with technical breakout structures amid the oil price surge, institutional and retail traders alike are scanning for high-upside altcoins to rotate into. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has emerged as a top contender, backed by functional AI technology, robust floppynomics, and a community-first ethos that fuels its growth. With an 80% bonus still live and presale momentum building, early participants are locking in deep-value allocations ahead of major growth drivers like Uniswap listings and exchange platform integrations. The project’s smart contract is fully audited by SolidProof, reinforcing investor confidence in its security and long-term integrity.

The ETF’s Setup In a Form S-1 submitted Monday, the proposed “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, B.T.” would have a holdings ratio of 75% BTC and 25% ETH, with Singapore-based exchange Crypto.com serving as the custodian, execution agent, and liquidity provider. Trump Media and Technology Group signaled its intent to issue a crypto exchange-traded fund earlier this month as it filed paperwork for a fund focused solely on Bitcoin, called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. The new ETF seeks to offer traditional investors exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether by giving them shares backed by the crypto assets, eliminating the intricacies related to buying and storing the tokens themselves. The ETF shares are proposed to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca (NYSE Arca), per the Monday filing. The product fees are yet to be disclosed. The inclusion of Ethereum aligns with the Trump family’s crypto activity; World Liberty Financial holds over 95% of its assets on the Ethereum blockchain, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF would join a crowded and competitive market already dominated by nearly a dozen established asset managers, including BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin Trust holds a whopping $70 billion in assets on behalf of its clients — accounting for roughly 3.37% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Trump Deepens Crypto Fray The latest filing furthers the Trump Media and Technology Group’s deepening involvement with crypto. In late May, it raised $2.32 billion to build its own BTC treasury, though the firm has not yet announced any Bitcoin acquisitions. Moreover, Trump’s family has become linked to a slew of crypto projects as the President’s administration eases restrictions on the hot sector. As you may recall, President Trump debuted an official meme coin on the Solana blockchain back in January, just days before his swearing-in. Before that was the launch of the Ethereum decentralized finance platform World Liberty Financial, which has since unveiled its own governance token and stablecoin .",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trumps-truth-social-continues-crypto-push-with-dual-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etf-filing/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Bitcoin|Ethereum|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp downturn following the recent conflict between Israel and Iran, triggering a wave of risk-off sentiment among investors. However, according to a Bitfinex Alpha report published on June 16, the market may be positioned for a recovery, provided global tensions do not escalate further. While Bitcoin started the previous week on a strong note, rising 4.7% and testing its all-time high at $109,590, the unexpected Israeli strikes on Iran on June 13 unexpected Israeli strikes on Iran and the subsequent retaliations made traders much more risk-averse. Investors panicked, but Bitcoin remained resilient: Bitfinex Alpha A spike in oil prices, driven by concerns that a broader conflict could disrupt oil production, further added to macroeconomic uncertainty. Following the attacks, Bitcoin fell 7.3%, coinciding with a sharp drop in net taker volume to negative $197 million — a level suggesting widespread panic in the market. Bitcoin net taker volume | Source: Bitfinex According to Bitfinex analysts, such sharp declines in net taker volume often indicate capitulation, a pattern seen in previous market bottoms. The crypto fear and greed index also slid quickly into “fear” territory, reinforcing the narrative of a likely local bottom.

In a press release , Trump Media says its previous registration filing with the SEC has been declared effective by the regulator on June 13th, allowing the company to move forward with a prospectus. Trump Media previously filed with the SEC to adopt a Bitcoin treasury because it views BTC as an “apex instrument of financial freedom.” Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s CEO and President, said that investing in BTC would “help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and US firms.” A BTC treasury would also be useful for subscription payments, a utility token and other planned transactions across the company’s subsidiaries – Truth Social and Truth+ – according to Nunes. Says Nunes, “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities. By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our FinTech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to a new S-1 Filing with the SEC, President Trump’s Truth Social, a social media network, has filed for a new BTC/ETH ETF. States the filing, “The purpose of the Trust is to own bitcoin and ether transferred to the Trust in exchange for Shares issued by the Trust. Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Trust. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin and ether held by the Bitcoin and Ether Custodian on behalf of the Trust.” The fund is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, and crypto custody will be handled by Foris DAX Trust Company, LLC, which is connected digital asset exchange Crypto.com. Last month, Trump reportedly blackballed a lobbying firm for allegedly manipulating him into posting on social media about XRP. In early March, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he directed the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets “to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA.” Politico, citing “two people familiar with the incident,” reported that Trump was goaded into making the post by an employee of the lobbying firm Ballard Partners. The unnamed employee reportedly “buttonholed” Trump at Mar-a-Lago and encouraged him multiple times to publish the post, even providing him with the text of a message she thought the president should write.

2025-06-16T19:30:12,"Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance","Ethereum has remained in a volatile consolidation phase, trading between the $2,400 and $2,800 levels as geopolitical tensions weigh heavily on global markets. After last week’s failed breakout above resistance, ETH has retraced yet again, struggling to build sustained momentum. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified market uncertainty, contributing to spikes in volatility across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation – Details Despite the macro headwinds, Ethereum bulls continue to defend key support levels, preventing a deeper breakdown. The $2,400 zone has acted as a strong floor in recent weeks, absorbing sell pressure and keeping ETH within its current trading range. Meanwhile, the $2,800 resistance remains the major hurdle to reclaim for a bullish breakout scenario. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical outlook suggesting that Ethereum is still consolidating below a key resistance area. This structure indicates that ETH is coiling before its next major move. The window for a potential breakout narrows as price tightens within this established range. Ethereum Prepares To Move Ethereum has pushed into a critical price zone, with bulls attempting to hold the $2,600–$2,700 range after recent volatility. The asset has shown resilience, rebounding from last week’s lows and re-entering the mid-range of its multi-week consolidation. With price action once again approaching the $2,800 resistance level, market participants are eyeing a potential breakout that could open the door to $3,000 and beyond. Analysts remain divided. On one side, bullish momentum and improving market sentiment suggest ETH is preparing for a larger move. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger aggressive buying and initiate a broader altcoin rally. Many investors are positioning themselves in anticipation of a rotation from Bitcoin into high-beta assets like Ethereum, hoping to ride the next phase of the cycle. On the other side, caution persists. Some technical analysts argue that Ethereum may still be at risk of losing steam, especially if the price gets rejected again at resistance. A failure to maintain the current range could result in a retracement toward $2,400 support or even lower, shaking out weak hands. According to a recent technical update from Jelle, Ethereum remains locked in consolidation just below its key resistance zone. The analysis points to a tightening structure where the window of opportunity is closing. If ETH breaks above this zone, it could ignite fireworks across the altcoin market. With global uncertainty still present and traders closely watching resistance levels, Ethereum’s next move could define the pace of the broader market. Whether it’s a breakout or a breakdown, the coming days are likely to be pivotal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Critical $104K Support – Eyes On $97K If It Breaks ETH Price Action: Technical Details Ethereum is currently trading at $2,606, maintaining a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800 as shown in the 12-hour chart. After multiple rejections around the $2,800 zone, the asset is struggling to break through this resistance level decisively. Despite the volatility triggered by macroeconomic uncertainty and Middle East conflict, ETH has managed to defend the $2,500 area, supported by a rising 100-period moving average. The recent bounce from the lower end of the range suggests that bulls are still active, stepping in to defend critical structure. However, volume remains relatively muted, indicating that buyers are cautious and awaiting confirmation before initiating larger positions. Meanwhile, the 50-period moving average remains above the 200-period MA, hinting at a medium-term bullish bias if support continues to hold.

If the range breaks to the downside, the $2,400 zone is the next level to watch for demand.

2025-06-16T19:19:36,"Tron’s $210m Nasdaq play is real. Eric Trump’s role? Not so much.","As Justin Sun’s TRON enters into a $210 million reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, Eric Trump has publicly distanced himself from Dominari Securities, the firm brokering the deal. The Trump-linked bank’s role is drawing scrutiny amid Sun’s expanding investments in crypto ventures associated with the Trump orbit. The reported reverse merger between TRON and Florida-based SRM Entertainment marks one of the more unusual public debuts in recent crypto history: a blockchain empire going public not through a traditional IPO, but by absorbing a small-cap toy maker with licensing deals across Disney, Universal, and SeaWorld. Structured as a private placement, the deal involves a $100 million upfront investment and warrants valuing the transaction at $210 million. As part of the agreement, SRM Entertainment will rebrand as Tron Inc., effectively giving Sun’s blockchain project a backdoor entry onto the Nasdaq. The intrigue deepens with the players behind the scenes. Dominari Securities, the boutique investment bank arranging the offering, has well-documented ties to the Trump family. Read more: Trump’s Truth Social joins ETF race with dual Bitcoin and Ethereum product According to a June 16 CNBC report, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump joined Dominari’s parent company’s advisory board earlier this year. Yet within hours of the report linking Dominari to the TRON-SRM deal, Eric Trump took to X to deny any “public involvement” with the firm, calling the narrative “inaccurate.” . @tier10k I’m the biggest fan of Tron and love @justinsuntron – he is a great friend and an icon in the crypto space. That said the below is inaccurate – I don’t have public involvement in this company. https://t.co/CDt0uudY1s — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) June 16, 2025 Damage control or strategic retreat? Eric Trump’s swift denial raises more questions than it answers. His June 16 tweet directly addressed the report tying his family to the TRON-SRM merger. But the phrasing—“I don’t have public involvement in this company”—leaves room for interpretation. What about involvement behind closed doors? With Dominari brokering one of the year’s most controversial crypto deals, the denial reads like a strategic retreat. The optics were problematic: Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire facing an SEC fraud case that has lost momentum under the Trump administration, invests nearly $100 million into Trump-aligned crypto ventures. Then, a Trump-linked bank steps in to help him go public. The timing is critical. Sun’s investments in Trump-backed ventures, including World Liberty Financial and the MAGA meme token, had already drawn scrutiny. Now, with Dominari at the center of the merger, the narrative risks shifting from business strategy to political patronage. Eric Trump’s denial may be a preemptive move to blunt regulatory or media backlash. Still, in crypto markets, where perception often drives sentiment, the damage may already be done. SRM stock surged 460 percent on news of the merger. But if investors start questioning who’s really pulling the strings, that volatility could just as quickly reverse course.

The altcoin, often dubbed “digital silver”, has failed to rally alongside top cryptocurrencies, with its price recently constrained below $140 since dropping below in January 2022. In the past few months, buyers have looked to strengthen in the $80-$100 range. Per CoinMarketCap data, LTC traded around $88.28, green on the day but in the red over the past week and month. Litecoin network surges to 30 million transactions in 2025 While not as impressive as some outperformers, the LTC price currently reflects renewed investor enthusiasm, fueled by spot ETF anticipation and network growth milestones. Among this is Litecoin network’s run to over 30 million transactions year-to-date. Litecoin Foundation shared the milestone in a post, noting the network has processed over 30 million transactions in 2025 so far. This translates to an average of over one million transactions per week, underscoring the network’s robust adoption as a payment method. Litecoin Foundation ⚡️ @LTCFoundation · Follow JUST IN: The Litecoin Network has completed 30 million transactions YTD in 2025!! Averaging well over a million transactions per week! #Litecoin ⚡️ What’s in your wallet? #MondayMotivation Watch on Twitter View replies 6:16 pm · 16 Jun 2025 85 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies Data from IntoTheBlock highlights a surge in large transactions, with over $1.2 billion in LTC moved in single transactions exceeding $100,000 during recent peak periods. This activity reflects growing confidence among institutional and high-net-worth investors. Litecoin’s likely price breakout could benefit from these massive transaction counts. Also set to play a huge role in holder sentiment is the growing expectations for a spot Litecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Currently, Litecoin, Solana, and XRP are among the altcoins with several spot ETF applications before the SEC. Sentiment is high across the market as Polymarket traders bet on huge odds that the SEC will approve these spot ETFs before the end of the year. Analysts, including Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, say the chances that the SEC approves these funds are very high. Potentially, they see a launch for LTC and others by October 2025. Given the anticipation, price appreciation could follow news of trading dates. Litecoin price forecast Litecoin’s price action suggests a potential bullish reversal. The token has bounced off the $80 support level on multiple occasions in the past month. A bullish pattern in the form of a rising channel gives bulls an upper hand. The daily chart also has the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trending upward, indicating increasing buying pressure. A similar outlook is possible given the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which signals a bullish crossover. Key price levels to watch are $100 on the upside and $80 on the downside. A breakout above or below will be crucial to either bulls or bears.

The saying holds true for Bitcoin treasury company Strategy, which on Monday announced it had expanded its holdings with a new 10,100 BTC buy amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The price of Bitcoin, meanwhile, climbed above the $107,000 level on Monday following a volatile weekend. Strategy Boosts Bitcoin Bet With Additional 10,100 BTC Purchase Strategy — formerly MicroStrategy — said it bought 10,100 BTC last week for approximately $1.05 billion at an average price of $104,080 per digital coin, with Bitcoin slumping from $110,000 last Monday to $103,639 lows on June 12 after news that Israel had bombed Iran rattled the markets. According to CoinGecko data, the world’s largest cryptocurrency was trading at $107,938 as of press time, up 2.3% in the past 24 hours. The Tysons, Virginia-based software company is the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency, and now focuses on buying the asset — at its highs and lows — so that investors can get exposure to Bitcoin via its Nasdaq-listed shares. Strategy now holds a total of 592,100 BTC, worth over $63 billion. The total stash was purchased at an average price of $70,666 per BTC for a total cost of roughly $41.8 billion, including fees and expenses. That’s equal to around 2.8% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. Please leave some for the rest of us. You bought our entire stack in 1 week — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 16, 2025 The latest haul comes after the company completed its new 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD) issuance. Targeted at long-term investors seeking high-yield, fixed-income opportunities, the offering consisted of 11.76 million shares and generated approximately $979.7 million in net proceeds after fees and expenses. Growing Corporate Crypto Adoption Since Strategy added a Bitcoin treasury, other public and private companies are following its lead by scooping up BTC to give shareholders better value for money. Despite the recent crypto market meltdown, where Bitcoin plunged to around $103,600 in a span of three days due to geopolitical tensions, institutional appetite for the apex crypto doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Cantor-backed Twenty One, Trump Media, and video game retailer GameStop recently joined the likes of Semler Scientific and Metaplanet in mirroring Strategy’s Bitcoin acquisition model. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet also announced Monday it had snapped up an extra 1,112 BTC, boosting its total holdings above 10,000 BTC.

According to FT, Sun’s new venture will be called “Tron Inc.” and copy the treasury method of Michael Saylor’s firm Strategy, but instead of Bitcoin ( BTC ), will accumulate TRX, the native token of the Tron network. FT’s sources say that Eric Trump will hold a major role in the company, and that the deal will also involve a $210 million injection of crypto assets. In a separate press release, SRM Entertainment announced it was entering into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with an unnamed private investor for a $100,000,000 equity investment that will be used by SRM to initiate a TRON token treasury strategy. Sun was named as an advisor to the company. Shares of SRM Entertainment (SRM) skyrocketed as much as 647% early on Monday, and at time of writing, are currently up 453% on the day.

In a new press release , the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York says it is charging six people – Michael Edwards, Shakeemo Hill, William Hill, Alixandria Lauture, Shuron Malone and Carlos Mercado – in connection with a multi-million-dollar check and bank fraud crew that operated between January 2022 and July 2024. Authorities allege that they operated a sophisticated scheme that involved buying or obtaining keys to unlock Postal Service collection boxes in an effort to steal mail, bank cards and other bank account details. The group and their coconspirators would subsequently change the details of the checks by using digital means to alter the details and printing them on check stock or by using chemicals to remove the original ink. The group’s leader, Edwards, mostly planned out how to obtain the postal keys, while William Hill, Shakeemo Hill, and Mercado used the keys to steal mail from collection boxes. The other two members were involved in recruiting people they knew to supply them with private bank account details they could use. The group posted “millions of dollars” worth of checks for sale on a messaging application. They also deposited millions worth of fraudulent checks into accounts at national banks located on the East Coast, though no specific amounts were disclosed. As stated by US Attorney Jay Clayton, “As alleged, the six defendants charged today lined their pockets by stealing checks destined for hard working New Yorkers and others. Together with our partners at the Postal Inspection Service, we will fight to protect the integrity of the US mail system – a public service upon which millions of Americans rely every day to send items of financial, professional, and personal importance.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The network's mining difficulty hit a record 126.98 trillion, propelled by a 14-day average hashrate of 913.54 exahashes per second (EH/s). Transaction fees in June fell below 1% of block rewards, and hashprice dropped to $52 per PH/s before rebounding slightly. Escalating competition and energy costs are expected to drive production expenses above $70,000 per BTC, up from $64,000 in the first quarter of the year, the report said. To remain competitive, public miners like MARA Holdings (MARA), CleanSpark (CLSK), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and IREN (IREN) are accelerating buildouts . MARA grew its hashrate by 30% in May, while HIVE (HIVE) added 32% after energizing a new facility in Paraguay. Cipher Mining (CIFR) is targeting a 70% boost by expanding its Texas operation. Top-tier ASICs now cost between $10 and $30 per terahash, the report said, with operational payback periods stretching as long as two years. That’s assuming a $0.06/kWh electricity rate — already out of reach for some. Terawulf, for instance, paid $0.081/kWh in the first quarter, pushing its fleet hashcost up by over 25%. Meanwhile, mining equities are decoupling from bitcoin’s price performance .

2025-06-16T18:42:45,"Will Bitcoin hit a new high in June? $108.9k resistance could decide BTC’s next major breakout","Bitcoin’s weekend rally has brought price into a significant high-timeframe resistance zone, where the coming sessions will determine whether this region marks a local top, or a springboard to new all-time highs. With technical confluence building around the $108,900 level, the market is now at a pivotal decision point. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has shown strong momentum coming into the week following a weekend push higher. However, price is now trading in a zone that has historically acted as resistance, and the market’s reaction here will shape the near-term outlook. If this resistance is cleared with volume and conviction, a breakout to fresh all-time highs becomes increasingly likely. If price is rejected, a retracement toward liquidity-laden zones below may occur first. Key technical points Key Resistance at $108,900: This level aligns with the value area high, a prior swing high, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, and a major high-timeframe resistance. Support Cluster at Weekend Lows: The point of control, 0.618 Fibonacci, and value area low align near the weekend’s base, creating a strong zone of liquidity. High Likelihood of Liquidity Sweep: Bitcoin often targets weekend lows before major directional moves, especially when consolidating at resistance. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin is currently trading within a key resistance region defined by a cluster of confluence: the value area high, a macro swing high, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, and a high-timeframe horizontal level at $108,900. This zone has historically served as a barrier for bullish momentum, making it a valid region for short-term distribution or consolidation. What happens at this level will likely determine the next leg of price action. A candle close above $108,900, particularly on the 4H or daily chart, would signal strength and open the door for a breakout toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, a rejection at this level, especially on low volume, could trigger a sweep of weekend liquidity. You might also like: XAUUSD weekly forecast: fundamentals push gold higher, $3700 a possibility? The key support zone to monitor in that scenario lies around the point of control, which aligns with the weekend lows, the 0.618 retracement, and the value area low. Historically, Bitcoin tends to clear weekend lows before initiating major moves, aligning with the liquidity-driven behavior typical of the asset. What to expect in the coming price action Bitcoin is trading at a critical inflection point. A break above $108,900 with strong volume increases the probability of a new all-time high. A rejection, however, raises the likelihood of a liquidity sweep, with a potential retrace to support zones near $104,000. Watch this level closely, as this week’s trend may hinge on what unfolds here.

2025-06-16T18:31:31,"Why Japanese Investors Are Embracing Metaplanet for Bitcoin Exposure","BitcoinWorld Why Japanese Investors Are Embracing Metaplanet for Bitcoin Exposure Are high taxes making direct Bitcoin ownership less appealing? According to recent Matrixport analysis , Japanese investors are finding clever ways to gain exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency without facing the country’s potentially steep tax rates on direct crypto gains. This shift in strategy highlights the impact of regulatory environments on investment behavior and shines a spotlight on a unique approach: investing in companies with significant Bitcoin holdings, like Metaplanet. Understanding the Challenge: High Bitcoin Tax Japan Japan is known for its vibrant cryptocurrency market, but it also has a tax system that can significantly impact investors’ profits. Unlike some countries that treat crypto gains as capital gains with lower rates, Japan often categorizes these profits as ‘miscellaneous income’. Here’s a quick look at the tax landscape: High Rates: Gains from cryptocurrency trading or holding can be taxed at progressive rates reaching up to 55% when combined with other income, including national and local taxes. This is a substantial portion of any profit, making investors hesitant to sell or even realize gains. Miscellaneous Income Classification: This classification means crypto profits are added to other income sources, potentially pushing individuals into higher tax brackets. Taxable Events: Selling crypto for fiat, exchanging one crypto for another, or using crypto to pay for goods and services can all trigger taxable events. This high tax burden creates a significant disincentive for direct, active trading or long-term holding if the eventual sale faces such a high levy. It encourages investors to look for alternative methods to benefit from Bitcoin’s potential appreciation. Metaplanet: A Gateway for Indirect Bitcoin Investment Enter Metaplanet. This publicly listed Japanese company has gained prominence by adopting a strategy similar to MicroStrategy in the US – accumulating substantial amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. By investing in Metaplanet shares, Japanese investors are effectively gaining exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional stock market vehicle. Why is this appealing? Investing in company shares is a well-understood and tax-efficient process in Japan compared to direct crypto holdings. Gains from selling shares are typically taxed under a separate system, often at a lower, fixed rate (around 20%) regardless of the investor’s total income. This creates a significant tax advantage for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. Matrixport’s observation underscores this trend, suggesting that the tax differential is a primary driver behind the increased interest in Metaplanet among Japanese investors. What the Matrixport Analysis Reveals About Metaplanet’s Valuation The Matrixport analysis points to an interesting phenomenon: Metaplanet’s market valuation appears to trade at a significant premium compared to the value of the Bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet. The report highlighted Metaplanet’s 7.23x market net asset value (mNAV), implying that Bitcoin within the Metaplanet structure is being valued by the market at roughly $759,000 per coin, significantly higher than the prevailing spot market price. This premium suggests more than just the value of the underlying Bitcoin. According to Matrixport, several factors contribute to this elevated valuation: Speculative Demand: Investors are betting on Metaplanet’s continued Bitcoin accumulation strategy and the potential for its stock price to appreciate alongside BTC. Limited Float: The number of available Metaplanet shares might be relatively low compared to demand from investors seeking this indirect exposure. Expectations of Higher Future BTC Valuations: Investors anticipate that Bitcoin’s price will continue to rise, and holding it via Metaplanet’s balance sheet is seen as a convenient and tax-efficient way to participate in that growth. Tax Arbitrage: The ability to gain Bitcoin exposure with a potentially lower tax burden on future gains adds significant value for Japanese investors. This premium serves as a tangible indicator of the strong demand for tax-advantaged Bitcoin exposure in Japan. Navigating the Landscape: Benefits and Challenges of Indirect Bitcoin Investment Investing in Metaplanet for Bitcoin exposure offers clear benefits, primarily related to taxation and accessibility via traditional brokerage accounts. However, it’s essential to consider the potential challenges: Benefits: Tax Efficiency: As discussed, potential lower tax rates on stock gains compared to direct crypto gains. Accessibility: Easily tradable through standard stock brokerage accounts, familiar to traditional investors. Simplified Custody: No need for investors to manage private keys or worry about the security of direct Bitcoin holdings. Regulatory Clarity: Investing in a listed company is a well-established regulatory path. Challenges: Trading at a Premium: As highlighted by Matrixport, investors might pay a significant premium over the actual value of the underlying Bitcoin. Company-Specific Risk: The investment is tied to the performance and management of Metaplanet as a company, not just the price of Bitcoin. Limited Direct Control: Investors don’t directly own Bitcoin and cannot use it for transactions or other purposes. Correlation Risk: While highly correlated, Metaplanet’s stock price may not perfectly track Bitcoin’s price due to other business factors or market sentiment towards the company itself. For Japanese investors , weighing these factors is crucial when deciding between direct and indirect Bitcoin investment methods. Japan’s Evolving Stance on Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The Matrixport report also touched upon recent shifts in the Japanese government’s approach to corporate crypto holdings. Efforts to lower barriers for corporations to hold BTC and potentially classify it more as a reserve asset than a speculative one signal a potential thawing in regulatory attitudes, at least for businesses. While this doesn’t directly change the individual investor’s tax burden on miscellaneous income, it creates a more favorable environment for companies like Metaplanet to operate and expand their Bitcoin reserves. This could further solidify the indirect investment path as a viable option. The Future of Bitcoin Investment in Japan The current landscape, driven by high individual taxes and innovative corporate strategies, points towards continued interest in indirect methods for gaining Bitcoin exposure among Japanese investors . The success and premium valuation of Metaplanet serve as a case study for how tax environments can shape investment product demand. While the tax situation for individuals remains challenging, any future reforms that simplify or reduce the tax burden on direct crypto gains could potentially shift the balance. Until then, strategies involving publicly traded companies with significant Bitcoin holdings are likely to remain attractive for those looking to participate in the Bitcoin market from Japan. The insights from the Matrixport analysis provide valuable context into these market dynamics, highlighting the creative solutions investors adopt in response to specific regulatory and tax conditions. Conclusion: Navigating Taxes for Bitcoin Exposure The story of Japanese investors and Metaplanet is a compelling example of how tax policy directly influences investment flows and innovation within the crypto space. High taxes on direct Bitcoin gains in Japan have paved the way for indirect methods, with Metaplanet emerging as a popular vehicle. The significant premium highlighted by Matrixport analysis underscores the strong demand for tax-efficient access to Bitcoin. While this approach offers benefits like tax efficiency and accessibility, investors must also be aware of the risks associated with company-specific performance and the premium paid. As Japan’s regulatory environment continues to evolve, the strategies employed by its investors will undoubtedly adapt, but for now, indirect investment methods remain a powerful response to the challenge of high Bitcoin tax Japan .

2025-06-16T18:30:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) Primed for New Highs Above $150,000 in 2025, While Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Could Become the Next Crypto to Hit $1","Bitcoin (BTC) is building momentum in mid‑2025, holding steady around $104,020 after a recent dip from about $108,750. As savvy investors evaluate what crypto to invest in, the steady recovery of Ethereum adds weight to the case for established coins, even as rising DeFi coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attract eyes for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Currently trading at $0.03 in its presale’s Phase 5, MUTM has raised over $10.6 million, passed a CertiK audit, and is projected for an explosive rally. Many now see MUTM as the most promising cheap crypto to buy now and a realistic coin for 2025’s next millionaire-maker and will hit $2 soon after launch. Mutuum Finance Soars Phase 5 of Presale as Investor Interest Surges Mutuum Finance is gathering real momentum as it soars in Phase 5 of its presale. As a new project, the platform is a potent competitor in the DeFi sector that provides an inflation-resistant and scalable alternative to meme coins focused on speculation. The interest of investors is also building up, and the project has already gathered more than $10.6 million, and over 12100 people hold the tokens. At this stage, the price of one MUTM is $0.03, and the official launch price will be doubled to $0.06, providing those who decide to support us at this stage, with a substantial chance of earning in the short term and an opportunity to grow in the long term. Mutuum Finance DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance offers an innovative non-custodial liquidity protocol allowing people to have full ownership of their assets when engaging in decentralized lending. The platform is developed on the basis of the dual lending model featuring Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer systems. The Peer-to-Contract structure operates under the control of smart contracts that smoothly vary interest rates in real-time according to the activity in the market. This brings about stability in the automated process to both the lenders and the borrowers. The Peer-to-Peer model on the other hand allows users to completely sideline intermediaries and instead allow borrowers and lenders to get in touch with each other. It is especially useful to people who transact with volatile assets like meme coins. Combined, those systems introduce a flexible and user-friendly experience of DeFi lending that is more controllable and secure than its centralized counterpart. CertiK Audit and Mutuum Finance Stablecoin Beyond its lending innovation Mutuum Finance also has intentions to launch a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The stablecoin offered by Mutuum will be capable of maintaining a stable condition even in a turbulent market as opposed to the situation being experienced with the algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance consists of open-source smart contracts and has already undergone a rigorous audit by CertiK, one of the most reliable brands in the sphere of blockchain security. Such an audit not only confirms the security of the infrastructure of the platform but also strengthens the overall transparency approach of Mutuum Finance, as well as its safety and reliability from the long-term perspective of the DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Finance is rapidly gaining recognition as one of the top high-upside DeFi projects of 2025, with over $10.6 million raised and 12,100+ early backers joining its Phase 5 presale. Priced at just $0.03, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, investors today are positioned for 100% gains out of the gate, with long-term projections eyeing potential returns as high as $2 and beyond. Backed by a completed CertiK audit, a robust dual lending model, and a soon-to-launch USD-pegged stablecoin, MUTM is offering far more than hype, it’s building a real, utility-driven ecosystem. If you’re looking for the next altcoin breakout before Bitcoin crosses $150K, secure your MUTM tokens now before the presale price jumps.

2025-06-16T18:29:00,"Solaxy vs. Neo Pepe—Inside Crypto’s Biggest Presale War","There are two players, who are ready to duke it out on the bloody battlefield of cryptocurrency presales . Competitors are not the only ones that Solaxy and Neo Pepe ($NEOP) have become symbols of a fierce ideological struggle within bitcoin society. In spite of presale phases that are thoroughly crafted to motivate investors and create groundbreaking momentum, they have taken the market by the storm and are representative of quite different concepts about the future of crypto. Finding themselves at a crossroad, investors who want to join the next Crypto Investment Gems are forced to choose between quite different perspectives. Even though the number of new releases in the crypto sphere each year is quite extensive, only a microscopic number of those elicit the interest and investment that warrant their attention. Presales have proven to be the necessary test field in this extremely competitive market where early adopters are able to determine the true capability of a project. At that, Solaxy and Neo Pepe are great in this respect; both represent somewhat different paths to achievement. Solactic is straightforward and correct towards the agreed industry standards whereas Neo Pepe is on edge, experimenting with mechanics and firm ideological frameworks. This competition represents various notions of decentralization, innovation, and participation of the community in shaping the future of crypto and not merely a financial contest. 1. Presale Tactics—Revolutionary vs. Conventional The way cryptocurrencies run their presales reveals a great deal about their underlying goals and operating principles. Although Solaxy has chosen a more conventional presale model—linear stages with modest token value increases—it is strong in delivery. Neo Pepe Protocol, on the other hand, has adopted a revolutionary 16-stage presale system, beginning at $0.05 and rising to $0.16, painstakingly crafted to maximize investor excitement and sustain ongoing buzz. Neo Pepe is among the Best Presale choices for this year since it provides consistent liquidity in addition to consistent price increase for investors. Unlike Solaxy’s traditional, predictable approach, Neo Pepe’s dynamic presale cleverly combines hourly token unlocks post-launch, an original twist keeping constant investor involvement and price stability. 2. Symbolic Messaging—Utility vs. Cultural Rebellion Emphasizing utility, scalability, and technical performance, Solaxy places itself squarely in the crypto story driven by utilities. Excellent, most certainly, but hardly innovative in the packed market of today. On the other hand, Neo Pepe Protocol uses symbolism as a potent kind of market differentiator. It goes beyond conventional memecoin expectations by including strong socioeconomic symbolism into its basic character—an evocative cultural revolt against centralized financial control and market saturation. Unlike most memecoins, like Shiba Inu or Pepe (PEPE), Neo Pepe uses its meme-origin as an ideological lighthouse rather than for comedy. Emphasized by the idea of the “Memetrix,” its presale story is meant to appeal especially to crypto aficionados looking for active involvement in a financial revolution instead of merely passive speculation. 3.Strategic Edge of Neo Pepe—Auto-Liquidity Mechanism Another crucial battlefield where Neo Pepe clearly excels is liquidity provision. Solaxy is not very good here. Following immediate burning of LP tokens, Neo Pepe Protocol uses an advanced auto-liquidity mechanism to automatically channel 2.5% of every transaction to build liquidity pools. This innovative mechanism greatly exceeds the more conventional liquidity strategies used by Solaxy by guaranteeing constant prices and building investor confidence. Neo Pepe positions itself as unique in the Exclusive Token Launch scene by including auto-liquidity straight into its tokenomics, so removing reliance on hand market interventions. 4. Empowering Investors vs. Centralization Risks: Governance Model The governance structure of a cryptocurrency determines long-term project viability and investor confidence mostly. Solaxy depends mostly on a conventional centralized structure even if it is transparent in governance. Although quick, this method runs the danger of exactly replicating the centralized control crypto aficioners want to avoid. Built around the NEOPGovernor contract, Neo Pepe’s governance system marks an ideological advance. Its distributed government model boasts: One million tokens, easily available but strong against pointless ideas. One-block delay in voting delays allows quick and responsive community government. One-week long voting period is enough to promote reflective and inclusive decision-making. Aim for a quorum fraction of an ideal 4%, which will balance participation against paralysis of decision-making. Timelock: Open execution delay guaranteeing thorough community control. This all-encompassing system enables investors to actively shape the future of the project, so sharply contrasting Solaxy’s centralized governance risks. 5. Strategic Positioning: Instant Impact Against Long-Term Vision Usually, investor appeal comes down to strategic orientation. Solaxy’s functional utility approach gives quick, short-term impact grounded in its practicality. However, these approaches sometimes lead to stagnation since once initial excitement based on utility fades, market hype can soon fade. But Neo Pepe fosters investor loyalty by means of both steady growth and instant excitement. Its strategic road map goes much beyond simple launch excitement; future phases include strategic alliances, governance-driven exchange listings, and vigorous worldwide marketing campaigns. 6: Industry Context—Neo Pepe’s Specialism Neo Pepe obviously stands out from well-known presales like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) or Antix (ANTIX) by its thorough and creative approach. While Antix mostly depends on speculative momentum and Bitcoin Pepe stresses conventional meme-driven enthusiasm, Neo Pepe combines strong tokenomics with meaningful symbolic engagement, so offering great utility wrapped in ideological purpose. Presale Losers and War Winners Taken through the lens of presale strategy, governance elegance, liquidity frameworks, as well as symbolic messaging, Neo Pepe is evidently competitive. It is a complete vision, which is well designed to attract investors in both the short and long-qualities. Ultimately, Neo Pepe Protocol is soon becoming one of the leading Crypto Investment Gems in the competitive and competitive crypto presale arena. The current participants in the launch will not only be a participant in another crypto launch but also a part of a continuing process of real decentralization, monetary independence, and a significant cultural declaration. Do it now; check the Neo Pepe Protocol presale and become part of crypto’s revolutionary journey toward true decentralization and financial freedom.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solaxy-vs-neo-pepe-inside-cryptos-biggest-presale-war/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB","Press Release",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T18:28:52,"CoinShares Joins Solana ETF Train With New Filing: Details","CoinShares has joined other asset management firms to file for a Solana ETF. It officially joined the race on June 14 by registering its interest in an S-1 form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, CoinShares is now the eighth applicant for a Solana ETF in the United States. Where is the BlackRock Solana ETF Filing? CoinShares is joining Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton, which had submitted the same filing earlier. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared the update on X, stating that ” Coinshares is jumping into the Solana spot ETF race with a new filing this morning. I think we are up to 8 now. He also noted that some people have asked him when BlackRock will file its SOL ETF filing. He answered these questions, “I don’t know, no intel. My Spidey sense is not helpful either, as I could see them filing, but I could also see them not filing.” Grayscale and Fidelity Files SOL ETF It is worth noting that for every Solana ETF filing made to the SEC, the applicants indicated their interest in including staking when they eventually launch. This suggests that staking is becoming a standard feature for these proposed funds. Grayscale Investments submitted a proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a SOL ETF in March. Fidelity filed its application in the same month, further demonstrating the increased interest in Solana. Such an ETF would allow investors to access Solana without directly buying or managing cryptocurrency. Generally, there is a push to engage with digital assets other than Bitcoin (BTC). Canary Capital Partners With Marinade Finance on ETF Staking Canary Capital took a bolder step towards its SOL ETF by bagging a new partnership with Marinade Finance , a popular SOL staking platform. This partnership led to the fund’s renaming, now called the Canary Marinade Solana ETF. This deal allows the ETF to include SOL staking, like the SOL ETF application from other asset managers. However, all these applicants wait for the security regulator to decide on their filings. On the other hand, the SEC has postponed its decision, claiming to wait for public comments.
