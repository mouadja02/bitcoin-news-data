Metaplanet says that it added another 1,112 BTC to its books, bringing its total holdings to 10,000 BTC, making it the ninth-largest holder of the flagship crypto asset among public companies. BitcoinTreasuries.net data shows that Coinbase currently holds 9,267 Bitcoin, 733 fewer Bitcoin than Metaplanet. The public company with the largest Bitcoin holdings remains Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, with 592,100 Bitcoin. Says Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, ‚ÄúMetaplanet has acquired 1,112 BTC for ~$117.2 million at ~$105,435 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC yield of 266.1% year to date 2025.

2025-06-17T16:47:01,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Market Sentiment Indicates A Potential Altcoin Season Next","Bitcoin‚Äôs early rally has historically always been the warm-up act before the real ‚Äúbull market.‚Äù The real drama, especially for retail investors, begins when Ethereum starts gaining traction. That‚Äôs when the market starts whispering that the altcoin season is near, which is the phase where smaller coins start clocking 2x, 5x, even 10x moves in a matter of days. Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs strong upward moves this year, altcoins have largely remained quiet. But that silence may be ending. The broader sentiment, while still cautiously optimistic, has begun to lean in favor of altcoins. And with Ethereum‚Äôs demand building quietly in the background, many in the space believe the tide could finally be shifting toward a market where alts start running hard. Why This Altcoin Season Speculation Isn‚Äôt Just Hopeful Thinking The clearest evidence that altcoins are about to gain strength isn‚Äôt found in hopes or hype but in the form of a technical indicator called Bitcoin dominance. This metric measures how much of the total crypto market cap is absorbed by Bitcoin alone. When dominance is rising, Bitcoin is doing the heavy lifting. But when dominance stalls or begins falling, it usually means that liquidity is rotating into altcoins. That‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs beginning to happen right now. Bitcoin dominance has hit a strong resistance zone just under 65%, and it‚Äôs already showing signs of rejection. As the metric begins trending down again, traders are preparing for what could be a heavy altcoin rotation. A drop toward the 64.2% level or below would likely confirm this shift. The second biggest crypto per market cap, Ethereum, has also managed to remain the heartbeat of altcoin activity. The recent accumulation of over 1.4 million ETH by major whale and shark wallets, even as retail has been selling, shows that smart money is positioning early. These wallets now control nearly 27% of Ethereum‚Äôs supply. Simultaneously, whale transactions in Ethereum-related protocols like ENS, L2 DeFi platforms, and USDC bridges have surged sharply, indicating increased strategic exposure to Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. üê≥ There are currently 6,392 wallets holding between 1K and 100K Ethereum. Over the past month alone, these key whale and shark wallets have rapidly added more coins as retail traders have taken profit.During these past 30 days, a net of +1.49M more $ETH has been accumulated by‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/1hPBTuAOrL ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 13, 2025 Interestingly, despite some retail selling, institutional appetite has been growing quite a bit. A 19-day inflow streak into spot ETH ETFs recently funneled over $1.3 billion into Ether products before finally cooling off. This wasn‚Äôt random enthusiasm, but a move that reflects belief in Ethereum‚Äôs longer-term role in the next market phase. Historically, altcoin seasons begin when retail exits and institutions accumulate. That‚Äôs what the current setup resembles. Best Crypto to Buy Now As the Altcoin Season Looks Like a Reality Bitcoin Hyper Every bull cycle chooses a mascot. During the present run, Bitcoin is that mascot, breaking ceilings while the rest of the market watches. Bitcoin Hyper leverages that spotlight while refusing to stay as just another memecoin with a BTC theme. The project builds a layer that slashes confirmation times to seconds, unlocks scalable smart contracts, and introduces fee levels the average phone user will accept. In an environment where analysts expect capital to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, Bitcoin Hyper offers a bridge rather than a divergence. Holders get exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs brand strength along with the transactional speed that usually belongs to leaner networks. The protocol places an automated relay on-chain that verifies Bitcoin block headers within a separate virtual machine. That relay mints wrapped BTC instantly, making the asset liquid inside decentralized applications without waiting for slow twelve-minute intervals. Once traders decide the broader market has room for creativity, platforms that extend Bitcoin‚Äôs utility tend to absorb fresh liquidity first. Institutional desks can park treasury-sized positions without leaving Bitcoin‚Äôs narrative, retail wallets can finally use BTC for micropayments, and developers can experiment with tokens pegged to the largest asset by market value. Top crypto YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins and many others across social media channels have already endorsed it as an up-and-coming presale with huge potential. Investors looking for early entries before altcoin season accelerates may see Bitcoin Hyper as a strategic midway point. It keeps the spotlight of the dominant coin while positioning itself to benefit from the inevitable search for alternative high-growth venues that characterizes every maturing bull rally. These converging forces place the token on watchlists at major desks. SUBBD Scroll through any social platform and you will see a silent struggle. Creators grinding for reach while algorithms change rules overnight. SUBBD proposes a different contract. Instead of chasing advertising pennies or surrendering data, creators issue subscription keys on-chain that fans can buy, trade, or even lend. Behind the simple paywall lies a familiar experience for mainstream audiences, which is why SUBBD stands out as altcoin season approaches. Capital often hunts for coins linked to practical, non-speculative demand, and few utilities are clearer than direct fan support. The architecture keeps complexity hidden. Fans pay with familiar cards or stablecoins, the gateway handles conversion in the background, and the SUBBD token coordinates revenue sharing plus loyalty boosts. Every purchase raises the circulating utility of the asset because access passes live as smart tokens anchored to SUBBD liquidity pools. If a concert video goes viral next month, early pass holders can resell their slot, capturing upside that would normally flow only to the platform owner. Adoption does not require the viewer to understand wallets on day one. Email sign-in works, content unlocks, and a custodial vault holds the tokens until the user is ready to explore deeper. That hybrid approach invites millions who ignore crypto headlines yet spend daily on digital media. As the market pivots from narrative trades to tangible use cases, SUBBD writes itself into the story investors care about. Creators keep freedom, audiences gain real ownership. Solaxy Price chatter often circles around Ethereum first, then jumps to Solana, yet the rails connecting those ecosystems remain clunky. Solaxy treats that gap as an opportunity rather than a technical footnote. It deploys a dual execution layer that can post transactions to both chains without forcing users to choose sides. As Ethereum volume climbs, gas fees rise, and traders look for faster venues, Solaxy routes overflow toward Solana while preserving settlement on Ethereum for those who need it. The platform therefore rides two of the most influential narratives driving this looming altcoin season. The mechanism relies on optimistic rollups that synchronize state between the two networks every few minutes. Meanwhile, a directional liquidity engine monitors price corridors and seeds pooled assets where demand spikes. The result feels like a single exchange window even though orders may clear on separate chains. Developers appreciate that they can target either virtual machine with one tool set, saving weeks of porting work. Solaxy also introduces yield channels that automatically stake idle balances in whichever environment offers the higher base return. Users do not have to chase pools or bridge back and forth. Reward tokens compound in the background, adding a passive layer to what begins as simple swapping. $SOLX is now breaking records... üöÄ53M RAISED! üî•üî• pic.twitter.com/J3tguZnTNG ‚Äî SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 16, 2025 Thanks to all these features, SOLX managed to become one of the biggest and most successful presales this year with a meme-based theme. At the time of writing, it has raised upwards of $53 million. As Ethereum rallies and institutional flows push for scalable throughput, Solaxy positions itself as the conveyor belt moving value to the edges. When optimism toward altcoins erupts, infrastructure projects that smooth those paths often outperform, carrying assets across chains smoothly. Snorter Trying to grab a fresh altcoin the instant it surfaces can feel like chasing sparks in a storm. Snorter turns that scramble into a few taps inside Telegram. The bot listens for on-chain liquidity events, sweeps the order book before manual traders even load a chart, and settles each fill at Solana‚Äôs cut-rate fees. Copy trading sits one command away, letting newcomers trail seasoned hunters in real time without studying Solidity or order routing. At first glance, it sounds like a toy for hard-core speculators, yet the service is quietly courting a broader wave of users as institutional flow widens the gap between casual investors and high-speed desks. Retail portfolios swell when altcoin season kicks in, but so does volatility. Traditional interfaces lag, gas spikes, and slippage gouges profits. Snorter sidesteps those bottlenecks by anchoring trades to Solana‚Äôs low-latency network while still reading activity across Ethereum and upcoming Layer 2 hubs. Its routing engine chooses the cheapest path in the background, then pipes the result back to the Telegram chat where the request began. The experience feels more like messaging a friend than executing an algorithmic strategy, which is precisely why adoption curves bend upward when markets heat. For professionals, the appeal is different. They can script conditional orders, mirror wallet behavior from top-performing accounts, and distribute entries across multiple chains in seconds. Every bull run rewards the tools that help traders keep pace with accelerating price action, making it a project worth keeping on the watchlist and following very closely. Conclusion Market data now places Bitcoin dominance on the back foot while institutional bids on Ether keep climbing. Those two conditions often precede the first clear move in altcoins. Retail outflows from key wallets show many traders are still waiting for an obvious trigger, yet history suggests the best gains accrue to positions set before headlines confirm the trend. Assets backed by functional throughput, cross-chain access, and faster settlement tend to attract the earliest rotation of capital. The projects discussed above meet those practical benchmarks and could reward investors who prefer substance over speculation when the wider market finally pivots.

At this point, Chinese company DDC Enterprise plans to accelerate its Bitcoin purchases. DDC Enterprise, which first started buying Bitcoin in May, announced that it will receive a total investment of $528 million in three different ways to increase its BTC purchases. In the official statement, it was stated that the majority of the $528 million fund will be used to purchase Bitcoin. Almost all of the capital increase will be devoted to expanding the Company's Bitcoin treasury. The funding, which is earmarked for the largest single-purpose Bitcoin purchase by any NYSE-listed company, is expected to accelerate DDC‚Äôs mission to build one of the most valuable institutional Bitcoin assets. Norma Chu, Founder and CEO of DDC Enterprise, said: ‚ÄúOur vision is clear: We are building the world's most valuable Bitcoin treasury.

2025-06-17T16:40:47,"Geopolitical Risk: Iran Commander Issues Grave Warning of Escalation","BitcoinWorld Geopolitical Risk: Iran Commander Issues Grave Warning of Escalation In the often unpredictable world of global events, geopolitical developments can send ripples through financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. A recent report highlights a significant warning from a senior Iranian military commander, suggesting a potential escalation of attacks against Israel could be imminent. Understanding the Latest Geopolitical Risk According to a report by Odaily, citing Iran‚Äôs official news agency, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), a high-ranking Iranian military official has issued a stern warning. The commander stated that attacks targeting Israel are expected to intensify significantly in the coming hours. This statement comes amidst already heightened Geopolitical Risk in the region, following previous exchanges and ongoing tensions. Such warnings from senior military figures are typically taken seriously by analysts and governments worldwide, as they can signal a potential shift in the scale or nature of the conflict. Key points from the report: A senior Iranian commander made the statement. The warning points to an escalation of attacks. The escalation is expected within hours. The report cites Iran‚Äôs official news agency, IRNA. How Do Iran Israel Tensions Affect Global Markets? Periods of elevated Iran Israel Tensions historically correlate with increased uncertainty in global financial markets. Investors often react to potential conflict by moving away from riskier assets and towards perceived safe havens like gold or government bonds. The Middle East is a critical region for global energy supplies, and any instability there can directly impact oil prices, which in turn affect inflation and economic forecasts globally. Market reactions can include: Increased volatility across stocks, commodities, and currencies. Potential sell-offs in equity markets. Rise in the price of safe-haven assets. Disruptions to supply chains, particularly energy. While the direct economic ties between the conflicting parties might seem limited on a global scale, the broader implications of regional instability, potential involvement of other actors, and impact on critical resources like oil mean that these tensions have a wide-reaching effect on investor sentiment and market stability. Exploring the Impact on the Crypto Market Amidst Middle East Conflict The relationship between geopolitical events and the Crypto Market Impact is a topic of ongoing debate. Some argue that Bitcoin, often dubbed ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô could serve as a hedge against geopolitical instability and inflation, similar to traditional safe havens. The idea is that it operates outside the traditional financial system and is not tied to any single country‚Äôs economy or political stability. However, in practice, the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has often shown correlation with traditional risk assets like tech stocks. During periods of broad market fear driven by events like the current Middle East Conflict , cryptocurrencies have sometimes seen price declines alongside equities, as investors liquidate assets across the board to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Key considerations for crypto investors: Bitcoin‚Äôs safe-haven narrative is tested during geopolitical crises. Correlation with traditional markets can lead to downside risk. Increased volatility in crypto prices is likely during uncertain times. Global events can affect investor sentiment and adoption rates. While specific attacks or escalations might not have an immediate, direct technical impact on blockchain networks, the resulting fear and uncertainty among global investors can certainly influence trading behavior and price movements in the highly speculative crypto market. Navigating Potential Market Volatility Given the warning of potential escalation and the inherent uncertainty of geopolitical situations, investors should be prepared for increased Market Volatility . This applies not only to traditional assets but also to the crypto market. Actionable insights for investors: Stay Informed: Keep track of reliable news sources regarding the geopolitical situation and market reactions. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how comfortable you are with potential price swings and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Consider Diversification: Ensure your investments are not overly concentrated in assets that might be particularly vulnerable to geopolitical shocks. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Volatility can trigger panic selling. Stick to your long-term investment strategy rather than making impulsive moves based on short-term news. Understand Crypto‚Äôs Role: Recognize that while crypto offers unique features, it is not immune to macro global events and market sentiment shifts. Geopolitical events are significant external factors that can influence market dynamics, often rapidly and with little warning. While impossible to predict the exact outcome or market reaction, being aware of the risks and having a prepared mindset can help navigate turbulent times. What Does This Mean for the Future Crypto Market Impact? The current situation underscores how interconnected global finance is, even for emerging asset classes like cryptocurrency. The Crypto Market Impact of geopolitical events like rising Iran Israel Tensions serves as a reminder that while crypto operates on decentralized technology, its valuation and adoption are still heavily influenced by global macroeconomic and political forces. As the situation in the Middle East develops, market participants will be closely watching for signs of de-escalation or further conflict. Each development will likely contribute to the ongoing narrative about crypto‚Äôs role in a world facing various economic and political uncertainties. Ultimately, the ability of crypto to function as a true safe haven during crises remains a subject of observation and debate. Events like these provide real-world scenarios to study how this nascent asset class behaves under pressure. Summary A senior Iranian commander‚Äôs warning of escalating attacks on Israel within hours introduces a significant layer of Geopolitical Risk into the global landscape. Such developments in the Middle East Conflict naturally heighten Iran Israel Tensions and are expected to increase Market Volatility across traditional financial systems. While the Crypto Market Impact is complex and debated, historical trends suggest that cryptocurrencies are unlikely to be entirely insulated from the fear and uncertainty that grips global markets during such times. Investors are advised to stay informed, assess their risk exposure, and approach the coming hours and days with caution and a clear strategy.

This is part of a larger goal to invest up to $342 million in Bitcoin over time through its at-the-market (ATM) offering program. The company‚Äôs move reflects a rising trend, as more firms add Bitcoin to their financial reserves. Blockchain Group To Fund Bitcoin Purchases With New Shares During the official announcement , the Paris-listed firm said it will issue about 1.6 million new shares to fund this acquisition. The average price for each share is expected to be ‚Ç¨4.49, equivalent to $5.19. These funds will support its ongoing Bitcoin acquisition efforts. This move follows last week‚Äôs announcement of a larger program with TOMAB, a French asset manager and investor in the company. As part of that plan, the company also revealed plans to raise an additional ‚Ç¨9.7 million, worth $11.2 million, through a mix of equity and convertible bond issuance. These steps show the company‚Äôs clear focus on building a strong Bitcoin treasury. Meanwhile, Matthew Sigel of VanEck recently raised concerns about small-cap companies claiming to build significant crypto investments. He said many of these firms have weak finances and low market value. Their crypto investment announcements may boost stock prices rather than reflect real business plans. Blockchain Group Joins Growing List of Major BTC Holders This move is part of a broader trend where more companies hold Bitcoin as a key treasury asset . Once viewed as too unstable for corporate finances, Bitcoin is now gaining acceptance as a long-term store of value. Many now see the digital coin as a long-term store of value and a safe haven during economic crises. Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, which recently added 10,100 BTC to its balanced sheet is leading the trend. The Nasdaq-listed company now owns 592,100 BTC, the most significant amount held by any publicly traded firm. Meanwhile, according to public data, Blockchain Groups holds a modest stash of 1,471 BTC. Market Reaction and Price Movements Despite the news, Blockchain Group‚Äôs stock dropped more than 4% and is now trading at around ‚Ç¨5.53 on Euronext Growth Paris.

""There's Only One Reason for This!""","One of the expected events that will trigger a rise in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins is the US Federal Reserve (FED) starting to cut interest rates. At this point, tomorrow's FED June interest rate decision will be more important, while the general expectation in the market is that the FED will keep interest rates constant. While the possibility of the FED making a surprise move is almost non-existent, analysts argue that the FED is actually in a position to cut interest rates. FED May Cut Interest Rates But‚Ä¶! Accordingly, analyst Nick Timiraos said the FED will keep interest rates steady and evaluate the impact of tariffs on inflation. Nick Timiraos expects the Fed to keep interest rates on hold this week despite recent inflation improvements, amid ongoing concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on price expectations. According to the analyst, although inflation data has moderated in the last three months, Fed members remain concerned about how tariff-related cuts could affect future inflation data. At this point, the Fed will continue its cautious approach, according to the analyst. The Reason FED Doesn't Cut Interest Rates Is Only Political! Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya also claimed that the FED could cut interest rates right now, but it did not do so for just one reason. Speaking on the All-In Podcast, Chamath Palihapitiya argued that the Fed will not be cutting interest rates in the near future, pointing to politics as the reason for this. Stating that the possibility of a rate cut in the summer months is quite low, the famous name argued that the FED could make a 100 basis point cut right now. Stating that such a move would reduce the US debt by $300 billion, the famous name claimed that it would be good for the US and the economy in every way, not just debt savings. ‚ÄúIf there's a numerical justification for lowering interest rates and it has all these positive effects for the U.S. economy, why not do it? ‚ÄúThe only answer is political.

2025-06-17T16:10:47,"Brazilian stock exchange begins trading Ethereum and Solana futures contracts in US dollars","B3, a Brazilian stock exchange, has started trading Ethereum and Solana futures contracts in US dollars. The firm announced the groundbreaking development Monday, stating that quoted prices for the products will reference Nasdaq Ether and Solana indices. With this, B3 is consolidating its reach in the crypto derivatives sector as it already offers Bitcoin futures contracts with around $4 billion in daily trading volume on the exchange. Derivative contracts expose investors to the expected price adjustments for crypto assets without owning a single coin. The exchange wrote: ‚ÄúWith the new cryptoasset futures, B3 meets the growing market and investor demand for products with exposure to cryptocurrencies, bringing more innovation and sophistication to products.‚Äù The announcement added that each unit of the Ethereum futures contract will be 0.25 ETH while the Solana contract unit will be 5 SOL. Thus, this will make the product more accessible while offering users familiar with crypto a safe and regulated way to trade on price volatility. B3 has a long history of offering crypto-focused products for investors, with the exchange launching its first digital assets-related product, HASH11, in 2021. It now has 21 crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs) of ETFs available for investors. B3 announces changes in Bitcoin futures contract size Meanwhile, the stock exchange has also reduced the unit size of its Bitcoin futures contract by ten times, with a unit now worth 0.01 BTC (approximately 6,000 Brazilian Real). This follows approval by the Brazilian securities regulator (CVM). This move is part of its efforts to make the Bitcoin futures contract, which launched in 2024, more accessible, not only for Brazilian traders but also for international investors. For instance, US investors have enjoyed access to Bitcoin Future and Bitcoin Future Scrolling products on B3 since May. Unlike the Ethereum and Solana futures contract, the Bitcoin futures trade in Brazilian Real and the reduction in unit size also took effect on June 16, the same day as the launch of the two new products. In one year of having Bitcoin futures, 41 million contracts were negotiated, and in April 2025 alone, 4 million were negotiated. Brazil‚Äôs crypto sector continues to grow With many countries still struggling to understand and regulate crypto, B3‚Äôs new products capture how Brazil is growing into a major crypto hub in Latin America. By pricing its new products in US Dollars, the exchange particularly shows its interest in attracting international investors to the country. Interestingly, the country has seen significant levels of adoption as it ranks ninth globally on the Chainalysis Global Adoption Index for 2024 while ranking second in value received for the Latin America region with $90.3 billion. Brazilian fintech Meliuz also recently adopted the Bitcoin treasury. However, there are regulatory pressures from several angles. The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has expressed concerns about stablecoin use in the country, claiming it enables money laundering and tax evasion. It is now making efforts to regulate stablecoins, with recently proposed rules that could limit the transfer of stablecoins across wallets. However, stakeholders have warned that rules must not overregulate the sector to avoid killing innovation. Still, more setbacks might be coming with the recent removal of tax exemptions on capital gains for small-scale crypto holders. The move, part of new tax policies under Provisional Measure 1303, imposed a flat 17.5% tax on all gains from crypto assets. However, the new rules have already faced pushback from crypto stakeholders who believe that they could affect the competitiveness of the country‚Äôs crypto sector. Lawmakers have queried the new tax regime for not involving stakeholders, with some even pushing to repeal it. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The trader, known as AguilaTrades on X, entered a bitcoin long position at $106,000, and sat through at Monday's high of $108,800 before the largest cryptocurrency took a tumble to trade recently around $104,000. Bitcoin volatility has been relatively low for months, with the price ranging between the $100,000 level of support and record highs around $110,000. That hasn't perturbed derivatives traders, who are continually betting on upside with leverage, subsequently getting chopped in a tight range. It's not the first time AguilaTrades has recorded a losing trade at these levels. Last week they were up $5.8 million on a BTC long before losing $12.5 million, according to Lookonchain . On paper the trade has credentials because BTC has managed to remain above $100,000 despite escalating conflict in the Middle East, which is typically a catalyst for downside in risk assets. However, remaining agnostic to price action in this range and simply buying support and selling resistance would have yielded far greater results.

Coinbase to Expand its Products According to the report, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, stated that Coinbase will provide access to ‚Äòtokenized equities‚Äô by leveraging blockchain technology. Thus, the crypto exchange might expand into a new line of business and become a competitor to Robinhood, Revolut, and similar platforms. Grewal told Reuters that ‚Äòtokenized equities‚Äô have become a ‚Äòtop priority‚Äô for the crypto exchange. This product would allow its users to gain exposure to the US financial markets, but without directly purchasing or going through the requirements to buy the stock. Instead, users would hold tokenized versions of these assets. Coinbase and other companies in the legacy and crypto industry are keen to offer these products to on-board new users, reduce costs, and provide faster transactions for its users. The US SEC declined to comment on this potential expansion. However, Reuters noted that currently the US lacks a market for trading ‚Äòtokenized equities.‚Äô Thus, if Coinbase gets the approval it could become the first to offer this product in the country, opening the door for more exchanges to diversify their offerings. Moreover, the report noted the change in the US SEC and in the Federal Government regarding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In the previous administration, Coinbase, Kraken, Binance.US, and several DeFi protocols were targeted by the regulator for allegedly offering ‚Äòunregistered securities‚Äô in the country. However, less than a year later and under the Trump administration, the country has changed its approach to a more favorable stance regarding the nascent sector. Coinbase‚Äôs CLO claims that the platform has already filed a request to the SEC, but they are still waiting for its approval. Grewal stated: With a no action letter, an issuer of a tokenized equity or a platform that wishes to offer secondary trading in those equities can have some confidence, some comfort, that the SEC has adopted its view of why this product is compliant. It‚Äôs that confidence that has been lacking so far, and I think really held back a lot of the institutional adoption. The New Meta in Crypto? There has been a lot of buzz in the crypto market regarding equities. Earlier this week, Justin Sun, founder of the TRON blockchain, inked a deal to take its native token TRX to the US stock exchange. The deal, supported by a company linked to Donald Trump, will take form via a merger with an already existing company trading in the US. This is just one of the many deals and potential partnerships looking to take crypto into the US financial markets. As Nic Carter, General Partner at Castle Island Ventures, stated the narrative currently dominating crypto, and the one more likely to take control of the market in the next year, is simply stocks. Carter stated: Most of my crypto trading GCs just talk about stocks now. the new meta is literally just stocks.

2025-06-17T15:55:50,"Thailand approves a five-year income tax exemption on crypto","The Thai cabinet has approved a personal income tax exemption on profits from trading digital assets through regulated exchanges. The plan has been confirmed by the Deputy Finance Minister of Thailand, Chulaphan Amornvivat, and was publicly announced . The move aligns with the nation‚Äôs effort to establish its footprint in the blockchain and digital currency space across Southeast Asia. The new policy, which takes immediate effect, applies to individual investors trading on authorized platforms and will remain in place until 2029, according to the Ministry of Finance. Previously, such profits from crypto trading were part of a person‚Äôs income and were subject to progressive tax rates. That was a source of tension for both small-time investors and big players, some of whom looked to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Now, with the tax removed, the Thai government believes it will be able to foster a way for fresh capital to flow into the market and encourage the global adoption of blockchain technology. The waiver is limited to transactions on government-approved platforms. The new tax relief will not apply to unauthorized exchange investors; some could even face fines . Thailand welcomes the world to crypto investment The tax-free period is one aspect of a broader national initiative to turn Thailand into a hub for digital asset innovation. The government aims to promote a strong financial technology sector, including cryptocurrencies, asset-backed or ‚Äútokenized‚Äù currencies, and blockchain-based financial services. Thailand has gradually been opening to digital finance. The SEC endorsed using stablecoins such as Tether‚Äôs USDt and Circle‚Äôs USDC on regulated venues in early 2024. The country is also considering crypto-tied debit and credit card services for tourists as part of a broader commitment to digitizing spending and increasing financial inclusion . Heavyweights in the industry will see the tax policy as a game-changing event. Social media reaction has been almost universally good. Crypto influencers and traders on X (formerly Twitter) describe the move as a breath of fresh air when contrasted with restrictive regimes in other countries. Thailand‚Äôs largest digital asset exchange, Bitkub, has the most to gain, particularly after Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price hike. With more than 5 million registered users and daily trading volumes approaching 2 billion baht ($54 million), it‚Äôs in a good place for that‚ÄÇrebound in investor appetite. Thailand balances crypto tax relief with tight oversight The policy has generated optimism but also‚ÄÇsome wariness among experts. Removing taxes from a highly volatile and speculative asset class might cause a chronically stretched government to lose some much-needed funds ‚Äì especially as digital assets are increasingly being used and viewed as ‚Äústore of value‚Äù vehicles. Others also caution that bringing in speculative capital may disrupt Thailand‚Äôs financial markets with inadequate regulation. Additionally, there is worry about investor protection, particularly for less sophisticated retail traders who may be attracted to the siren song of tax-free profits without a real grasp on the risks. Thailand‚Äôs Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has responded swiftly. The commission said it would maintain onerous licensing standards and closely monitor the market. In the last few months, the SEC has moved against unlicensed crypto platforms, such as Bybit and OKX, preventing them from serving Thai users. The Thai cabinet has also agreed on changes to the Digital Asset Business Act to protect crypto investors better, enhance cybercrime surveillance, and increase the transparency of the cryptocurrency industry.

2025-06-17T15:40:48,"Bitcoin Rebounds as Institutions Buy the Dip ‚Äî JPMorgan Says Hashrate Hits Record","Bitcoin is making a quiet but notable comeback, with institutional buyers stepping in to scoop up the dip. JPMorgan‚Äôs latest report reveals that the Bitcoin network‚Äôs hashrate has hit an all-time high‚Äîoften seen as a sign of long-term confidence from miners and big-money players alike. While price action remains tense, this surge in network strength hints at a possible shift in momentum. As BTC stabilizes, eyes are turning to which other cryptocurrencies could ride the wave next. In this analysis, we break down Bitcoin‚Äôs current setup and explore where the smart money may flow next. Bitcoin Price Struggles as Bulls Show Weakness Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current range sits between roughly $102,000 and $110,000, marking a slight tension in its movement. Recent data points to bulls losing their grip, with prices dipping about 3.7% in the past week. The coin is approaching the support level near $98,600, while resistance looms at around $114,000. With an RSI under 40, bearish tendencies appear stronger now. However, over the last month, Bitcoin has grown by nearly 3%, showing potential for resurgence. If bullish momentum gains, it could aim for the second resistance, just over $121,000, capturing a near 20% gain from the current lower price of $102,000. Yet, for now, cautious optimism prevails. Conclusion Bitcoin‚Äôs rebound, paired with record-breaking hashrate growth, sends a clear signal: institutions are far from bearish. Despite short-term price hesitations, the long-term fundamentals are strengthening‚Äîlaying the groundwork for a broader market recovery. If BTC pushes beyond key resistance levels, it could trigger a wider rally across altcoins. For now, cautious optimism prevails, but with deep-pocket investors stepping in and network health surging, Bitcoin‚Äôs next big move may be closer than it looks‚Äîand other major coins may soon follow.

2025-06-17T15:32:44,"Quantum Biopharma Adds 100,000 XRP to its Crypto Treasury","Quantum Biopharma, a publicly traded Canadian biopharmaceutical company, has expanded its digital asset holdings with the purchase of 100,000 XRP, according to a report shared by crypto analyst Xaif on X. Though the company has not yet released an official press statement, the move adds to its growing crypto treasury and signals deepening interest in Ripple‚Äôs native token from institutional players. At XRP‚Äôs current trading price of $2.20, the acquisition represents an investment of approximately $220,000. This latest addition builds on Quantum‚Äôs broader crypto strategy, which has already seen it allocate millions to digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) over the past six months. Inside Quantum‚Äôs Crypto Playbook Quantum Biopharma entered the crypto space in December 2024 with an initial $1 million investment in BTC and other selected tokens. On May 19, 2025, the company expanded its digital portfolio to $4.5 million, followed by another capital injection on June 10, bringing its total crypto holdings to $5 million. The XRP purchase is believed to be part of this most recent treasury expansion, as per Xaif‚Äôs disclosure. Just In: Quantum Biopharma has added 100,000 $XRP to its crypto treasury! Pharma meets crypto ‚Äî are more institutions eyeing #XRP next? #Ripple #XRPL #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/MjM8v5Rm9W ‚Äî ùïèaif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 17, 2025 All assets are held in custody by BitGo, a trusted institutional provider offering cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and regulatory-grade compliance. This custodial arrangement ensures the company‚Äôs crypto holdings remain secure and auditable. Quantum‚Äôs CEO, Zeeshan Saeed, has previously emphasized that crypto is not merely a speculative bet, but a deliberate part of the company‚Äôs treasury management strategy. According to Saeed, the goals include protecting shareholder value, hedging against currency depreciation‚Äîespecially the Canadian dollar‚Äîand exploring opportunities for yield generation through staking where applicable. Why XRP? XRP‚Äôs inclusion in the portfolio highlights the company‚Äôs interest in assets with real-world utility. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily viewed as a store of value, XRP is designed for fast, low-cost international transactions and is already used by financial institutions and payment providers through Ripple‚Äôs growing network. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Quantum‚Äôs decision to add XRP comes when the token regains institutional attention, buoyed by ongoing regulatory clarity and Ripple‚Äôs expanding partnerships across the financial sector. Though not XRP‚Äôs highest historical price, its current valuation of $2.20 reflects the asset‚Äôs resilience. A Pioneer in Pharma-Fintech Integration Quantum Biopharma stands out in the pharmaceutical industry for its proactive adoption of blockchain assets. While most biotech and pharma firms have avoided exposure to crypto due to perceived volatility and regulatory uncertainty, Quantum is carving a different path‚Äîone that blends traditional healthcare with modern finance. The company‚Äôs crypto strategy has also been well-received by investors. Quantum‚Äôs stock (QNTM) has attracted increasing attention from both individual and institutional investors since its initial investment in December 2024, thanks to its forward-thinking financial strategy. As the line between traditional finance and digital assets continues to blur, Quantum Biopharma‚Äôs latest XRP acquisition sends a clear message: blockchain-based finance is no longer confined to the tech sector. With this move, the company strengthens its position as a leader in integrating decentralized tools into legacy industries.

2025-06-17T15:30:52,"XRP Must Complete Right Shoulder Before Takeoff‚ÄîBut How Low First?","XRP bulls appear to be facing one last test of conviction before the market‚Äôs next explosive phase, according to CryptoInsightUK‚Äôs video analysis released on 16 June. The British analyst argues that the token is sculpting an inverse head-and-shoulders formation whose right shoulder ‚Äústill needs to form around the high-$1.80s‚Äù before any sustained rally can commence. How Low Must XRP Go? In the broadcast, he emphasised that ‚Äúdense liquidity is below us,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of resting bids and stop-loss clusters between roughly $1.92 and $1.80. ‚ÄúI still think it comes down to make the right shoulder which is around 1.88,‚Äù he said, adding that a swift wash-out into that pocket would ‚Äúflush the lows, tap in there and send it.‚Äù At present, XRP is changing hands near $2.24, up about 3% over the past 24 hours, which implies a prospective drawdown of roughly 20% if the market fulfills his downside scenario. From the analyst‚Äôs vantage point, such a retreat is less a cause for alarm than a prerequisite for the next major leg higher: ‚ÄúIf we come down first, we‚Äôve done the downside part. Otherwise I‚Äôm still going to be worried about going down even if we come up to $2.42 or higher.‚Äù Related Reading: What Are The Implications For XRP If Ripple Captures 14% Of SWIFT‚Äôs Volume? He linked the bearish short-term bias to structural forces beyond the XRP Ledger‚Äôs ecosystem. Bitcoin dominance, he noted, has crept toward a historical inflection zone that previously triggered alt-seasons: ‚ÄúAnywhere in this box could be the start of alt-season‚Ä¶ That would probably coincide with Bitcoin dropping to between $100,000 and $93,000.‚Äù A dominance spike fed by a late-cycle Bitcoin dip, he argued, would typically inflict outsized percentage losses on major altcoins‚Äîincluding XRP‚Äîbefore liquidity rotates back into them. Within XRP‚Äôs own order book, CryptoInsightUK highlighted a ‚Äúliquidity vacuum‚Äù created by May‚Äôs capitulation candle. Although the token has since retraced most of that single-session collapse, he described the rebound as ‚Äúchoppy corrective price action,‚Äù lacking the conviction and volume that accompanied earlier impulse waves. The right-shoulder flush, in his view, would neutralise residual leverage, particularly among traders who re-loaded longs too aggressively during the $2.15‚Äì$2.40 bounce. How High Can XRP Explode? The inverse head-and-shoulders thesis also features prominently on his long-range chart, stretching back to mid-May. The analyst first published the pattern on X, showing a left shoulder near $2.42, a head at $1.47, and a neckline just above $2.50. Completing a symmetrical right shoulder near $1.88 would, by classical pattern-measuring rules, project an upside target above $3.50‚Äîa level not visited since late-2021‚Äôs cycle top. Related Reading: Still Sleeping On XRP? Analyst Says $8 Breakout Is ‚ÄòJust Waiting‚Äô Liquidity dynamics across the broader market reinforce his caution. Open interest in perpetual swaps for Ether, he observed, remains ‚Äúas high as it‚Äôs ever been,‚Äù suggesting that any sudden drop in majors could spark a forced-liquidation cascade across altcoin pairs. ‚ÄúThese people will be flushed out,‚Äù he warned, calling attention to negative-funding episodes that hint at an overcrowded short base waiting to be squeezed‚Äîonce the final downside pocket has been filled. Despite the near-term jitters, CryptoInsightUK reiterated a resolutely bullish macro stance. ‚ÄúThe next stage I‚Äôm most certain about is that we‚Äôre going to go significantly higher for crypto,‚Äù he told viewers. Drawing parallels with gold‚Äôs record weekly close, he argued that an undercurrent of global risk aversion is quietly supporting non-sovereign stores of value, positioning both Bitcoin and XRP for accelerated appreciation once the technical reset concludes. For long-term holders, his advice was unequivocal: avoid wholesale portfolio shifts and instead treat any sub-$2.00 wick as a final accumulation window. ‚ÄúDollar-cost averaging from here is a good thing to do,‚Äù he said, revealing that 97% of his own capital remains in spot positions, with only a single-digit percentage reserved for surgical bids in the $1.80‚Äì$1.92 zone. Whether XRP respects that script will become clear in the days ahead. Should the market indeed sweep into the high-$1.80s and rebound with the aggressive thrust the analyst expects, the right shoulder will be complete‚Äîand the runway clear‚Äîfor the long-awaited take-off. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23.

The project has raised $804,511 so far. Husky Inu (HINU) Registers Latest Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) has registered the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00018045 to $0.00018098. The jump comes at a testing time for the broader crypto ecosystem, as escalating tensions in the Middle East have put pressure on the market. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies registered a steep decline on Monday after starting the week positively. The price jump is part of Husky Inu‚Äôs HINU) pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The pre-launch phase allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date draws closer. It is the next strategic step in the Husky Inu roadmap, designed to raise additional capital to fund ongoing development, platform improvements, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a dynamic pricing strategy, allowing the project to increase the token price every two days. The phase will end once the project meets its fundraising goal or the HINU tokens sell out. Another Milestone Reached Husky Inu‚Äôs dynamic pricing strategy has allowed the project to raise the price of the HINU token every two days.

Despite ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù sentiment and exhaustion among traders, the actual price pullback from recent highs has been modest at just -10%, representing more of a ‚Äútime-based capitulation‚Äù rather than a price-driven plunge. In their estimation, failure to hold this level risks a deeper correction. At the same time, sustained support could pave the way to challenge the final major resistance near $108,890, pushing the asset into what he called ‚ÄúPrice Discovery Uptrend 2.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs long as BTC holds $104400, then it is positioned for upside over time,‚Äù declared the analyst. Though sluggish, the transition is notable for producing higher lows and diamond-shaped formations, technical signals that often precede strong upward movements. Market Behavior Even geopolitical jitters caused by the ongoing military conflict between Israel and Iran have failed to derail Bitcoin‚Äôs structural support seriously , further strengthening its bullish case. At the time of writing, BTC was trading around $105,569, a 2% drop over the past 24 hours. It also shaved about 3.4% from its value in the last seven days, while maintaining a 60.2% gain across 12 months. A tightening consolidation near the cryptocurrency‚Äôs all-time high of $111,814 could also signal growing tension, with investor Daan Crypto Trades noting that the monthly range is ‚Äúextremely likely‚Äù to break in June. He warned that a ‚Äúlarge move is coming in the next couple of weeks,‚Äù even as on-chain data shared by Axel Adler Jr. revealed a sustained drop in Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) Momentum below zero, indicating reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. Coupled with a continued decline in exchange-held BTC, the setup points toward a market primed for supply shocks.

The filing triggered a strong response from the XRP community, especially after it became clear that XRP was excluded. One of the most prominent voices who reacted to the news was Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL). He tagged the president, asking why XRP is excluded. The comment reflects the broader sentiment among XRP holders who have been waiting for more signs of institutional recognition, particularly in the form of more ETF filings. No XRP wtf man @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/UR5E5HFkxt ‚Äî Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 16, 2025 XRP ETF Landscape and Institutional Moves The timing of this exclusion has raised questions, considering the current state of ETF applications. More than 11 XRP ETF filings are currently pending with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and industry observers view XRP as a viable candidate for future spot ETFs. Teucrium, a commodities ETF provider, recently launched a leveraged XRP ETF, which it tagged as the most successful launch in its history. Yet XRP remains absent from the Truth Social plan. Speculation on XRP‚Äôs Omission While the Bitcoin and Ethereum filings mark a significant institutional step, many in the XRP community believe that XRP‚Äôs omission may be temporary or intentional. Several responses under Cobb‚Äôs post suggest that another filing, including XRP, might follow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 One user speculated that a separate ETF could be in the works, focusing mainly on XRP, SOL, and ADA. Notably, these three assets were included in Trump‚Äôs crypto reserve announcement , suggesting that the president is interested in them. Another commenter pointed to the pending legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, and this case has historically caused hesitation. Other members of the XRP community echoed similar theories or took a more defiant stance. One user commented that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need one,‚Äù suggesting that Bitcoin will eventually collapse. Another implied that a potential 1,000% pump from ETFs cannot happen yet due to a coordinated strategy. This view reinforces a common belief within the XRP community that institutional players are deliberately withholding public support until the timing is optimal, possibly after regulatory hurdles are resolved. A recent TimesTabloid report discussed reasons why Eric Trump has not publicly supported XRP . The Trumps could be waiting for full legal clarity before engaging fully with the digital asset that many believe will lead the financial revolution.

US-based miners generally hold more than 40% of the hashrate, but listed companies are now in charge of large-scale mining centers. Bitcoin mining has changed its approach multiple times, evolving past personal computers into ASIC. In the past few years, mining is only viable through large-scale operations, leading to the creation of dedicated data centers. Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at Van Eck, noted that corporate miners controlled over 30% of the hashrate for the first time after a period of constant growth. In total, exchange-listed miners had 31.8% of the Bitcoin network hashrate. üá∫üá∏ pic.twitter.com/Y9enIzQwea ‚Äî matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) June 17, 2025 The Bitcoin network produces blocks with a near-record hashrate, close to 900 EH/s, with peak difficulty. Previous narratives of miner capitulation did not materialize, as large-scale miners can afford to mine at a loss. Long-term corporate miners have a lower cost basis and can afford to hold coins for the long term. BTC mining is currently viable based on prices above $100,000. Miners are also not shy about building new data centers, tapping the remaining BTC block rewards while also seeking ways to branch out to new crypto assets and AI computation. BTC mining stocks, in general, rise during favorable market periods. | Source: Hashrate Index The list of 13 BTC corporate miners tracked by Morgan Stanley shows they nearly doubled their output in the past year. The growth was linked to previous plans to launch new data centers with favorable energy contracts. Corporate miners either use their data centers for solo block production or join pools. Foundry Digital, the top US-based pool, now carries 29.1% of the total hashrate. The pool produces up to 33% of all BTC for each 100-block interval. BTC corporate miners use reserves to pivot into AI For crypto natives, the mining situation is entirely normalized, with no signs of distressed conditions. However, BTC miners are not relying on block rewards for the long term. Transaction fees produce under $500K per day, even during busy periods, and may be insufficient to sustain operations or renew mining and data centers. BTC mining stocks benefit from the general recovery of the crypto market. The BTC miner index is up in the past quarter, bouncing from the lows in April and March. Miners are still estimating ways to extend their operations, especially after the 2024 halving. Top miners like Mara Holdings, Riot Platform, IREN, and others are also using traditional fundraising to finance their shift into AI computation. Bitcoin miners ( $MARA $IREN $CLSK $CIFR $RIOT ) are raising big cash via equity (50-115% of capital) to survive post-2024 halving.

BlackRock and Fidelity Continue to Lead the ETF Race Among the ETFs, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains the frontrunner. It pulled in $266.60 million on Monday alone and has now amassed $50.03 billion in total net inflows. Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC also performed strongly, adding $82.96 million in net flows. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, however, lagged behind significantly with just $12.84 million in inflows and continues to reflect a total net outflow of $23.23 billion since its inception. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Taiwan-based Kronos Research, emphasized that institutional investors appear to be focusing on long-term strategies. ‚ÄúDespite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, institutions are looking past short-term volatility and focusing on long-term positioning,‚Äù Liu told Cointelegraph. He added, ‚ÄúSteady Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect growing trust in BTC‚Äôs resilience, accessibility, and role as a hedge in a shifting macro environment.‚Äù Bitcoin Price Volatile, But Underlying Structure Intact While ETF inflows remain strong, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has faced some turbulence. A surprise Israeli strike on Iran last Friday triggered a broader sell-off, pushing Bitcoin down more than 7% and ending the week in the red. Bitfinex analysts noted that the market showed signs of capitulation, with Net Taker Volume hitting a multi-week low of $197 million. ‚ÄúThis selling, however, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation-style setups that often mark local bottoms,‚Äù they stated in a report released Monday. They also observed that if Bitcoin can maintain support between $102,000 and $103,000, it may indicate that downward pressure is being absorbed and could suggest a potential rebound in the near term. Despite the brief price dip, the continued inflows into ETFs suggest growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a resilient asset class, even amid uncertain global conditions.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/u-s-bitcoin-etfs-extend-inflow-streak-as-institutional-interest-holds-steady/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T14:20:34,"Russia hits crypto farm in ramp up to illegal mining operators","Law enforcement authorities in Russia have closed down a large crypto mining farm that operated outside the law in the middle of Siberia. The industrial coin minting facility, which occupied almost 30,000 square meters of land, has been targeted amid an ongoing crackdown on illegal mining across the vast country. Russian court bans Bitcoin farm plugged into the power grid without permit A court in Russia‚Äôs Krasnoyarsk Krai has stopped the illegal mining of cryptocurrencies for millions of rubles a month, the region‚Äôs prosecutor‚Äôs office announced. The large coin-producing operation was set up in the city of Nazarovo. The unusual facility, which minted crypto in open air and behind a barbed wire fence, attracted the attention of the local community, RBC Crypto reported on Monday, quoting a press release which was also published on Telegram. Regional authorities said the property was registered as a non-residential building on an industrial site with a total area of 29,800 square meters. However, law enforcement officials established that the land plot had been repurposed. Prosecutors explained: ‚ÄúIn reality, the territory is occupied by transformers, power plants, mobile centers and other equipment that was leased, together with a non-existent building, to another organization for 4.6 million rubles (nearly $60,000) a month.‚Äù The operator of the illegal mining farm connected the hardware to the city‚Äôs power grid without obtaining the proper permits and rights to use the state-owned land. Inspectors also reported violations of fire safety regulations, the article detailed. Initially, the prosecutor‚Äôs office demanded that the miner address the registered violations, but their request was ignored. Eventually, a lawsuit was filed, which resulted in the ban of mining operations at the site until these are eliminated. Russia busts large crypto mining farm. Photo: Prosecutor‚Äôs Office of Krasnoyarsk. Source: RBC Crypto Russia cracks down on illegal cryptocurrency miners Crypto mining in the Russian Federation, which was legalized last year, has been blamed by local authorities across the country for causing excessive load on power distribution networks, resulting in breakdowns and blackouts. Their concerns have led to seasonal and permanent restrictions on the energy-intensive activity in many parts of the country. But while a blanket ban on mining has already affected almost a dozen Russian regions, a report earlier in June indicated that Moscow is halting its expansion . Citing a drop in tax revenues and decreasing electricity sales, the federal government now wants to shift its focus to targeting illegal mining farms rather than all mining firms. Recently announced legislative changes seek to punish the so-called ‚Äúgray‚Äù miners with hefty fines and crypto confiscation. Back in February of this year, the authorities in Krasnoyarsk Krai, one of the most popular mining destinations in Russia, charged an employee of a local utility with taking 600,000 rubles in bribes to cover up the activities of illegal miners who caused damages exceeding 9 million rubles. This month, engineers from the local energy distributing company in the Russian republic of Buryatia discovered 95 mining rigs hidden in the back of a truck. The improvised mobile mining farm was connected to the power lines supplying electricity to a village in the Pribaikalsky district. This week, police in Ingushetia announced they have detained a man who stole 2.34 million rubles‚Äô worth of electricity to power 65 coin-minting devices illegally tapped into the grid. The mining installation, found in a utility room, had been connected to a substation, bypassing electricity meters. The North Caucasian republic is among the Russian regions where cryptocurrency mining has been completely prohibited until the spring of 2031. The list includes territories from the Far East to the Russia-occupied oblasts of Ukraine. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?
