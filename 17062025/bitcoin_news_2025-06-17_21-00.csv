2025-06-17T18:50:48,"Massive $528M Boost: DDC Enterprise Expands Bitcoin Treasury","BitcoinWorld Massive $528M Boost: DDC Enterprise Expands Bitcoin Treasury In a significant move signaling growing corporate confidence in digital assets, e-commerce company DDC Enterprise has successfully raised a substantial sum to bolster its Bitcoin treasury . This isn’t just another funding round; it’s a strategic push to accumulate one of the world’s most sought-after digital assets on a large scale. The news highlights a fascinating trend where companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional financial instruments to manage their reserves. Understanding DDC Enterprise’s Bold Bitcoin Move So, what exactly happened? DDC Enterprise announced it secured $528 million through a series of securities purchase agreements. Think of this as selling a stake in the company or a future claim on its assets in exchange for immediate cash. The primary purpose? To acquire Bitcoin . The company has made it clear that the vast majority of these newly acquired funds are earmarked specifically for building a significant corporate holding of the cryptocurrency. This isn’t a small side project; DDC Enterprise aims to position itself among the companies with the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries globally. Key players involved in this massive raise include prominent names from the crypto and blockchain world: Animoca Brands: A major force in blockchain gaming and the metaverse space. Their participation underscores the convergence of different digital sectors. QCP Capital: A well-known Singapore-based crypto trading firm. Their involvement suggests confidence in the market’s future trajectory and Bitcoin’s role within it. The fact that established players like Animoca Brands and QCP Capital are backing this initiative speaks volumes about the perceived value and strategic importance of holding Bitcoin as a corporate asset. Why Are Companies Building Bitcoin Treasuries? DDC Enterprise isn’t operating in a vacuum. A growing number of companies, most famously led by MicroStrategy, have been adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. But why? What’s the allure of holding a volatile digital asset instead of traditional cash or bonds? Here are some key reasons driving the trend of building a Bitcoin treasury : Inflation Hedge: With concerns about inflation rising globally, many see Bitcoin, with its capped supply (only 21 million ever), as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a reliable store of value in the digital age, similar to how gold has been viewed historically. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can provide diversification away from traditional financial assets, which may behave differently during economic shifts. Exposure to a New Asset Class: Holding Bitcoin gives companies direct exposure to the burgeoning digital economy and the potential growth of cryptocurrencies. Forward-Thinking Strategy: For some companies, holding Bitcoin is seen as a forward-thinking strategic move, signaling adaptability and a willingness to embrace future financial paradigms. For DDC Enterprise, an e-commerce company, integrating this level of crypto investment into its treasury strategy could also align with potential future plans involving blockchain, digital payments, or loyalty programs, though the primary stated goal here is asset accumulation. The Scale and Significance of $528 Million Let’s put this number into perspective. $528 million is a substantial amount of capital. While it might not immediately place DDC Enterprise at the very top of the list of corporate Bitcoin holders (MicroStrategy holds billions worth), it certainly propels them into the ranks of companies with significant exposure. This level of crypto investment from an e-commerce company, backed by major players like Animoca Brands and QCP Capital, underscores a few important points: Institutional Confidence: It demonstrates increasing confidence from institutional investors and crypto-native firms in the long-term viability and value proposition of Bitcoin as a corporate asset. Sector Diversification: It shows that the trend of building a corporate Bitcoin treasury is spreading beyond just tech or financial companies into sectors like e-commerce. Market Impact: A half-billion-dollar allocation to Bitcoin can have a noticeable impact on market dynamics, especially during periods of lower liquidity. It represents significant buy pressure. The ambition to build ‘one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries’ is a bold statement and indicates a long-term commitment to this strategy by DDC Enterprise. Potential Benefits and Challenges Embarking on such a large-scale crypto investment strategy comes with potential upsides and risks. Potential Benefits: Asset Appreciation: If the price of Bitcoin increases, the value of DDC Enterprise’s treasury holding would grow significantly, potentially boosting the company’s balance sheet. Attracting Investment: A strong Bitcoin position might attract investors interested in companies with exposure to digital assets. Industry Leadership: Becoming a major corporate Bitcoin holder could position DDC Enterprise as a leader or innovator in its sector regarding financial strategy. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for its significant volatility. A sharp downturn could negatively impact the company’s financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, which could pose risks. Accounting and Reporting: Managing and reporting Bitcoin holdings can be complex from an accounting perspective. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. DDC Enterprise, with the backing of experienced crypto firms like QCP Capital, is likely well aware of these challenges and presumably has strategies in place to mitigate them. What Does This Mean for the Future? The DDC Enterprise raise and subsequent plan to expand its Bitcoin treasury is more than just a company-specific event; it’s a data point in the broader narrative of institutional and corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the underlying conviction in Bitcoin as a long-term asset class remains strong among sophisticated investors and forward-thinking companies. The involvement of Animoca Brands also highlights the increasing integration of crypto assets across various digital industries, from finance and e-commerce to gaming and the metaverse. For other companies observing this trend, DDC Enterprise’s move provides another case study. It might encourage more businesses to explore the possibility of a corporate Bitcoin strategy, especially as the infrastructure for holding and managing digital assets becomes more accessible and regulated. In Conclusion: A Strategic Leap into Digital Assets DDC Enterprise’s successful $528 million raise, with notable participation from Animoca Brands and QCP Capital, marks a significant strategic leap for the e-commerce company. By dedicating the majority of these funds to building a substantial Bitcoin treasury , DDC Enterprise is making a bold statement about its belief in the future of digital assets and its ambition to become a major player in the corporate Bitcoin space. This move underscores the growing trend of companies seeking alternative stores of value and diversification in an evolving global economy, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position on the corporate balance sheet.

2025-06-17T18:45:28,"Goldman Sachs Says US Experiencing Disinflation if Not for Tariffs, Predicts Federal Reserve Cutting Rates Later This Year – Here’s When","Goldman Sachs vice chairman Robert Kaplan thinks the US economy would be in a deflationary situation right now if not for President Donald Trump’s wave of tariffs. Kaplan, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, tells CNBC in a new interview that recent inflation numbers suggest the possibility of rate cuts later this year. “We’re in a disinflating world, and I think if it weren’t for these prospective tariffs that will flow through and are flowing through, I think the Fed would be on their front foot to be looking to cut rates now.” Inflation rose by 2.4% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was slightly less than the 2.5% increase predicted by economists. Kaplan notes that the Fed will watch to see where the tariffs are set in the next several weeks and how they flow through the economy. “I think if I were at the Fed, it would encourage me that, after we get over the horizon, maybe the tariff impact could be more muted than I fear.” The Goldman vice chairman also comments on Fed Futures , which estimate the market-implied probability of changes to the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate at upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. “Directionally, what I make of the Fed Futures is the first meeting where there’s a real meaningful probability of a cut is September. So what I take from it, which I think is about right, is no action in June, unlikely in July. The Fed, though, it will likely prepare itself and prepare in its comments that it might take action into the fall. But we still don’t know what the tariff rates are, and we still have a budget and tax bill that has not yet been passed, and we’ll see over the summer what the details of that are.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-17T18:41:21,"Coinbase Seeking SEC Approval for Tokenized Stock Trading in Push To Compete With Robinhood: Report","The top US-based crypto exchange by volume is looking for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of tokenized equities offerings. According to a new Reuters report , Coinbase is in talks with the SEC to offer what is essentially blockchain-based stock trading. In tokenized equities, company shares are converted into digital tokens that represent the securities, similar to how other real-world-based digital assets work already. The benefits of tokenized equities include around-the-clock trading, quicker trading times, and reduced trading costs. Tokenized equities are not currently available for trade in the US, though other US-based exchanges, such as Kraken, are already looking into the sector. Reuters reports that Coinbase needs one of two things from the SEC in order to make the offering – either a no-action letter or exemptive relief, which is a pledge not to pursue legal ramifications. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal could not say whether or not the company has submitted an official request to the SEC yet. “With a no action letter, an issuer of a tokenized equity or a platform that wishes to offer secondary trading in those equities can have some confidence, some comfort, that the SEC has adopted its view of why this product is compliant. It’s that confidence that has been lacking so far, and I think really held back a lot of the institutional adoption…” The potential move would allow Coinbase to compete with other top trading apps like Robinhood.

2025-06-17T18:40:48,"Canadian Fintech LQwD Strengthens Bitcoin Holdings, Now Totals 166 BTC","BitcoinWorld Canadian Fintech LQwD Strengthens Bitcoin Holdings, Now Totals 166 BTC In a move highlighting the continued interest of corporate entities in digital assets, Canadian fintech company LQwD announced a strategic addition to its cryptocurrency reserves. The firm recently completed an acquisition of 5 additional Bitcoin, a step that reinforces its commitment to the leading digital currency. What is LQwD’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase? According to a report by Newsfile, LQwD Technologies Inc. (TSXV: LQWD) officially disclosed its latest acquisition. The company purchased an additional 5 Bitcoin (BTC), building upon its existing cryptocurrency portfolio. This transaction brings LQwD’s total LQwD Bitcoin holdings to a significant 166 BTC. This incremental purchase, while seemingly small compared to the total, demonstrates a consistent strategy by the company to accumulate and hold Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury assets. For companies operating in the fintech space, particularly those involved with blockchain technology or the Lightning Network (which LQwD specializes in), holding Bitcoin can align with their core business and investment philosophy. This recent LQwD BTC purchase is a tangible example of this alignment in action. Why Are Canadian Companies Increasing Bitcoin Holdings? LQwD is not an isolated case. The trend of Canadian company Bitcoin adoption for treasury purposes has been gaining momentum. Several factors are driving this shift: Inflation Hedge: In an environment of potential currency devaluation, companies view Bitcoin as a potential store of value due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. Potential Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, attracting companies looking to enhance their balance sheet value. Alignment with Business: For crypto-native or fintech companies, holding Bitcoin can be seen as supporting the ecosystem they operate within and demonstrating confidence in the technology. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a traditional portfolio of cash and equivalents can offer diversification benefits, though it comes with higher risk. This growing trend reflects a broader acceptance and understanding of digital assets within the corporate world, moving beyond just individual investor interest. Understanding Institutional Bitcoin Investment The move by LQwD is part of a larger global phenomenon of institutional Bitcoin investment . Major corporations worldwide, such as MicroStrategy, Tesla, and others, have allocated significant portions of their corporate treasuries to Bitcoin. This signals a shift from Bitcoin being solely a retail asset to one considered seriously by sophisticated financial players and large businesses. The decision to add Bitcoin to a Bitcoin corporate treasury involves careful consideration of risks and rewards. While the potential for substantial gains exists, companies must also navigate the asset’s inherent price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and the complexities of secure custody. Benefits often cited by companies holding Bitcoin include: Potential Benefit Description Store of Value Protection against inflation and currency debasement. Growth Potential Opportunity for significant capital appreciation. Balance Sheet Enhancement Potentially boosts company valuation if BTC price rises. Industry Leadership Positioning as forward-thinking and innovative, especially for tech companies. However, the challenges are equally important: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, impacting the balance sheet. Regulatory Risk: The legal and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Security: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by region. Despite these challenges, the increasing number of companies making a LQwD BTC purchase or similar acquisitions suggests that many see the potential rewards as outweighing the risks in the long term. The Significance of LQwD’s 166 BTC Holdings While 166 BTC may not rival the holdings of giants like MicroStrategy, it represents a substantial commitment for a company like LQwD. At current market prices, this holding constitutes a significant asset on their balance sheet. It indicates that LQwD views Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but as a core component of its financial strategy and potentially a strategic resource for its Lightning Network-focused business operations. The decision to increase their LQwD Bitcoin holdings underscores confidence in the future of Bitcoin and its underlying technology. It positions LQwD among a growing list of publicly traded companies globally, and specifically in Canada, that are allocating capital to digital assets. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investment in Canada? LQwD’s latest purchase contributes to the narrative of increasing crypto adoption within the Canadian corporate landscape. Canada has been relatively progressive in its approach to cryptocurrencies, with regulated Bitcoin ETFs and a growing ecosystem of crypto businesses. Moves like LQwD’s further legitimize digital assets as a viable asset class for corporate treasuries and institutional portfolios within the country. As more Canadian company Bitcoin holdings become public knowledge, it could potentially encourage other firms to explore similar strategies, further accelerating the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system in Canada. Conclusion LQwD’s recent acquisition of 5 additional Bitcoin, bringing its total to 166 BTC, is a clear signal of the company’s continued conviction in the digital asset. This move aligns with a broader trend of institutional adoption and the strategic allocation of Bitcoin to corporate treasuries by companies seeking potential hedges against inflation and long-term growth opportunities. As the cryptocurrency market matures, actions like LQwD’s highlight the increasing role digital assets are playing in the financial strategies of forward-thinking companies worldwide, including here in Canada.

2025-06-17T18:35:32,"Trump’s Crypto Reserve to Make XRP the Next Big Winner as XRP Eyes $1000 on SWIFT Replacement Theory","Patrick Bet-David, CEO of Valuetainment and host of the PBD Podcast, has made a bold prediction regarding XRP, suggesting that a recent development could trigger a significant price surge. In a video , Bet-David analyzed a key event that might shape the future of XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market, urging investors to “pay attention” to what could be unfolding. Notably, the catalyst for Bet-David’s discussion was President Donald Trump’s March 2 announcement of his intention to establish a U.S. crypto strategic reserve, akin to Fort Knox for gold. Notably, Trump’s post listed XRP first among cryptocurrencies, ahead of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bet-David noted he found this prioritization surprising and speculated that it could signal growing institutional interest and potential regulatory clarity that may benefit XRP. Bet-David further highlighted XRP’s potential to replace SWIFT, the global messaging network for interbank payments, which currently processes approximately $5 trillion in transactions daily, totaling $1.25 quadrillion annually. He suggested that if XRP were to capture even 5-10% of SWIFT’s volume , its price could rise dramatically. Notably, analysts have speculated that such adoption could push XRP’s market cap to $10 trillion, potentially elevating its price to $100 per token. In a scenario where XRP fully replaces SWIFT, the token could theoretically reach $1,000. Additionally, he pointed to XRP’s increasing institutional usage. Over 300 financial institutions, including Bank of America and American Express, have integrated RippleNet , signaling strong industry interest. Furthermore, Ripple’s partnerships with governments for central bank digital currency (CBDC) infrastructure add to its credibility. Despite its potential, Bet-David acknowledged XRP’s challenges, particularly regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He mentioned Ripple’s seven-year-long legal battle with the SEC, noting that the lawsuit has slowed XRP’s adoption. However, he pointed out that with SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s potential departure in 2025, the case could be resolved, paving the way for institutional adoption. “Who knows what’s going to be happening? When the president puts XRP at the top of the list in his Truth Social post, followed by a retweet mentioning Bitcoin and Ethereum, it makes you wonder, maybe something is about to happen,” Bet-David speculated. Bet-David clarified that he is not an XRP maximalist, noting that his Bitcoin holdings far exceed his XRP stake. However, he predicted a significant surge for XRP in the near future. “I would be paying attention,” he advised. “The next 3, 6, or 12 months could be game-changing for XRP.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trumps-crypto-reserve-to-make-xrp-the-next-big-winner-as-xrp-eyes-1000-on-swift-replacement-theory/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T18:31:48,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar: $1.78 Billion Boost Signals Strong Confidence","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar: $1.78 Billion Boost Signals Strong Confidence Are you watching the markets? Recent data reveals a significant surge in capital flowing into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products. This trend is grabbing headlines and signaling renewed investor confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. What’s Driving the Latest Wave of Bitcoin ETF Inflows ? The past week has been particularly strong for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF s. They’ve collectively recorded six consecutive days of net inflows, a clear indicator that buyers are stepping in. The total net inflow over this period reached an impressive $1.78 billion . Let’s break down the recent activity: Six Straight Days of Inflows: This consistent positive flow demonstrates sustained buying pressure, not just a one-off event. Total Over Six Days: The cumulative total of $1.78 billion is substantial, highlighting the scale of investment entering the market via these regulated products. June 16th Standout: A single day, June 16th, saw $412.2 million added to the funds. BlackRock’s IBIT fund continues to lead the pack, attracting a significant portion of these inflows. On June 16th alone, IBIT recorded $266.6 million in net inflows. While there was a temporary scare involving a reported $10 billion outflow from the ARKB fund due to a data error, corrected figures quickly confirmed that ARKB, like its peers, experienced continued net inflows, reinforcing the positive trend. How Significant Are These Total Spot Bitcoin ETF Figures? Looking at the bigger picture since their launch in January, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF market has grown dramatically. These recent inflows add to an already impressive cumulative total. Consider these figures: Total Net Inflows (Cumulative): Across all U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, total net inflows now exceed $46.3 billion . This figure represents the net capital added to these funds after accounting for both inflows and outflows (including the initial significant outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC as investors transitioned). Assets Under Management (AUM): The total value of assets held within these ETFs has surpassed $123 billion . This AUM figure reflects the value of the underlying Bitcoin held by the funds, which fluctuates with the Bitcoin price , plus the cumulative net inflows. These numbers underscore the significant impact these investment vehicles have had on making Bitcoin accessible to a wider range of investors, particularly institutions and traditional finance participants. What About Other Crypto ETF Products? While Bitcoin ETFs dominate the conversation due to their size and tenure, other cryptocurrency investment products are also emerging. The recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. marks another milestone for the industry. While the Ethereum ETFs have yet to launch trading, associated products are seeing activity: Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows: On June 16th, spot Ethereum ETFs saw $21.4 million in inflows. While smaller than Bitcoin, this indicates initial interest in regulated Ethereum exposure. The successful launch and performance of Bitcoin ETFs are paving the way for other crypto-linked investment products, potentially bringing more diverse capital into the digital asset space. How Are These Inflows Influencing the Bitcoin Price ? The correlation between significant ETF inflows and the Bitcoin price is a hot topic among analysts and investors. While not a direct cause-and-effect on a minute-by-minute basis, sustained buying pressure from these large funds provides underlying support and can contribute to upward price momentum. Currently, the Bitcoin price has managed to hold above the significant $100,000 mark. This level is being watched closely as a key psychological and technical support zone. Analysts are cautiously optimistic. They note that while the market is experiencing high volatility, the continued inflows into ETFs suggest underlying demand. If the price can maintain support above the $102,000 level (a slightly higher, more specific technical level mentioned by some analysts) and investor confidence remains high, there is potential for further upside. Key Price Considerations: Current Support: Holding above $100,000 is seen as crucial. Technical Level: The $102,000 mark is another important support level being monitored. Volatility: Expect price swings as the market digests news and macro factors. Buyer Confidence: Continued ETF inflows are a strong indicator of returning or sustained buyer confidence. The sustained buying via ETFs provides a potential buffer against significant downturns, although broader market sentiment and macroeconomic factors will also play a critical role in future price movements. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of This Trend? The rise of Spot Bitcoin ETF s and the subsequent inflows bring both opportunities and challenges: Benefits: Increased Accessibility: ETFs make investing in Bitcoin as easy as buying a stock through traditional brokerage accounts. Institutional Adoption: They provide a regulated and familiar vehicle for large institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Market Legitimacy: The approval and success of these ETFs lend credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class. Potential Price Support: Sustained inflows represent consistent demand, which can support the Bitcoin price . Challenges: Market Volatility: While inflows can support price, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Correlation Risk: ETFs can increase the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets. Centralization Concerns: Large amounts of Bitcoin being held by a few major fund managers raise questions about centralization. Fee Structures: While generally low, ETF fees add a layer of cost compared to direct ownership. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Consider? For those interested in the cryptocurrency market, the significant Bitcoin ETF inflows offer valuable insights: Monitor Inflow Data: Keep an eye on daily and weekly inflow figures for major ETFs like IBIT, FBTC, and ARKB. Sustained positive inflows are generally bullish signals. Watch Key Price Levels: Pay attention to whether the Bitcoin price holds critical support levels like $100,000 and $102,000. Understand the Macro Landscape: Bitcoin’s performance is increasingly linked to global economic conditions and monetary policy. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin ETFs are strong performers, the crypto market is broad. Explore other assets and investment strategies. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Despite institutional interest, Bitcoin remains a high-risk asset. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Summary: A Bullish Signal Backed by Capital The recent streak of significant Bitcoin ETF inflows , totaling $1.78 billion over six days and pushing cumulative inflows past $46.3 billion, is a powerful indicator of strong and sustained investor interest. Led by funds like BlackRock’s IBIT, these inflows demonstrate the growing acceptance and accessibility of Bitcoin through regulated investment vehicles. While the market remains volatile, the ability of the Bitcoin price to hold above key support levels amidst this influx of capital suggests underlying strength and potential for future growth. The cautious optimism from analysts reflects the current state: a market navigating volatility but buoyed by fresh investment entering through the increasingly popular Spot Bitcoin ETF channel.

2025-06-17T18:30:50,"Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here’s Why","Crypto analyst Daan Crypto has provided an analysis of the rising Bitcoin dominance, explaining why this will likely continue to surge. Based on his analysis, the altcoin season is unlikely to come anytime soon, with many alts suffering significant selling pressure while BTC accumulation increases. Bitcoin Dominance Surge Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season In an X post, Daan Crypto stated that the Bitcoin Dominance shows no signs of stopping following the latest surge above 64%. He indicated that the dominance will only continue to rise as more treasury companies try to accumulate Bitcoin. Meanwhile, on the other hand, hopes of an altcoin season fade away as many altcoins are plagued with big unlocks and downtrending momentum. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises Daan Crypto also alluded to how there was a short squeeze last month on Ethereum, which took a lot of coins with it. However, this momentum quickly faded afterwards, again dashing hopes of an altcoin season. The analyst explained that there wasn’t sufficient spot bid to bid most of these coins up further. Meanwhile, he cautioned market participants to pick their altcoin investments wisely. Daan Crypto remarked that most of them will underperform BTC over a larger timeframe. His warning suggests that the Bitcoin dominance will continue to trend upwards while an altcoin season may not happen anytime soon. Basically, there is a lack of interest and capital in these altcoins to spark an altcoin season, which could see them outperform BTC. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin dominance is surging thanks to massive adoption from institutional investors. These companies are looking to adopt Strategy’s playbook or gain exposure through the Bitcoin ETFs. BlockchainCenter data shows that it is still Bitcoin season and nowhere near altcoin season. For it to be altcoin season, 75% of the top 50 coins need to have outperformed BTC over the last 90 days. Only ten altcoins have outperformed the flagship crypto during this period. Altseason Is Still Coming, But Slowly In an X post, crypto analyst Astronomer assured that the altcoin season is still coming, although it could take a while. He noted that the price remains the same for these altcoins, but declared that nothing has changed. The analyst remarked that this lines up with the overall plan of the Bitcoin price ranging till the end of June and altcoins remaining in their local ranges. Related Reading: The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62% Astronomer also indicated that BTC needs to break out while the Bitcoin dominance remains below 65% for all parts of the plan for an altcoin season to be completed. The analyst urged market participants to be patient, expressing his confidence that an altcoin season would still occur. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $107,300, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-06-17T18:19:53,"Can Tron price surge 60% and revisit December highs?","Tron price remained consolidated on Tuesday as investors reflected on the new public listing news. Tron ( TRX ) was trading at $0.2790, a few points above this week’s low of $0.2670. It has risen by almost 40% from its lowest level this year. The biggest Tron news is that it will execute a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment , a company that sells branded toys. Dominari Securities, a company with ties to the Trump family, is arranging this merger. The merger will see SRM accumulate TRX tokens, mimicking the strategy of Strategy, which transformed from a small tech company into the largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) holder. Strategy’s market capitalization has soared from $1 billion in 2020 to $105 billion today. The deal comes after the successful Circle IPO , which has pushed its market capitalization to over $33 billion. Other companies in the crypto industry, like Gemini, Galaxy Digital, and Kraken, are also considering going public late this year. You might also like: Tron’s $210m Nasdaq play is real.

According to TokenTerminal data , Tron has generated over $3.65 billion in revenue over the past 365 days, with $1.6 billion recorded so far this year. Most of these fees are either burned or distributed to super representatives. The token-burning mechanism contributes to Tron’s deflationary nature. Its circulating supply has dropped from 96.3 billion in June last year to 94.8 billion today. Tron price technical analysis TRX price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that TRX has been in a gradual uptrend in recent months, rising from a February low of $0.20 to $0.2743 today. The price has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), signaling that bulls remain in control. Tron has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, a popular continuation formation, and is currently developing the handle portion. If the pattern holds and TRX breaks above the year-to-date high of $0.2958, a continuation rally toward last year’s high of $0.4497, a roughly 60% upside, becomes increasingly likely.

SHIB fell over 3.5% to 0.00001134, the level last seen on April 9, according to data source CoinDesk. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, slipped nearly 3% to $103,800. The risk aversion happened after President Donald Trump downplayed reports of his administration seeking truce with Iran and threatened assassination of Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling for IRan's unconditional surrender in the ongoing war with Israel. SHIB's decline follows rejection at the $0.00001230 resistance level Monday, which paved for the sell-off with exceptionally high trading volumes exceeding 1.2 billion tokens. Support had briefly emerged at around $0.00001167 early today, but was eventually pierced by bears, driving prices lower. Market analysts note that SHIB's performance reflects broader cryptocurrency market trends, which continue to be influenced by global economic factors and trade disputes between major economies. As traditional financial markets respond to these tensions, cryptocurrencies like SHIB face increased volatility while traders closely monitor key support and resistance levels for signs of directional movement. Key AI insights (Monday-Tuesday) Clear rejection at the $0.0000123 resistance level during the 20:00-21:00 timeframe.

Private credit is emerging as a top alternative asset for family offices, according to a new survey by BlackRock, reports Bloomberg. Of the 175 family offices around the world that were surveyed, more than half have a bullish outlook on private credit and nearly one-third say they are planning to increase allocations to the asset class this year. Says Armando Senra, head of the Americas institutional business at BlackRock, “They are diversifying their exposure within private markets. While allocations used to be primarily into private equity growth, now what you see is high interest in private credit, the beginning of interest in infrastructure.” The survey also finds that 30% of respondents plan to commit more of their money to the infrastructure market. Lili Forouraghi, BlackRock’s head of family offices, health care, endowments, foundations and official institutions in the US, says the super-rich are increasingly interested in the potential of private credit to generate a higher yield than public bond markets. She also says that infrastructure investments related to decarbonization and “the whole buzz of AI plus data centers, those are the areas that have intrigued a lot of our clients.” The survey finds that, on average, alternative investment comprises 42% of assets in family office portfolios, up from 39% in a prior 2022-2023 survey, and that private credit holdings make up anywhere from 15% to 30% of some family offices’ portfolios.

Bitcoin BTC is down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, trading under $104,000 yet again. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, exchange coins and memecoins — lost 6.1% in the same period of time, with ether ETH and solana SOL both slumping 7% and sui SUI dipping almost 10%. Crypto stocks are also taking a hit, with Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and Circle (CRLC) all down 2%-3%, and bitcoin miners such as Bitdeer (BTDR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK), HIVE (HIVE) and Hut 8 (HUT) losing 6%-7%. The market move came as President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. could soon get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump posted on social media, referring to Iranian head of state Ali Khamenei. “He is an easy target, but he is safe there - we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.” Trump also called for Iran to surrender unconditionally, and for residents of Tehran to evacuate the city. The national security council was convened, according to the White House, and Trump himself cut short a G7 summit to focus on the issue. Odds of U.S. military action against Iran before July have soared to 65% on Polymarket. “The sudden and severe escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict introduced a significant geopolitical risk premium, prompting an immediate flight from risk assets across the board, to which crypto has not proven immune,” said Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, Chief Investment Officer at XBTO. “The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard; any credible de-escalation in the Middle East could serve as a significant risk-on catalyst, while a further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets,” he added. Matteo Greco, senior analyst at Finequia, shared the same sentiment, adding that the war could end up having significant consequences on the U.S. economic outlook. “Should Israeli military actions impact Iran’s oil production, a spike in oil prices could follow, fueling renewed inflationary pressures,” Greco said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/17/bitcoin-heads-lower-as-trump-threatens-to-assassinate-irans-supreme-leader,"BTC|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL","Markets|Bitcoin|Trump|Iran|Israel|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T17:54:50,"Can the Real Cypherpunks Please Stand Up?","Am I the only one feeling a growing sense of cognitive dissonance in crypto right now? The crypto industry has always had revolutionary roots. It emerged in 2008 with the Bitcoin whitepaper, a direct response to the financial crisis that decimated livelihoods while protecting a systemically flawed, corrupt banking system. Bitcoin wasn’t just a technical innovation—it was a political and ideological statement. A signal that builders and thinkers were ready to challenge the status quo with tools, not just words. As someone who’s worked in crypto for years, I should be celebrating. Today, decentralized technologies are no longer on the fringe. Fintechs are adopting stablecoins. Bitcoin ETFs are trading on traditional exchanges. The average person has heard of blockchain. From Capitol Hill to Davos, crypto is no longer being laughed out of the room. But despite this surface-level “legitimacy,” I can’t help but feel that something essential is lost. The ethos of crypto—the cypherpunk values that got us here—is being diluted, co-opted, and in some cases, directly betrayed. The Cypherpunk movement’s core belief is that technology can and should be used to rebalance power—away from overreaching governments and monopolistic corporations, and toward individuals. Peer-to-peer networks, end-to-end encryption, censorship-resistant platforms—these aren’t buzzwords; they’re commitments to improve our society. Stripe acquiring crypto infrastructure startups? Great, but it doesn’t create legitimacy in the crypto industry. That’s a survival move by big fintech to stay relevant and improve their product offering. Circle going public is a corporate milestone, not a validation of crypto’s principles. A Bitcoin ETF may bring liquidity, but it doesn’t bring ideological alignment. These fintech brands aren’t leading a movement—they’re reacting to it. They’re trying to keep pace with the crypto-native upstarts that are quickly rendering their legacy models obsolete. Let’s not confuse acquisition with validation. Just because the suits are now interested in the tools we’ve built doesn’t mean they understand, respect, or intend to preserve the reasons those tools exist. Crypto wasn’t supposed to be another tool in the hands of the state. It is supposed to be the counterweight. So it's understandable that the recent uptick in political engagement and clearer regulatory frameworks—like the GENIUS Act —feels like progress. Applications like Coinbase and Polymarket are gaining household recognition. President Biden’s successor has even extended an olive branch to the industry. But somewhere along the way, many of us seem to have lost the plot. A glaring example? Coinbase’s recent sponsorship of a military parade affiliated with President Trump. This isn’t a partisan critique. It’s a principled one. Coinbase’s mission statement emphasizes that political causes are a “distraction from our mission.” Yet, in practice, the company has repeatedly aligned itself with political events—from sponsoring presidential inauguration funds to courting political favor with expedited hiring of ex-DOGE staffers. CEO Brian Armstrong’s recent solicitation of former DOGE employees is quite poignant: “If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase.” That framing—tying Coinbase’s mission to the state—epitomizes the creeping fusion between crypto’s stewards and the very power structures we were meant to counterbalance. Yes, Coinbase is a publicly-traded company. Yes, it operates in a jurisdiction governed by laws and politics. But being compliant does not mean being co-opted. Sponsoring political events, aligning with political figures, and turning a profit from proximity to power undermines the ethical foundation of decentralized technology. And Coinbase is not alone. Crypto-funded super PACs are pouring money into elections at every level. Ripple is now a lobbying juggernaut in D.C. We’re still reckoning with the staggering corruption that was FTX—where political donations and influence-peddling were tools of manipulation, not participation. This is not a slippery slope. We’re already sliding. Cypherpunkism is more than an aesthetic or an ideology. It’s a commitment to building systems that make centralized power obsolete—not tolerated or negotiated with, but irrelevant. It’s about building tools that empower individuals, preserve privacy, and promote a more open and resilient society. Crypto founders, investors, and institutions need to revisit these roots. Blockchain’s purpose isn’t to replicate traditional systems with shinier branding at politicized military gatherings—it’s to fundamentally alter how those systems work. To create a future where financial freedom, privacy, and open access are not privileges, but defaults. Yes, we must engage with regulators. Yes, we must work within legal frameworks. But that is a far cry from becoming their cheerleaders. There’s a difference between navigating the system and being consumed by it. There’s a difference between playing the game and forgetting why you joined it in the first place. We owe it to the movement—and to ourselves—to remember why crypto exists. Not to appease governments, but to hold them accountable. Not to win political favor, but to render such favor unnecessary. Not to build brands, but to build freedom. The real cypherpunks are still out there. But it’s time we make our voices heard again.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/17/can-the-real-cypherpunks-please-stand-up,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare

Some of the key factors contributing to this surge include Solana’s broader ecosystem and developer engagement, thanks to the network’s high speed and ultra-low fees to the tune of $0.02. Solana is also known to experience a beehive of meme-coin activity, contributing to its high monthly usage. Solana Remains Locked in a Consolidated Market According to market analyst Crypto Joe, “SOL has been chopping in a sideways range for over a year — bouncing between Fib levels and shaking out the weak hands. $140 remains the key level to hold for any real continuation upward.” Source: Crypto Joe The analyst added that Solana’s ranging market is not a sign of giving up because the one-year sideways grind is a volatile base-building phase. At the time of this writing, Solana was hovering around the $146 zone, and the altcoin’s consolidation between the $140 and $160 zones was intensifying. As previously reported by ZyCrypto, popular crypto analyst AltcoinGordon recently opined that the next leg up for Solana would be violent to the extent of surpassing Bitcoin’s recent all-time high (ATH) move.

The site, developed with BlueFlare Energy, marks the company’s first operational milestone in a broader strategy to turn off-grid natural gas into energy-backed digital infrastructure. The Berwyn facility currently draws 425 kW and delivers more than 32 petahashes per second (PH/s) of compute power. A second phase under development will expand capacity by another 200 kW. BlueFlare’s systems monitor emissions and provide real-time telemetry through its proprietary OS and carbon tracking tech. The use of flared gas to mine bitcoin is one way miners are looking to use a cheaper source of energy to offset some of the margin squeeze hurting the industry. For several years, flared gas bitcoin mining has been a trend for miners to monetize otherwise wasted excess natural gas produced when oil and gas companies drill for fossil fuels. Read more: Bitcoin Mining Costs Soar as Hashrate Hits Records: TheMinerMag This deployment is part of AgriFORCE’s three-pronged strategy: mining bitcoin, building modular compute infrastructure, and monetizing energy directly. That approach gained traction with a new binding agreement between AgriFORCE and BlueFlare to expand operations to two additional Alberta sites, in Oyen and Hinton. Combined, these deployments could add 1.3 MW of natural-gas-powered compute, supporting tasks beyond bitcoin mining — such as AI model inference and edge computing for industrial devices. The model AgriFORCE is pursuing sidesteps grid dependencies by tapping unused energy reserves and bringing them online quickly. The company says it has already mined seven BTC across its Alberta and Ohio sites and plans to retain up to half of its bitcoin holdings while using the rest for operational expansion. AgriFORCE aims to scale to 1 exahash per second (EH/s) of compute capacity by Q1 2026, positioning itself as a player in the intersection of energy markets and decentralized infrastructure.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/17/agriforce-launches-gas-powered-bitcoin-mining-site-in-alberta-plans-expansion-to-1-ehs,"BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|MINING","Markets|Bitcoin Mining|Canada|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T17:45:12,"Exploring Cardano's Ambitious Path to Surpass Bitcoin","High stakes and high ambitions define the tumultuous realm of cryptocurrencies, where every player seeks to innovate and outpace the rest. Standing prominently among these is Cardano, directed by its visionary leader Charles Hoskinson. His latest proposal for a monumental $1 billion Sovereign Wealth Fund seeks to not just accelerate ADA's adoption but fundamentally alter the ecosystem's dynamics. Cardano's Disruptive Technology and Strategic Moves Unlike Bitcoin, which has primarily focused on stability and security, Cardano aims to revolutionize the blockchain arena through advanced technical frameworks and on-chain governance . These innovations make Cardano a significant contender in the race to redefine the blockchain's future. Charles Hoskinson argues that Cardano's approach is not about picking up where Bitcoin left but about pushing the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve. The Vision for a $1 Billion Sovereign Wealth Fund Hoskinson's ambitious strategy includes the creation of a decentralized fund as detailed in his recent Cardano treasury conversion proposal . This fund aims to invest in a mix of assets to foster network liquidity and curb inflation, drawing parallels with strategies employed by massive networks like Ethereum. Real-World Applications and Market Dynamics While Cardano focuses on infrastructural evolution, other cryptocurrencies like Remittix are carving niches by solving practical financial dilemmas. Remittix offers rapid conversion between crypto and fiat, appealing to users needing efficient, economical international transactions. Such dual paths highlight the diverse approaches within the crypto industry, where some entities like Remittix directly address user needs, whereas others like Cardano innovate at a foundational level. Future Prospects and Industry Positioning In the fast-evolving crypto world, the future lies in both technological innovation and practical utility. Cardano, with its robust technological advancements and strategic initiatives such as Hoskinson's 2025 vision , alongside practical solutions offered by platforms like Remittix, reveal the multifaceted nature of blockchain advancements.

2025-06-17T17:44:54,"Cardano Founder Believes ADA Is Bitcoin's Biggest Threat, Proposes $1B Cardano Sovereign Wealth Fund","Cardano’s outspoken founder Charles Hoskinson has once again stirred the crypto world - this time with a bold claim that ADA could emerge as Bitcoin’s biggest threat. In a recent proposal, Hoskinson introduced the idea of a $1 billion Cardano Sovereign Wealth Fund, aimed at accelerating ecosystem development, boosting ADA adoption and reshaping global perceptions of crypto governance. Could this be the move that propels Cardano to the top? Analysts feel that another altcoin is set to play a leading role in 2025 and could become a bigger challenger to Bitcoin than ADA. Cardano Aims To Dethrone Bitcoin's Dominance With Next-Generation Capabilities Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently stated that Cardano offers the most significant threat to Bitcoin, thanks to its next-generation technical structure and governance model. He explained how Cardano's UTXO-based smart contract development and governance on-chain are radical advancements over Bitcoin's more inflexible structure. Source: TradingView Hoskinson believes Bitcoin's plan is something Cardano has already integrated. He contends Cardano doesn't merely take up ""unfinished work"" early Bitcoin developers started but never completed, making ADA a future-proof solution for secure and scalable blockchain transactions. Remittix Investors Have Actual Real World Use While Ada Is Focused On Enhancing Structure Remittix has focused on functional problems in global finance. With a Q3 wallet release, RTX enables users e.g., remote workers or overseas merchants to convert crypto to fiat in under 24 hours. An East African logistics company already uses Remittix to pay European suppliers without waiting for traditional banks. Here, Remittix is a more instant attraction for customers looking for fast and inexpensive transfers. It is for this reason that the majority of early adopters are already thinking of it as a valid XRP alternative with much higher potential. Hoskinson's $1b Fund Can Redefine The Cardano Ecosystem Hoskinson proposed to introduce a $1 billion decentralized sovereign wealth fund to boost Cardano's DeFi and stablecoin sectors. The fund would invest treasury ADA in assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins, encouraging network liquidity while limiting inflation risk. The move echoes Ethereum's adoption of treasury-backed projects. It could also help Cardano make up lost ground in the DeFi domain with networks like Solana, which currently dominate in Total Value Locked and stablecoin activity. Nevertheless, some pundits warn that it could cause market imbalances if poorly tracked. Conclusion: A New Era Of Ecosystem Competition? Both ADA and RTX are two of the biggest aspects of blockchain technology. Cardano is technical prowess and formal regulation, whereas Remittix provides speed and convenience. Hoskinson's 2025 vision also includes BTC integration and privacy tools, but such innovations may not show up in the price of ADA immediately. With its clear use case, strong presale momentum and upcoming product releases, Remittix may offer quicker gains. If you’re looking to back the next breakout crypto, now might be the time to get in early.

By integrating this service for RLUSD, Alchemy Pay is making it straightforward for users in a vast number of regions to acquire Ripple’s stablecoin. Accessing RLUSD Stablecoin in 173 Countries One of the most impressive aspects of this partnership is the sheer scale of accessibility it promises. Alchemy Pay’s integration is set to enable fiat on-ramp services for RLUSD in an astounding 173 countries. This global reach is critical for the widespread adoption of any digital asset, particularly a stablecoin aiming for stability and utility across diverse markets. Users in these countries will no longer need to navigate complex processes involving multiple exchanges or intermediaries to get their hands on RLUSD. They can potentially use their preferred local payment methods, making the transition from fiat to the RLUSD stablecoin much smoother and more intuitive. This level of accessibility is a powerful catalyst for onboarding new users into the digital asset ecosystem. Why is RLUSD Significant? Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market with RLUSD is a noteworthy development. As a fully backed stablecoin, RLUSD aims to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with a reserve asset like the US dollar. Stablecoins are crucial components of the crypto economy, providing a bridge between volatile cryptocurrencies and stable fiat currencies. They are used for trading, lending, payments, and as a safe haven during market downturns. Ripple’s decision to launch RLUSD signals their commitment to participating in the growing stablecoin sector, which is vital for facilitating smoother transactions and fostering greater confidence in digital currencies for everyday use and institutional adoption. A reliable fiat on-ramp is essential for any stablecoin to achieve broad utility, and this is where the Alchemy Pay partnership plays a pivotal role. Alchemy Pay: A Key Crypto Payment Gateway Alchemy Pay has established itself as a significant player in the crypto payment gateway space. Their infrastructure is designed to connect traditional finance with the crypto economy, offering solutions for businesses and individuals. Their services typically include: Fiat On-Ramp: Enabling users to buy crypto with fiat. Fiat Off-Ramp: Allowing users to sell crypto for fiat. Crypto Payroll: Facilitating salary payments in crypto. NFT Checkout: Simplifying the purchase of NFTs using fiat. Their strength lies in integrating a wide array of local payment channels across numerous jurisdictions. This existing infrastructure is precisely what makes them an ideal partner for Ripple to ensure RLUSD is easily accessible globally. Their network covers diverse payment methods, from major credit cards like Visa and Mastercard to regional mobile wallets and bank transfer systems. The Benefits of This Partnership for Users and the Ecosystem The collaboration between Ripple and Alchemy Pay brings several tangible benefits: Enhanced Accessibility: Users in 173 countries gain a direct, easy way to acquire RLUSD using their local currencies. Simplified Onboarding: The fiat on-ramp service reduces the technical barriers for new users entering the stablecoin market. Increased RLUSD Adoption: Greater accessibility naturally leads to increased potential usage and adoption of the RLUSD stablecoin. Broader Utility for Ripple Ecosystem: As RLUSD becomes easier to acquire, it can be more readily used within applications and services built on or connected to Ripple’s infrastructure. Strengthened Alchemy Pay Network: Partnering with a major player like Ripple enhances Alchemy Pay’s reputation and expands its transaction volume. Support for Local Payments: The focus on local payment methods makes the process feel familiar and trustworthy to users worldwide. How Does the Fiat On-Ramp Process Work? While the exact user interface will depend on the platform integrating Alchemy Pay’s service, the general process for a user wanting to acquire RLUSD stablecoin via the fiat on-ramp typically involves: Selecting RLUSD as the desired cryptocurrency to purchase. Entering the amount of RLUSD they wish to buy or the amount of fiat they wish to spend. Choosing their country and preferred local payment method (e.g., bank transfer, credit card, specific regional wallet). Completing identity verification (KYC – Know Your Customer), if required by regulations or the platform. Authorizing the payment using their chosen local method. Receiving the purchased RLUSD directly into their designated crypto wallet. This streamlined process contrasts sharply with older methods that might require users to first buy a more common crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum on one platform, transfer it to another exchange, and then trade it for the desired stablecoin. Looking Ahead: The Future of Fiat On-Ramps and Stablecoins The partnership between Alchemy Pay and Ripple for RLUSD’s fiat on-ramp is indicative of a larger trend in the crypto space: the increasing focus on usability and integration with the traditional financial system. As stablecoins like RLUSD aim for wider adoption, easy and reliable fiat on-ramps become non-negotiable necessities. This development not only benefits individual users but also lays groundwork for businesses looking to interact with digital assets. A readily accessible stablecoin like RLUSD, backed by a major entity like Ripple and easily purchasable via a global payment gateway like Alchemy Pay, has the potential to be used for cross-border payments, settlements, and various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Actionable Insight: How to Access RLUSD via Alchemy Pay Users interested in utilizing this new service should look for platforms, exchanges, or wallets that have integrated Alchemy Pay’s fiat on-ramp solution for RLUSD. Once integrated, the option to buy RLUSD directly using local fiat currency via various payment methods will become available within those platforms’ interfaces. Keep an eye on announcements from exchanges and wallets popular in your region regarding their integration with Alchemy Pay’s RLUSD service. Conclusion The partnership between Alchemy Pay and Ripple to provide a comprehensive fiat on-ramp for the RLUSD stablecoin across 173 countries marks a significant leap forward in making digital assets more accessible globally. By leveraging Alchemy Pay’s robust crypto payment gateway infrastructure and wide network of local payment methods, acquiring RLUSD is set to become easier and more convenient for millions of potential users. This collaboration not only boosts the potential adoption and utility of RLUSD but also underscores the growing importance of seamless fiat-to-crypto solutions in the evolving financial landscape. It’s a powerful example of how strategic partnerships are paving the way for broader participation in the digital economy.

2025-06-17T17:33:34,"America’s Largest Bank JPMorgan Applies for Possible Stablecoin JPMD Trademark","JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in America, has filed for a trademark for a digital currency titled JPMD with the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). At this stage, it is unclear what JPMD represents or whether it is a new stablecoin developed by JPMorgan in secret. A stablecoin pegs a digital currency to a real-world asset such as the US dollar. JPMorgan has taken an interest in stablecoins, signalling a change in the bank’s stance regarding using digital assets in the finance industry. The PTO website described the JPMD trademark as representing a service that would provide trading and exchange services for digital assets. The trademark is categorised as relating to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Traders on X have surmised that the new crypto trademark is JPMorgan’s stablecoin and will be accompanied by a coin offering. JPMD, the new trademark by JPMorgan, seems to imply that the “D” represents the word “dollar”, making the new crypto trademark a stablecoin issued by JPMorgan. Other stablecoins of note include Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. The Wall Street Journal published an article on May 22 suggesting that JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America planned to create a stablecoin shared between them. The WSJ article indicated that the stablecoin would speed up routine transactions and make cross-border payments. Therefore, the stablecoin could be used as an advanced accounting tool to save on transaction costs and record financial details within the bank. However, one can only speculate as to the legitimacy of the WSJ article at this stage. The Genius Act, meanwhile, is being considered by US lawmakers as a way to install regulatory guardrails on stablecoin use. Many expect the new laws to pass through this summer. Various companies plan to capitalise on the looser regulations relating to stablecoin use. JPMorgan may be one such company that intends to profit by investing early in stablecoin technology. The Trump administration may continue to provide incentives for the crypto industry. Therefore, companies from non-crypto industries may take a proactive approach to stablecoin investing. The Trump-backed crypto World Liberty project debuted its stablecoin USD1. The crypto company BitGo announced its stablecoin, USDS. Tether, however, remains the most popular stablecoin by market capitalisation with its token USDT. The World Liberty token USD1 is backed by real-world assets such as US dollars to legitimise the project. JPMorgan has adopted Bitcoin into its financial business model, accepting Bitcoin spot ETFs as collateral for loan applications. When assessing creditworthiness, JPMorgan will consider digital assets alongside fine art and vehicles to ascertain an individual’s net worth. JPMorgan has started considering BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a loan collateral. The largest bank in America has surely begun to embrace Bitcoin within its business practices. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that they will adopt their own stablecoin, especially with the current climate that may favour the stablecoin market. The major banks in America may be trying to control the issuance and circulation of stablecoins while applying traditional finance rules to use these assets. The PTO website has formally accepted the trademark application but is awaiting further review by a separate examiner. The trademark application allows JPMorgan to connect a trade name to an underlying process so that they have exclusive rights to use that name. Kinexys Digital Payments is the blockchain specialist that JPMorgan uses to complete its crypto projects. Kinexys completed their second test batch of transactions on a public blockchain last week. JPMorgan has the specialists lined up to adopt blockchain more fully within their bank. However, they have a lot of competition to contend with, such as with Tether, the largest issuer of US stablecoins.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/americas-largest-bank-jpmorgan-applies-for-possible-stablecoin-jpmd-trademark/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|USDT","Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|JPMorgan|stablecoin",cryptocompare

Major U.S. stock indices were down as hopes for a swift resolution to the Israel-Iran conflict continued to fade. On Tuesday, July 17, the Dow Jones fell 130 points, or 0.31%, with healthcare firms leading the declines. At the same time, the S&P 500 dropped 0.44%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined by 0.50%. Dow Jones Industrial Average heatmap | TipRank The downturn came after U.S. President Donald Trump called for the evacuation of Tehran, Iran’s capital. The move rattled investors, signaling the possibility of a prolonged conflict. Instead of pushing for a ceasefire, Trump has maintained a firm stance on Iran’s nuclear disarmament , a demand which the regime is unlikely to accept. In response, oil prices spiked 3%, as investors feared that the escalating conflict could threaten the region’s oil production and trade. Notably, Israel has already attacked major Iranian oil facilities , while traders fear that Iran might close the Strait of Hormuz , a vital global oil artery.

2025-06-17T17:10:47,"Bitcoin Miner Vinanz Secures $4.85M Funding for Massive BTC Acquisition and Expansion","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Miner Vinanz Secures $4.85M Funding for Massive BTC Acquisition and Expansion Exciting news from the world of digital asset infrastructure! London-listed Bitcoin miner Vinanz has just announced a significant milestone, successfully closing a funding round that exceeded all expectations. This substantial capital injection is set to power the company’s strategic growth initiatives, focusing on expanding its operational footprint and, notably, increasing its direct holdings of Bitcoin (BTC). For anyone tracking the crypto market or considering a crypto investment , this development offers valuable insights into the confidence surrounding the mining sector and the future of Bitcoin accumulation strategies. Understanding the Vinanz Funding Success The core of this positive news revolves around the recent Vinanz funding round. Vinanz managed to raise a total of £3.58 million, which translates to approximately $4.85 million based on current exchange rates. What makes this particularly impressive is that the amount raised is more than three times the company’s initial target. This oversubscription is a strong indicator of robust investor confidence in Vinanz’s business model and its future prospects within the competitive Bitcoin mining landscape. Why did this funding round attract such significant interest? Several factors likely contributed: Market Position: Vinanz, being a London-listed entity, offers a level of transparency and regulatory oversight that appeals to certain investor segments. Growth Strategy: The clear intention to use funds for both operational expansion and direct BTC acquisition presents a dual-pronged growth strategy. Sector Confidence: Despite market volatility, the underlying belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and the necessity of mining operations remains strong among dedicated crypto investors. Exceeding Targets: The sheer volume of oversubscription creates positive momentum and signals strong demand for Vinanz’s equity. This successful capital raise provides Vinanz with the necessary financial muscle to execute its ambitious plans effectively. Fueling the BTC Acquisition Strategy A key stated purpose for the newly raised capital is the direct BTC acquisition . This isn’t just about funding mining operations; it’s also about strategically accumulating Bitcoin itself. For a Bitcoin miner, acquiring BTC can happen in two primary ways: through the mining process itself (earning block rewards) and through direct purchase on the open market. Vinanz’s announcement suggests they will utilize a portion of the raised funds for the latter. Why would a miner buy Bitcoin directly when they are already producing it? This strategy can be seen as a form of balance sheet management and a bullish bet on Bitcoin’s price appreciation. By using external capital to buy BTC, Vinanz can potentially: Increase its overall BTC holdings faster than mining alone would allow. Benefit directly from future price increases on the acquired BTC. Potentially use acquired BTC as collateral or for other financial strategies down the line. This approach highlights a growing trend among publicly listed miners to not only focus on operational efficiency but also to leverage their position to become significant holders of the asset they produce. It signals a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future value among the company’s leadership and investors alike. Driving Bitcoin Mining Expansion Beyond acquiring Bitcoin, the Vinanz funding is also earmarked for Bitcoin mining expansion . This is the core business of a Bitcoin miner , and scaling operations is crucial for increasing hash rate, improving efficiency, and ultimately, earning more block rewards and transaction fees. Expanding mining operations typically involves several key components: Purchasing New Hardware: Acquiring the latest generation of ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners is essential for maintaining competitiveness and efficiency. Newer machines offer higher hash rates with better energy consumption ratios. Developing or Securing Infrastructure: This includes setting up or expanding data centers, ensuring reliable and cost-effective power sources, and establishing cooling and security systems. Location is often critical, seeking regions with cheap and ideally renewable energy. Increasing Capacity: Simply adding more machines requires space, power capacity, and network connectivity. Funding allows for building out or leasing larger facilities. The commitment to expansion indicates Vinanz’s intent to increase its share of the global Bitcoin hash rate. A larger hash rate contributes more to securing the network and increases the miner’s probability of earning block rewards. This strategic growth is vital for long-term profitability and relevance in the rapidly evolving mining sector. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment? The success of the Vinanz funding round provides interesting signals for the broader crypto investment landscape, particularly concerning infrastructure plays like mining companies. While direct Bitcoin investment remains popular, investing in publicly traded miners offers a different kind of exposure. Here’s what this funding success might suggest for investors: Investor Appetite for Mining: The oversubscribed round demonstrates that significant capital is willing to flow into well-structured and publicly listed mining operations. Confidence in Long-Term BTC Value: The focus on both mining and direct BTC acquisition reflects a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s price trajectory among sophisticated investors. Sector Maturity: Successful, oversubscribed funding rounds like this suggest increasing maturity and institutional interest in the crypto mining sector as a legitimate industry. Growth Potential: For investors considering mining stocks, this highlights the potential for companies to raise capital to scale operations and increase their Bitcoin holdings, potentially leading to significant growth. However, like any crypto investment , investing in miners comes with its own set of risks, which are crucial to consider. Challenges Facing a Bitcoin Miner While the Vinanz funding is a clear success, operating as a Bitcoin miner is far from without its challenges. These factors influence profitability and operational stability: Bitcoin Price Volatility: A miner’s revenue is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin. Significant price drops can quickly impact profitability, even for efficient operations. Network Difficulty Increases: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of finding a block increases. This means each miner earns less BTC for the same amount of hash rate, requiring constant investment in more powerful hardware. Energy Costs: Electricity is the single largest operational expense for a Bitcoin miner. Fluctuating energy prices or lack of access to cheap, stable power can severely impact margins. Regulatory changes impacting energy grids can also pose risks. Hardware Obsolescence: Mining hardware improves rapidly. Today’s top-tier miner might be significantly less efficient than models released just a year or two later, necessitating continuous capital expenditure to upgrade. Regulatory Landscape: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrency mining, leading to potential uncertainty regarding energy consumption, environmental impact, and financial oversight. Successful miners like Vinanz must constantly navigate these challenges through strategic planning, efficient operations, and securing favorable energy deals. Actionable Insights from Vinanz’s Success What can we take away from this news? For those interested in the crypto space: Mining Sector Health: This successful raise suggests that despite market cycles, there is still strong belief and investment flowing into the Bitcoin mining sector. Strategic Accumulation: Watch for other miners potentially adopting or increasing their direct BTC acquisition strategies, signaling bullish sentiment from industry insiders. Importance of Capital: Access to capital is crucial for miners to remain competitive, especially post-halving when block rewards are reduced. Funding rounds like this enable necessary expansion and hardware upgrades. Diversification Considerations: For investors, consider how mining stocks fit into a broader crypto investment strategy. They offer leverage to BTC price but also come with operational risks distinct from holding BTC directly. Vinanz’s ability to raise significant funds underscores the potential seen in scaling Bitcoin mining operations and accumulating the underlying asset. Conclusion: A Strong Vote of Confidence The successful £3.58 million ($4.85 million) funding round by London-listed Bitcoin miner Vinanz is a significant event, far exceeding its initial target and providing a strong vote of confidence from investors. The allocation of these funds towards both BTC acquisition and Bitcoin mining expansion highlights a clear strategy for growth and value accumulation. In a sector facing constant challenges from market volatility, network difficulty, and energy costs, Vinanz’s ability to secure substantial capital positions it well for future scaling and underscores the continued appeal of the mining industry as a key component of the crypto ecosystem. This development offers positive signals for the health of the mining sector and potential opportunities within the broader crypto investment landscape.

Gemini And Coinbase Target Regulatory Licenses According to Reuters, Gemini, the crypto trading platform founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is expected to receive a license from Malta, the EU’s smallest member country. This follows Malta’s swift approvals of other crypto firms like OKX and Crypto.com earlier this year. In parallel, Coinbase is reportedly nearing approval for a license in Luxembourg, which would make it the first US-based crypto company to be licensed under the new EU regulations. While the application has been in progress for several months, insiders suggest that Coinbase’s planned operations in Luxembourg will be “relatively modest.” A spokesperson for the company told Reuters that it employs around 200 people in Europe and is committed to investing in staff to ensure operational safety. The anticipated approval for Coinbase comes amid cooling relations between the crypto industry and Ireland. The Central Bank of Ireland has recently expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies, with its governor likening them to a Ponzi scheme. Yet, the licensing process has drawn criticism from various national regulators who are concerned about the “speed and rigor of approvals.” EU Regulators Express Concerns Over Rapid Licensing Under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which aims to align crypto operations with traditional financial oversight , countries can issue licenses that enable crypto companies to function throughout the 27-member bloc. Some regulators fear that lax enforcement could undermine the regulatory framework’s objectives, potentially leading to issues such as fraud and market instability. The rapid licensing in Malta has also raised eyebrows among other EU regulators, particularly those meeting under the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). France’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) has publicly warned that a lack of direct oversight from ESMA could lead to a “regulatory race to the bottom.” Concerns have also been voiced about the adequacy of regulatory staffing in countries like Malta, which may affect the robustness of their licensing processes. In response, the Malta Financial Services Authority has stated that its expedited approvals are based on years of experience and a strict adherence to local anti-money laundering standards. So far, Malta has granted four crypto licenses since the new MiCA regime was introduced. The ongoing debates within the EU highlight the complex dynamics between member states as they compete for international business. Per the report, while the EU operates as a unified trading bloc, individual countries vie for the attention of crypto firms, often leading to regulatory inconsistencies.

The company behind Truth Social and Truth+ has asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission to register a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, according to reports. At roughly the same time, it unveiled plans for a $499 Trump‑branded smartphone and service plan. Related Reading: Record‑High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Truth Social Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF According to the registration statement dated June 16, the proposed ETF would hold 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and the remaining 25% in Ethereum. If the SEC clears the way, the fund will list on NYSE Arca under a sponsor agreement with Yorkville America Digital. The plan is to store both coins in direct custody, meaning the ETF will actually hold the digital tokens rather than futures contracts or other derivatives. Crypto.com Handles Custody And Staking Based on reports, Crypto.com will serve as the ETF’s sole custodian and prime execution agent. The company will also provide staking and liquidity services for the Ethereum portion. That setup could ease SEC concerns, given the regulator’s focus on secure storage and clear oversight. Still, there’s no guarantee the ETF will win approval. Past spot crypto ETF proposals have faced delays and rejections due to worries over market manipulation and investor protection.

2025-06-17T17:00:00,"BTC or RUVI? why analysts predict up to 109x returns from the newcomer","Bitcoin (BTC) has been the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies since its inception, offering stability and long-term growth for investors. However, with Bitcoin’s market cap towering above all others, its potential for explosive returns has somewhat diminished. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI), a revolutionary newcomer combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts are now forecasting up to 109x returns, positioning Ruvi AI as a compelling alternative to Bitcoin for forward-thinking investors. Why analysts favor Ruvi AI over Bitcoin Bitcoin has established itself as a store of value, but its functionality is largely limited to being a crypto equivalent of gold. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, prioritizes real-world applications across industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance, ensuring scalable demand for its utility token. At its core, Ruvi AI solves practical problems by integrating AI-driven solutions with blockchain technology. Investors are attracted to this dual-purpose innovation that caters to future-facing industries. At a current presale price of $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI provides a rare opportunity for investors to secure significant returns. Experts predict its token price will rise to $0.07 post-presale, delivering 50% gains immediately. Looking further ahead, analysts anticipate Ruvi’s valuation will hit $1 per token, translating to an extraordinary 109x ROI for presale participants. Ruvi AI’s explosive start Ruvi AI is already making waves with its highly successful presale, which has raised over $1.8 million and garnered interest from more than 1,600 holders. This remarkable momentum highlights the growing confidence in Ruvi AI as a next-gen blockchain project. What makes Ruvi AI particularly compelling is its structured price roadmap, designed to deliver predictable returns. Unlike Bitcoin, which relies on macroeconomic trends and scarce supply for value increases, Ruvi AI’s presale sets a guaranteed price rise to $0.07 after Post Presale. This transparency eliminates speculation, giving investors a clear trajectory for growth.

2025-06-17T16:55:24,"Cantor Fitzgerald launch coverage for public companies with Solana treasuries","Financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald has initiated coverage for public companies with Solana treasuries. In a note to the client, the firm’s analysts gave the coverage an overweight rating, suggesting that the companies are trading at a premium. According to the analysts led by Thomas Shinske , Solana has the potential to become the leading blockchain for digital finance, with more applications likely to surface on the network. Thus, they expect this will boost the value of companies holding SOL. The analysts wrote: “With increased liquidity making it easier to raise capital, Solana treasury companies can follow the ‘Saylor playbook’ and raise capital at a premium to NAV, purchase SOL, and increase SOL-per-share.” The coverage covers the three public companies with SOL treasuries: Sol Strategies (HODL), Upexi (UPX), and Defi Development (DFDV). Currently, their stocks are trading at C$2.48, $9.84, and $31.06 respectively. However, the analyst has set a price target of C$54 for HODL, $16 for UPX, and $45 for DFDV. According to Shinske, these companies can provide investors with exposure to SOL with tax benefits. He added that these companies can combine SOL treasuries with staking, allowing them to grow their SOL/share faster than BTC treasury companies. Interestingly, he identified DFDV as the best-positioned SOL treasury company due to its access to the US capital markets and crypto-native management team, noting that the company could raise $250 million at a 250% premium on average. However, he noted that Sol Strategies is the most forward-thinking SOL treasury company. Even though the company is not currently listed in the US, the analyst noted that it is already in the final stages of a US listing. This is the first time a Wall Street analyst will cover SOL treasury company. Cantor analysts say SOL is a better treasury asset than ETH Meanwhile, the Cantor analyst noted that Solana will outperform Ether because Solana technology is far better than Ethereum’s on every metric. Thus, it will be a future chain of choice for on-chain finance. As proof of this, the firm noted that developer growth in Solana has recently exceeded Ethereum’s and expects the trend to continue. Thus, they believe it makes more sense for companies to adopt SOL for their treasury over ETH. They added that companies that have chosen SOL for their treasuries believe that the asset could one day flip Ethereum despite ETH’s market cap currently having 2.5x its market cap. Interestingly, the analyst did not place Solana on the same level as Bitcoin, noting that Bitcoin has established itself as a foundational reserve asset. Still, a bet on treasury today is an investment in its long-term growth as the transactions network. They wrote: “If BTC has solidified itself as the foundational reserve currency, or asset, for the digital economy, Solana aims to be the technology that powers transactions and marketplaces in the digital economy.” The research note represents a significant endorsement of Solana at a time when the network has seen activity drop. This decline, due to reduced interest in memecoins and the growth of transaction volume on the BNB Chain due to Binance Alpha, has led some experts to be bearish on the network. Standard Chartered analysts noted last month that Solana might be a one-trick pony if it cannot use its advantage to attract other use cases where low-cost and high-speed transactions are required. More companies are buying SOL for treasuries Meanwhile, Cantor’s note appears to push more companies to adopt an SOL strategy. The latest to do that is Hong Kong-listed MemeStrategy , which bought 2,440 SOL tokens for around $369,000. Despite its minimal investment, the announcement was enough to send its stock soaring more than 28%, reaching HK$2.70. The company has also stated that it plans to provide SOL staking services and is bullish on Solana’s long-term potential. However, the faith in Solana has not yet been reflected in SOL performance, with the token down 3.24% in the last 24 hours, falling to $151.21. The token has decreased 11.74% in the past 30 days, declining 21.46% year-to-date.

2025-06-17T16:55:17,"Japanese Bitcoin Hoarder Metaplanet Surges Past Coinbase To Become Ninth-Largest Corporate BTC Holder After Latest Buying Spree","The Japanese hotel and investment firm Metaplanet (MTPLF) now holds more Bitcoin ( BTC ) than Coinbase. Metaplanet says that it added another 1,112 BTC to its books, bringing its total holdings to 10,000 BTC, making it the ninth-largest holder of the flagship crypto asset among public companies. BitcoinTreasuries.net data shows that Coinbase, the top US crypto exchange, currently holds 9,267 Bitcoin, 733 fewer Bitcoin than Metaplanet. The public company with the largest Bitcoin holdings remains Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, with 592,100 Bitcoin. Metaplanet chief executive Simon Gerovich says the firm acquired the new Bitcoin for $105,435 per BTC and has achieved a yield of 266.1% on the top crypto asset year to date. Metaplanet’s 10,000 Bitcoin were acquired for $947 million at an average price of $94,697 per BTC. In 2024, the company said it would start buying the top crypto asset as part of a Bitcoin Treasury strategy. The aim is to reach 21,000 BTC in holdings by the end of 2026. Gerovich said previously that he “worries every day” that the company doesn’t own enough Bitcoin. “The window to buy won’t stay open forever. Soon, there will be two kinds of people: those who own Bitcoin and those who regret not buying it. At Metaplanet, we’re accumulating as much as we can so our shareholders can relax.” Metaplanet also operates a Tokyo hotel that it plans to renovate and rebrand into “the Bitcoin Hotel.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-17T16:47:01,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Market Sentiment Indicates A Potential Altcoin Season Next","Bitcoin’s early rally has historically always been the warm-up act before the real “bull market.” The real drama, especially for retail investors, begins when Ethereum starts gaining traction. That’s when the market starts whispering that the altcoin season is near, which is the phase where smaller coins start clocking 2x, 5x, even 10x moves in a matter of days. Despite Bitcoin’s strong upward moves this year, altcoins have largely remained quiet. But that silence may be ending. The broader sentiment, while still cautiously optimistic, has begun to lean in favor of altcoins. And with Ethereum’s demand building quietly in the background, many in the space believe the tide could finally be shifting toward a market where alts start running hard. Why This Altcoin Season Speculation Isn’t Just Hopeful Thinking The clearest evidence that altcoins are about to gain strength isn’t found in hopes or hype but in the form of a technical indicator called Bitcoin dominance. This metric measures how much of the total crypto market cap is absorbed by Bitcoin alone. When dominance is rising, Bitcoin is doing the heavy lifting. But when dominance stalls or begins falling, it usually means that liquidity is rotating into altcoins. That’s exactly what’s beginning to happen right now. Bitcoin dominance has hit a strong resistance zone just under 65%, and it’s already showing signs of rejection. As the metric begins trending down again, traders are preparing for what could be a heavy altcoin rotation. A drop toward the 64.2% level or below would likely confirm this shift. The second biggest crypto per market cap, Ethereum, has also managed to remain the heartbeat of altcoin activity. The recent accumulation of over 1.4 million ETH by major whale and shark wallets, even as retail has been selling, shows that smart money is positioning early. These wallets now control nearly 27% of Ethereum’s supply. Simultaneously, whale transactions in Ethereum-related protocols like ENS, L2 DeFi platforms, and USDC bridges have surged sharply, indicating increased strategic exposure to Ethereum’s ecosystem. 🐳 There are currently 6,392 wallets holding between 1K and 100K Ethereum. Over the past month alone, these key whale and shark wallets have rapidly added more coins as retail traders have taken profit.During these past 30 days, a net of +1.49M more $ETH has been accumulated by… pic.twitter.com/1hPBTuAOrL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 13, 2025 Interestingly, despite some retail selling, institutional appetite has been growing quite a bit. A 19-day inflow streak into spot ETH ETFs recently funneled over $1.3 billion into Ether products before finally cooling off. This wasn’t random enthusiasm, but a move that reflects belief in Ethereum’s longer-term role in the next market phase. Historically, altcoin seasons begin when retail exits and institutions accumulate. That’s what the current setup resembles. Best Crypto to Buy Now As the Altcoin Season Looks Like a Reality Bitcoin Hyper Every bull cycle chooses a mascot. During the present run, Bitcoin is that mascot, breaking ceilings while the rest of the market watches. Bitcoin Hyper leverages that spotlight while refusing to stay as just another memecoin with a BTC theme. The project builds a layer that slashes confirmation times to seconds, unlocks scalable smart contracts, and introduces fee levels the average phone user will accept. In an environment where analysts expect capital to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, Bitcoin Hyper offers a bridge rather than a divergence. Holders get exposure to Bitcoin’s brand strength along with the transactional speed that usually belongs to leaner networks. The protocol places an automated relay on-chain that verifies Bitcoin block headers within a separate virtual machine. That relay mints wrapped BTC instantly, making the asset liquid inside decentralized applications without waiting for slow twelve-minute intervals. Once traders decide the broader market has room for creativity, platforms that extend Bitcoin’s utility tend to absorb fresh liquidity first. Institutional desks can park treasury-sized positions without leaving Bitcoin’s narrative, retail wallets can finally use BTC for micropayments, and developers can experiment with tokens pegged to the largest asset by market value. Top crypto YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins and many others across social media channels have already endorsed it as an up-and-coming presale with huge potential. Investors looking for early entries before altcoin season accelerates may see Bitcoin Hyper as a strategic midway point. It keeps the spotlight of the dominant coin while positioning itself to benefit from the inevitable search for alternative high-growth venues that characterizes every maturing bull rally. These converging forces place the token on watchlists at major desks. SUBBD Scroll through any social platform and you will see a silent struggle. Creators grinding for reach while algorithms change rules overnight. SUBBD proposes a different contract. Instead of chasing advertising pennies or surrendering data, creators issue subscription keys on-chain that fans can buy, trade, or even lend. Behind the simple paywall lies a familiar experience for mainstream audiences, which is why SUBBD stands out as altcoin season approaches. Capital often hunts for coins linked to practical, non-speculative demand, and few utilities are clearer than direct fan support. The architecture keeps complexity hidden. Fans pay with familiar cards or stablecoins, the gateway handles conversion in the background, and the SUBBD token coordinates revenue sharing plus loyalty boosts. Every purchase raises the circulating utility of the asset because access passes live as smart tokens anchored to SUBBD liquidity pools. If a concert video goes viral next month, early pass holders can resell their slot, capturing upside that would normally flow only to the platform owner. Adoption does not require the viewer to understand wallets on day one. Email sign-in works, content unlocks, and a custodial vault holds the tokens until the user is ready to explore deeper. That hybrid approach invites millions who ignore crypto headlines yet spend daily on digital media. As the market pivots from narrative trades to tangible use cases, SUBBD writes itself into the story investors care about. Creators keep freedom, audiences gain real ownership. Solaxy Price chatter often circles around Ethereum first, then jumps to Solana, yet the rails connecting those ecosystems remain clunky. Solaxy treats that gap as an opportunity rather than a technical footnote. It deploys a dual execution layer that can post transactions to both chains without forcing users to choose sides. As Ethereum volume climbs, gas fees rise, and traders look for faster venues, Solaxy routes overflow toward Solana while preserving settlement on Ethereum for those who need it. The platform therefore rides two of the most influential narratives driving this looming altcoin season. The mechanism relies on optimistic rollups that synchronize state between the two networks every few minutes. Meanwhile, a directional liquidity engine monitors price corridors and seeds pooled assets where demand spikes. The result feels like a single exchange window even though orders may clear on separate chains. Developers appreciate that they can target either virtual machine with one tool set, saving weeks of porting work. Solaxy also introduces yield channels that automatically stake idle balances in whichever environment offers the higher base return. Users do not have to chase pools or bridge back and forth. Reward tokens compound in the background, adding a passive layer to what begins as simple swapping. $SOLX is now breaking records... 🚀53M RAISED! 🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/J3tguZnTNG — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 16, 2025 Thanks to all these features, SOLX managed to become one of the biggest and most successful presales this year with a meme-based theme. At the time of writing, it has raised upwards of $53 million. As Ethereum rallies and institutional flows push for scalable throughput, Solaxy positions itself as the conveyor belt moving value to the edges. When optimism toward altcoins erupts, infrastructure projects that smooth those paths often outperform, carrying assets across chains smoothly. Snorter Trying to grab a fresh altcoin the instant it surfaces can feel like chasing sparks in a storm. Snorter turns that scramble into a few taps inside Telegram. The bot listens for on-chain liquidity events, sweeps the order book before manual traders even load a chart, and settles each fill at Solana’s cut-rate fees. Copy trading sits one command away, letting newcomers trail seasoned hunters in real time without studying Solidity or order routing. At first glance, it sounds like a toy for hard-core speculators, yet the service is quietly courting a broader wave of users as institutional flow widens the gap between casual investors and high-speed desks. Retail portfolios swell when altcoin season kicks in, but so does volatility. Traditional interfaces lag, gas spikes, and slippage gouges profits. Snorter sidesteps those bottlenecks by anchoring trades to Solana’s low-latency network while still reading activity across Ethereum and upcoming Layer 2 hubs. Its routing engine chooses the cheapest path in the background, then pipes the result back to the Telegram chat where the request began. The experience feels more like messaging a friend than executing an algorithmic strategy, which is precisely why adoption curves bend upward when markets heat. For professionals, the appeal is different. They can script conditional orders, mirror wallet behavior from top-performing accounts, and distribute entries across multiple chains in seconds. Every bull run rewards the tools that help traders keep pace with accelerating price action, making it a project worth keeping on the watchlist and following very closely. Conclusion Market data now places Bitcoin dominance on the back foot while institutional bids on Ether keep climbing. Those two conditions often precede the first clear move in altcoins. Retail outflows from key wallets show many traders are still waiting for an obvious trigger, yet history suggests the best gains accrue to positions set before headlines confirm the trend. Assets backed by functional throughput, cross-chain access, and faster settlement tend to attract the earliest rotation of capital. The projects discussed above meet those practical benchmarks and could reward investors who prefer substance over speculation when the wider market finally pivots.

2025-06-17T16:40:47,"Geopolitical Risk: Iran Commander Issues Grave Warning of Escalation","BitcoinWorld Geopolitical Risk: Iran Commander Issues Grave Warning of Escalation In the often unpredictable world of global events, geopolitical developments can send ripples through financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. A recent report highlights a significant warning from a senior Iranian military commander, suggesting a potential escalation of attacks against Israel could be imminent. Understanding the Latest Geopolitical Risk According to a report by Odaily, citing Iran’s official news agency, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), a high-ranking Iranian military official has issued a stern warning. The commander stated that attacks targeting Israel are expected to intensify significantly in the coming hours. This statement comes amidst already heightened Geopolitical Risk in the region, following previous exchanges and ongoing tensions. Such warnings from senior military figures are typically taken seriously by analysts and governments worldwide, as they can signal a potential shift in the scale or nature of the conflict. Key points from the report: A senior Iranian commander made the statement. The warning points to an escalation of attacks. The escalation is expected within hours. The report cites Iran’s official news agency, IRNA. How Do Iran Israel Tensions Affect Global Markets? Periods of elevated Iran Israel Tensions historically correlate with increased uncertainty in global financial markets. Investors often react to potential conflict by moving away from riskier assets and towards perceived safe havens like gold or government bonds. The Middle East is a critical region for global energy supplies, and any instability there can directly impact oil prices, which in turn affect inflation and economic forecasts globally. Market reactions can include: Increased volatility across stocks, commodities, and currencies. Potential sell-offs in equity markets. Rise in the price of safe-haven assets. Disruptions to supply chains, particularly energy. While the direct economic ties between the conflicting parties might seem limited on a global scale, the broader implications of regional instability, potential involvement of other actors, and impact on critical resources like oil mean that these tensions have a wide-reaching effect on investor sentiment and market stability. Exploring the Impact on the Crypto Market Amidst Middle East Conflict The relationship between geopolitical events and the Crypto Market Impact is a topic of ongoing debate. Some argue that Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ could serve as a hedge against geopolitical instability and inflation, similar to traditional safe havens. The idea is that it operates outside the traditional financial system and is not tied to any single country’s economy or political stability. However, in practice, the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has often shown correlation with traditional risk assets like tech stocks. During periods of broad market fear driven by events like the current Middle East Conflict , cryptocurrencies have sometimes seen price declines alongside equities, as investors liquidate assets across the board to reduce risk or cover losses elsewhere. Key considerations for crypto investors: Bitcoin’s safe-haven narrative is tested during geopolitical crises. Correlation with traditional markets can lead to downside risk. Increased volatility in crypto prices is likely during uncertain times. Global events can affect investor sentiment and adoption rates. While specific attacks or escalations might not have an immediate, direct technical impact on blockchain networks, the resulting fear and uncertainty among global investors can certainly influence trading behavior and price movements in the highly speculative crypto market. Navigating Potential Market Volatility Given the warning of potential escalation and the inherent uncertainty of geopolitical situations, investors should be prepared for increased Market Volatility . This applies not only to traditional assets but also to the crypto market. Actionable insights for investors: Stay Informed: Keep track of reliable news sources regarding the geopolitical situation and market reactions. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how comfortable you are with potential price swings and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Consider Diversification: Ensure your investments are not overly concentrated in assets that might be particularly vulnerable to geopolitical shocks. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Volatility can trigger panic selling. Stick to your long-term investment strategy rather than making impulsive moves based on short-term news. Understand Crypto’s Role: Recognize that while crypto offers unique features, it is not immune to macro global events and market sentiment shifts. Geopolitical events are significant external factors that can influence market dynamics, often rapidly and with little warning. While impossible to predict the exact outcome or market reaction, being aware of the risks and having a prepared mindset can help navigate turbulent times. What Does This Mean for the Future Crypto Market Impact? The current situation underscores how interconnected global finance is, even for emerging asset classes like cryptocurrency. The Crypto Market Impact of geopolitical events like rising Iran Israel Tensions serves as a reminder that while crypto operates on decentralized technology, its valuation and adoption are still heavily influenced by global macroeconomic and political forces. As the situation in the Middle East develops, market participants will be closely watching for signs of de-escalation or further conflict. Each development will likely contribute to the ongoing narrative about crypto’s role in a world facing various economic and political uncertainties. Ultimately, the ability of crypto to function as a true safe haven during crises remains a subject of observation and debate. Events like these provide real-world scenarios to study how this nascent asset class behaves under pressure. Summary A senior Iranian commander’s warning of escalating attacks on Israel within hours introduces a significant layer of Geopolitical Risk into the global landscape. Such developments in the Middle East Conflict naturally heighten Iran Israel Tensions and are expected to increase Market Volatility across traditional financial systems. While the Crypto Market Impact is complex and debated, historical trends suggest that cryptocurrencies are unlikely to be entirely insulated from the fear and uncertainty that grips global markets during such times. Investors are advised to stay informed, assess their risk exposure, and approach the coming hours and days with caution and a clear strategy.

2025-06-17T16:30:00,"Experts projecting BTC nears $112K again—but MUTM stuns with 12,000+ holders","As Bitcoin (BTC) approaches the $112,000 mark again, the crypto market is heating up with renewed excitement. Historically, such major price milestones have triggered a wave of capital rotation from Bitcoin (BTC) into promising altcoins—especially those under $0.10 with clear use cases and growth potential. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the spotlight. While Bitcoin (BTC) grabs headlines with price speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining ground through real progress, delivering strong presale momentum, and building a functional lending ecosystem from the ground up. Dual lending models: P2C and P2P at the core Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed as a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol. The system enables lenders to deposit digital assets like USDC, ETH, or AVAX into liquidity pools, where they begin earning interest automatically. Interest rates are determined dynamically, depending on pool usage. As more borrowers take overcollateralized loans from a pool, interest rates rise. This market-driven rate model incentivizes new lenders to join high-performing pools and discourages over-borrowing, allowing the system to regulate itself without any centralized control. Alongside this automated pool-based model, users will also be able to participate in P2P lending. Here, individual lenders and borrowers can define terms directly with one another, creating flexible, custom-tailored loan agreements. This peer-to-peer feature is especially relevant for lending or borrowing tokens not usually accepted in traditional DeFi pools, including higher-risk assets like PEPE or SHIB. Both models will be powered entirely by smart contracts, enabling users to interact directly with the protocol without relying on third parties. It’s a design that brings complete transparency, flexibility, and decentralization to the lending landscape. Users in Mutuum’s liquidity pools will instantly receive mtTokens that represent the value of their deposited assets. These mtTokens, such as mtDAI or mtUSDC, will accumulate interest over time and can be traded on secondary markets or used within the protocol for further borrowing. The mtTokens provide constant liquidity for users without needing to exit their lending positions, unlocking greater flexibility and utility. A portion of the protocol’s profits will be used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This buyback mechanism is designed to increase token demand over time while delivering consistent value to long-term participants. It also aligns incentives between users and the growth of the protocol—something that speculative tokens simply don’t offer. A regulatory-ready foundation with CertiK Audit completed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already taken significant steps to ensure security and transparency. The project completed a CertiK audit, using manual review and static analysis, and received a Token Scan Score of 80.00. The audit began on February 25, 2025, and was revised on May 20, 2025, confirming that the team is focused on deploying a well-tested, secure system ahead of launch. At a time when investors are increasingly cautious about smart contract risk, this layer of verification sets Mutuum apart from other low-market-cap DeFi tokens. While most DeFi protocols still operate on congested and expensive Layer-1 networks, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed with full Layer-2 integration. This will significantly reduce transaction fees and improve speed for users engaging in lending and borrowing. The choice to build on Layer-2 solves major usability issues in decentralized finance, making Mutuum more accessible and efficient—especially for smaller investors who are often priced out of Ethereum-based transactions. Among the key features in development is Mutuum’s upcoming decentralized stablecoin, which will be fully overcollateralized and backed by assets already held within the protocol. Unlike traditional stablecoins that rely on fiat reserves or centralized backers, Mutuum’s stable asset will be minted directly from on-chain collateral, ensuring full transparency and algorithmic supply adjustment. This stablecoin will not only offer users a more reliable borrowing option but will also strengthen the protocol’s treasury by redirecting interest payments into the ecosystem. It’s a system designed to increase platform sustainability while opening up new utility paths for MUTM holders. Why MUTM token holders will benefit Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply of 4 billion tokens. Its utility is deeply integrated into every part of the protocol. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) users will have access to passive income through staking, influence over protocol decisions, and eligibility to participate in safety modules that generate dividends. At the current price of $0.03, early buyers will soon gain exposure with extensive built-in utility and a protocol backed by a functioning roadmap. Upon launch, the planned listing price is $0.06. An investor allocating $1,500 during Phase 5 receives 50,000 MUTM. When the price reaches $0.90—aligned with realistic valuations in the DeFi sector—this allocation becomes $45,000. According to the project roadmap, a beta version of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform is scheduled to go live in parallel with the token listing. This early access phase will give users the opportunity to test the platform, engage in real lending and borrowing, and begin staking rewards. To increase awareness and participation, the team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway campaign—driving new users to explore the presale and become part of the early community. While Bitcoin (BTC) continues its upward march toward $112,000, investors are looking beyond the headlines for high-utility, high-upside opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is answering that demand with real DeFi functionality, smart contract-powered lending, passive income systems, and a rapidly growing user base.

2025-06-17T16:14:19,"Blockchain Group Plans to Raise €7.2M to Buy More Bitcoin","Blockchain Group has announced plans to raise €7.2 million, about $8.3 million to buy more Bitcoin (BTC). This is part of a larger goal to invest up to $342 million in Bitcoin over time through its at-the-market (ATM) offering program. The company’s move reflects a rising trend, as more firms add Bitcoin to their financial reserves. Blockchain Group To Fund Bitcoin Purchases With New Shares During the official announcement , the Paris-listed firm said it will issue about 1.6 million new shares to fund this acquisition. The average price for each share is expected to be €4.49, equivalent to $5.19. These funds will support its ongoing Bitcoin acquisition efforts. This move follows last week’s announcement of a larger program with TOMAB, a French asset manager and investor in the company. As part of that plan, the company also revealed plans to raise an additional €9.7 million, worth $11.2 million, through a mix of equity and convertible bond issuance. These steps show the company’s clear focus on building a strong Bitcoin treasury. Meanwhile, Matthew Sigel of VanEck recently raised concerns about small-cap companies claiming to build significant crypto investments. He said many of these firms have weak finances and low market value. Their crypto investment announcements may boost stock prices rather than reflect real business plans. Blockchain Group Joins Growing List of Major BTC Holders This move is part of a broader trend where more companies hold Bitcoin as a key treasury asset . Once viewed as too unstable for corporate finances, Bitcoin is now gaining acceptance as a long-term store of value. Many now see the digital coin as a long-term store of value and a safe haven during economic crises. Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, which recently added 10,100 BTC to its balanced sheet is leading the trend. The Nasdaq-listed company now owns 592,100 BTC, the most significant amount held by any publicly traded firm. Meanwhile, according to public data, Blockchain Groups holds a modest stash of 1,471 BTC. Market Reaction and Price Movements Despite the news, Blockchain Group’s stock dropped more than 4% and is now trading at around €5.53 on Euronext Growth Paris. However, the market remains open, and the stock could move further depending on investor reaction. Bitcoin also dipped slightly, falling 1.00% over the last 24 hours. It is currently trading at $105,634, according to CoinMarketCap data.

2025-06-17T16:12:08,"Why Doesn't the FED Cut Interest Rates? What to Expect Tomorrow? Analysts Explained! ""There's Only One Reason for This!""","One of the expected events that will trigger a rise in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins is the US Federal Reserve (FED) starting to cut interest rates. At this point, tomorrow's FED June interest rate decision will be more important, while the general expectation in the market is that the FED will keep interest rates constant. While the possibility of the FED making a surprise move is almost non-existent, analysts argue that the FED is actually in a position to cut interest rates. FED May Cut Interest Rates But…! Accordingly, analyst Nick Timiraos said the FED will keep interest rates steady and evaluate the impact of tariffs on inflation. Nick Timiraos expects the Fed to keep interest rates on hold this week despite recent inflation improvements, amid ongoing concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on price expectations. According to the analyst, although inflation data has moderated in the last three months, Fed members remain concerned about how tariff-related cuts could affect future inflation data. At this point, the Fed will continue its cautious approach, according to the analyst. The Reason FED Doesn't Cut Interest Rates Is Only Political! Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya also claimed that the FED could cut interest rates right now, but it did not do so for just one reason. Speaking on the All-In Podcast, Chamath Palihapitiya argued that the Fed will not be cutting interest rates in the near future, pointing to politics as the reason for this. Stating that the possibility of a rate cut in the summer months is quite low, the famous name argued that the FED could make a 100 basis point cut right now. Stating that such a move would reduce the US debt by $300 billion, the famous name claimed that it would be good for the US and the economy in every way, not just debt savings. “If there's a numerical justification for lowering interest rates and it has all these positive effects for the U.S. economy, why not do it? “The only answer is political. The bottom line is that the Fed is being cautious for political reasons.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Doesn't the FED Cut Interest Rates? What to Expect Tomorrow?

2025-06-17T16:10:47,"Brazilian stock exchange begins trading Ethereum and Solana futures contracts in US dollars","B3, a Brazilian stock exchange, has started trading Ethereum and Solana futures contracts in US dollars. The firm announced the groundbreaking development Monday, stating that quoted prices for the products will reference Nasdaq Ether and Solana indices. With this, B3 is consolidating its reach in the crypto derivatives sector as it already offers Bitcoin futures contracts with around $4 billion in daily trading volume on the exchange. Derivative contracts expose investors to the expected price adjustments for crypto assets without owning a single coin. The exchange wrote: “With the new cryptoasset futures, B3 meets the growing market and investor demand for products with exposure to cryptocurrencies, bringing more innovation and sophistication to products.” The announcement added that each unit of the Ethereum futures contract will be 0.25 ETH while the Solana contract unit will be 5 SOL. Thus, this will make the product more accessible while offering users familiar with crypto a safe and regulated way to trade on price volatility. B3 has a long history of offering crypto-focused products for investors, with the exchange launching its first digital assets-related product, HASH11, in 2021. It now has 21 crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs) of ETFs available for investors. B3 announces changes in Bitcoin futures contract size Meanwhile, the stock exchange has also reduced the unit size of its Bitcoin futures contract by ten times, with a unit now worth 0.01 BTC (approximately 6,000 Brazilian Real). This follows approval by the Brazilian securities regulator (CVM). This move is part of its efforts to make the Bitcoin futures contract, which launched in 2024, more accessible, not only for Brazilian traders but also for international investors. For instance, US investors have enjoyed access to Bitcoin Future and Bitcoin Future Scrolling products on B3 since May. Unlike the Ethereum and Solana futures contract, the Bitcoin futures trade in Brazilian Real and the reduction in unit size also took effect on June 16, the same day as the launch of the two new products. In one year of having Bitcoin futures, 41 million contracts were negotiated, and in April 2025 alone, 4 million were negotiated. Brazil’s crypto sector continues to grow With many countries still struggling to understand and regulate crypto, B3’s new products capture how Brazil is growing into a major crypto hub in Latin America. By pricing its new products in US Dollars, the exchange particularly shows its interest in attracting international investors to the country. Interestingly, the country has seen significant levels of adoption as it ranks ninth globally on the Chainalysis Global Adoption Index for 2024 while ranking second in value received for the Latin America region with $90.3 billion. Brazilian fintech Meliuz also recently adopted the Bitcoin treasury. However, there are regulatory pressures from several angles. The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has expressed concerns about stablecoin use in the country, claiming it enables money laundering and tax evasion. It is now making efforts to regulate stablecoins, with recently proposed rules that could limit the transfer of stablecoins across wallets. However, stakeholders have warned that rules must not overregulate the sector to avoid killing innovation. Still, more setbacks might be coming with the recent removal of tax exemptions on capital gains for small-scale crypto holders. The move, part of new tax policies under Provisional Measure 1303, imposed a flat 17.5% tax on all gains from crypto assets. However, the new rules have already faced pushback from crypto stakeholders who believe that they could affect the competitiveness of the country’s crypto sector. Lawmakers have queried the new tax regime for not involving stakeholders, with some even pushing to repeal it. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The trader, known as AguilaTrades on X, entered a bitcoin long position at $106,000, and sat through at Monday's high of $108,800 before the largest cryptocurrency took a tumble to trade recently around $104,000. Bitcoin volatility has been relatively low for months, with the price ranging between the $100,000 level of support and record highs around $110,000. That hasn't perturbed derivatives traders, who are continually betting on upside with leverage, subsequently getting chopped in a tight range. It's not the first time AguilaTrades has recorded a losing trade at these levels. Last week they were up $5.8 million on a BTC long before losing $12.5 million, according to Lookonchain . On paper the trade has credentials because BTC has managed to remain above $100,000 despite escalating conflict in the Middle East, which is typically a catalyst for downside in risk assets. However, remaining agnostic to price action in this range and simply buying support and selling resistance would have yielded far greater results. Bitcoin has been trading in this range since May 9 with numerous attempts at breaking support and resistance along the way.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/17/hyperliquid-trader-turns-usd10m-profit-into-usd2-5m-loss-as-bitcoin-falls,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING","Finance|Cryptocurrency Derivatives|Bitcoin Trading|Leverage|News",cryptocompare
