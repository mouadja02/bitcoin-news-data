2025-06-26T14:50:39,"Nano Labs’ Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: Bolstering BTC Holdings to 1,000","BitcoinWorld Nano Labs’ Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: Bolstering BTC Holdings to 1,000 The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, with new developments emerging that reshape the landscape of digital finance. One such significant move comes from Nano Labs, a name increasingly recognized in the intersection of semiconductor manufacturing and digital assets. This Nasdaq-listed firm has just made a substantial stride, significantly boosting its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, a move that signals a bold future for corporate treasury management in the crypto space. Nano Labs’ Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: A Deep Dive In a move that has captured the attention of both the traditional financial sector and the crypto community, Nano Labs , a prominent Chinese semiconductor manufacturer specializing in cutting-edge crypto mining chips, recently announced a major expansion of its digital asset portfolio. The firm shared via X (formerly Twitter) that it successfully secured an additional 600 BTC, valued at approximately $63.6 million, through its inaugural round of fundraising via convertible notes. This latest acquisition elevates Nano Labs’ total BTC holdings to an impressive 1,000 BTC, solidifying its position among publicly traded companies with substantial Bitcoin treasuries. This isn’t Nano Labs’ first foray into significant Bitcoin investment. Last December, the company publicly declared its ambitious plan to purchase and hold up to $50 million worth of Bitcoin over the next five years. This consistent strategy underscores a clear commitment to integrating Bitcoin into its long-term financial framework, moving beyond just manufacturing hardware for crypto mining to actively participating in the asset class it helps facilitate. What Are Convertible Notes and Why Did Nano Labs Use Them? The choice of convertible notes as a fundraising mechanism for this significant Bitcoin acquisition is particularly noteworthy. For those unfamiliar, convertible notes are a type of short-term debt that converts into equity (shares) at a later date, usually upon the occurrence of a specific event like a future funding round or a pre-determined maturity date. They are often favored by startups and growing companies because they: Delay Valuation: They allow companies to raise capital without immediately setting a definitive valuation, which can be beneficial if the company expects its value to increase significantly in the near future. Flexibility: They offer flexibility in terms of interest rates, maturity dates, and conversion terms, making them adaptable to various financing needs. Less Dilution Upfront: Initial investors receive debt, not equity, which means less immediate dilution for existing shareholders compared to a direct equity round. For Nano Labs, using convertible notes likely provided a strategic way to quickly raise capital for their Bitcoin purchase without undergoing a full equity offering, which can be time-consuming and complex. It signals confidence in their future growth and the potential appreciation of both their core business and their Bitcoin assets. Expanding the Treasury: The Growing Trend of Corporate BTC Holdings Nano Labs’ increasing BTC holdings are part of a broader, accelerating trend: publicly traded companies integrating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. This strategy goes beyond mere speculation; it’s a calculated move by forward-thinking firms to: Hedge Against Inflation: With global economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, many companies view Bitcoin as a potential store of value, akin to digital gold, that can protect their capital from depreciation. Diversify Assets: Adding Bitcoin provides diversification away from traditional fiat currencies and conventional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Signal Innovation and Industry Alignment: For companies deeply embedded in the digital asset space, like Nano Labs with its crypto mining chip production, holding Bitcoin aligns their balance sheet with their operational focus. It sends a strong signal of belief in the future of the decentralized economy. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering companies an opportunity for substantial capital appreciation on their treasury assets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have famously adopted this strategy, accumulating vast amounts of Bitcoin. Their success, despite market fluctuations, has encouraged other firms to consider similar approaches, validating Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset. Nano Labs is clearly following in these footsteps, demonstrating a proactive approach to managing its financial reserves in a rapidly changing global economy. What Does This Mean for the Future of Nano Labs and Crypto Mining? This significant Bitcoin acquisition by Nano Labs has several implications for both the company and the broader crypto mining industry. Firstly, it strengthens Nano Labs’ financial foundation. By holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin, the company is not only investing in a potentially appreciating asset but also aligning its long-term financial health with the success of the digital asset ecosystem it serves. This synergy can create a virtuous cycle: as Bitcoin’s value potentially rises, so does the value of Nano Labs’ holdings, potentially providing additional capital for research, development, and expansion of its semiconductor business. Secondly, it underscores the increasing maturity and institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. When a Nasdaq-listed company, especially one at the forefront of semiconductor technology for crypto, makes such a bold statement, it lends credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This can encourage other traditional businesses to explore similar strategies, further driving mainstream adoption. Finally, for the crypto mining sector itself, Nano Labs’ move is a powerful vote of confidence. As a key supplier of the very chips that power mining operations, their decision to hold Bitcoin directly indicates a strong belief in the continued profitability and growth of mining activities and the underlying asset. It suggests that despite market cycles, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and its ecosystem remains robust in the eyes of industry insiders. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts For investors tracking the digital asset space, Nano Labs’ strategy offers several key takeaways: Watch Corporate Treasury Trends: Keep an eye on publicly traded companies, especially those in tech and finance, that are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. These moves can indicate growing institutional confidence and potentially influence market dynamics. Understand Funding Mechanisms: Familiarize yourself with instruments like convertible notes . Understanding how companies are funding their crypto acquisitions can provide insight into their financial health and strategic outlook. Consider Industry Alignment: Companies like Nano Labs, whose core business is intertwined with the crypto ecosystem, might be particularly strong candidates for long-term investment, as their operational success is linked to the growth of the assets they hold. For crypto enthusiasts, this news reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital currency to a recognized corporate asset. It highlights the ongoing institutionalization of the space and the potential for Bitcoin to become a standard component of corporate financial strategies. Conclusion: Nano Labs’ Bold Step into Bitcoin’s Future Nano Labs’ latest Bitcoin acquisition , funded through innovative convertible notes , is far more than just a balance sheet adjustment. It represents a strategic and confident stride into the future of corporate finance, deeply entwined with the burgeoning digital economy. By significantly increasing its BTC holdings to 1,000 BTC, this Nasdaq-listed semiconductor powerhouse is not only hedging against economic uncertainties but also actively participating in the growth of the very ecosystem its crypto mining chips power. This move solidifies Nano Labs’ position as a forward-thinking entity, demonstrating a clear belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its integral role in the evolving financial landscape. It serves as a compelling example of how traditional businesses are embracing digital assets, paving the way for broader institutional adoption and shaping the future of global finance.

2025-06-26T14:47:46,"Bitcoin ETFs Notch $1B Weekly Inflow, Extending 10-Week Streak","BlackRock's IBIT dominated with a $1.23 billion inflow, while Bitwise's BITB saw $29.85 million, Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust $14.93 million, and Hashdex's DEFI fund $1.17 million. Positive Market Sentiment Amid Easing Geopolitical Tensions Having witnessed a 10‑day streak of ETF inflows, Bitcoin has been able to record this bullish run thanks to easing geopolitical uncertainty with the Iran-Israel ceasefire taking center stage. BlackRock's IBIT dominance cannot go unnoticed because its inflows since early June have surpassed $2.6 billion, securing 9-concecutive days of inflows. Therefore, the $1.02 billion net inflow reflects sustained institutional conviction, supply-driven bullish dynamics, and geopolitical stability with Bitcoin ETFs already cementing their place as a mainstream investment vehicles. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and crypto funds have raked in inflows for 10 consecutive weeks, adding $1.24 billion recently and pushing year-to-date totals to $15 billion. Despite holiday lulls and global jitters, investors are seizing the pullback as a buying opportunity—not a sell signal. Bitcoin attracted $1.11 billion in weekly capital inflows, boosting its monthly total to $2.37 billion and year-to-date haul to $12.7 billion—backed by nearly $152 billion in assets under management, according to CoinShares data . Therefore, these metrics paint a bullish Bitcoin picture as more institutional and retail investors continue jumping on the BTC bandwagon. Bitcoin’s Illiquid Supply Ballons Bitcoin’s illiquid supply—the portion of coins held in wallets that rarely move—is now 14.37 million BTC, up from roughly 13.9 million BTC at the start of the year, reflecting a rise of 470,000 BTC YTD. This means over 72 percent of the circulating Bitcoin supply—approximately 19.8 million BTC—is now effectively “off‑market,” held by long‑term investors and cold wallets. That’s a historic peak in illiquid supply, driven by two reinforcing trends: What’s Driving the Surge? Record Accumulation in Recent Months Over the past 30 days, around 180,000 BTC moved into illiquid wallets—the strongest monthly shift since December 2022. “Whales & sharks” (entities holding 10–10,000 BTC) added 83,000 BTC, while small retail investors offloaded a few hundred. Institutions & ETFs Mopping Up Corporate treasuries and U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are absorbing newly mined BTC almost as fast as they’re released, sometimes even exceeding miner issuance. As a result, what little liquid supply remains is being hoarded or locked away. Why It Matters Reduced sell‑side pressure: With fewer BTC on exchanges, sudden demand surges can trigger sharp price moves. Heightened scarcity: As more coins become illiquid, a supply “squeeze” becomes increasingly likely, bolstered by the upcoming mining reward halving in 2028. Maturing market: The shift toward long-term holding echoes Bitcoin’s evolution as a “digital gold” rather than speculative asset. Outlook This rising illiquid supply trend—a bellwether of investor conviction—may predispose Bitcoin toward sustained upward momentum. While cyclical pullbacks remain possible, fewer coins available for trading mean any demand spike might outsizedly impact price. Conclusion Bitcoin’s illiquid supply topping 14 million BTC underscores a market dominated by conviction, not speculation. With whales, institutions, and treasuries continuing to accumulate, the tightening float points to mounting scarcity, setting the stage for potentially bullish price dynamics in the months ahead. This coupled with Bitcoin’s ETF and capital inflows going through the roof have the potential of sending the apex cryptocurrency to a new all-time high (ATH) above with the present price being $107,104.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9721/bitcoin-et-fs-notch-1-b-weekly-inflow-extending-10-week-streak,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T14:46:48,"Billionaire Hedge Fund Manager Puts Bitcoin in His Fantastic 40 List for the Next 5 Years","Billionaire Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, has included Bitcoin in his “Fantastic 40,” a handpicked list of what he considers the top investment opportunities for the next five years. Key Takeaways: Billionaire hedge fund manager Philippe Laffont named Bitcoin among his top investments for the next five years. Laffont projects Bitcoin’s market cap could surpass $5 trillion by 2030, driven by reduced volatility. Laffont says he regrets waiting, calling Bitcoin a missed opportunity he now takes seriously. The hedge fund billionaire ranked Bitcoin alongside Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta, notably excluding Apple and Google from his top five. Speaking with CNBC , Laffont admitted to having long overlooked Bitcoin, despite its continued price strength. “I wake up every day at three in the morning and I’m like, ‘why am I such an idiot? What have I been waiting for, not being involved in it?’” he said. “Sometimes you have to change your mind and say, ‘I made a mistake.’” Bitcoin Market Cap to Double by 2030: Laffont Despite not yet owning Bitcoin, Laffont projects its market cap could more than double to over $5 trillion by 2030, putting it in the same league as tech giants. He expects Microsoft to hit a $5.7 trillion valuation and Nvidia to reach $5.6 trillion within the same timeframe. “I thought of like the market cap of the world [and] the net worth of the world is, I think $450 to $500 trillion, equities are let’s say $120 trillion, gold above and under the ground is $20 trillion,” he said. Part of his revised outlook stems from Bitcoin’s maturing volatility. “It seems its volatility as an asset class is coming down,” he noted, comparing it to the Nasdaq’s risk profile. He also cited the de-dollarization trend and the potential decline of U.S. financial dominance as tailwinds for Bitcoin’s rise. Notably, Laffont is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Likewise, crypto analyst Scott Melker has said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure. Hedge Funds Remain Skeptical of Bitcoin’s Future Despite growing interest in Bitcoin, not everyone in traditional finance is convinced of its long-term staying power. As reported, Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific, has said that many hedge funds remain skeptical about Bitcoin’s long-term viability, believing it may lose momentum after the Trump administration. While Trump’s support for Bitcoin has boosted sentiment, others, including JAN3’s Samson Mow, warn that enthusiasm could fade under a different administration. Semler Scientific already holds 4,449 BTC and plans to hit 10,000 by year-end.

2025-06-26T14:39:49,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Holds Steady At $107,000 As Ceasefire Brings Relief","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its gains for a fourth consecutive day before registering a marginal decline. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has held above $107,000, with analysts favoring a breakout to $110,000. BTC is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $107,077. Price action stabilized after tensions in the Middle East eased and the Fed held interest rates steady. GameStop Raises $450M For Potential Bitcoin Buy GameStop shareholders are unimpressed despite raising another $450 million as part of its private convertible note offering for investments, potentially including Bitcoin. The videogame retailer disclosed in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that an individual who opted into the initial $2.25 billion note offering intended to purchase an additional $450 million. GameStop has earmarked the funds for general corporate purposes, including investments and potential acquisitions. While the firm did not mention Bitcoin , it has discussed plans to grow its treasury. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $107,000. If GameStop used the entire $450 million to purchase Bitcoin, it could double its existing treasury of 4,710 BTC . Several companies are adding Bitcoin to diversify treasury risk and tap into liquidity. However, Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research, believes that only buying Bitcoin isn’t enough. Liu stated, “A Bitcoin treasury rollout requires a well-planned strategy to protect capital and strengthen liquidity because without “clear execution and long-term vision, it’s unlikely to deliver sustained value. It’s not just buying Bitcoin. It’s how and why. Clear strategy and strong execution build trust and attract liquidity, but if it’s just hype or a ‘sell the news’ event like GameStop, the impact will be muted.” Satoshi Era Miners Sold Just 150 BTC In 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) miners have added over 4,000 BTC to their reserves since April. Large miners have been adding to their reserves instead of taking profits despite the flagship cryptocurrency reaching all-time highs. The dramatic change in miner approach was disclosed by new research conducted by CryptoQuant, which highlighted a dramatic decline in “Satoshi-era” miner sales. According to the report, miners are holding on to their assets despite being severely underpaid. CryptoQuant revealed that conditions for miners remain difficult despite BTC trading near all-time highs. “Bitcoin miners are the most underpaid they have been in the last year as daily revenues decline to two-month lows. The Daily revenue fell to $34 million on June 22, the lowest since April 20, 2025, due to lower transaction fees and the recent decline in the price of Bitcoin.” The report states that even the oldest miners are breaking tradition and are unwilling to sell despite burgeoning prices. “Selling from Satoshi-era miners remains at low levels. These miners have sold only 150 Bitcoin so far in 2025, compared to almost 10K Bitcoin in 2024. Historically, old miners from the Satoshi era usually move their coins after a strong price rally, indicating a potential market top.” Wall Street Pours $1B In Bitcoin ETFs Wall Street investors have pumped over $1 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs this week. Bitcoin ETFs hold over 1.2 million Bitcoin as of June 25, adding over 9,700 BTC over the past three days. According to Glassnode, more than half the week’s inflows came on June 25, after reports that President Donald Trump may announce a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell as early as September. The US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback’s strength against foreign currencies, plunged 1.23% since the report, dropping to its lowest levels since April. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a stunning recovery this week after geopolitical tensions dragged it below $100,000 on Sunday. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $98,385 on Sunday before rebounding to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,982. Market sentiment flipped to bullish after President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, BTC rallied over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and end Monday at $105,442. BTC is trading around 3% lower than its all-time high, with analysts expecting continued bullish momentum, which could push the price beyond $110,000. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, stated that markets are showing strength. He also said that open interest suggested a possible squeeze at $110,000 before a reversal. “If a pullback ensues, key levels around $106,000 and $104,000 should offer strong support.” BTC also registered surging institutional interest this week, with Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap announcing the purchase of $400 million worth of BTC . The announcement came days after it signed a $1 billion deal to become listed on public markets. Metaplanet also announced the purchase of $133 million worth of BTC , becoming the fifth-largest corporate holder of the asset. The latest acquisitions come after Gamestop purchased $500 million worth of Bitcoin in May. BTC registered a sharp increase on Monday (June 16), reaching an intraday high of $108,939 before settling at $106,808, ultimately registering a rise of 1.18%. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, falling over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884, but was back in the red on Thursday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $104,631. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as BTC lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $106,513, dropping 1.19%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,388.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Western District of North Carolina, Jessica Bailey Sowell engaged in the scheme from March 2023 to February 2024. Court records show that she created fraudulent identification documents using compromised personal identifying information (PII) that were obtained through stolen mail, the internet and other sources. Sowell then used the fake documents at banks, hotels and retail stores. Investigators found that she had letters, bank cards and checks belonging to at least 26 victims of identity theft. The 32-year-old was apprehended after a federal search warrant was executed at a hotel room where she was staying. Investigators found a suitcase containing hundreds of mail with various names and addresses and another suitcase with store-tagged merchandise, two handwritten journals with the names and credit information of several individuals and 23 driver’s licenses from different states that show Sowell’s photograph and the PII of the identity theft victims. They also seized from the rental vehicle that Sowell was using a credit card under the name of an ID theft victim, receipts for goods that were bought using the victim’s credit card, an identity card printer, multiple blank identity cards and holographic stickers. Sowell, who is prohibited from possessing firearms, also kept a Taurus G3 9mm handgun in the hotel room. On Monday, she was sentenced to 57 months of jail time followed by five years of supervised release for bank fraud, aggravated identity theft and unlawful possession of a firearm. She was also ordered to pay restitution to her victims in the amount of $47,190.25.

2025-06-26T14:30:50,"US Housing Agency Authorizes Crypto Assets In Mortgage Assessments","The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to recognize cryptocurrency as an asset in their assessments of single-family mortgage loan risks. This directive, issued by FHFA Director William J. Pulte, marks a pivotal moment in the integration of digital assets within the traditional finance framework, particularly in the realm of home lending. Crypto As Asset For Home Loans According to CNBC, the order mandates that both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac create proposals that allow borrowers to use digital assets without needing to convert them into US dollars before closing a loan. Pulte emphasized that this initiative aligns with President Donald Trump’s vision of positioning the United States as a global leader in cryptocurrency. Historically, cryptocurrency has been largely excluded from mortgage underwriting due to concerns over its volatility , regulatory ambiguities, and the challenges associated with verifying asset reserves. However, this new directive signals a shift in perspective, recognizing the increasing acceptance of crypto within institutional finance and federal policy. A ‘Monumental Shift’ The FHFA’s order acknowledges cryptocurrency as an emerging asset class that could provide opportunities for wealth building outside of conventional stock and bond markets. Yet, the directive specifies that only digital assets stored on US-regulated, centralized exchanges (CEX) will be considered, ensuring that these assets can be clearly evidenced. Additionally, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are required to implement measures to account for the “inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies,” ensuring that these assets do not jeopardize their underwriting standards. Both enterprises will need to submit their proposals for assessment to their respective boards of directors and subsequently to the FHFA for final approval. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were placed under government control in September 2008 as government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), play a crucial role in the US housing market, holding over $7 trillion in housing loans. Market expert Echo X weighed in on this development in a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), asserting that the decision to allow digital assets as reserves represents a monumental shift. The expert noted that this change will enable borrowers to use their crypto holdings as part of their home loan qualifications , eliminating previous barriers that required users to liquidate their assets to qualify for loans. According to Echo X, this move opens the floodgates for genuine adoption of cryptocurrency within the housing market, signaling the dawn of a tokenized real estate market supported by the US mortgage system. This decision caused an uptick in prices across the broader digital asset ecosystem, with Bitcoin (BTC) surging 1.5% toward $107,000 in the 24-hour chart. Consequently, the total crypto market cap also surged to $3.27 trillion.

2025-06-26T14:30:20,"Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer","Bitcoin is starting to inch closer toward $110,000 again, recently pushing to an intraday high of $108,116 and now steadily trading above $107,000. Despite the retracement below $99,000 in the past week, Bitcoin’s current price action shows that the broader market is still bullish. Notably, the recent price action in the past 24 hours is beginning to quiet questions about whether Bitcoin has already reached its top for this cycle. The MVRV Z-Score may be offering a clear answer, and it points in a very different direction from what some might expect. MVRV Z-Score Says Bitcoin Has Room To Run According to crypto analyst Doctor Profit, who initially posted an on-chain analysis of Bitcoin on the social media platform X, the MVRV Z-Score indicates that BTC is still far from its cycle top. The MVRV Z-Score is an established on-chain metric used to determine whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Is In And Price Is Headed For $92,000, Analyst Warns As pointed out by the analyst, the current level on the MVRV Z-Score metric is only slightly above 2, which has been a relatively neutral zone since Bitcoin’s creation. Bitcoin only reached its major tops in past cycles when this metric climbed into the red zone and above a value of around 8 and above. The overall Bitcoin price chart shared by Doctor Profit supports this claim. Peaks in the orange MVRV Z-Score line are shown with red shaded zones in the chart below. These red zones have aligned almost perfectly with Bitcoin’s price tops in 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2021. On the other hand, despite the recent surge to new all-time highs in May, the current cycle has yet to push BItcoin’s price into that overheated region. Instead, the chart shows the Z-Score still in a much lower band. This boils down to show that the Bitcoin price could have a very significant upside left. MVRV vs Price: What The Current Setup Means For Bitcoin One detail that stands out in the current cycle is the pattern of lower highs forming in the MVRV Z-Score, as seen in the chart. Unlike in old cycles, where the metric surged into extreme overvaluation zones above 10, the most recent peaks have been noticeably more subdued. This trend could be interpreted as a signal that the market is beginning to mature or that Bitcoin may even already be approaching the peak of its current cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align However, although this pattern is worth keeping an eye on, it is far from conclusive. The only conclusive fact is that Bitcoin’s price has never reached a definitive cycle top until the MVRV Z-Score has pushed into the red zone, which it has yet to do this time around. Although there isn’t a set price peak from the metric, other analysts have offered a wide range of predictions for where it might land. Predictions of Bitcoin price peaks range anywhere from $150,000 to as high as $500,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,740, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-26T14:20:38,"The corporate Bitcoin fever has reached London and is bouncing to Sweden","The corporate Bitcoin fever is spreading fast. What started with Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is now becoming the new boardroom obsession. Firms from Sweden to London are buying Bitcoin for their treasuries, raising millions, and even ditching ETFs for direct holdings. From miners to tech startups, Europe’s Bitcoin moment is turning balance sheets into bullish statements. The trend comes as BTC is looking strong and heading towards reclaiming the $110K mark. Bitcoin lands on EU balance sheets According to reports, Sweden’s Bitcoin Treasury Capital just made its opening move with the purchase of 66 BTC after raising SEK 100 million ($10.5M). Their next move comes in the wake of going public under the ticker BTC on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. Hopping on the momentum, British-listed company Vault Ventures added 1.86 BTC to its stash, bringing the firm’s total to 2.08 BTC. It announced that it had completed fundraising and invested £750,000 in Ethereum and £150,000 in Bitcoin. Vault Ventures also picked up more Ethereum (ETH), doubling down on its crypto-intensive strategy. Then there’s Catenai, now planning to hold a portion of its excess cash in Bitcoin and some in $TAO. The firm is mixing hard money with AI tokens and raising around £1.6 million ($2.2 million) to kick things off. 11 out of 84 (13%) active companies listed on 🇬🇧 UK's Aquis Stock Exchange have BTC exposure or are raising funds to acquire BTC 🤯 If 13% of all worldwide public companies adopt the BTC strategy, we should see around 6,900 public companies adopting the Bitcoin Treasury… pic.twitter.com/Xf3J2SYpSr — NLNico (@btcNLNico) June 25, 2025 NLNico reported that 11 out of 84 (13%) active companies on the UK’s Aquis Stock Exchange have Bitcoin exposure or are raising funds to acquire BTC. He added that if 13% of all worldwide public companies are willing to adopt the Bitcoin strategy , then the market would see around 6,900 companies entering in arena. Michael Saylor’s corporate Bitcoin playbook goes global Another plot twist comes as a literal gold mining company, Bluebird Mining, wants to start mining “digital gold.” Bluebird Mining upgraded its fundraising target to a minimum of £10 million ($13.7 million) to fund a Bitcoin strategy. It announced a £2 million facility and got flooded with offers. In other developments, the Smarter Web Company raised £41.2 million ($56.5 million) via Accelerated Bookbuild to buy more BTC. Finally, Sixty Six Capital Inc. is going all-in on Michael Saylor. It has snapped up another 18.2 Bitcoins and plans to convert its 113 BTC in ETF exposure into direct holdings. Canada-based Neptune Digital Assets also jumped on the wave and shared a Bitcoin treasury update. The company has added 3 BTC since its last update in April and now holds around 404 BTC. However, it also mentioned that it has Solana (SOL) staked and uses the rewards to buy more Bitcoin. As discussions and actions to enter the biggest crypto into their balance sheets are growing, Bitcoin is booming hard. BTC price has jumped by 27% in the last 90 days despite facing global market turbulence. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $107,354 as of press time. The crypto ETF market is also buzzing. June 25 saw Bitcoin ETFs recording a net inflow of $548 million. This marked 12 consecutive days of net inflows Strategy is still the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

For crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, the news from this publicly listed Japanese firm is nothing short of electrifying: Metaplanet has significantly boosted its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves, solidifying its position as a major player in the institutional Bitcoin landscape. What’s Driving Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy? Metaplanet, a name increasingly synonymous with strategic digital asset accumulation, recently announced on X (formerly Twitter) a substantial acquisition of an additional 1,234 BTC. This latest move brings their total Bitcoin treasury to an impressive 12,345 BTC. This isn’t just a simple purchase; it’s a clear statement of intent, echoing the pioneering moves made by companies like MicroStrategy in the West. But what exactly is propelling this Japanese firm’s audacious Bitcoin investment strategy? Inflationary Pressures: Many corporations are seeking robust hedges against persistent inflation in traditional fiat currencies. Bitcoin, with its finite supply, presents a compelling alternative. Long-Term Value Proposition: Metaplanet likely views Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, similar to digital gold, capable of appreciating significantly over time. Corporate Treasury Diversification: Diversifying treasury assets beyond traditional instruments like cash and bonds can reduce risk and potentially enhance returns. Non-Sovereign Asset: Bitcoin offers a decentralized, censorship-resistant asset, free from the direct control of any single government or financial institution. How Does Japan Bitcoin Adoption Compare Globally? While the United States has seen significant institutional interest in Bitcoin, particularly with the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Japan has its own distinct regulatory landscape. Historically, Japan has been a leader in cryptocurrency regulation, recognizing Bitcoin as legal property as early as 2017. However, institutional adoption, especially among publicly traded companies, has been slower to materialize compared to some Western counterparts. Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation therefore marks a significant milestone, potentially paving the way for broader crypto adoption within the nation’s corporate sector. Consider the contrasting approaches: Region Key Institutional Drivers Pace of Corporate Adoption United States Spot Bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy’s pioneering strategy, strong venture capital interest. High, with increasing public company engagement. Japan Early regulatory clarity, but more cautious corporate entry until recently. Growing, with Metaplanet leading the charge for publicly listed firms. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation The consistent accumulation of Bitcoin by publicly traded entities like Metaplanet sends a powerful signal to the global financial markets. This isn’t speculative trading; it’s a deliberate long-term treasury strategy. Such substantial moves by institutional Bitcoin holders lend immense credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. It demonstrates a growing confidence among sophisticated investors that Bitcoin is here to stay, not just as a niche digital currency but as a significant store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. Key benefits of this trend include: Increased Market Legitimacy: Corporate adoption helps Bitcoin shed its speculative image and mature into a recognized asset class. Potential for Price Stability: Large, long-term holdings by institutions can reduce volatility and provide a more stable demand floor. Encourages Broader Adoption: As more companies succeed with Bitcoin treasury strategies, others are likely to follow suit, creating a positive feedback loop. Validation as “Digital Gold”: Reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a robust alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. What Does This Mean for Future Crypto Adoption and BTC Investment ? Metaplanet’s bold move could be a catalyst, sparking a domino effect across the corporate world, particularly in Asia. As more companies witness the successful integration of Bitcoin into corporate balance sheets, the hesitancy surrounding BTC investment may dissipate. This progressive approach by a Japanese firm underscores a growing global trend: Bitcoin is transitioning from a fringe asset to a foundational component of modern financial strategy. It suggests a future where holding digital assets becomes as commonplace as holding traditional bonds or equities for corporate treasuries. Actionable insights for readers: Monitor Corporate Announcements: Keep an eye on other publicly traded companies, especially in Asia, for similar announcements regarding Bitcoin acquisitions. Understand the Shifting Narrative: Recognize that Bitcoin’s primary narrative is evolving from purely retail speculation to serious institutional allocation and treasury management. Consider Long-Term Implications: The increasing demand from institutions, coupled with Bitcoin’s fixed supply, has significant long-term implications for its value proposition. Metaplanet’s strategic decision to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings to 12,345 BTC is more than just a news headline; it’s a powerful testament to the evolving perception of digital assets in the global financial landscape. As a publicly listed Japanese firm, their commitment highlights Bitcoin’s growing role as a vital component of corporate treasury management and a hedge against economic volatility. This bold step by Metaplanet not only reinforces Bitcoin’s legitimacy but also sets a compelling precedent for other institutions considering their foray into the world of cryptocurrency. The future of finance is clearly embracing digital assets, and companies like Metaplanet are leading the charge.

2025-06-26T13:58:09,"What’s Next for Tokenization?","To many of us in and around crypto, this time feels different. Tokenization of financial assets has arrived in ways that we haven’t previously seen. As we charge ahead, it’s important to zoom out, slow down—something our industry is not known for—and take a snapshot of today and where we are going tomorrow. Stablecoins Are Tokenization’s First Smash Hit While tokenization is revolutionary for financial markets, its adoption to date has been evolutionary. First, we had stablecoins as a more efficient means of payment. Then we had tokenized money market funds as a more efficient store of value. What’s next? Structured credit coupled with private funds. As with previous technological waves of adoption, tokenization will come slowly and then all at once. Buckle up: we are about to enter the vertical slope of the S-curve. Since the last crypto market cycle in 2021, stablecoins have demonstrated clear product-market fit. With more than $250 billion in circulating supply , stablecoins continue to demonstrate long-term demand and utility. That includes Tether and USDC for cross-border payments through companies such as MoneyGram, Stripe, PayPal, and Felix; overseas dollar access in emerging economies and those with weaker currency regimes such as Nigeria, Venezuela, Turkey, and others; and as the key trading pairs for crypto trades including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Regulatory clarity, particularly passage of the GENIUS Act in the U.S. covering stablecoins, can only accelerate this trend. The outsized demand for Circle’s stock following its IPO is another positive sign. Tokenized money market funds bring a technological and financial upgrade for storage of value on-chain. Market leaders including BUIDL, BENJI, ONDO, and others have shown there is clear demand for the risk-free rate onchain. That means not only as a collateral and treasury instrument, but also as a stablecoin substitute for crypto-native players that need fiat-denominated liquidity. While the initial versions offer hybrid structures with the fund tokens mirroring traditional transfer agents and off-chain shares, we are beginning to see token-native issuances percolate across the industry. What’s Next for Tokenization? Given that tokenization has demonstrated a more efficient method to move and store value, what parts of the industry are next? To start, we have seen industry leaders tokenize private funds—such as Apollo’s ACRED, Hamilton Lane’s tokenized fund with Republic, multiple on-chain funds offered by WisdomTree, and others—that have begun to show utility through transparency, DeFi lending, and liquidity improvements. The value that tokenization is bringing today to different fund structures only scratches the surface of what is possible, but as DeFi and TradFi overlap more and more, utility is likely to take off. Structured credit is an ideal candidate for tokenization. Traditionally, it can be complex, opaque, involve multiple counterparties, and can be comparatively expensive to issue and operate. Smart contracts not only streamline and automate debt servicing of a loan pool, for example, but also follow a preprogrammed waterfall for each investor tranche. Couple that with instant settlement within the structure and the cost basis can drop substantially. And, because the structure is on-chain, we won’t have the lack of transparency that plagued the financial system in 2008. At the issuer’s discretion, holders of on-chain structured credit products could see the performance of the underlying in real time, 24/7. This transparency is not only transformative for regulators to better monitor underlying risks, but it also increases collateral acceptance by standardizing and providing more information to lenders. This combination of value and information will mean a more liquid secondary market for these assets as well. While larger traditional institutions can offer some of these benefits—such as transparency or their own secondary marketplaces—tokenization has the potential to bring this all together and standardize it beyond today’s walled gardens. Tokenizing Equities Discussion around tokenizing equities has taken off in 2025. Though companies, including INX and Backed, have tokenized stocks before, regulatory discussions with Security and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Task Force have hastened the adoption timeline. Superstate, Kraken, and we at Galaxy have all announced stock tokenization initiatives to continue to push the industry forward. While the industry has made progress, several challenges lie ahead. The US still lacks the stablecoin and market infrastructure bills that are needed—though the GENIUS’s passage in the Senate is a notable step forward. Solving KYC/AML remains a barrier holding the technology back from adoption at scale; private chains are too limiting and public chain structures without adequate KYC/AML are challenging for TradFi to adopt. Instead, the industry will have to land in the middle, leveraging the benefits of public chains with the regulatory and trust-based KYC policies that our financial system is built on today. Education on the technology’s potential also remains a hurdle. The industry must continue to highlight material use cases and tangible benefits that tokenization can bring not just to traditional finance but entirely new opportunities and structures that couldn’t exist before. Takeaways What should we take away from this time? First, we have come a long way from the initial bitcoin transactions and ethereum smart contracts that formed a cornerstone of crypto; now, the industry has partnerships with the biggest names in finance, payments, and technology that lead the global economy today. Second, we are at the bottom of the second inning—we’ve put some points on the board, but this is just the start. Adoption at scale will require a pairing of the revolutionary benefits of this technology with the timeless trust that has been the bedrock of the financial industry since its founding. This balance of technology and trust is core to achieving the potential of tokenization in finance: to do for value what the internet did for information.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/26/whats-next-for-tokenization,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T13:55:35,"BTC price outlook: Bitcoin nears bullish breakout with DXY at lowest since 2022","Bitcoin price could be on the cusp of a bullish breakout, potentially reaching its all-time high as a flag pattern forms and the U.S. dollar index crashes. Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $107,115 on Thursday, June 25, up 8.65% from its lowest point this week. A potential catalyst for Bitcoin is the ongoing decline in the U.S. dollar index (DXY), as Donald Trump considers candidates for the next Federal Reserve Chair. The DXY, which measures the dollar’s performance against a basket of currencies, plunged to 96.98—its lowest level since 2022. The index has slumped nearly 12% from its highest level this year, and Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate another 9% crash . This pullback followed Trump’s brokered a truce between Israel and Iran , which ended 12 days of hostilities. It also came after reports indicated Trump is weighing options for replacing Jerome Powell as Fed Chair in 2026, when Powell’s term ends. Leading candidates include Scott Bessent, Kevin Hassett, and Kevin Warsh. You might also like: MSTR stock vs. MSTY stock: Which offers better returns in a Bitcoin bull run? Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell, urging him to cut interest rates. In a statement this week, Powell reiterated the Federal Reserve’s wait-and-see stance. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin echoed that sentiment on Thursday, stating : “There is little upside in heading too quickly in any one direction. Given the strength in today’s economy, we have time to track developments patiently and allow the visibility to improve.” The dollar’s weakness has deepened as investors anticipate that a new Fed Chair could move quickly on interest rate cuts. In a note on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley projected the Fed would implement seven rate cuts in 2026, representing an outlook that could benefit Bitcoin and other risk assets. Bitcoin price technicals signal a breakout is coming BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Bitcoin price has remained above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average, which has provided substantial support since April. Bitcoin has formed a bullish flag pattern, consisting of a vertical line and a descending channel. This channel is part of the handle in a broader cup-and-handle formation. The cup has a depth of about 31%, and projecting the same distance from the upper edge of the handle yields a target price of $143,780. A drop below the 200-day moving average at $94,000 would invalidate the bullish thesis.

BlackRock’s strong presence and reputation in traditional finance likely played a significant role in drawing such a large portion of the capital. Bitwise’s ETHW: Following BlackRock, Bitwise’s ETHW secured $5.23 million in inflows, indicating a healthy, albeit smaller, interest from its investor base. Other Spot Ethereum ETFs: Interestingly, the remaining spot Ethereum ETFs reported no changes in their holdings for the day. This suggests that initial institutional capital is highly concentrated in a few key players, particularly those with established track records and brand recognition. This concentrated inflow into a select few ETFs highlights the importance of trust and accessibility for investors entering the crypto space through regulated financial products. What Do These Ethereum Inflows Signify for the Market? The consistent positive Ethereum inflows into these ETFs are more than just numbers; they represent a significant shift in how mainstream finance views and interacts with digital assets. These inflows can be interpreted in several ways, each with profound implications for Ethereum and the wider crypto ecosystem. Increased Institutional Adoption: The primary takeaway is the accelerating pace of institutional adoption. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are now gaining a regulated, familiar pathway to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This reduces operational complexities and regulatory hurdles, making it a more attractive option for traditional investors. Validation of Ethereum’s Value Proposition: Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and its role in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) sectors, is increasingly being recognized as a foundational technology. The inflows suggest that institutional investors are buying into Ethereum’s long-term potential as a programmable blockchain. Potential for Price Impact: While daily inflows might not immediately cause drastic price movements, sustained inflows over weeks and months can create significant buying pressure. As more capital flows into these ETFs, the underlying ETH needs to be purchased to back the shares, potentially driving up the price of Ethereum. This creates a positive feedback loop, attracting even more interest. Market Maturity: The launch and subsequent performance of these ETFs contribute to the overall maturity of the cryptocurrency market. It moves crypto from a niche, speculative asset class to a more legitimate and accessible investment option within traditional financial portfolios. BlackRock ETHA: A Dominant Force in the New ETF Landscape The sheer volume of inflows into BlackRock ETHA is a testament to BlackRock’s immense influence and strategic positioning in the financial world. As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock brings unparalleled trust and reach to any product it launches. Their entry into the crypto ETF space, first with Bitcoin and now with Ethereum, is a game-changer. Why is BlackRock’s ETHA leading the pack? Brand Recognition and Trust: BlackRock is a household name in finance. Investors, particularly institutional ones, are more comfortable allocating capital to a fund managed by a firm with such a long-standing reputation for reliability and expertise. Extensive Distribution Network: BlackRock has a vast network of clients and advisors, making it easier for them to distribute their new ETF products to a wide range of investors, from large pension funds to individual wealth management accounts. Proven Track Record: The success of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has set a precedent. Investors who saw the rapid growth and adoption of IBIT are likely to feel confident in allocating capital to their Ethereum counterpart. Liquidity and Market Depth: A larger fund often attracts more liquidity, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting the market price of the ETF shares. The performance of BlackRock’s ETHA will likely serve as a benchmark for other Ethereum ETFs and could encourage more traditional financial players to explore similar offerings. The Broader Impact of the ETH ETF on Crypto Adoption The introduction and success of an ETH ETF marks a crucial milestone for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. For years, direct investment in crypto was seen as complex, risky, and largely unregulated. ETFs bridge this gap by offering a familiar, regulated, and easily accessible investment vehicle. Benefits for Investors: Simplicity: Investors can gain exposure to Ethereum through their existing brokerage accounts, just like they would with stocks or other ETFs. Security: The custody of the underlying Ethereum is handled by professional, regulated custodians, reducing the risk of hacks or self-custody errors for individual investors. Liquidity: ETF shares are traded on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of trading during market hours. Diversification: For traditional portfolios, adding an ETH ETF provides diversification into a rapidly growing digital asset class. Challenges and Considerations: Fees: ETFs come with management fees, which can eat into returns over time compared to direct ownership. Indirect Ownership: Investors own shares in a fund that holds Ethereum, not the Ethereum itself. This means they cannot use their ETH for staking, DeFi, or other on-chain activities. Market Volatility: While ETFs provide regulated access, they are still exposed to the inherent volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency market. Despite these considerations, the net positive inflows suggest that the benefits currently outweigh the challenges for a significant portion of the investor community. What’s Next for Crypto ETFs and the Digital Asset Market? The success of the U.S. Crypto ETFs , both Bitcoin and now Ethereum, paints a promising picture for the future of digital asset investment. This trend is likely to continue, potentially paving the way for ETFs based on other major cryptocurrencies, provided they meet regulatory requirements and demonstrate sufficient market demand. Future Outlook: Increased Competition: As more funds enter the market, we can expect increased competition, potentially leading to lower fees and more innovative product offerings. Global Adoption: The U.S. market often sets a precedent. The success here could encourage other countries to approve similar crypto ETF products, further legitimizing digital assets on a global scale. Impact on Spot Price: Continued institutional buying through ETFs could provide a stable demand floor for Ethereum, potentially mitigating some of the extreme volatility seen in previous market cycles. Evolution of Investment Products: We might see more complex crypto-linked financial products emerge, such as options or futures on these ETFs, offering even more sophisticated ways for investors to gain exposure or hedge risk. The journey of spot Ethereum ETFs has just begun, but the initial $60.16 million net inflow is a strong indicator of the significant role they are poised to play in the ongoing integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The robust $60.16 million in total net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on June 25, heavily led by BlackRock’s ETHA, marks a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum, validates its long-term potential, and offers a clear pathway for broader investor adoption. While challenges remain, the current trajectory suggests a promising future where digital assets are increasingly accessible and integrated into traditional investment portfolios. This surge of capital is not just a daily statistic; it’s a powerful signal of evolving market confidence and the dawning of a new era for Ethereum investment.

2025-06-26T13:38:10,"US-Based Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Net Inflows for 12th Consecutive Trading Day! What Does This Mean? Here Are the Details","US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows for the 12th consecutive trading day, bringing the total capital gain to $3.9 billion. On June 25 alone, $547.7 million inflows were made. Bitcoin ETFs 12-Day Net Inflow Series: Total Inflows Near $4 Billion, BTC Strengthens on Dollar Weakness BlackRock’s IBIT fund was the day’s top ETF with net inflows of $340.3 million. Fidelity’s FBTC fund followed with $115.2 million. Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL funds took in $70.2 million, $12.9 million and $9.1 million, respectively. Other ETFs closed with zero net inflows. IBIT continues to lead the pack by accounting for 86% ($3.3 billion) of the 12-day total net inflows. “12 consecutive days of inflows, $4 billion in fresh capital. The ETF category is approaching $50 billion since January 2024. That’s really incredible,” said Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store. To date, there have been a total of $48.4 billion in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January 2024. Total assets under management in these funds currently stand at approximately $125 billion. Positive Mood Continues for Ethereum ETFs Spot Ethereum ETFs also recorded net inflows of $60.4 million on the same day, with $55.2 million of the inflows also going to BlackRock’s ETHA fund. This is the third consecutive positive day for Ethereum ETFs, with total inflows over the last three days reaching $232.4 million. In total, $4.2 billion has flowed into these funds to date, which were launched in July 2024. Bitcoin is trading at $107,445, up 0.8% in the last 24 hours and 2.9% on the week. After falling to $98,000 on Sunday, BTC tested the $108,000 level again on Thursday morning. Timothy Misir, BRN Research Director, said that the dollar index falling to its lowest level since March 2022 created a strong headwind for crypto assets: “The weakening dollar and the World Bank’s downgrade of its 2025 US growth forecast to 1.4% from 2.3% are sending economic signals in favor of uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin.” Misir also emphasized that government institutions have openly begun accumulating Bitcoin and companies continue to rapidly adopt Bitcoin, expressing that BTC is maturing as an institutional asset class. K33 Research President Vetle Lunde stated in his assessment earlier this week that ETF flows directly affect the BTC price, while treasury companies have a more limited impact. Considering the combination of increasing institutional demand, the weakening dollar and concerns about an economic slowdown, it is thought that Bitcoin's upward momentum may continue in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

But is it just hype, or is something real driving the momentum? PI Price Action: A Rollercoaster Start Pi Network (PI) launched with a bang on February 20 , starting at just $0.0991. Within six days, the price rocketed by 2,812.41%, setting off a wave of excitement across the crypto community. But the hype didn’t last forever. From February 27 to April 4 , PI crashed by 81.51% . February still ended strong with a 222.5% gain . In March and April, PI declined by 66.5% and 13.9% , respectively. May brought a 6.39% rebound , showing some market recovery. However, June has been rough , with a 17.4% drop so far. Weekly Surge: PI Up 5% Amid Stability Despite the volatile ride, PI has risen 5% in the last 7 days, currently trading at $0.5639 . Most notably, PI has consistently maintained an average price of $0.60 over the past 3 months—a rare feat for new tokens in a bear-biased market. Analyst: “PI’s Growth Is Organic, Not Hype” According to crypto analyst Dr Altcoin, this price consistency isn’t fueled by hype or manipulation. In a recent post on X (Twitter) , he explained: “PI’s price action is being shaped by organic market demand and long-term support—not speculation.” Dr Altcoin believes real investor confidence is behind the token’s price strength. Pi Network’s $100M Ecosystem Fund Is a Game-Changer The analyst highlights a crucial factor supporting this stability— Pi Network Ventures’ $100 million fund , aimed at developing the ecosystem. This fund incentivizes developers to build real-world apps using PI. It drives tangible utility , bringing new users and real use cases to the platform. The focus is on slow, steady, and sustainable growth , not overnight pumps. PI Price Prediction: What’s Next? Dr Altcoin says no major price spike is expected this week unless a big announcement drops. However, he remains bullish on long-term stability, stating that: “PI is unlikely to fall below its all-time low of $0.40.” The coin has tested the $0.40 low only twice—April 5 and June 13—but quickly bounced back. Currently, PI sits 41.47% above its low, signaling strong support. Final Thoughts: Is PI the Dark Horse of 2025? While many still dismiss PI as a hype-driven token, the data and ecosystem funding tell a different story. With real-world utility growing and investor confidence holding steady, PI might just be the most underrated crypto of the year.

Driven by new political interest and a global trend, India’s ruling party, the BJP, signals towards forming a Bitcoin Reserve. National spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari argued that India could benefit from adopting a BTC reserve. BJP Urges to Establish Bitcoin Reserve in India Recently, Pradeep Bhandari, the spokesperson of the BJP, urged that India’s financial policies must evolve to adapt more flexible and innovative framework. This method will aim to bring financial growth and prosperity to the country, according to Bhandari. He stated – “India stands at a pivotal juncture. A measured Bitcoin strategy—perhaps a reserve pilot—could strengthen economic resilience and project modernity. As the US advances and nations like Bhutan adapt, India has a unique opportunity to lead.” Bhandari’s Argument for the Possibility of BTC Reserve in India Bhandari points out several significant points that signal the possibility of a future Bitcoin reserve in India. Renewable Energy Capacity He noted that India has the full capability to mine Bitcoin, following Bhutan’s mining initiative. Bhutan mines Bitcoin, using hydropower, building a reserve exceeding $1billion by Q1 2025. Bhandari suggests that India could follow this framework, as India has even bigger renewable energy potential than Bhutan. US Model Bhandari noted that the US benefited by launching its Bitcoin Reserve and now holds over $20 billion in value. India could benefit from a pilot reserve strategy based on the US model, he proposed.

2025-06-26T13:22:41,"Cryptocurrencies replace cash as Bolivia’s economic crisis deepens","In the commercial centre of Cochabamba, the third largest city of Bolivia, cryptocurrencies are quickly becoming a necessity rather than a fragmented experiment. Crypto ATMs enabling shoppers to swap coins for Bitcoin, beauty salons accepting digital assets at a discount, and Binance accounts getting you meals. Bolivia is facing one of its most serious economic crises in decades. Dollar reserves in the country are nearly depleted. The result is the highest inflation in 40 years. According to a Reuters story, the city is congested with gas station lines due to a lack of fuel. The official exchange rate is more detached from reality, with the boliviano losing half of its value on the illegal market this year alone. Amid the instability, an increasing number of Bolivians are turning to cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, stablecoins like Tether, and platforms like Binance, as a hedge against the country’s collapsing currency. Crypto adoption surges amid Dollar scarcity Despite the scarcity of exact statistics, there are numerous signals of rising cryptocurrency use. Until recently, digital currencies were prohibited in Bolivia. But by October of last year, the central bank had reported $24 million in digital asset transactions. Analysts believe that figure has climbed dramatically in recent months, as trust in the boliviano has dwindled. Bolivia’s rate of adoption is also being compared to economically distressed neighbours such as Argentina and Venezuela. Nonetheless, the overall volume of cryptocurrency activity is low. Daily Tether (USDT) transactions are expected to be around $600,000, which is much lower than the volume flowing through traditional banks and the country’s informal cash-based economy. Binance is the preferred platform for many Bolivians due to its low costs and peer-to-peer capabilities. However, global controversies loom large: in 2023, Binance paid a $4.3 billion settlement for breaking US anti-money laundering regulations. According to Mauricio Torrelio of the Bolivian Blockchain Chamber, the country’s adoption rate is now comparable to that of Argentina and Venezuela. The overall scale of the market, however, lags well behind its South American counterparts and other domestic activities. According to Jose Gabriel Espinoza, the former president of Bolivia’s central bank, daily USDT volumes average roughly $600,000, a fraction of the $18-$22 million in the legal financial sector and $12-$14 million in the cash-based criminal market. “While crypto is growing, it’s still a nascent market,” he said to Reuters. Everyday payments go digital Despite the hazards, several firms in Cochabamba have adopted digital currencies as an alternative to the national structure that is on the point of collapsing. At Bros Steakhouse, patrons can have a payment option through Binance or an ATM linked to Blink, a crypto wallet developed in El Salvador—the first country that makes Bitcoin legal. Meanwhile, across town, Carla Jones, owner of a spa that gives Bitcoin discounts to customers. She tells clients, “Three tanning sessions for less when you pay in crypto.” Rather, it is to attract younger clients and keep funds in a currency that could have a better store value than the boliviano. These innovations are not just typical tech-savvy marketing, but rather, are indicative of a deep-seated financial anxiety. Cryptocurrencies, in turn, are filling a vacuum as banks run out of dollars and the official exchange rate reaches irrelevance. A reflection of decline, not growth Despite the enthusiasm, experts warn against seeing Bolivia’s cryptocurrency development as a sign of modernisation. Many analysts believe it suggests desperation rather than a digital revolution. The huge drop in gas exports has reduced Bolivia’s access to hard cash, forcing it to rely on costly fuel imports and creating a parallel economy for dollars. On the streets, a US dollar buys more than 16 bolivianos, greatly exceeding the official rate of 6.9. Some perceive cryptocurrency as a risky gamble in an already volatile market. Vulnerable communities may be enticed to shift real-world money into volatile assets. In some situations, cryptocurrency has been marketed as a cure-all in Bolivia’s poorest districts, only to backfire when coin prices fall and shops quit taking it. According to Reuters, Bitcoin supporters like Andree Canelas see the transition as a sensible response to economic decline. He is assisting with the installation of cryptocurrency ATMs at shops and cafes throughout Cochabamba. The message is that holding Bolivians in a till is no longer secure. Despite the risk, cryptocurrency may provide a better future. “People see the volatility,” according to him, “but they also see the alternative: guaranteed loss.” The post Cryptocurrencies replace cash as Bolivia’s economic crisis deepens appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/26/cryptocurrencies-replaces-cash-as-bolivias-economic-crisis-deepens/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT|BNB","Central Banks|Crypto|Crypto business|Economic|South America|Binance|Bitcoin|Crypto Picks & Tips|Tether",cryptocompare

GameStop Completes $2.7 Billion Fundraise Video game retailer GameStop has concluded a major fundraising effort, securing a total of $2.7 billion through the sale of zero-coupon convertible senior notes. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, the latest $450 million raised came via a greenshoe option exercised in full by the original purchaser. This follow-on sale arrived just a week after GameStop’s initial $2.25 billion private placement. The convertible notes, maturing in 2032, are priced to convert into GameStop Class A common stock at $28.91 per share, which is a 32.5% premium over the company’s volume-weighted average share price on June 12, the day of the original offering. Potential Bitcoin Allocation on the Table In its official statement, GameStop confirmed that proceeds from the offering would be deployed for general corporate purposes. Notably, this could include further Bitcoin acquisitions under its updated Investment Policy. The firm first adopted the Bitcoin treasury strategy in May, when it acquired 4,710 BTC, valued at $512 million at the time of purchase and approximately $506 million at current prices. With Bitcoin trading near $107,175, GameStop’s treasury strategy places it within a growing cohort of public companies turning to the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and a long-term reserve asset. Following, Not Copying, the Bitcoin Treasury Playbook GameStop’s pivot toward Bitcoin has drawn comparisons to Strategy’s high-profile crypto accumulation model. The connection was further highlighted when GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen appeared in a widely circulated photo alongside Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in March, shortly before GameStop hinted at its Bitcoin intentions. However, Cohen has been careful to distance his firm from replicating any specific strategy, stating in a recent interview, “We’re not going to call our shots in advance, we’re not following anyone else's strategy.” While Strategy continues to announce regular Bitcoin purchases, GameStop’s future moves in the crypto space remain deliberately opaque, with no confirmed timelines for further acquisitions. Market Reaction Muted Despite Strategic Moves Despite the headline-making Bitcoin purchases and significant capital raises, GameStop’s stock performance has not reflected investor enthusiasm. The company’s share price fell over 10% to $30.73 following its initial Bitcoin purchase announcement in May. A further dip followed the disclosure of its second convertible notes offering, even as the fundraising total increased through the greenshoe exercise.

The decision means crypto will be considered a reserve asset for borrowers without converting them into US Dollars. The FHFA has been in charge of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since 2008 when both were placed under government conservatorship after the financial crisis. According to Pulte, the decision to include crypto in the mortgage risk assessment came after significant deliberations and studies. It aligns with President Trump’s goal to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have played a crucial role in the US housing market since the subprime mortgage crisis, providing liquidity and stability by purchasing mortgages from lenders, enabling them to issue more loans. Crypto.com Secures Insurance For US Custody Platform Crypto.com has announced that it has secured $120 million in insurance coverage for assets held in the Crypto.com custody trust. According to the official announcement, Aon, a London-based insurance company, arranged the insurance cover. The company worked with underwriters via Lloyd’s of London to assess the platform’s risk management. Crypto.com’s Custody Trust Company offers digital asset custody solutions for institutions based in North America. The insurance plan aims to protect eligible customers from crime and theft. Joe Anzures, president of Crypto.com Custody Trust Company, stated, “We built Crypto.com on a foundation of safety and security. Our insurance policy arranged by Aon for assets within Crypto.com Custody Trust Company is the latest example of our efforts to safeguard our customers and provide a best-in-class offering our clients can be reassured by.” According to sources, the insurance coverage includes the first quarter of 2025. Around $100 million is for physical loss, theft, or damage to customer assets held in cold storage. The remaining $20 million will cover third-party theft and other criminal incidents. Kalshi Raises $185M At $2B Valuation Prediction market Kalshi has reportedly raised $185 million in a funding round that values the company at $2 billion. The funding round was led by crypto investment firm Paradigm and also saw participation from Sequoia Capital, Multicoin Capital, and others. Kalshi CEO and co-founder Tarek Mansour said the company will use the funding to expand its technology team and integrate its prediction contracts with more brokerage platforms. Currently, Kalshi contracts are only available through Webull and Robinhood. Prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket have gained traction recently, emerging as an alternative to traditional polling. Proponents have argued that prediction markets offer more accuracy by aggregating the collective expectations of all participants. Kalshi’s latest fundraising comes amid reports that its closest competitor, Polymarket, is expected to close a $200 million funding round that values it at $1 billion. Coinbase Stock Rallies To 52-Week High Coinbase (COIN) surged to a 52-week high after Bernstein analysts called the company a “one-stop Amazon” of crypto services. COIN shares gained over 3% in the past 24 hours to reach within touching distance of its record close of $357.39. Bernstein analysts raised their price target from $310 to $510, giving the stock an Outperform rating. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani stated, “Coinbase is the most misunderstood company in our Crypto coverage universe. COIN has also added several fast-growing businesses such as institutional custody, Base blockchain services, and Prime lending desk, emerging as the ‘Amazon of crypto financial services’, offering crypto financial services beyond simple trading.” Coinbase is the only crypto firm in the S&P 500 and dominates US crypto trading. It also operates the largest stablecoin business among all crypto exchanges and is the custodian for the underlying assets of most US spot Bitcoin ETFs. “Coinbase’s market share has been persistent despite new competition. Traditional brokerage competition is several months away from launch, which is an eternity on crypto timelines.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its gains for a fourth consecutive day as it consolidated around $107,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up during the ongoing session, with the price up 0.34%. Analysts believe BTC’s current price action favors a push to $110,000 after it broke through a key resistance level. The price registered an increase of 1.18% Wednesday to reclaim $107,000 and move to $107,393. BTC’s rebound comes amid a dovish stance by the Federal Reserve and the easing of geopolitical tensions, which improved risk sentiment across markets. As a result, BTC reached an intraday high of $108,201 on Wednesday before settling at $107,393, thanks to profit booking at higher levels. Despite the minor drop, sentiment around BTC remains positive. BTC is trading around 3% lower than its all-time high, with analysts expecting continued bullish momentum, which could push the price beyond $110,000. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, stated that markets are showing strength. He also said that open interest suggested a possible squeeze at $110,000 before a reversal. “If a pullback ensues, key levels around $106,000 and $104,000 should offer strong support.” The recent uptick has also seen BTC book year-to-date gains of nearly 15%, making it the top-performing cryptocurrency among the top 5. CoinGlass data shows that BTC short liquidations were in a normal range, with most shorts liquidated on Monday when the price bounced off $110,000. Meanwhile, open interest in BTC futures has climbed to its highest level in over a fortnight, with traders returning to the market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also testified before Congress that the central bank does not intend to rush a rate cut. However, he reiterated that there will be two rate cuts this year. The confirmation comes after the Trump administration decided against raising tariffs on goods from China and other trading partners. BTC started the previous week in positive territory, reaching an intraday high of $108,939 before losing momentum and settling at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Sellers took control on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884 before registering a marginal decline on Thursday and settling at $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.19%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,388. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish on Saturday, falling 1.17% to $102,180, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $100,979. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $98,385 as market sentiment worsened. It recovered from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. Market sentiment flipped to bullish on Monday after President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, BTC rallied over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,442. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 0.66% to cross the 20 and 50-day SMAs, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,138. BTC continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 1.18% to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,393. The current session sees BTC marginally up, as buyers look to push to $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) bulls have seized control after a minor wobble on Wednesday led to a decline of 1.25% to $2,419. Analysts believe the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could reclaim $2,500 if buyers maintain control. However, it must cross $2,550 to confirm a bullish rally. If ETH loses momentum and closes below $2,400, it could decline to $2,200 or lower. Despite Wednesday’s wobble, ETF inflows remained strong. However, ETH is down nearly 2% over the past seven days, indicating traders are skeptical about a push to $3,000. ETH derivatives also suggest reduced demand for leveraged bullish bets. However, ETH’s drop from upper levels has not diminished demand for Ethereum ETFs, which registered inflows of $322 million over the next two weeks. However, CryptoQuant analysts are bullish about ETH, adding that a break above the 50-day EMA could propel the asset to $2,800. If resistance levels are breached, it could push to $4,000. The analysts stated that ETH must consistently close above $2,500 to confirm a breakout. Historical data also shows that ETH has moved sharply after breaking out of similar consolidation goals. Despite a positive outlook, they urged investors to be cautious, highlighting that geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic events could trigger market volatility. ETH started the previous week in the red despite racing to an intraday high of $2,680. It lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $2,544, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 1.31% to $2,511. Despite the selling pressure, ETH recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.57%, but was back in the red on Thursday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $2,522. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as the price fell nearly 5%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and $2,500 to $2,406. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Saturday as ETH fell to an intraday low of $2,215 before settling at $2,296, ultimately registering a drop of 4.56%. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $2,119 on Sunday as market sentiment worsened. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $2,200 and settle at $2,229, registering a drop of almost 3%. Market sentiment flipped to bullish on Monday after President Trump announced an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, ETH soared over 8% to reclaim $2,400 and settle at $2,413. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price registered an increase of 1.51% and settled at $2,450. However, ETH lost momentum on Wednesday and fell 1.25% to $2,419. Bullish sentiment has returned during the ongoing session, with the price up over 3%, trading around $2,496. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) rebounded during the ongoing session, consolidating around $145. The world’s 6th largest cryptocurrency started the week with a strong rally, surging nearly 10% to $144. However, it has struggled to move higher and faces a wall of resistance around $150. However, there is good news for investors as Invesco Galaxy filed for a Solana ETF, meaning the US could get nine Solana ETFs, depending on regulatory approval. Invesco and Galaxy Digital proposed the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, joining bids from VanEck, Bitwise, and Grayscale. “NEW: @InvescoUS and @galaxyhq just filed for a Solana ETF. That makes nine issuers who have filed for a Solana ETF now.” Approval of the ETFs could send SOL beyond $180 and even $200. SOL raced to an intraday high of $158 on Monday (June 16) as buyers attempted to overwhelm sellers. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.52% to $150. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as SOL dropped over 2%, slipping below $150 and settling at $147. The price declined on Wednesday, falling almost 1% to $146. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, SOL recovered on Thursday, rising 0.44% after falling to a low of $143 and settling at $147. SOL was back in bearish territory on Friday, dropping nearly 5% to $140, but not before hitting a low of $135. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish on Saturday as SOL fell over 3% to $135.

2025-06-26T13:10:56,"Dogwifhat slips after golden pocket rejection, this support level now in focus","Dogwifhat remains in a macro downtrend and is currently undergoing a corrective move after a major rejection at the golden pocket. Price is now trading back inside the broader range, with lower support in focus. Over the past week, Dogwifhat ( WIF ) has continued to print a series of lower highs and lower lows, signaling both local and macro weakness. The most recent breakout attempt failed, with price sharply rejecting from a significant resistance cluster. This has led to a return to the range mid, where price is currently consolidating. With volume dropping and momentum fading, a double-bottom formation may be the structure to watch for at the range low. Key technical points Rejection at 0.618 Fibonacci: Golden pocket, VWAP, POC, and value area high all aligned. Macro Downtrend Still Intact: Price continues to post lower highs and lower lows. Key Support at $0.30: Double bottom formation possible if price revisits this level. WIFUSDT (1D) Chart: Source, TradingView The recent rejection on Dogwifhat was anything but random. Price rallied directly into the golden pocket—the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, where it also collided with multiple confluences: the VWAP resistance, the point of control, the value area high, and the range high of the broader consolidation zone. This convergence created a textbook technical resistance, which promptly rejected the move and sent price lower. This breakdown has pushed Dogwifhat back into the range mid, confirming that the breakout lacked the volume and follow-through needed for continuation. The drop in volume reinforces the idea that the market is still consolidating rather than trending, with price stuck in a broader accumulation zone. You might also like: Pepe Dollar could rebirth DeFi on Ethereum for retail investors From a technical perspective, price action remains corrective and could stay this way until it tests the range low near $0.30. This is the level to watch for a potential double-bottom formation, a bullish reversal pattern that occurs when price retests a previous low and holds. If buyers defend this level and price forms a higher low on the retest, it could set the stage for a rally back toward $1.20 and beyond. Until that formation occurs, the market remains in limbo. The lower highs suggest sellers remain in control, and bulls will need to reclaim range levels with strength and volume to shift the narrative. What to expect in the coming price action Dogwifhat is likely to remain trapped within the broader range unless volume steps in decisively. Watch for a revisit of the $0.30 level, where a double bottom may initiate the next bullish wave. Failure to defend this support would invalidate the setup and extend the downtrend.

2025-06-26T13:10:23,"Amazing Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Robust Market Growth","BitcoinWorld Amazing Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Robust Market Growth The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with exciting news as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue their impressive run, signaling a significant shift in the digital asset landscape. On June 25, these innovative investment vehicles collectively witnessed a staggering $547.39 million in total net inflows, extending their winning streak to an remarkable 12 consecutive trading days. This sustained momentum isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful indicator of growing confidence and institutional appetite for Bitcoin. The Phenomenal Surge: Understanding Recent Bitcoin ETF Inflows For weeks, analysts and investors alike have been closely monitoring the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the data from June 25 provides yet another compelling chapter in their success story. The figure of $547.39 million in net inflows highlights a robust demand that continues to absorb Bitcoin supply, potentially laying the groundwork for future price appreciation. This consistent stream of capital flowing into these regulated products underscores a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate and accessible asset class. What exactly does this sustained inflow mean? It suggests that both retail and institutional investors are increasingly comfortable gaining exposure to Bitcoin through traditional investment avenues. Unlike direct Bitcoin purchases, ETFs offer a regulated, familiar, and often more convenient way to invest, eliminating concerns about self-custody, security, and complex exchange interfaces. This ease of access is proving to be a powerful magnet for capital. Who’s Leading the Charge in U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs? While the overall picture is one of strong positive movement, a closer look reveals which specific players are driving these substantial Bitcoin ETF inflows . On June 25, several key players stood out: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded an impressive $339.96 million in net inflows. This dominant performance solidifies IBIT’s position as a top choice for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. Fidelity’s FBTC: Following closely, Fidelity’s FBTC secured $115.19 million in net inflows, demonstrating its strong appeal and consistent performance in the competitive ETF market. ARK Invest’s ARKB: ARK Invest’s ARKB also contributed significantly, bringing in $70.20 million in net inflows, showcasing continued interest from its investor base. Bitwise’s BITB: Adding to the positive trend, Bitwise’s BITB saw $12.90 million in net inflows. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck’s HODL rounded out the top performers with $9.14 million in net inflows. The fact that the remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day further emphasizes the concentrated success of these leading funds, particularly BlackRock IBIT , which continues to capture the lion’s share of new investments. The Impact of BlackRock IBIT’s Dominance: What Does It Mean? The consistent outperformance of BlackRock IBIT is a crucial element in the ongoing success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, brings unparalleled institutional trust, distribution networks, and marketing power to the Bitcoin space. Their robust inflows are not just about volume; they signify a deepening acceptance of Bitcoin within mainstream finance. When a giant like BlackRock commits significant resources and attracts hundreds of millions daily, it sends a powerful signal to other institutional players and conservative investors who might have previously hesitated. IBIT’s success can be attributed to several factors, including its competitive fee structure, BlackRock’s established reputation, and its efficient market-making operations. This strong performance by IBIT, coupled with other major players, creates a positive feedback loop, drawing in more capital and further legitimizing Bitcoin as an investable asset. How Are These Inflows Shaping the Crypto Market? The sustained influx of capital into Bitcoin ETFs has a profound impact on the broader crypto market . Firstly, it provides a consistent buying pressure for Bitcoin itself, which can contribute to price stability and upward momentum. As ETFs acquire more BTC to back their shares, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially leading to price increases if demand continues to outstrip supply. Secondly, these inflows boost overall market sentiment. Positive news regarding institutional adoption and significant capital injections tends to instill confidence among both retail and institutional investors, reducing fear and uncertainty. This positive sentiment can spill over into other cryptocurrencies, as Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the entire digital asset ecosystem. The narrative shifts from speculative investment to a more mature asset class, attracting a wider range of participants. Finally, the success of Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for other cryptocurrency ETFs, such as Ethereum ETFs, further expanding the accessibility and legitimacy of the digital asset space within traditional finance. This incremental integration is vital for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto market. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: A Glimpse into the Future The continuous streak of net inflows is a clear testament to accelerating institutional Bitcoin adoption . Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin through these regulated products. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about diversification, hedging against inflation, and recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value. This trend signifies a maturation of the Bitcoin market. As more institutional capital enters, it can lead to reduced volatility over time, as these entities typically have longer investment horizons and less reactive trading strategies compared to some retail investors. Furthermore, the involvement of major financial players brings increased regulatory scrutiny and infrastructure development, which can further enhance the market’s stability and appeal. The future of Bitcoin, therefore, looks increasingly intertwined with traditional finance. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs is not just a story of impressive numbers; it’s a narrative of integration, validation, and the steady march of digital assets into the mainstream investment world. In conclusion, the remarkable run of 12 consecutive days of net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, highlighted by BlackRock IBIT’s leading performance, marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. This sustained capital injection underscores growing institutional confidence and accessibility, cementing Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate and increasingly sought-after asset. As the lines between traditional finance and digital assets continue to blur, these ETFs are playing a crucial role in shaping a more mature and robust investment landscape for Bitcoin, promising an exciting future for the entire crypto ecosystem.

2025-06-26T13:03:54,"Galaxy Digital raises $175m for stablecoin and DeFi venture fund","Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital has launched a $175 million fund to invest in new crypto startups. Galaxy Digital is expanding its crypto startup venture capital business. According to a June 26 report by Fortune, the company has raised $175 million for its latest venture fund. The fund, which will focus on DeFi and stablecoins, exceeded its original funding target of $150 million. Mike Giampapa, general partner at Galaxy Digital, explained that the firm plans to invest across more companies operating at the intersection of traditional finance and crypto. The primary focus will be on stablecoins and DeFi, which the firm says hold particular promise. “You’re seeing this fundamental shift from more speculative use cases of blockchains to something that’s much more…tangible,” Mike Giampapa, Galaxy Digital.

2025-06-26T13:03:29,"Last Time Bitcoin Did This, the Price Went From $60K to $100K","Bitcoin (BTC) could be primed for a surge to $160,000, according to a key on-chain metric that foreshadowed two other record-breaking rallies. This bullish outlook is emerging even as BTC battles volatility near $108,000, a psychological threshold tested amid geopolitical turbulence and conflicting accumulation patterns. The Accumulation Blueprint In his latest analysis , market watcher Axel Adler Jr. pointed out that Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holder (LTH) to Short-Term Holder (STH) ratio shows a very familiar accumulation pattern. According to him, some of BTC’s most explosive rallies between 2023 and 2025 were preceded by sustained LTH/STH growth. One of the runs, which started when Bitcoin was trading around the $28,000 level, saw the king cryptocurrency go all the way to $60,000. Another LTH/STH ratio uptick provided enough momentum to push BTC from $60,000 to $100,000. Adler has noted the same signal flashing at the $100,000 level: “Today, at the $100K mark, we again see sustained growth in the LTH/STH ratio,” noted the expert. “This accumulation phase could last 4-8 weeks, after which, by analogy with previous cycles, a powerful upward reversal is likely.” Applying a conservative 1.6x multiplier to Bitcoin’s current price, he projects a $160,000 target by the end of August. Giving more credence to the outlook, prominent trader Titan of Crypto identified a bull flag formation on BTC’s daily charts, suggesting a potential breakout to $137,000. He added that the MACD indicator was also on the verge of a bullish crossover, a move often viewed as a trigger for price momentum shifts. Technical and historical indicators also bolster Adler’s thesis. For instance, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart places the crypto asset firmly in the “BUY” zone, a scenario comparable to November 2020, just prior to it setting off on a 450% ROI surge, and May 2017, before the same metric boomed 1,400%. Market Outlook This activity coincides with broader geopolitical and market forces. On June 25, Bitcoin briefly touched $108,000 following remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump on easing tensions in the Middle East. Prices have since cooled slightly, with BTC changing hands at around $107,653 at the time of this writing. While a modest 0.7% gain in the last 24 hours, the price reflects a 1.8% monthly dip. Still, the asset’s nearly 3% uptick in the last seven days puts its performance slightly ahead of the rest of the crypto market, which only managed to go up 1.6% in that period.
