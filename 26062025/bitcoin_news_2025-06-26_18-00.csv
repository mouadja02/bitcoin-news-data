2025-06-26T15:50:52,"Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: India’s Bold Vision for Economic Resilience","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: India’s Bold Vision for Economic Resilience Imagine a future where a nation’s core financial strength isn’t solely tied to gold or traditional fiat currencies, but also to a decentralized digital asset like Bitcoin. This intriguing prospect just gained significant traction in India, one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies. Pradeep Bhandari, a national spokesperson for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has openly advocated for recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a profound statement that could signal a monumental shift in how India views and potentially integrates cryptocurrencies into its national financial framework. The implications of a major global power considering a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve are far-reaching, sparking conversations about financial sovereignty, technological innovation, and India’s position in the evolving global financial landscape. Why is a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Being Considered for India? To understand the significance of Bhandari’s statement, it’s crucial to grasp what a ‘strategic reserve asset’ truly entails. Traditionally, nations hold reserves of gold, foreign currencies (like the U.S. dollar), and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) from the IMF. These assets serve as a nation’s financial bedrock, providing stability during economic crises, facilitating international trade, and bolstering confidence in the national currency. They are crucial for managing exchange rates and external debt. So, why Bitcoin? Proponents argue that Bitcoin possesses several unique characteristics that make it an attractive candidate for a modern strategic reserve: Decentralization and Censorship Resistance: Unlike traditional assets controlled by central banks or governments, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, making it resistant to political interference or seizure. This offers a level of financial sovereignty that traditional assets cannot. Scarcity and Predictable Supply: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it a truly scarce asset. This fixed supply contrasts sharply with fiat currencies, which can be inflated at will by central banks, potentially eroding their value over time. This predictability offers a hedge against inflation. Global Liquidity and Portability: Bitcoin is a globally traded asset, accessible 24/7. Its digital nature allows for easy, rapid, and cost-effective transfer across borders, potentially streamlining international transactions and reducing reliance on traditional, slower banking rails. Protection Against Sanctions and Geopolitical Risks: In an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, holding a non-sovereign asset like Bitcoin could offer a nation an alternative means of conducting transactions and preserving wealth, particularly if faced with economic sanctions. For a nation like India, which aims for greater economic autonomy and global influence, exploring a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve could be a forward-thinking move to diversify its financial holdings and embrace the future of digital finance. How is India Crypto Regulation Evolving? India’s journey with cryptocurrencies has been a rollercoaster of caution, skepticism, and gradual openness. For years, the prevailing sentiment from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government leaned towards a ban, citing concerns about financial stability, money laundering, and investor protection. There were even proposals for a blanket prohibition on private cryptocurrencies, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty for millions of Indian crypto users and businesses. However, recent times have seen a noticeable shift. India’s presidency of the G20 in 2023 brought cryptocurrency regulation to the forefront of international discussions. India actively pushed for a globally coordinated framework for crypto assets, recognizing that unilateral bans are ineffective in a borderless digital world. This G20 initiative, spearheaded by India, resulted in a synthesis paper from the IMF and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) offering recommendations for a comprehensive regulatory approach. This marked a significant pivot from outright prohibition to a more nuanced, regulatory stance. Pradeep Bhandari’s statement, therefore, isn’t an isolated incident but rather a public manifestation of this evolving mindset within the ruling party. It suggests that the discussion around crypto in India is moving beyond mere regulation of trading and usage, towards considering its fundamental role in national finance. This indicates a growing recognition that digital assets, and Bitcoin in particular, cannot be ignored but must be understood and potentially integrated into the broader economic strategy. The direction of India Crypto Regulation is clearly shifting from one of apprehension to one of strategic consideration. What Does Broader Digital Asset Adoption Mean for India? Beyond its potential as a strategic reserve, broader Digital Asset Adoption holds immense promise for India across various sectors. India, with its vast, tech-savvy youth population and a rapidly expanding digital infrastructure, is uniquely positioned to leverage blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Potential Benefits: Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies can provide financial services to India’s unbanked and underbanked populations, offering access to savings, credit, and investment opportunities without traditional banking intermediaries. Remittances: India is the world’s largest recipient of remittances. Blockchain-based systems can significantly reduce the cost and time involved in cross-border money transfers, benefiting millions of families. Technological Innovation and Job Creation: A supportive regulatory environment for digital assets can foster a thriving blockchain industry, attracting investment, nurturing startups, and creating high-skilled jobs in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 development. Smart Contracts and Supply Chain Efficiency: Beyond Bitcoin, the underlying blockchain technology can revolutionize various industries through smart contracts, enhancing transparency and efficiency in areas like land records, healthcare, and supply chain management. Challenges to Overcome: Despite the immense potential, the path to widespread Digital Asset Adoption is not without hurdles: Regulatory Clarity: While the sentiment is shifting, a clear, comprehensive, and consistent regulatory framework is still needed to provide certainty for businesses and investors. Public Education: There’s a significant need to educate the general public about the risks and opportunities associated with digital assets to prevent scams and foster responsible participation. Infrastructure: Ensuring robust and secure digital infrastructure, including reliable internet access and cybersecurity measures, is crucial for mass adoption. Energy Consumption: The energy consumption of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin remains a concern, especially for a country like India committed to sustainability goals. Addressing these challenges proactively will be key to unlocking the full potential of digital assets for India’s growth story. How Could Bitcoin Impact the Indian Economy ? The potential integration of Bitcoin into India’s strategic reserves, or even just a more open stance towards digital assets, could have profound effects on the Indian Economy . This isn’t just about a new asset class; it’s about potentially reshaping economic policies and investment flows. Opportunities for the Indian Economy: Diversification of Reserves: Adding Bitcoin could diversify India’s foreign exchange reserves, reducing reliance on a single currency or commodity and potentially hedging against global economic volatility. Attracting Foreign Investment: A progressive stance on digital assets could make India a more attractive destination for global blockchain and crypto businesses, leading to increased foreign direct investment (FDI) and capital inflows. Innovation Hub: By embracing digital assets, India could solidify its position as a global innovation hub, particularly in fintech and blockchain technology, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of startups and talent. Inflation Hedge: As a scarce asset with a fixed supply, Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation, offering a potential tool to preserve purchasing power for the national treasury. Potential Risks for the Indian Economy: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant concern. Holding a volatile asset in national reserves could expose the economy to considerable fluctuations. Regulatory Arbitrage: Lack of clear global regulations could lead to regulatory arbitrage, where illicit activities might flow through jurisdictions with weaker oversight. Systemic Risk: Uncontrolled growth and integration of digital assets without proper oversight could introduce new systemic risks to the financial system. Careful consideration and a phased approach would be essential to mitigate these risks while harnessing the opportunities for the Indian Economy . Could Bitcoin Redefine India’s Role in the Global Financial System ? India’s consideration of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset is not just an internal policy matter; it carries significant weight for its standing in the Global Financial System . Historically, the U.S. dollar has dominated as the world’s primary reserve currency, alongside gold. Any move by a major economy like India to diversify its reserves into a non-sovereign digital asset could have ripple effects globally. If India were to proceed with accumulating Bitcoin, it would join a small but growing list of nations and entities exploring this path. El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, and various corporations have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. However, a major G20 economy doing so for its national reserves would be a game-changer, potentially accelerating the global legitimization of Bitcoin as a serious financial asset. Such a move could: Influence Other Nations: India’s decision could inspire other developing and even developed nations to re-evaluate their reserve strategies and consider digital assets. Challenge the Dollar’s Hegemony: While unlikely to dethrone the dollar overnight, a widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset could gradually reduce global reliance on a single fiat currency, fostering a more multipolar financial world. Promote Financial Multilateralism: By embracing a decentralized asset, India could champion a more inclusive and resilient global financial architecture, less susceptible to the whims of individual national policies. Enhance India’s Soft Power: Taking a pioneering role in digital asset integration could boost India’s image as a technologically advanced and forward-thinking nation on the world stage. The conversation around Bitcoin’s place in the Global Financial System is no longer theoretical; it’s becoming a tangible policy debate in key economies like India, potentially paving the way for a new era of international finance. The Road Ahead: Actionable Insights for India’s Crypto Future Pradeep Bhandari’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset is a significant moment, but it’s just the beginning of a complex journey. For India to effectively navigate this path, several actionable insights come to the fore: Develop a Clear Policy Roadmap: The government needs to move beyond statements to formulate a detailed, transparent policy framework for digital assets, covering taxation, regulation, and potential reserve integration. Foster Public-Private Dialogue: Engaging with industry experts, blockchain developers, and the crypto community is crucial to crafting informed and effective policies. Invest in Research and Development: India should invest in research into blockchain technology, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and the broader digital asset ecosystem to stay at the forefront of innovation. International Collaboration: Continuing to advocate for global regulatory harmonization, as initiated during the G20 presidency, is vital to manage the cross-border nature of digital assets. Pilot Programs: Consider small-scale pilot programs for Bitcoin integration or other digital asset initiatives to gather data and learn before full-scale implementation. The path forward requires a balanced approach, weighing the immense opportunities against the inherent risks, and building robust frameworks to ensure financial stability and protect investors. Conclusion: India’s Digital Dawn? The statement from BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful signal that India, a nation poised to become a global economic powerhouse, is seriously considering a revolutionary shift in its financial strategy. The idea of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for India moves the discussion from mere speculation to a tangible policy debate. While the journey of India Crypto Regulation has been cautious, this endorsement highlights a growing recognition of digital assets’ potential. Embracing broader Digital Asset Adoption could unlock significant opportunities for the Indian Economy , from financial inclusion to technological leadership. Moreover, such a move could redefine India’s influence within the Global Financial System , positioning it as a pioneer in the digital age of finance. The road ahead will undoubtedly be challenging, requiring careful planning and robust regulatory frameworks. However, if India successfully integrates Bitcoin into its national strategy, it could set a powerful precedent, paving the way for a new era of economic resilience and digital sovereignty.

2025-06-26T15:45:03,"Crypto businesses in Poland brace for impact as new bill looms","The authorities in Poland are working on a bill to finally regulate the nation’s crypto market, the largest in Central and Eastern Europe, in accordance with the latest EU rules. While regulatory clarity may attract major players in the industry, the local crypto community fears that some provisions suggested by Polish politicians threaten the survival of smaller domestic companies. Polish government renews push to regulate crypto Poles may have been frustrated by delayed efforts to regulate the crypto space in their country, but what’s in store for them now does not necessarily bring a change for the better, Polish crypto media has noted. The government in Warsaw approved a draft law prepared by the finance ministry, the basic purpose of which is to implement the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets ( MiCA ) package in Poland, the Bitcoin.pl portal reported. But that’s not all. Certain texts added by local politicians are making Polish crypto companies think about moving abroad, the news outlet warned. If adopted, the legislation will assign regulatory oversight to Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), which is not particularly popular among members of the country’s crypto industry. The agency will be tasked to control the operations of platforms such as cryptocurrency exchanges and token issuers, which will be required to share detailed information about their activities. The KNF will also be entitled to impose heavy fines on crypto firms, which can reach 22 million złoty annually (over $6 million). The penalties are harsher than those for banks, the report points out. According to the FinTech Poland Foundation for Financial Innovation, the regulations contain overly rigorous provisions regarding reporting obligations and supervisory powers. Bill raises entry barriers for crypto startups Poland is obliged to apply the rules introduced by the MiCA law, which seeks to unify regulatory frameworks across the EU. However, many Poles are concerned that the rules proposed by their own government, which the industry describes as “draconian,” go too far. Besides exaggerated regulatory scrutiny, it also includes higher entry barriers for new crypto businesses. Obtaining a crypto asset service provider (CASP) license will cost about half a million zlotys, noted Polish economist Prof. Krzysztof Piech. “Then 30 – 40,000 zlotys of monthly costs, in addition to which you have to prepare about 1,000 pages of documentation and wait two years for the regulator’s decision,” he told the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza, adding: “From my conversations with entities in the market, everyone will try to obtain a license abroad. It is therefore possible that the Polish act will not cover any entity, except for those already regulated.” The comments of the academic, who specializes in finance, were quoted in an article titled “Government Grabs Bitcoin by the Throat.” The same report revealed that Poland’s president-elect Karol Nawrocki, who will assume office in August, intends to veto the law, which, in his view, proposes “murderous” solutions. The Sejm and the Senate, the upper and lower house of Polish parliament, are likely to adopt the bill. If Nawrocki makes good on his promise not to sign it in its current form, attempts to regulate the crypto space in Poland are expected to continue. “I notice that more and more people and companies are investing in cryptocurrencies. What is my attitude to this? Innovations must be created in Poland, not regulations,” Nawrocki was quoted as stating during the election campaign . “As the president of the Republic of Poland, I will guarantee that the murderous regulations that will limit your freedom will not be implemented,” he insisted in a post on X at the end of May. 🟦 Zauważam, że coraz więcej osób i firm inwestuje w kryptowaluty. Jaki jest mój stosunek do tego? W Polsce muszą powstawać innowacje, a nie regulacje. Jako Prezydent RP, będę gwarantem, że nie wejdą w życie zamordystyczne przepisy, które ograniczą Waszą wolność. #Nawrocki2025 pic.twitter.com/pHoJ03Gg3K — #Nawrocki2025 (@Nawrocki25) May 28, 2025 While the upcoming regulatory clarity may attract major industry players that can afford the high costs of licensing, smaller crypto firms will have to either leave Poland or continue to operate there via registration in another jurisdiction. “This will happen at the expense of the state budget. It is hard to understand the logic of the legislator,” the crypto news outlet noted. A previously discussed controversial proposal envisaged imposing a 0.5% fee on the revenues of Polish crypto exchanges while charging foreign-based platforms only a one-time fee of around $5,000.

2025-06-26T15:38:57,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Technical Target at $169K as Cup and Handle Now Completed","Bitcoin has completed its cup and handle pattern, according to TradingView analysis, with bullish signals pointing to a possible technical breakout. Bitcoin (BTC) has shown renewed strength over the past week, recovering from a mid-week low and maintaining an upward trajectory. BTC reached a recent high of around $107,980 by June 25–26. As of today, it trades at $106,952, continuing to hover near local highs.Bitcoin Completed Cup and Handle PatternFollowing the recent recovery, a chart analysis from TradingView analyst TradingShot indicates a potential technical breakout. The analyst reports that Bitcoin appears to have completed a Cup and Handle pattern on the daily (1D) timeframe. This formation began in January, with BTC initially surging to $109,400 on January 20. A decline followed, bottoming near $74,000 on April 9, forming the base of the cup. Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin Price Prediction The rebound that extended into May reached as high as $111,800 around May 22, which marked the right edge of the cup. After that, price action ranged between $98,300 and $110,700, shaping the handle. This period of consolidation coincided with Bitcoin dipping below its 1D MA50. After this, it rebounded at the 1D MA200, a move noted by the analyst as significant for the technical setup.Technical Indicators Signal Building MomentumAccording to TradingShot, Bitcoin not only reclaimed its 1D MA50 following the rebound but also posted a bullish signal on the MACD. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator printed a Bullish Cross, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. This development typically points to strengthening bullish momentum and supports the possibility of further gains.The MACD crossover aligns with Bitcoin regaining its MA50, reinforcing the bullish outlook based on the completed chart pattern. Importantly, the handle segment of the cup and handle pattern has formed what the analyst refers to as an “isolated” Bull Flag. The chart projects a technical target at the 2.0 Fibonacci extension, situated at approximately $169,000.To meet the projected level of $169,000, Bitcoin would require a 57.47% increase from the current pivot level of $107,316.Bitcoin Has Room for UpsideMeanwhile, Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), shared an updated chart on June 25 showing Bitcoin’s historical correlation with global M2 liquidity, which now stands at $94.3 trillion. The chart highlights that Bitcoin has generally followed M2 trends with a 12-week lag, maintaining a broad alignment since 2023 despite occasional deviations. Currently, Bitcoin appears to be trailing the growth in global liquidity, creating a divergence that analysts are watching. This macro backdrop, paired with bullish technical signals such as the MACD crossover and the recovery of key moving averages, suggests Bitcoin may still have room to follow global M2’s upward path and approach projected cycle targets.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/26/analyst-says-bitcoin-technical-target-at-169k-as-cup-and-handle-now-completed/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-bitcoin-technical-target-at-169k-as-cup-and-handle-now-completed,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T15:30:41,"Bitcoin Investment Strategy: The Smarter Web Company Secures Massive Funding for Future Crypto Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment Strategy: The Smarter Web Company Secures Massive Funding for Future Crypto Holdings The digital landscape is constantly evolving, and at the heart of this transformation lies the powerful synergy between innovative technology and forward-thinking financial strategies. In a move that has sent ripples across both the tech and cryptocurrency worlds, UK-based web development powerhouse, The Smarter Web Company , has announced a monumental funding round, securing approximately $56.45 million. But this isn’t just another funding story; it’s a profound declaration of intent. This substantial capital injection isn’t merely for expanding their core web development services; a significant portion is earmarked for an ambitious and long-term Bitcoin investment strategy . With a current holding of over 543 BTC and a commitment to acquiring more over the next decade, The Smarter Web Company is setting a compelling precedent for corporate crypto adoption , signaling a new era where digital assets become a cornerstone of corporate treasury management. Unpacking the Funding Success: A Boost for Web Development Funding The announcement from The Smarter Web Company details a highly successful accelerated bookbuild and subscription, drawing in a diverse group of institutional and qualified investors. This fundraising method, known for its efficiency, allowed the company to swiftly raise £41.2 million, translating to roughly $56.45 million at the time of the announcement. This significant influx of capital underscores robust investor confidence not only in The Smarter Web Company’s established expertise in web development but also in its innovative financial foresight. What does this mean for the broader web development sector? This substantial web development funding highlights a continued appetite among investors for companies that are not only delivering cutting-edge digital solutions but are also adapting to the evolving financial landscape. It suggests that firms integrating advanced technologies with shrewd financial planning, particularly in the realm of digital assets, are increasingly attractive. For The Smarter Web Company, this funding provides the necessary leverage to: Accelerate product development and innovation in web technologies. Expand market reach and acquire new talent. Strengthen its balance sheet and operational capabilities. Execute its bold Bitcoin investment strategy with greater conviction. The success of this funding round is a testament to the company’s strong fundamentals and its ability to articulate a clear vision for growth, both within its traditional business and its progressive approach to asset management. Why a Bold Bitcoin Investment Strategy is Key for The Smarter Web Company In a world grappling with economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, companies are increasingly seeking alternative asset classes to preserve and grow their capital. For The Smarter Web Company, Bitcoin has emerged as the asset of choice for its long-term treasury management. Their commitment to purchasing Bitcoin over the next decade, building on their existing holding of more than 543 BTC, is a clear indication of a strategic and long-term conviction in the digital gold narrative. But why Bitcoin? Several factors likely underpin this audacious Bitcoin investment strategy : Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a deflationary asset, offering a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Digital Gold Narrative: Often referred to as “digital gold,” Bitcoin shares characteristics with traditional safe-haven assets, providing a store of value in the digital age. Long-Term Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, attracting investors looking for substantial capital appreciation. Transparency and Decentralization: The transparent and decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain appeals to companies seeking alternatives to traditional, centralized financial systems. Innovation Alignment: For a web development firm, investing in a leading decentralized technology like Bitcoin aligns with their ethos of innovation and embracing the future of the internet. This proactive approach to asset management positions The Smarter Web Company not just as a tech innovator, but also as a pioneer in modern corporate finance, adapting to a rapidly changing global economy. It’s a strategic move that could inspire many other companies to reconsider their treasury strategies. The Growing Trend: Corporate Crypto Adoption Takes Center Stage The Smarter Web Company’s move is not an isolated incident but rather part of a burgeoning global trend of corporate crypto adoption . While early adopters like MicroStrategy paved the way, an increasing number of publicly traded and private companies are now allocating a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This shift signifies a growing recognition of digital assets as legitimate, long-term components of a diversified corporate portfolio. What drives this wave of corporate interest in cryptocurrencies? Driver Explanation Macroeconomic Concerns Rising inflation, quantitative easing, and low-interest rates in traditional banking systems push companies to seek alternative stores of value. Technological Advancement Understanding of blockchain technology and digital assets is maturing, leading to greater confidence in their underlying value. Competitive Edge Companies that embrace digital assets are often seen as forward-thinking and innovative, attracting talent and customers. Investor Demand A growing segment of investors expects companies to explore new avenues for value creation, including digital assets. While the benefits are clear, challenges such as regulatory uncertainty, price volatility, and security concerns remain. However, companies like The Smarter Web Company are demonstrating that with careful planning and a long-term outlook, these challenges can be navigated. Their commitment to a decade-long Bitcoin accumulation plan highlights a belief in the fundamental strength and future potential of the asset, moving beyond short-term speculative plays. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Holdings ? The significant funding raised by The Smarter Web Company, coupled with its explicit Bitcoin strategy, provides a fascinating case study for the broader trend of institutional crypto holdings . When institutional investors commit capital to a company that openly embraces Bitcoin as a treasury asset, it sends a powerful signal to the market. It suggests a growing acceptance and even demand for exposure to digital assets, albeit indirectly, through traditional equity investments. This scenario creates a unique investment proposition: Indirect Crypto Exposure: Investors who might be hesitant to directly purchase cryptocurrencies can gain exposure through equity in companies with significant crypto holdings. Validation of Strategy: The success of the funding round validates the corporate Bitcoin strategy, potentially encouraging other institutional players to consider similar approaches. Market Maturation: As more traditional companies integrate crypto into their operations and balance sheets, it contributes to the overall maturation and legitimization of the cryptocurrency market. New Investment Vehicles: This trend could pave the way for new financial products and investment vehicles designed to track companies with substantial digital asset reserves. The Smarter Web Company’s move is a clear indicator that institutional crypto holdings are no longer a niche concept but are becoming an integral part of diversified investment portfolios and corporate strategies. It marks a crucial step in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. The Road Ahead for The Smarter Web Company : A Decade of Bitcoin With $56.45 million in fresh capital and a clear commitment to accumulating Bitcoin for the next ten years, The Smarter Web Company is charting an ambitious course. This dual strategy – excelling in web development while building a substantial Bitcoin treasury – positions them uniquely in the market. Their journey will be closely watched by industry analysts, investors, and other corporations contemplating similar moves. Actionable insights for companies considering a similar path, inspired by The Smarter Web Company’s bold steps: Define a Clear Strategy: Understand your “why” for crypto adoption. Is it an inflation hedge, a growth asset, or an innovation play? Start Small and Scale: You don’t need to go all-in immediately. A phased approach allows for learning and adaptation. Prioritize Security: Implement robust security measures for storing digital assets, potentially using multi-signature wallets and cold storage solutions. Understand Regulatory Landscape: Stay informed about evolving regulations in your jurisdiction regarding corporate crypto holdings. Communicate Transparently: Clearly articulate your strategy to investors, employees, and the public to build trust and manage expectations. The Smarter Web Company’s journey over the next decade will not only define its own future but also serve as a blueprint for how traditional businesses can successfully navigate and thrive within the emerging digital asset economy. Their story is a powerful narrative of foresight, strategic planning, and a deep belief in the transformative power of Bitcoin. Conclusion: Pioneering a New Era of Corporate Finance The announcement from The Smarter Web Company marks a pivotal moment, showcasing a progressive integration of traditional business growth with innovative digital asset management. Their successful $56.45 million funding round is a testament to their prowess in web development, but their commitment to a long-term Bitcoin investment strategy truly sets them apart. This bold move underscores a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a strategic corporate asset and highlights the accelerating trend of corporate crypto adoption and institutional crypto holdings. As The Smarter Web Company embarks on its decade-long Bitcoin accumulation journey, it stands as a beacon for other enterprises, illustrating how embracing the future of finance can lead to unprecedented growth and resilience in an ever-changing global economy.

2025-06-26T15:30:23,"Crypto Comeback: SoFi Digital Bank Relaunches Trading After 2-Year Break","SoFi Technologies is back in crypto. On Wednesday, the online banking platform said it will let customers trade digital coins and send money abroad using blockchain. This marks a full turn from last November, when SoFi paused its crypto services to secure a bank charter under tighter rules. SoFi Reopens Crypto Doors According to a waitlist notice on SoFi’s website, users can soon buy, sell, and hold popular tokens in their accounts. The firm also plans to roll out stablecoin offerings down the road. There’s even a hint at borrowing against crypto and new staking features. That means customers might earn rewards on proof-of-stake assets or tap their holdings for loans without selling. A New Spin On Remittances Based on reports , SoFi’s remittance tool will convert US dollars into crypto, move it on-chain, then change it back into local currency. This could cut both time and fees compared with old-school services. The fintech blockchain sector is set to jump from $3.5 billion in 2024 to $50 billion by 2030, according to Insider. If SoFi nails the flow and liquidity, it could undercut players like Western Union and MoneyGram. Regulation Winds Have Shifted SoFi exited crypto in November 2023 to comply with bank-charter rules. But under the US President Donald Trump administration, stablecoin bills have gained traction in Congress. The Federal Reserve’s move to drop “reputational risk” from bank exams also clears a path for crypto-bank ties. Still, SoFi will need to watch both federal and state rules as they evolve. Galileo’s Wider Role The company’s Galileo platform won’t just power SoFi’s own products. It will host third-party wallets and custody services, too. By opening its rails to other apps, SoFi hopes to grab fees and embed blockchain tech in more corners of finance. It’s a two-pronged approach: serve its members and support outside developers. Very excited about the innovation we can drive via blockchain and crypto across our businesses. @Sofi ‘s planned new international payments (frequently called remittances) will convert fiat to crypto, transmit via blockchain, and convert to local fiat. It’s only day 1 of the type… https://t.co/KIIyXMEHJo — Anthony Noto (@anthonynoto) June 25, 2025 Market Reaction and Next Steps SoFi stock (ticker: SOFI) jumped over 10% over the past week, based on Google Finance data. Investors seem to like the pivot. But the real test will come with execution. Customers expect smooth apps, low fees, and iron-clad security. Any hiccup—especially in converting crypto back to local fiat—could cause headaches and chatter with regulators abroad. CEO Anthony Noto said this is only “day one” of what they can build with blockchain, crypto, and AI “to make financial services faster, easier, safer, more accessible, and lower cost for our members.” If SoFi delivers on those goals, it could become one of the first big banks to bridge traditional finance and digital assets in a meaningful way. Until then, all eyes will be on its waitlist and the first wave of customer feedback.

The first one notes the progress toward excluding UST (US Treasury) stablecoins from the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) regulation, which would reduce capital charges for banks holding stablecoins. This could unlock more bank involvement, increasing liquidity and institutional support for crypto, but only if US regulators finalize it. Second, Hayes sees the GENIUS Act (now passed by the Senate) as effectively putting US stablecoin issuance in the hands of banks or heavily regulated entities.

2025-06-26T15:22:35,"Peter Schiff Says the European Demand for Bitcoin Will Keep Falling","Long-term Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has predicted that Europeans will continue to lose interest in Bitcoin, citing its price difference as proof. Bitcoin is down slightly in the past 24 hours against the dollar, following a period of intense upward price action that saw it reach an intraday high of $108,310 today. While the asset has shown bullish momentum, particularly from a scare over the weekend that saw it drop below $100,000, some still believe BTC remains a bubble that will burst soon.Bitcoin’s Demand Would Decline in Europe: SchiffParticularly, in a tweet today, staunch critic Peter Schiff made another claim about Bitcoin and its long-term trajectory, especially outside the United States. He argued that the demand for the pioneering cryptocurrency would continue to decline in Europe alongside the demand for the US dollar.For context, he cited that while Bitcoin is only 4% away from its all-time high of $112,000 attained on May 22, it is 14% away from its peak of €105,951 against the euro. Interestingly, BTC reached this peak on January 20, failing to find much joy against the euro as with the dollar, where it has hit two new ATHs since Inauguration Day.Meanwhile, Schiff claims that this disparity is due to Bitcoin's lesser popularity in Europe compared to the United States. While the European Union debuted a crypto market framework before the US, the latter still has more users and processes more crypto-related transactions than the former.Notably, the Bitcoin critic expects this trend to continue. He emphasized that the global de-dollarization trend is ongoing, and Bitcoin’s adoption is likely to decline in Europe alongside the dollar. “European demand for both will keep falling,” Schiff added. Mere Forex Difference?Meanwhile, Schiff’s comments drew the attention of the crypto community, with a reaction emphasizing that the acclaimed lack of interest is merely a forex disparity. Salomondrin highlighted that this was due to the US dollar index (DXY) dropping, which led to other cryptocurrencies appreciating against the USD.For perspective, Donald Trump’s tariff war led many institutions to lose interest in the US dollar as they sought alternative means of cross-border trading. The DXY crashed on this development and remains in a downtrend, dropping to 97 today.As a result, during the period, Bitcoin surged against the US dollar to new highs but failed to replicate a similar feat against the more stable euro. As a result, Schiff’s claim that the price difference suggested a lack of interest lacked logic.Moreover, Salomondrin stated that a similar price difference is seen in gold’s price against the dollar and the euro. Gold sells at $2,880 per ounce against the euro and $3,300 against the dollar; hence, Schiff’s comments are based on relative all-time highs rather than Bitcoin’s real value.Remarkably, top market watchers have tipped Bitcoin to continue growing both in price and adoption. Recall that Tim Draper tipped BTC to increase infinitely against the US dollar, with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong arguing that nations will hold more Bitcoin than gold in the future.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/26/peter-schiff-says-the-european-demand-for-bitcoin-will-keep-falling/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=peter-schiff-says-the-european-demand-for-bitcoin-will-keep-falling,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Peter Schiff News",cryptocompare

2025-06-26T15:20:21,"MicroStrategy: Crucial Implications of $40.3M Executive Stock Sales","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy: Crucial Implications of $40.3M Executive Stock Sales The cryptocurrency world often buzzes with news of major corporate moves, and when it involves a titan like MicroStrategy , ears perk up. Recently, a significant development caught the attention of many: MicroStrategy executive stock sales totaling a staggering $40.3 million over the past 90 days. This news, involving top brass like the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, naturally sparks questions. Is this a sign of waning confidence in their bold Bitcoin strategy, or simply routine financial management? Let’s unpack the details and understand what these moves truly signify for the company and the broader crypto market. What’s Behind the MicroStrategy Executive Stock Sales? The headline itself can sound alarming: key executives offloading millions in company stock. However, a closer look at the specifics reveals a more nuanced picture. According to reports, the vast majority of these sales were conducted through pre-scheduled plans. This is a critical distinction. Executives often receive a significant portion of their compensation in the form of stock options or other equity-based awards. To realize the value of these awards, they must sell shares, and to avoid accusations of insider trading, these sales are typically set up well in advance through mechanisms like 10b5-1 plans. Who Sold? The sales involved high-ranking officials, including the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Their positions give them deep insight into the company’s operations and strategy. How Much? A cumulative total of $40.3 million worth of MSTR stock was sold over a 90-day period. How Were Sales Conducted? Primarily through pre-scheduled plans, often involving the exercise of stock options and the subsequent sale of the acquired shares. This is a common practice for executive compensation. Understanding the MSTR Stock Movement For investors tracking MSTR stock , any significant insider selling can be a cause for concern. However, in the context of pre-scheduled plans, these sales are often less about a lack of confidence in the company’s future and more about personal financial planning, diversification, or tax obligations. Executives, like anyone else, need to manage their personal finances, and converting equity compensation into liquid assets is a standard part of that process. It’s important to differentiate between opportunistic, reactive sales and planned, systematic divestments. Historically, MicroStrategy’s stock performance has been heavily correlated with the price of Bitcoin, given its aggressive strategy of accumulating the cryptocurrency. Therefore, any analysis of MSTR stock movement must always consider the underlying Bitcoin price action. While these executive sales are notable, they don’t necessarily indicate a shift in the company’s core strategy or a negative outlook from within, especially if they align with established compensation structures. The Broader Picture: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy MicroStrategy cemented its reputation as a pioneer in corporate crypto adoption under the leadership of Michael Saylor. The company famously began accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020, positioning itself as the largest corporate holder of the digital asset. This strategy transformed the company’s identity and financial profile, making its stock a proxy for Bitcoin exposure for many traditional investors. The company’s commitment to Bitcoin has been unwavering, with continuous purchases even during market downturns. This aggressive accumulation strategy has defined MicroStrategy and made it a bellwether for institutional interest in Bitcoin. The recent executive stock sales, therefore, are being scrutinized not just for their financial implications but also for what they might signal about the long-term commitment to this unique corporate strategy. Implications for Corporate BTC Holdings and the Market The news of executive stock sales at a prominent firm like MicroStrategy inevitably raises questions about the broader trend of corporate BTC holdings . As more companies consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, the actions of early adopters like MicroStrategy are closely watched. If these sales were indicative of a strategic pivot or a loss of faith in Bitcoin, it could send ripples through the market. However, as established, the pre-scheduled nature of these sales suggests otherwise. The market generally reacts more strongly to unexpected insider selling, which can signal a lack of confidence. Planned sales, however, are often priced in or understood as part of regular executive compensation cycles. For the wider cryptocurrency market, the primary focus remains on MicroStrategy’s continued commitment to its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which has not shown any signs of wavering despite these executive transactions. Is This a Red Flag or Business as Usual? When high-profile executives sell a substantial amount of company stock, it’s natural to wonder if it’s a “red flag.” Is it a sign that those closest to the company see trouble ahead? In this specific case, the consensus, supported by reports, points towards “business as usual” rather than a dire warning. The key differentiator is the pre-scheduled nature of the sales. Consider these points: Planned vs. Reactive: Sales executed through 10b5-1 plans are set up months, sometimes years, in advance. They are not a reaction to recent news or a sudden shift in company outlook. Diversification: Executives often have a large portion of their wealth tied up in company stock. Selling some shares is a prudent way to diversify their personal portfolios. Tax Obligations: Exercising stock options can trigger significant tax liabilities, necessitating the sale of some shares to cover these costs. While any insider selling warrants attention, the context is paramount. For MicroStrategy, a company whose identity is now deeply intertwined with Bitcoin, any perceived shift in strategy or confidence would be monumental. These executive sales, however, appear to be a routine aspect of compensation and financial management, not a signal of retreat from their bold Bitcoin conviction. Conclusion: Navigating Executive Moves in the Crypto Age The $40.3 million in executive stock sales at MicroStrategy might have initially raised eyebrows, but a deeper dive reveals a more standard explanation rooted in executive compensation and personal financial planning. Far from signaling a retreat from their pioneering corporate BTC holdings , these transactions appear to be largely pre-scheduled and part of routine financial management. For investors in MSTR stock and the broader Bitcoin market, the focus should remain on MicroStrategy’s stated strategy and continued actions regarding its significant digital asset portfolio. Understanding the nuances of insider trading regulations and executive compensation plans is crucial to interpreting such news accurately and avoiding unwarranted panic.

2025-06-26T15:19:06,"Altcoins today: CVX weakens after $9.5M hack, BSW rallies 120% despite delisting news","Digital tokens remained on the edge on Thursday as Bitcoin targeted upside continuation to the $110,000 mark . The altcoin space remained mixed, with tokens flashing possible reversal as upside momentum fades. While most assets displayed eye-catching performances, Convex Finance and Biswap dominated daily trends for different reasons. Let’s check what influenced CVX and BSW as cryptocurrencies remained relatively calm over the past 24 hours. CVX slides as hackers drain Convex and Yearn’s subDAO CVX led the downside today as fraudsters accessed Resupply, a subDAO designed to complement Convex Finance and Yearn Finance blockchains. The incident resulted in the loss of assets worth around $9.5 million. CVX and YFI plunged hours after BlockSec confirmed the news on X as the incident reignited fears among DeFi enthusiasts. Convex’s native token saw a swift fall to $2.45 minutes after the announcement. It has extended the decline to trade at $2.40 during this publication, highlighting surging selling pressure. Chart by CoinMarketCap Short-term technical indicators reveal CVX’s deteriorated structure. The 4H Moving Average Convergence Divergence forms red histograms after a bearish crossover with the signal line. The Relative Strength Index suggests a weakening momentum as sellers resurfaced. Thus, Convex Finance’s coin will likely dip further before a possible rebound. Enthusiasts wait for a full post-mortem as the team analyses the magnitude of the attack. However, they guaranteed system stability after pausing the hack. The team stated : The affected contract has been identified, and the protocol continues to function as intended. A full post-mortem will be shared as soon as a complete analysis of the situation has been conducted. BSW jumps as Binance announces imminent delisting While today’s headlines screamed “sell,” Biswap’s native token defied the trends. The altcoin staged a remarkable rally after Binance announced it would remove BSW, alongside Stella (ALPHA), Komodo (KMD), LTO Network (LTO), and LeverFi (LEVER) on July 4. Binance @binance · Follow Binance will Delist ALPHA, BSW, KMD, LEVER, LTO on 2025-07-04. 👉 binance.com/en/support/ann… 8:00 pm · 26 Jun 2025 211 Reply Copy link Read 123 replies Generally, digital assets plummet after delisting confirmations. However, BSW skyrocketed, possibly amid increased speculative trading as users capitalized on the existing liquidity. The exchange cited various factors behind its decision, including deteriorated developer activity, declining community engagement, liquidity issues, and team dedication concerns. Users should close their current BSW positions and withdraw their assets before specific deadlines. BSW jumped from the daily low of $0.017 to $0.03709 intraday peak, translating to a 118% upswing. Chart by CoinMarketCap It trades at $0.03318 after correcting from the 24-hour peak. BSW’s daily trading volume has increased by over 1,600%. Nevertheless, Biswap’s current structure demands caution. The altcoin exhibits significant volatility, making it susceptible to immense price swings. The altcoin might plunge further in the upcoming hours as hacking sentiments outweigh the prevailing bullish momentum. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continued to determine the market tone. Breaching the resistance zone at $109.7K could shift short-term trends to bullish, with $113,000 as the next target. Nevertheless, magnified bearish pressure at BTC’s current price could catalyze substantial declines to the support barrier at $102,000 – $103,000.

The firm said it will not accept new applications, feature submissions, and app updates on the Nano S due to its phase-out initiative. Ledger also recommended that companies begin planning for the transition to ensure continuity for their users by warning them that support for Nano S will not be guaranteed. The firm told companies to encourage users to upgrade to other Ledger devices and check that they have their 24-word Secret Recovery Phrase to maintain support. The crypto company urged users to upgrade to newer versions like the Ledger Nano X, Ledger Nano S Plus, Ledger Flex, and Ledger Stax. Ledger argued that upgrading will offer perks, including the latest security features like Clear Signing, improved user experience, future-proofing, and increased storage. Since Ledger Nano S launched in 2016, the company believes the crypto landscape has evolved. With new digital assets and blockchain applications, the model’s limited storage capacity is now a constraint. The firm noted that Nano S has a Secure Element (ST31H320) with 320 kb of flash memory, enabling top-tier security through self-custody. Ledger also highlighted that the chips were not initially designed for current use cases. Despite the Nano S model’s limited memory being sufficient in 2016 to store the Ledger OS and its associated applications, Ledger acknowledged that the rapid growth of the crypto ecosystem has made its storage capacity a limitation. The firm noted that users had to delete frequently and reinstall apps to manage their diverse crypto holdings due to the Nano S model’s insufficient space. The hard wallet manufacturer said it impacts usability and convenience, especially for users on multiple blockchains. Ledger also disclosed that the available RAM on the Nano S chip is lower compared to newer products. The firm said the limitation does not support features including Ledger Recover, Ledger Sync, latest and future Clear Signing improvements, sending NFTs through Ledger Live, Ledger Live swaps with THORChain and Uniswap, and Device Language Packs.

The firm debuted the Ledger Recovery Key , allowing Ledger Flex or Ledger Stax users to store their private keys on a smart card with an NFC connection. According to the hard wallet manufacturer, the new private key differs from its previous version, Ledger Recover, which stores encrypted fragments of recovery phrases in cloud-based hardware security modules. The firm also acknowledged that the new key recovery product does not require identity verification or the collection of personal details, as Ledger Recover does. “We’ve received extremely positive feedback from security researchers and industry leaders, and we’re excited to reveal it to the world for even more feedback ahead of its launch soon.” Charles Guillemet, Chief Technology Officer at Ledger. The company maintained that the Ledger Recovery Key is always offline and protected by its PIN. The firm also confirmed in the announcement that the Recovery Key connects directly to Ledger devices using secure NFC wireless channels with no intermediary. The key is built with Secure Element, the main security layer, and the same technology applied by Ledger wallet devices. As part of Ledger’s transparency pledge, the key’s application code is open-sourced on GitHub. Its code shows the tool has undergone internal security testing with Donjon, the company’s white hat hacker team and has been externally audited by cybersecurity firm Synacktiv.

2025-06-26T15:03:45,"The Evolution of Sports Betting: How Crypto and Betting Platforms Are Redefining the Game","Sports have been an aspect of our culture dating back to the pre-historic era. Communal pastimes make for a great way to spend the day bonding with friends or family. But, they are also the perfect outlet to blow off steam or pent up energy. Of course, not only do we enjoy playing sports, we also enjoy watching them. Today, the sports industry is bigger than ever. Football alone has over 3 billion fans around the globe. The sport generates billions from ticket sales, sponsorship deals, and betting. As most markets today, sports betting has gone digital. Online betting platforms like Puntit have redefined the way we engage with the sports that we love. One of the most exciting evolutions of the betting industry is the integration of crypto. The rise of cryptocurrency has fascinated and intrigued the general population. Not only has it sent waves through the world of finance, but it has also made incredible changes in entertainment. The sports betting industry has not gone unscathed. Let’s take a look at how crypto and online betting have redefined the world of sports betting. Integration of Cryptocurrency The integration of cryptocurrency in sports betting should not go unaddressed. It was the first step in creating a crypto-friendly environment in the sports betting industry. Bitcoin served as the introduction to digital currencies for many. However, it was a while before the mainstream could accept crypto-based deposits. Even some of the most popular markets that operate using crypto today were hesitant to jump on the bandwagon throughout the 2010s. What many don’t know is that sports betting platforms on the internet were among the first to embrace this bold new era of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin quickly became a staple of both sports betting sites and online casinos. For a long time, the first crypto was also the only option that sports gamblers had. However, as altcoins gained prominence in the mainstream, punters were noticing an increase in their availability on the numerous betting sites. Today, sports betting fans have access to various crypto options. Despite that, Bitcoin remains the top choice. Ethereum and Tether are also quite popular. There are even certain sites that will allow customers to use some lesser-known altcoins and memecoins like Doge. Crypto-based betting has become such a hit that there are even websites entirely dedicated to deposits and withdrawals with these digital currencies. For many, the new era of crypto gambling represents a brighter future. Blockchain-based Betting Sites Cryptocurrencies are a byproduct of a greater invention in the digital tech sector. Blockchains are the core of the crypto industry. However, they’ve fascinated far more than just the crypto fans and Bitcoin fanatics. In fact, there are many who believe that these ledgers hold the key to the internet’s future. Anyone familiar with the concept of Web3 is almost certainly aware of what blockchains are and how they work. Using cryptographic hashes, the ledger links together a growing list of records. These records are segmented in blocks of information. The combination of cryptographic technology and the peer-to-peer system on which these ledgers operate are at the core of cryptocurrency. But, how could blockchains help in establishing new and secure websites in the future? That is the hot button debate that many tech professionals are having today. The idea is that one could combine the elements of blockchains with certain skills in modern programming. The result would be cryptographically protected websites. The goal is to return to an old-school imagining of the internet; one where anonymity is top priority, and where central authority figures hold no power. But, where do sports betting sites fit into all of this? Many believe that sports betting sites could operate off of the blockchain. In such a world, crypto would become the primary currency of the gambling industry. Online sports punters would never have to worry about anonymity or security again, as their data would be cryptographically protected from external threats. Some have already taken the step towards the future. Crypto and our Virtual Future Virtual reality and cyberspace have fascinated science fiction writers for decades. Though the great William Gibson came up with the name, the concept of a digital world predates the 1980s by fifty years. Virtual reality is no longer a far off dream in the fast-paced tech-oriented 21st century. Recently, we got three announcements for high-budget VR video games. Museums are integrating VR in online tours. But, what does it all have to do with sports and crypto? That is where the Metaverse comes in. A fully simulated VR world that some are calling the future of the world wide web. The Metaverse would allow sports punters to sit in on a game at the FIFA World Cup , while simultaneously relaxing on their couch. Of course, sports betting is a big part of the whole experience. The customer would be able to step into one of the most luxurious sports betting centers they’ve ever seen. The options to bet on any sport you can imagine awaits. But, what about cryptocurrency? Crypto-based casinos and sports betting platforms are certainly going to be a huge part of the Metaverse. The Metaverse would not be possible without the cryptographic algorithms made possible by blockchain technology. The various 3D worlds that all exist in this virtual reality have to be linked in some way, after all. It wouldn’t be surprising if cryptocurrency became the central currency of our digital future. The Pros and Cons of Crypto Betting Many punters are well-aware of the benefits that come with sports betting using Bitcoin. Anonymity is at the top of the list. Crypto-based deposits and withdrawals operate on a peer-to-peer system. No central authority figures functions as a go-between, which means there is nobody tracking the transactions. Heightened security and financial independence are a byproduct of this freedom-oriented exchange. However, we would be remiss if we did not mention the massive downside. Cryptocurrencies are quite volatile. Their volatility has been the topic of debate for years. Many don’t understand how it works, and thus misrepresent it. But, there is no denying that it exists. For many, it is a problem. However, those who can navigate the market can certainly overcome this issue. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-26T15:00:00,"Crypto for Advisors: Crypto Hits Wall Street","What do the latest crypto IPOs mean for the market? Aaron Brogan of Brogan Law breaks it down in today’s Crypto for Advisors newsletter. Then, Jean-Marie Mognetti , CEO of CoinShares , provides insights from their latest investor insights survey about what clients are looking for from their advisors in terms of crypto support in Ask an Expert. Please note that there will be no newsletter next week. We are taking the week off in lieu of the holidays — we wish you a happy Canada Day and Independence Day for those celebrating. We will be back on July 10th. – Sarah Morton Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Cryptocurrency and the Public Markets Cryptocurrency is typically viewed as an alternative to traditional securities markets. Lately, this trend may have reversed, as cryptocurrency is increasingly a factor in public equity markets. Since January, there have been three major crypto IPOs: May 14, 2025 – eToro Group Ltd., a trading platform, raised approximately $619 million in its initial offering, valuing the company at about $5.6 billion. Its market cap has since decreased slightly to $5.17 billion . May 16, 2025 – Galaxy Digital Inc. uplisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange to Nasdaq, raising approximately $602 million in a mixed primary and secondary share sale priced at $19 per share. The deal valued the company at just over $8 billion. Its market cap has since settled at approximately $7.19 billion . June 5, 2025 – Circle Internet Group Inc., the issuer of USDC, raised approximately $1.05 billion in its IPO, selling 34 million shares at $31 apiece. The offering initially valued the company at about $8 billion, but a sharp post-offering rally has pushed its market cap to $43.9 billion. Each of these IPOs is remarkable, considering the extremely punitive regulatory environment of just one year ago, but Circle is in a class of its own. Circle raised the most money, and in the immediate aftermath, its stock popped by many multiples, indicating overwhelming demand. The pop was so extreme, in fact, that some felt the firm “left money on the table” and questioned the motives of the bankers involved. In the wake of Circle’s success, a number of other cryptocurrency firms are considering public offerings. On June 6, Gemini announced that it had submitted a confidential S-1 to the SEC, and on June 10, it was reported that Bullish followed . Numerous other firms, including Kraken, BitGo and ConsenSys, have reportedly also considered public turns. Yet, for these aspirants, the $20 billion question remains: Why has Circle exceeded expectations? Here are my three theories: 1. Public Market Comps Circle was not the first crypto company to outperform. Most famously, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (d/b/a Strategy) has, in recent years, become a bitcoin holding company with a rump software business. Currently, Strategy holds 592,100 bitcoin, valued at approximately $62 billion, compared to about $460 million in annual revenue from its legacy business lines. Strategy is a publicly traded company, allowing retail customers with brokerage accounts to purchase its stock and gain exposure to bitcoin. In theory, its market cap should be the sum of (1) the value of its bitcoin, plus (2) some de minimis premium for the rest. Generously, this might be $66 billion. But in reality, its market cap is $101 billion , prompting commentators to suggest that “the U.S. stock market will pay $2 (or more) for $1 worth of crypto.” Circle’s business model involves buying conventional vanilla financial assets (mostly short-dated U.S. Treasury bills) and then issuing cryptocurrency — roughly the opposite of Strategy — but it may benefit from the same premium. 2. The GENIUS Act Over the past several months, Congress has advanced the GENIUS Act , a piece of legislation intended to govern the regulatory treatment of stablecoins. This bill passed through the Senate last week and is expected to become law in the near future. In this theory, GENIUS will bring regulatory clarity, enabling the stablecoin ecosystem to thrive. In particular, the bill includes a prohibition on yield, which will disallow stablecoin issuers from passing on the yields they earn from holding collateral to token holders. Perhaps this increases issuers’ value. Complicating this, however, is the likelihood that the bill will bring increased competition from banks, such as JPMorgan’s recently announced tokenized deposits. Per Stablecon founder Nik Milanović, “If I were Circle, I would be concerned about bank issuers of stablecoins.” 3. Treasury Instability Finally, there is the macro. Market factors have pushed up Treasury yields in recent months, and if this trend continues, it could be very lucrative for stablecoin issuers. Most issuer revenue comes from yields on the collateral they hold, so when those go up, the issuers benefit. Importantly, the biggest risk these issuers face is rates returning to zero, in which case they would lose the majority of revenue and may not be solvent for long. Perhaps a rerating of the quality of U.S. sovereign debt has increased the long-term value of this class of business. Looking Forward Of course, Circle’s rise could be froth, too. Circle’s market cap is now more than half that of Coinbase . For 10-K enthusiasts, this is a bit puzzling, as Coinbase has a contractual right to half of Circle’s reserve revenue, as well as other business lines. For further reading, view the coverage of the Circle IPO . - Aaron Brogan, founder and managing partner, Brogan Law Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ask an Expert Q. What does the survey data say? A. The survey reflects a clear shift in investor behavior: digital assets are no longer a side conversation. They’ve entered the core of how investors think about wealth — and they’re not waiting for permission. Nearly 9 in 10 crypto holders plan to grow their allocation this year. That’s not hype, that’s commitment. However, what stood out most was the tension: investors are clearly seeking guidance, yet they don’t always trust the advice they’re being offered. We’re seeing a generation of investors who are self-directed, well-informed, and fully engaged. They’re not rejecting the role of the advisor, but they are raising the bar. They want intelligent, transparent conversations about crypto, and they expect their advisor to keep pace with them. That’s a reality the industry has to face head-on. Q. What does this mean for advisors? A. It’s an opportunity for advisors to strengthen client trust by expanding their expertise. Clients aren’t just asking for access to crypto — they’re asking whether their advisor actually understands it. And if 29% of them say a lack of experience or poor communication around risk would make them walk away, that’s not a marginal issue. Advisors still play an essential role, but the model has evolved. What clients want is strategic insight and transparency. They want someone who has taken the time to understand the ecosystem and can speak fluently about risk, custody, and product structure. If an advisor can do that, they’re not just protecting client capital, they’re earning long-term trust. That’s the difference between offering a product and earning a relationship. Q. What specific type of support are clients looking for? A. Clients are seeking guidance that strikes a balance between opportunity and caution. The most valued support isn’t about picking tokens — it’s about managing risk, navigating regulation, and accessing secure vehicles like ETFs or trusts. Over half of the investors we spoke to say that risk oversight is one of the most important roles an advisor can play in the crypto space. That’s a huge opening. Especially for younger or sub-HNW investors, crypto is where they’re building — and they need informed guidance. Advisors who step into that role thoughtfully can help shape the next phase of wealth creation. - Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO, CoinShares Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Keep Reading The US Federal Housing Finance Agency is reviewing whether crypto holdings like bitcoin could be used to qualify for mortgages.

2025-06-26T14:54:09,"Bitcoin holders under IRS scrutiny as thousands receive warning letters","Thousands of Bitcoin holders across the US are now finding out the hard way that the IRS has been watching closely, without saying a word. Over the past 60 days, there’s been a 758% spike in people bringing up these crypto warning letters in support chats, and tax firms like Taxing Cryptocurrency are backing up the same trend, according to CoinLedger. Now these warnings aren’t all the same, but they’re landing in mailboxes fast, and the most common one is Letter 6174, a softer nudge that doesn’t accuse anyone of doing anything wrong. But there’s also 6174-A, which quietly suggests something might be off. Then it ramps up. Letter 6173 comes with a demand for a response. And CP2000? That’s the one where the IRS has already decided what you owe, and you’ve got just 30 days to reply or face whatever comes next. The IRS is casting a wide net Reportedly, a lot of the people getting hit are everyday traders who thought they did everything right. Some never even made a taxable move. But the IRS has been collecting data from Coinbase, Poloniex, and other exchanges through John Doe Summons , and it seems they’re now using that info to check filings. Ben Yoder, Customer Success Manager at CoinLedger, told Cryptopolitan, “These aren’t tax evaders, they’re everyday investors who held Bitcoin or Ethereum for years and thought they did everything right.” He added that a common issue is fear about small mistakes made years ago, like one user who forgot to report a few hundred dollars in 2021 and now fears getting audited. It’s not always about what’s missing though, it’s how the IRS is calculating it. Wallet-to-wallet transfers are a huge problem. If you buy Bitcoin on one platform, move it to your cold wallet, and later sell it on a second exchange, that second platform doesn’t know your original cost. It might report a cost basis of zero, and the IRS thinks your entire sale was profit, even if it wasn’t. That’s how people who filed correctly are still getting flagged. Ben said, “We’ve seen that wallet-to-wallet transfers are a major source of confusion. Many users don’t realize that while these transfers aren’t taxable, failing to keep proper records on them can lead to tax reporting issues.” So even though the movement itself doesn’t create a tax event, the lack of documentation messes with how gains are calculated. New 1099-DA form will fuel more IRS letters This whole situation is only going to get worse. In 2026, crypto exchanges will start sending out Form 1099-DA to both users and the IRS. The form will show gains and losses. If folks don’t report the same income that shows up on their 1099-DA, CoinLedger says they’ll likely get hit with a CP2000. David Kemmerer, CEO of CoinLedger, said, “The IRS has more visibility into crypto than ever before, but without accurate cost basis data, even compliant investors can get mistakenly flagged.” He said this is only the beginning, and people need to start getting their records straight now. If you get one of these letters and know your return is solid, don’t panic. You can fight it. But you’ll need proof. That means screenshots, trading history, 1099s, anything that shows what you actually paid. Respond to the IRS with documentation to back up your numbers. Crypto tax tools like CoinLedger can help pull all your trades and transfers from different wallets and exchanges into one place so you can present the full picture. People are also asking why they’re getting letters at all. They are especially confounded that it’s happening during the Trump administration, where many assumed crypto would get a free pass. But nothing has changed yet. While President Donald Trump floated the idea of making US-based crypto gains tax-free, that hasn’t moved through Congress. Right now, the IRS is still taxing crypto like stocks, and it’s using everything in its arsenal to enforce that. For those who realize they missed something on a past return, there’s still a way to fix it. You can file an amendment using Form 1040X, and the IRS is typically more forgiving if you’re the one coming forward. If you’re making big changes, include a short note to explain what you corrected to help avoid future questions. When it comes to hiring help, it depends on the letter. If you got CP2000 or 6173, it’s probably smart to get a crypto tax pro. Those letters carry higher risks, especially when there’s a disagreement over how much you owe. For the less aggressive letters like 6174 or 6174-A, you might be fine using a tool like CoinLedger to double-check your gains and fix anything off.

The Japanese investment firm has now overtaken Elon Musk’s Tesla in corporate Bitcoin holdings after purchasing an additional 1,234 BTC. Metaplanet Grows Bitcoin Treasury To 12,345 BTC The Tokyo-listed firm disclosed on Thursday that it had acquired the Bitcoin stash at around $107,557 per BTC. The latest acquisition has lifted Metaplanet’s Bitcoin cache to 12,345 BTC at an average price of $98,303. Based on Bitcoin’s current market price of $107,460, the firm holds around $1.3 billion worth of the world’s foremost cryptocurrency. Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that Metaplanet is now the seventh-biggest publicly listed corporate Bitcoin holder, usurping Tesla, which holds 11,509 BTC on its books. The firm is now within striking distance of Bitcoin miner CleanSpark, with its 12,502 BTC cache. Listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Metaplanet is Japan’s first and only company dedicated to building a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a strategy which has given it a market cap of $6.2 billion and made it the 2,434th most valuable firm worldwide. Accumulation Strategy Drawing its inspiration from Michael Saylor’s Strategy, Metaplanet has funded its Bitcoin purchases through a combination of stock and bond sales as part of its bold “555 million plan” to secure 1% of Bitcoin’s supply.

2025-06-26T14:50:39,"Nano Labs’ Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: Bolstering BTC Holdings to 1,000","BitcoinWorld Nano Labs’ Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: Bolstering BTC Holdings to 1,000 The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, with new developments emerging that reshape the landscape of digital finance. One such significant move comes from Nano Labs, a name increasingly recognized in the intersection of semiconductor manufacturing and digital assets. This Nasdaq-listed firm has just made a substantial stride, significantly boosting its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, a move that signals a bold future for corporate treasury management in the crypto space. Nano Labs’ Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: A Deep Dive In a move that has captured the attention of both the traditional financial sector and the crypto community, Nano Labs , a prominent Chinese semiconductor manufacturer specializing in cutting-edge crypto mining chips, recently announced a major expansion of its digital asset portfolio. The firm shared via X (formerly Twitter) that it successfully secured an additional 600 BTC, valued at approximately $63.6 million, through its inaugural round of fundraising via convertible notes. This latest acquisition elevates Nano Labs’ total BTC holdings to an impressive 1,000 BTC, solidifying its position among publicly traded companies with substantial Bitcoin treasuries. This isn’t Nano Labs’ first foray into significant Bitcoin investment. Last December, the company publicly declared its ambitious plan to purchase and hold up to $50 million worth of Bitcoin over the next five years. This consistent strategy underscores a clear commitment to integrating Bitcoin into its long-term financial framework, moving beyond just manufacturing hardware for crypto mining to actively participating in the asset class it helps facilitate. What Are Convertible Notes and Why Did Nano Labs Use Them? The choice of convertible notes as a fundraising mechanism for this significant Bitcoin acquisition is particularly noteworthy. For those unfamiliar, convertible notes are a type of short-term debt that converts into equity (shares) at a later date, usually upon the occurrence of a specific event like a future funding round or a pre-determined maturity date. They are often favored by startups and growing companies because they: Delay Valuation: They allow companies to raise capital without immediately setting a definitive valuation, which can be beneficial if the company expects its value to increase significantly in the near future. Flexibility: They offer flexibility in terms of interest rates, maturity dates, and conversion terms, making them adaptable to various financing needs. Less Dilution Upfront: Initial investors receive debt, not equity, which means less immediate dilution for existing shareholders compared to a direct equity round. For Nano Labs, using convertible notes likely provided a strategic way to quickly raise capital for their Bitcoin purchase without undergoing a full equity offering, which can be time-consuming and complex. It signals confidence in their future growth and the potential appreciation of both their core business and their Bitcoin assets. Expanding the Treasury: The Growing Trend of Corporate BTC Holdings Nano Labs’ increasing BTC holdings are part of a broader, accelerating trend: publicly traded companies integrating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. This strategy goes beyond mere speculation; it’s a calculated move by forward-thinking firms to: Hedge Against Inflation: With global economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, many companies view Bitcoin as a potential store of value, akin to digital gold, that can protect their capital from depreciation. Diversify Assets: Adding Bitcoin provides diversification away from traditional fiat currencies and conventional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Signal Innovation and Industry Alignment: For companies deeply embedded in the digital asset space, like Nano Labs with its crypto mining chip production, holding Bitcoin aligns their balance sheet with their operational focus. It sends a strong signal of belief in the future of the decentralized economy. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering companies an opportunity for substantial capital appreciation on their treasury assets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have famously adopted this strategy, accumulating vast amounts of Bitcoin. Their success, despite market fluctuations, has encouraged other firms to consider similar approaches, validating Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset. Nano Labs is clearly following in these footsteps, demonstrating a proactive approach to managing its financial reserves in a rapidly changing global economy. What Does This Mean for the Future of Nano Labs and Crypto Mining? This significant Bitcoin acquisition by Nano Labs has several implications for both the company and the broader crypto mining industry. Firstly, it strengthens Nano Labs’ financial foundation. By holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin, the company is not only investing in a potentially appreciating asset but also aligning its long-term financial health with the success of the digital asset ecosystem it serves. This synergy can create a virtuous cycle: as Bitcoin’s value potentially rises, so does the value of Nano Labs’ holdings, potentially providing additional capital for research, development, and expansion of its semiconductor business. Secondly, it underscores the increasing maturity and institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. When a Nasdaq-listed company, especially one at the forefront of semiconductor technology for crypto, makes such a bold statement, it lends credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This can encourage other traditional businesses to explore similar strategies, further driving mainstream adoption.

2025-06-26T14:47:46,"Bitcoin ETFs Notch $1B Weekly Inflow, Extending 10-Week Streak","BlackRock's IBIT dominated with a $1.23 billion inflow, while Bitwise's BITB saw $29.85 million, Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust $14.93 million, and Hashdex's DEFI fund $1.17 million. Positive Market Sentiment Amid Easing Geopolitical Tensions Having witnessed a 10‑day streak of ETF inflows, Bitcoin has been able to record this bullish run thanks to easing geopolitical uncertainty with the Iran-Israel ceasefire taking center stage. BlackRock's IBIT dominance cannot go unnoticed because its inflows since early June have surpassed $2.6 billion, securing 9-concecutive days of inflows. Therefore, the $1.02 billion net inflow reflects sustained institutional conviction, supply-driven bullish dynamics, and geopolitical stability with Bitcoin ETFs already cementing their place as a mainstream investment vehicles. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and crypto funds have raked in inflows for 10 consecutive weeks, adding $1.24 billion recently and pushing year-to-date totals to $15 billion. Despite holiday lulls and global jitters, investors are seizing the pullback as a buying opportunity—not a sell signal. Bitcoin attracted $1.11 billion in weekly capital inflows, boosting its monthly total to $2.37 billion and year-to-date haul to $12.7 billion—backed by nearly $152 billion in assets under management, according to CoinShares data . Therefore, these metrics paint a bullish Bitcoin picture as more institutional and retail investors continue jumping on the BTC bandwagon. Bitcoin’s Illiquid Supply Ballons Bitcoin’s illiquid supply—the portion of coins held in wallets that rarely move—is now 14.37 million BTC, up from roughly 13.9 million BTC at the start of the year, reflecting a rise of 470,000 BTC YTD. This means over 72 percent of the circulating Bitcoin supply—approximately 19.8 million BTC—is now effectively “off‑market,” held by long‑term investors and cold wallets. That’s a historic peak in illiquid supply, driven by two reinforcing trends: What’s Driving the Surge? Record Accumulation in Recent Months Over the past 30 days, around 180,000 BTC moved into illiquid wallets—the strongest monthly shift since December 2022. “Whales & sharks” (entities holding 10–10,000 BTC) added 83,000 BTC, while small retail investors offloaded a few hundred. Institutions & ETFs Mopping Up Corporate treasuries and U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are absorbing newly mined BTC almost as fast as they’re released, sometimes even exceeding miner issuance. As a result, what little liquid supply remains is being hoarded or locked away. Why It Matters Reduced sell‑side pressure: With fewer BTC on exchanges, sudden demand surges can trigger sharp price moves. Heightened scarcity: As more coins become illiquid, a supply “squeeze” becomes increasingly likely, bolstered by the upcoming mining reward halving in 2028. Maturing market: The shift toward long-term holding echoes Bitcoin’s evolution as a “digital gold” rather than speculative asset. Outlook This rising illiquid supply trend—a bellwether of investor conviction—may predispose Bitcoin toward sustained upward momentum. While cyclical pullbacks remain possible, fewer coins available for trading mean any demand spike might outsizedly impact price. Conclusion Bitcoin’s illiquid supply topping 14 million BTC underscores a market dominated by conviction, not speculation. With whales, institutions, and treasuries continuing to accumulate, the tightening float points to mounting scarcity, setting the stage for potentially bullish price dynamics in the months ahead. This coupled with Bitcoin’s ETF and capital inflows going through the roof have the potential of sending the apex cryptocurrency to a new all-time high (ATH) above with the present price being $107,104.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9721/bitcoin-et-fs-notch-1-b-weekly-inflow-extending-10-week-streak,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T14:46:48,"Billionaire Hedge Fund Manager Puts Bitcoin in His Fantastic 40 List for the Next 5 Years","Billionaire Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, has included Bitcoin in his “Fantastic 40,” a handpicked list of what he considers the top investment opportunities for the next five years. Key Takeaways: Billionaire hedge fund manager Philippe Laffont named Bitcoin among his top investments for the next five years. Laffont projects Bitcoin’s market cap could surpass $5 trillion by 2030, driven by reduced volatility. Laffont says he regrets waiting, calling Bitcoin a missed opportunity he now takes seriously. The hedge fund billionaire ranked Bitcoin alongside Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta, notably excluding Apple and Google from his top five. Speaking with CNBC , Laffont admitted to having long overlooked Bitcoin, despite its continued price strength. “I wake up every day at three in the morning and I’m like, ‘why am I such an idiot? What have I been waiting for, not being involved in it?’” he said. “Sometimes you have to change your mind and say, ‘I made a mistake.’” Bitcoin Market Cap to Double by 2030: Laffont Despite not yet owning Bitcoin, Laffont projects its market cap could more than double to over $5 trillion by 2030, putting it in the same league as tech giants. He expects Microsoft to hit a $5.7 trillion valuation and Nvidia to reach $5.6 trillion within the same timeframe. “I thought of like the market cap of the world [and] the net worth of the world is, I think $450 to $500 trillion, equities are let’s say $120 trillion, gold above and under the ground is $20 trillion,” he said. Part of his revised outlook stems from Bitcoin’s maturing volatility. “It seems its volatility as an asset class is coming down,” he noted, comparing it to the Nasdaq’s risk profile. He also cited the de-dollarization trend and the potential decline of U.S. financial dominance as tailwinds for Bitcoin’s rise. Notably, Laffont is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Likewise, crypto analyst Scott Melker has said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure. Hedge Funds Remain Skeptical of Bitcoin’s Future Despite growing interest in Bitcoin, not everyone in traditional finance is convinced of its long-term staying power. As reported, Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific, has said that many hedge funds remain skeptical about Bitcoin’s long-term viability, believing it may lose momentum after the Trump administration. While Trump’s support for Bitcoin has boosted sentiment, others, including JAN3’s Samson Mow, warn that enthusiasm could fade under a different administration. Semler Scientific already holds 4,449 BTC and plans to hit 10,000 by year-end.

2025-06-26T14:39:49,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Holds Steady At $107,000 As Ceasefire Brings Relief","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its gains for a fourth consecutive day before registering a marginal decline. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has held above $107,000, with analysts favoring a breakout to $110,000. BTC is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $107,077. Price action stabilized after tensions in the Middle East eased and the Fed held interest rates steady. GameStop Raises $450M For Potential Bitcoin Buy GameStop shareholders are unimpressed despite raising another $450 million as part of its private convertible note offering for investments, potentially including Bitcoin. The videogame retailer disclosed in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that an individual who opted into the initial $2.25 billion note offering intended to purchase an additional $450 million. GameStop has earmarked the funds for general corporate purposes, including investments and potential acquisitions. While the firm did not mention Bitcoin , it has discussed plans to grow its treasury. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $107,000. If GameStop used the entire $450 million to purchase Bitcoin, it could double its existing treasury of 4,710 BTC . Several companies are adding Bitcoin to diversify treasury risk and tap into liquidity. However, Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research, believes that only buying Bitcoin isn’t enough. Liu stated, “A Bitcoin treasury rollout requires a well-planned strategy to protect capital and strengthen liquidity because without “clear execution and long-term vision, it’s unlikely to deliver sustained value. It’s not just buying Bitcoin. It’s how and why. Clear strategy and strong execution build trust and attract liquidity, but if it’s just hype or a ‘sell the news’ event like GameStop, the impact will be muted.” Satoshi Era Miners Sold Just 150 BTC In 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) miners have added over 4,000 BTC to their reserves since April. Large miners have been adding to their reserves instead of taking profits despite the flagship cryptocurrency reaching all-time highs. The dramatic change in miner approach was disclosed by new research conducted by CryptoQuant, which highlighted a dramatic decline in “Satoshi-era” miner sales. According to the report, miners are holding on to their assets despite being severely underpaid. CryptoQuant revealed that conditions for miners remain difficult despite BTC trading near all-time highs. “Bitcoin miners are the most underpaid they have been in the last year as daily revenues decline to two-month lows. The Daily revenue fell to $34 million on June 22, the lowest since April 20, 2025, due to lower transaction fees and the recent decline in the price of Bitcoin.” The report states that even the oldest miners are breaking tradition and are unwilling to sell despite burgeoning prices. “Selling from Satoshi-era miners remains at low levels. These miners have sold only 150 Bitcoin so far in 2025, compared to almost 10K Bitcoin in 2024. Historically, old miners from the Satoshi era usually move their coins after a strong price rally, indicating a potential market top.” Wall Street Pours $1B In Bitcoin ETFs Wall Street investors have pumped over $1 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs this week. Bitcoin ETFs hold over 1.2 million Bitcoin as of June 25, adding over 9,700 BTC over the past three days. According to Glassnode, more than half the week’s inflows came on June 25, after reports that President Donald Trump may announce a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell as early as September. The US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback’s strength against foreign currencies, plunged 1.23% since the report, dropping to its lowest levels since April. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a stunning recovery this week after geopolitical tensions dragged it below $100,000 on Sunday. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $98,385 on Sunday before rebounding to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,982. Market sentiment flipped to bullish after President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, BTC rallied over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and end Monday at $105,442. BTC is trading around 3% lower than its all-time high, with analysts expecting continued bullish momentum, which could push the price beyond $110,000. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, stated that markets are showing strength. He also said that open interest suggested a possible squeeze at $110,000 before a reversal. “If a pullback ensues, key levels around $106,000 and $104,000 should offer strong support.” BTC also registered surging institutional interest this week, with Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap announcing the purchase of $400 million worth of BTC . The announcement came days after it signed a $1 billion deal to become listed on public markets. Metaplanet also announced the purchase of $133 million worth of BTC , becoming the fifth-largest corporate holder of the asset. The latest acquisitions come after Gamestop purchased $500 million worth of Bitcoin in May. BTC registered a sharp increase on Monday (June 16), reaching an intraday high of $108,939 before settling at $106,808, ultimately registering a rise of 1.18%.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Western District of North Carolina, Jessica Bailey Sowell engaged in the scheme from March 2023 to February 2024. Court records show that she created fraudulent identification documents using compromised personal identifying information (PII) that were obtained through stolen mail, the internet and other sources. Sowell then used the fake documents at banks, hotels and retail stores. Investigators found that she had letters, bank cards and checks belonging to at least 26 victims of identity theft. The 32-year-old was apprehended after a federal search warrant was executed at a hotel room where she was staying. Investigators found a suitcase containing hundreds of mail with various names and addresses and another suitcase with store-tagged merchandise, two handwritten journals with the names and credit information of several individuals and 23 driver’s licenses from different states that show Sowell’s photograph and the PII of the identity theft victims. They also seized from the rental vehicle that Sowell was using a credit card under the name of an ID theft victim, receipts for goods that were bought using the victim’s credit card, an identity card printer, multiple blank identity cards and holographic stickers. Sowell, who is prohibited from possessing firearms, also kept a Taurus G3 9mm handgun in the hotel room. On Monday, she was sentenced to 57 months of jail time followed by five years of supervised release for bank fraud, aggravated identity theft and unlawful possession of a firearm. She was also ordered to pay restitution to her victims in the amount of $47,190.25.

2025-06-26T14:30:20,"Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer","Bitcoin is starting to inch closer toward $110,000 again, recently pushing to an intraday high of $108,116 and now steadily trading above $107,000. Despite the retracement below $99,000 in the past week, Bitcoin’s current price action shows that the broader market is still bullish. Notably, the recent price action in the past 24 hours is beginning to quiet questions about whether Bitcoin has already reached its top for this cycle. The MVRV Z-Score may be offering a clear answer, and it points in a very different direction from what some might expect. MVRV Z-Score Says Bitcoin Has Room To Run According to crypto analyst Doctor Profit, who initially posted an on-chain analysis of Bitcoin on the social media platform X, the MVRV Z-Score indicates that BTC is still far from its cycle top. The MVRV Z-Score is an established on-chain metric used to determine whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Is In And Price Is Headed For $92,000, Analyst Warns As pointed out by the analyst, the current level on the MVRV Z-Score metric is only slightly above 2, which has been a relatively neutral zone since Bitcoin’s creation. Bitcoin only reached its major tops in past cycles when this metric climbed into the red zone and above a value of around 8 and above. The overall Bitcoin price chart shared by Doctor Profit supports this claim. Peaks in the orange MVRV Z-Score line are shown with red shaded zones in the chart below. These red zones have aligned almost perfectly with Bitcoin’s price tops in 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2021. On the other hand, despite the recent surge to new all-time highs in May, the current cycle has yet to push BItcoin’s price into that overheated region. Instead, the chart shows the Z-Score still in a much lower band. This boils down to show that the Bitcoin price could have a very significant upside left. MVRV vs Price: What The Current Setup Means For Bitcoin One detail that stands out in the current cycle is the pattern of lower highs forming in the MVRV Z-Score, as seen in the chart. Unlike in old cycles, where the metric surged into extreme overvaluation zones above 10, the most recent peaks have been noticeably more subdued. This trend could be interpreted as a signal that the market is beginning to mature or that Bitcoin may even already be approaching the peak of its current cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align However, although this pattern is worth keeping an eye on, it is far from conclusive. The only conclusive fact is that Bitcoin’s price has never reached a definitive cycle top until the MVRV Z-Score has pushed into the red zone, which it has yet to do this time around. Although there isn’t a set price peak from the metric, other analysts have offered a wide range of predictions for where it might land. Predictions of Bitcoin price peaks range anywhere from $150,000 to as high as $500,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,740, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-26T14:20:38,"The corporate Bitcoin fever has reached London and is bouncing to Sweden","The corporate Bitcoin fever is spreading fast. What started with Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is now becoming the new boardroom obsession. Firms from Sweden to London are buying Bitcoin for their treasuries, raising millions, and even ditching ETFs for direct holdings. From miners to tech startups, Europe’s Bitcoin moment is turning balance sheets into bullish statements. The trend comes as BTC is looking strong and heading towards reclaiming the $110K mark. Bitcoin lands on EU balance sheets According to reports, Sweden’s Bitcoin Treasury Capital just made its opening move with the purchase of 66 BTC after raising SEK 100 million ($10.5M). Their next move comes in the wake of going public under the ticker BTC on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. Hopping on the momentum, British-listed company Vault Ventures added 1.86 BTC to its stash, bringing the firm’s total to 2.08 BTC. It announced that it had completed fundraising and invested £750,000 in Ethereum and £150,000 in Bitcoin. Vault Ventures also picked up more Ethereum (ETH), doubling down on its crypto-intensive strategy. Then there’s Catenai, now planning to hold a portion of its excess cash in Bitcoin and some in $TAO. The firm is mixing hard money with AI tokens and raising around £1.6 million ($2.2 million) to kick things off. 11 out of 84 (13%) active companies listed on 🇬🇧 UK's Aquis Stock Exchange have BTC exposure or are raising funds to acquire BTC 🤯 If 13% of all worldwide public companies adopt the BTC strategy, we should see around 6,900 public companies adopting the Bitcoin Treasury… pic.twitter.com/Xf3J2SYpSr — NLNico (@btcNLNico) June 25, 2025 NLNico reported that 11 out of 84 (13%) active companies on the UK’s Aquis Stock Exchange have Bitcoin exposure or are raising funds to acquire BTC. He added that if 13% of all worldwide public companies are willing to adopt the Bitcoin strategy , then the market would see around 6,900 companies entering in arena. Michael Saylor’s corporate Bitcoin playbook goes global Another plot twist comes as a literal gold mining company, Bluebird Mining, wants to start mining “digital gold.” Bluebird Mining upgraded its fundraising target to a minimum of £10 million ($13.7 million) to fund a Bitcoin strategy. It announced a £2 million facility and got flooded with offers. In other developments, the Smarter Web Company raised £41.2 million ($56.5 million) via Accelerated Bookbuild to buy more BTC. Finally, Sixty Six Capital Inc. is going all-in on Michael Saylor. It has snapped up another 18.2 Bitcoins and plans to convert its 113 BTC in ETF exposure into direct holdings. Canada-based Neptune Digital Assets also jumped on the wave and shared a Bitcoin treasury update. The company has added 3 BTC since its last update in April and now holds around 404 BTC. However, it also mentioned that it has Solana (SOL) staked and uses the rewards to buy more Bitcoin. As discussions and actions to enter the biggest crypto into their balance sheets are growing, Bitcoin is booming hard. BTC price has jumped by 27% in the last 90 days despite facing global market turbulence. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $107,354 as of press time. The crypto ETF market is also buzzing. June 25 saw Bitcoin ETFs recording a net inflow of $548 million. This marked 12 consecutive days of net inflows Strategy is still the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. It added 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion at an average price of $104,080 per coin from June 9 to June 15, 2025. Then it added another 245 BTC last week. The company’s total Bitcoin holdings have now grown to approximately 592,345 BTC. MSTR share price has seen a major boom as it jumped by a massive 166% in the last year to hit $388.67 as of press time.

Also, only crypto that is kept on big U.S. crypto websites (that are watched by the government) will count.</p><p>Impact on the Real Estate Market</p><ul><li><p>Increased Buying Power:
Homebuyers holding crypto (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) can now leverage these assets as collateral or part of their financial profile, potentially expanding their purchasing power.</p></li><li><p>Greater Market Demand:
With more liquidity options for crypto investors, especially millennials and Gen Z, who hold significant crypto wealth, there could be heightened demand for homes—particularly in tech-centric urban markets.</p></li><li><p>Potential Price Inflation:
As demand grows from crypto holders newly empowered to enter or upgrade in the housing market, home prices could experience upward pressure.</p></li></ul><p>Impact on the Loan Market</p><ul><li><p>New Loan Products:
Financial institutions may introduce innovative mortgage and loan products tailored specifically for crypto holders, bridging traditional finance and digital assets.</p></li><li><p>Expanded Borrower Base:
Lenders could access a wider pool of qualified borrowers previously overlooked due to their assets primarily held in crypto.</p></li><li><p>Changing Risk Models:
Banks and lenders will need new risk-assessment frameworks to manage crypto’s inherent volatility, potentially affecting interest rates, lending conditions, and collateral requirements.</p></li><li><p>Market Competition:
Traditional lenders might face increased competition from fintech firms or DeFi platforms offering crypto-backed mortgages or lending solutions.</p></li></ul><p>Impact on the Crypto Market</p><ul><li><p>Legitimization and Mainstream Acceptance:
Crypto recognition in mortgage processes strongly enhances legitimacy, making crypto appear as reliable as traditional assets like stocks or bonds.</p></li><li><p>Increased Demand and Liquidity:
As crypto assets become acceptable collateral for real estate, demand could rise, boosting liquidity and potentially increasing crypto valuations.</p></li><li><p>Reduced Volatility (Potentially):
Wider acceptance in major financial transactions (like mortgages) might stabilize some crypto prices, reducing volatility as these assets gain more long-term holders.</p></li><li><p>Regulatory Attention:
Enhanced mainstream adoption could prompt further regulatory scrutiny and clarity, eventually benefiting long-term crypto integration into broader financial systems.</p></li></ul><p>Will this push bitcoin to a new ATH?</p><p>Well, it sure is gonna help it get to a new all time high. Integrating crypto assets into mortgage evaluations represents a significant step toward mainstream financial adoption, potentially reshaping real estate, lending, and cryptocurrency markets with increased liquidity, broader participation, and new market dynamics. So far, the Bitcoin charts still favor the bulls.</p>
