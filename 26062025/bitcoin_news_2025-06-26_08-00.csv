2025-06-26T05:54:33,"Online Bank SoFi Brings Back Crypto Trading, Eyes Cross-Border Blockchain Payments","SoFi Technologies is making a return to the cryptocurrency space, less than a year after stepping away due to regulatory hurdles. Key Takeaways: SoFi has reentered the crypto market with trading, remittances, and future DeFi tools. The platform plans to offer stablecoins, staking, and asset-backed borrowing to users. Regulatory shifts in the U.S. have opened the path for SoFi’s renewed crypto strategy. The US-based online banking platform announced Wednesday that it is reintroducing crypto trading and launching blockchain-based international remittances as part of a broader expansion into digital assets. SoFi users will soon be able to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies through their accounts, with future plans to offer stablecoin products, crypto-backed loans, and staking features. SoFi Plans Asset-Backed Borrowing and Expanded Payment Options The company said it aims to create a more comprehensive digital finance experience by expanding payment options and introducing asset-backed borrowing. CEO Anthony Noto said SoFi is “very excited” to leverage blockchain technology across its operations. The planned remittance service will convert fiat to crypto, transmit funds over blockchain rails, and reconvert them into local fiat on the receiving end. “This is just day one,” Noto said, hinting at long-term plans involving crypto, blockchain, and artificial intelligence to improve financial accessibility and cost-efficiency. SoFi’s crypto reboot coincides with projections of rapid industry growth, with the fintech blockchain market expected to reach $49 billion by 2030, up from $3.4 billion in 2024, according to Insider. The firm’s Galileo platform will support third-party crypto infrastructure, including wallets and custody services, positioning SoFi as a serious contender in the expanding digital finance ecosystem. Very excited about the innovation we can drive via blockchain and crypto across our businesses. @Sofi ‘s planned new international payments (frequently called remittances) will convert fiat to crypto, transmit via blockchain, and convert to local fiat. It's only day 1 of the type… https://t.co/KIIyXMEHJo — Anthony Noto (@anthonynoto) June 25, 2025 SoFi exited the crypto space in late 2023 after securing its bank charter, agreeing to the withdrawal under tighter regulatory conditions. However, recent shifts in Washington, such as advancing stablecoin legislation and the Federal Reserve’s rollback of “reputational risk” assessments, have opened the door for traditional banks to work more closely with crypto firms. Shares of SoFi Technologies (SOFI) have climbed roughly 12% over the past week, reflecting renewed investor interest in its pivot back to crypto-enabled services. Venture Capital Backing For Crypto Payment Services on the Rise Earlier this year, crypto payment firm RedotPay closed a $40 million Series A funding round , led by Lightspeed with key investments from HSG, Galaxy Ventures, and other prominent investors including DST Global Partners, Accel, and Vertex Ventures. RedotPay’s funding round came shortly after crypto payments firm Mesh raised $82 million in a Series B funding round to expand its blockchain-based settlement network globally. The round was led by Paradigm, with participation from ConsenSys, QuantumLight, Yolo Investments, Evolution VC, Hike Ventures, Opportuna, and AltaIR Capital. Notably, most of the investment was settled using PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin, highlighting the growing role of stablecoins in financial transactions. Venture capital firms are increasingly backing projects focused on stablecoin services and financial infrastructure. The sector’s potential was further underscored by payments giant Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion last year, signaling strong institutional interest in blockchain-based financial solutions.

2025-06-26T05:32:01,"US Government Opens Door to Crypto Backed Mortgages","The United States is making major strides toward integrating cryptocurrency into mainstream financial policy. This is a major shift in federal housing finance and aligns with President Donald Trump’s vision of positioning the US as a leader in crypto innovation. Only cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated centralized exchanges will be considered to ensure compliance. On the other hand, the UK is tightening restrictions. Barclays announced a ban on crypto purchases via its credit cards, due to consumer protection concerns. On the legislative front, Senator Cynthia Lummis is very optimistic that two key crypto bills — the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts — could pass by year-end. Overall, these developments shed some light on growing divergence in regulatory approaches between the US and UK during a time of global institutional adoption of digital assets. FHFA Backs Crypto for Home Loans The US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals for recognizing cryptocurrency as a form of asset in mortgage loan risk assessments. In a letter that was issued Wednesday, FHFA director William J. Pulte instructed the two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to explore incorporating crypto holdings into risk assessments for single-family mortgage loans without requiring conversion of those assets into US dollars. This is a big shift in federal housing policy, as digital assets have typically not been factored into traditional mortgage evaluations unless liquidated into fiat currency. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under federal conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis, and are key players in the US housing finance system. Their ability to purchase mortgages from lenders has long helped maintain liquidity and stability in the housing market. Pulte explained that the move comes after extensive study and aligns with President Donald Trump's vision of positioning the US as a global hub for crypto innovation. Importantly, Pulte’s letter specifies that only cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated centralized exchanges and subject to relevant laws should be considered. This cautious approach ensures regulatory compliance while acknowledging the growing role of crypto in the financial ecosystem. The decision was made amid broader trends indicating increasing institutional acceptance of digital assets as legitimate collateral. JPMorgan , for instance, is preparing to let some of its wealth management clients use crypto-based financial products like Bitcoin ETFs as collateral for financing. Additionally, Coinbase Derivatives and clearinghouse Nodal Clear are planning to make Circle’s USDC stablecoin eligible as collateral for futures trading beginning next year. While crypto-backed mortgages are still a niche offering, their use is expanding. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Bitcoin lending platform Ledn, said that many crypto investors have successfully leveraged Bitcoin and Ethereum to purchase property without having to sell their holdings. Barclays Blocks Crypto Credit Card Purchases While US financial institutions might be opening up to crypto, Barclays, one of the United Kingdom’s leading banks, will begin blocking cryptocurrency transactions made through its Barclaycard credit cards starting Friday. This is due to the inherent risks tied to digital assets. The bank stated that the move is driven by concerns over the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies and the lack of regulatory protections for consumers. According to a notice on its website, Barclays stated that falling crypto prices could leave customers in unmanageable debt, especially given that crypto assets are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if something goes wrong. A notice of Barclays website Barclays allowed crypto purchases via its credit cards since at least 2018, giving customers access to crypto markets through major exchanges. Their latest announcement is a huge reversal in policy from a bank that services over five million credit card accounts in the UK. The ban comes during a time of broader debate in the UK over whether additional restrictions should be imposed on using credit to purchase cryptocurrencies. On May 2, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a discussion paper seeking feedback on whether these kinds of transactions should face tighter controls. The Payments Association, a London-based group representing the payments industry, responded critically to the FCA’s suggestion by arguing that it unfairly likens crypto investments to gambling. They pointed out that consumers should have the autonomy to make informed financial decisions within existing credit limits. The Payments Association also mentioned that credit card restrictions already exist for high-risk investments, including crypto. In some cases, banks even block cash purchases of crypto, making credit cards a last resort for some users. However, buying digital assets with a credit card can come at a steep cost. Bankrate reports that many credit card issuers categorize these transactions as cash advances, which often result in higher fees and interest rates. GENIUS and CLARITY Acts Gain Momentum Part of the reason why the US is warming up to crypto could be its recent regulatory progress. In fact, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis said she expects Congress to pass two major crypto bills related to stablecoins and digital asset market structure by the end of 2025. At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Lummis shared some details about the ongoing progress of the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act in the House of Representatives and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in the Senate. While she hopes the legislation will pass before the end of this calendar year, she stated she would be “extremely disappointed” if they were not passed by 2026. Lummis chairs the Senate Banking Committee’s digital asset subcommittee, and acknowledged the political difficulty of securing bipartisan support for crypto bills. At a hearing on Tuesday, she pointed out concerns that legislation might benefit individuals with connections to the current administration. She believes it is very important to ensure both sides of the aisle feel involved in the process to avoid partisan resistance. While some Democrats have supported crypto-related legislation, including the GENIUS Act — which passed the Senate with 68 votes, 18 from Democrats — others are still a bit hesitant . Their concerns center around President Donald Trump’s growing involvement in the crypto sector, including his issuance of meme coins, his ties to the crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and political donations from digital asset industry executives. The path to passage in the House is still uncertain. Lummis’s timeline contrasts with that of Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, He predicted in May that the GENIUS Act could be ready before the congressional recess in August. Trump is also ready to sign the bill without amendments if it passes swiftly through the House. However, with Republicans holding only a slim majority, both the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts will need at least some Democratic support to move forward.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9711/us-government-opens-door-to-crypto-backed-mortgages,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Donald Trump’s Shortlist Just Dropped appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tensions between Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell are heating up again. With Powell’s term set to end in May 2026, Trump is reportedly thinking about announcing a replacement much earlier. According to Wall Street Journal journalist Nick Timiraos , Trump is frustrated with how slowly the Fed is cutting interest rates. However, naming someone too early could backfire, as that person might face more public pressure and be less likely to get the job in the end. Who is the Next FED Chair? SCOOP: As President Trump remains furious at Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he has started deliberating to make his choice of chair and announce it to the world months before Powell's term ends. On the rise in his considerations for Fed Chair are loyalists but with their own… — Brian Schwartz (@schwartzbWSJ) June 25, 2025 While Trump hasn’t officially named his pick, he said during a NATO summit press conference that he’s narrowed it down to “three or four people.” Among the top contenders are known Trump loyalists: Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, Chris Waller, and David Malpass. Additionally, Scott Bessent is being pushed as a strong candidate. These candidates are seen as more likely to support Trump’s push for faster rate cuts and stronger economic growth. [post_titles_links postid=”474867″] Can Trump Fire Jerome Powell ? Even though Trump has hinted at firing Powell, it’s not that simple. A recent Supreme Court ruling confirmed that the Fed operates differently from other government agencies, which means Powell’s job is more secure. During his first term, Trump also thought about removing Powell but backed off after markets reacted badly. This time, he’s been more open, even posting online that he “might change [his] mind” about firing him. A Battle Over FED Interest Rates The disagreement between Trump and Powell mainly revolves around interest rates and inflation. Trump wants the Fed to cut rates to help the economy grow, but Powell is holding firm, saying Trump’s tariff plans could drive up prices. With only 11 months left in Powell’s term, the decision on who leads the Fed next could have a big impact on the U.S. economy, especially if Trump returns to the White House. In short, Trump wants change at the top of the Fed, but legal limits, market reactions, and careful timing could make that tricky.

Trump wants faster interest rate cuts for economic growth, while Powell prioritizes stable prices, citing concerns that Trump’s tariffs could fuel inflation.

The market is now betting on a convergence of two trends: dovish Fed commentary and retail’s accelerating rotation into digital assets, traders say. “Crypto will continue its bullish trend,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “Institutional purchases are picking up, and Jerome Powell’s comments hinting at rate cuts have flipped investor sentiment quickly.” Powell this week said rate adjustments remain on the table, contingent on successful trade deals and softening inflation, words that markets took as code for a late-2025 pivot. At press time, bitcoin was trading over $107,800, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Ether ETH is holding at $2,480 with a 1.8% gain. Solana’s SOL SOL, dogecoin DOGE, XRP XRP and BNB Chain’s BNB BNB showed gains under 1%, but could be next to move if BTC and ETH prices further recover. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich said that the overall market capitalization had previously dipped below its 200-day moving average and rebounded sharply, “confirming that level as new support.” Bitcoin also reclaimed its 50-day average, signaling that momentum may accelerate if sentiment holds, he noted, adding that BTC remains about 5% below its recent highs and is lagging behind traditional tech benchmarks, such as the Nasdaq 100, which has just hit fresh all-time highs. “If crypto-related equities maintain this pace, they may soon catch up with traditional finance,” he said. Meanwhile, underlying demand is strengthening. eToro data shows U.S. retail investors are increasing crypto exposure amid a weakening dollar and rising global uncertainty, with 58% reportedly rebalancing their portfolios to favor digital assets.

2025-06-26T05:00:44,"Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Attracting Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors Away From Solana and Litecoin","Analysts are closely watching MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential breakout candidate, with many drawing parallels between its current trajectory and the historic rallies of Solana and Litecoin. This article explores why experts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could mirror the explosive growth of these established cryptocurrencies, and what each project brings to the evolving crypto landscape. The Rise of Solana and Litecoin Solana has become a standout performer in the crypto market, recently surging more than 40% toward the $200 milestone. Its rally is driven by strong technical indicators—such as bullish EMA crossovers and clearing of key resistance levels—alongside robust on-chain activity and rising institutional interest. Solana’s ecosystem continues to expand, with increasing use in payments and stablecoin settlement, solidifying its position as a top-tier Layer 1 blockchain. However, as Solana’s market cap grows, analysts note that the potential for massive early-stage returns diminishes, prompting investors to seek new, high-upside opportunities. Litecoin, often dubbed “digital silver,” is experiencing a resurgence in 2025. With reduced transaction fees, a strong history of reliability, and renewed interest from ETF-related speculation, Litecoin is attracting both long-term holders and traders looking for stability with upside potential. Its price hovers around $85, supported by healthy trading volumes and a loyal user base. Like Solana, Litecoin is considered a blue-chip asset, but its growth prospects are now seen as more incremental compared to early-stage projects. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a focal point for investors seeking the next big asymmetric return. Analysts highlight several reasons for its bullish outlook: Scarcity-Driven Model: MAGACOIN FINANCE features a capped supply (ranging from 100 billion to 170 billion tokens, depending on the source), with a significant portion reserved for presale. This scarcity is designed to drive demand as the project matures. Transparency and Security: The project’s smart contracts have been audited by HashEx, providing confidence to investors wary of the risks common in meme and presale tokens. Community and Narrative: MAGACOIN FINANCE has cultivated a hyper-engaged community and leverages a politically charged narrative, which resonates with investors seeking alternatives to traditional crypto assets. Its rapid presale sellouts and growing holder base signal strong grassroots momentum. Early-Stage Upside: With the token still priced under $0.01 and not yet listed on major exchanges, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the kind of early entry point that historically precedes massive rallies. Analysts project potential returns of 25x to 50x or more, with some models even suggesting the possibility of a $1 valuation if momentum continues. Strategic Capital Rotation As Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilize at higher price levels, investors are rotating capital into established altcoins like Litecoin and high-upside presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. This trend reflects a broader market strategy: balancing reliable blue-chip exposure with the asymmetric return potential of early-stage tokens. Analysts see MAGACOIN FINANCE as uniquely positioned to benefit from this rotation. Its combination of scarcity, transparency, and community-driven growth mirrors the early days of Solana and Litecoin, but with the added advantage of being in its infancy. As the crypto market matures, the window for transformative gains narrows—making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the few remaining opportunities for investors seeking to replicate the massive rallies of previous cycles. In summary MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention not just for its novelty, but for its structural strengths and strategic timing. With Solana and Litecoin serving as both inspiration and cautionary benchmarks, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands at the intersection of community enthusiasm , scarcity, and early-stage potential—making it a compelling candidate for the next big crypto rally.

2025-06-26T05:00:31,"Bitcoin Eyes $120K? Analyst Reveals What Comes After BTC’s 50-Day EMA Breakout","Bitcoin has resumed its upward movement, maintaining strength above the $107,000 level as market momentum builds toward the asset’s recent all-time high above $111,000. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $107,242, reflecting a 1.3% gain over the past 24 hours and a 2.7% rise in the past week. The market’s rebound comes after a brief dip last weekend, suggesting that investor confidence remains resilient heading into the next potential leg up. Contributing to the bullish outlook, CryptoQuant analyst İbrahim COŞAR recently highlighted Bitcoin’s successful reclaim of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which he described as a key level to track for short-term price trends. Related Reading: Fast-Tracking A Bitcoin Rally: Expert Identifies 3 Bullish Catalysts Bitcoin Reclaims Key Technical Level, Eyes $120K Potential According to COŞAR, the 50-day EMA often acts as dynamic support during corrections, and regaining this level typically precedes a price rally. In past cycles, similar conditions have led to gains between 10% to 20% shortly after the level was reclaimed. COŞAR further noted that Bitcoin’s reclaim of the 50-day EMA occurred after a short-lived breakdown, which was quickly reversed with three consecutive daily closes above the level. This technical setup mirrors previous instances that preceded substantial upward moves. COŞAR also cautioned that while the technical structure favors continued gains, geopolitical uncertainties, especially involving the US, Israel, and Iran, could introduce sudden volatility. As a result, he advised market participants to avoid leveraged positions in the short term and remain prepared for potential price swings. COŞAR wrote: That said, geopolitical developments—particularly any positive or negative news involving the U.S., Israel, and Iran—could trigger sudden volatility in BTC’s price. Please avoid using leverage during this period and remain cautious in the face of potential market swings. Further Into Technicals: Analyst Points to Bullish Flag Adding to the conversation, independent crypto analyst Captain Faibik suggested that Bitcoin’s price pattern is forming a bullish flag, a common continuation pattern in technical analysis. According to Faibik, while the structure indicates a likely breakout, a final corrective dip to the $97,000–$98,000 range may occur before upward momentum resumes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall He emphasized that a confirmed breakout above the $108,000 resistance would be a key signal, potentially setting the stage for a mid-term target of $130,000. $BTC is currently forming Bullish flag Pattern, but there’s a chance we could see one more correction before the massive Bullish Rally begins..

2025-06-26T04:39:11,"Profitability Metrics Reveal Diverging Sentiment Across Top Cryptocurrencies","Fresh on-chain data that keeps track of the percentage of total supply in profit provides a revealing look into the health and sentiment of the crypto market’s largest players. This metric approximates what part of a cryptocurrency’s circulating supply is currently held at a profit (the current market price is higher than the average price at which holders acquired their tokens). The new data comes from Glassnode, a crypto analytics firm that provides on-chain insight into the market. The information reveals that Bitcoin and Ethereum lead by a wide margin, with the vast majority of their holders comfortably in the green. In the meantime, coins such as Cardano and Chainlink are lagging behind, with more than half of their supply underwater. These figures not only indicate the market’s current dynamics but also suggest possible directions for future price action. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead With High Confidence—And Some Caution At the top of the list, with a staggering 94.5% of its circulating supply currently in profit, is bitcoin. This means that nearly 19 out of every 20 BTC in existence is held by someone who purchased it at a price lower than that of today. Such a percentage is rather indicative of strong market confidence. Most holders are in the green and very likely maintaining their positions in the face of minor price dips. Ethereum is not far behind; 88.7% of its supply is in profit. When one looks at the numbers for BTC and ETH together, they depict a scene where the market has handsomely rewarded both long-term holders and late-cycle buyers. Historically, moments of this kind have coincided with periods of high momentum and bullish sentiment. Nonetheless, there’s a catch. When profit-taking becomes widespread—and in nearly all cases, the nearly all holders are sitting on gains—that very fact leads to increased selling pressure. Not a guaranteed trigger for a correction, of course, but such metrics are often viewed as a signal that the local market could be reaching a top, especially if momentum is fading or adverse macroeconomic conditions are emerging. Mid-Tier Coins Show Mixed Sentiment and Slower Recovery XRP and Dogecoin further down the list take on a more moderate look. XRP has 65.1% of its supply in profit, and Dogecoin follows closely at 64.7%. These two figures suggest that a majority of holders are in the green, but a significant portion—roughly one in three—are still waiting to break even or return to profitability. The split profile underscores a much less even performance during the past several market cycles. The two assets have seen their share of wild volatility and hype thanks to the media, but haven’t consistently managed to generate (or maintain) the upward price movement that seems (or seemed) baked into the price forecasts for Bitcoin or Ethereum. The middle-ground profitability of these mid-cap crypto assets could be an inflection point for investors in them. They seem almost to be on the verge of being profitable, yet they are under far less immediate profit-taking pressure than Bitcoin and Ethereum. If the mid-cap assets have a rally, that confidence that was restored in 2020 could very quickly see sidelined capital re-engaging with these assets. Cardano and Chainlink Hold the Most “Underwater” Supply Chainlink and Cardano are at the lower end of the list. Only 59.4% of LINK’s supply is in profit, and just 46.5% of ADA’s—meaning that more than half of Cardano’s holders are currently sitting at a loss. These numbers reflect a more bearish sentiment, and that indeed holds for a few cryptos right now . . . an amount of frustration over the long term growing among the holders who bought during the previous peaks. But this could position ADA and LINK as potential high-reward plays when the market again moves into a bullish phase, which is certainly not being ruled out at this point. When a lower percent of supply is in profit, it also suggests that the market might be in some form of seller exhaustion, where the weak hands have already dumped their holdings and the remainder of the market is long-term bullish. Additionally, with such a large portion of the supply held at a loss, there is less incentive for immediate profit-taking during a price recovery. This leaves more room for a sustained uptick in prices once demand comes back. Here is the Percent of Total Supply in Profit for six top-cap cryptocurrencies. This metric tracks the percentage of each asset’s circulating supply currently held at a profit (meaning the market price is higher than the average on-chain acquisition price). As of the latest… pic.twitter.com/2jBKekDMnH — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 24, 2025 Even though Bitcoin and Ethereum may appear to be artificially inflated at present, cryptocurrencies like Cardano might be more promising simply because today’s prices may not be reflective of their true value. The reason for this is that today’s prices for Cardano—and other similar coins—are also significantly lower than their all-time highs. Conclusion The metric of the Percent of Supply in Profit is more than just a historical snapshot. It offers a psychological map of the market. Right now, Bitcoin and Ethereum are both flying high. This is good for sentiment but raises caution flags around potential corrections. As for the mid-tier assets like XRP and Dogecoin, they strike a more balanced appearance when it comes to the outlook. Finally, these two projects, Cardano and Chainlink, look beaten down in the market. But there’s potential there—in terms of a recovery that could happen. Overall, this is a snapshot of the current landscape. With the crypto market moving tentatively toward what could be the next bull cycle, these profitability levels will be very important to watch. They furnish not just data but also insights into how likely each asset is to run into resistance, find support, or completely break out. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-26T04:36:00,"Metaplanet Scoops Up 1,234 More BTC, Holdings Reach 12,345","Metaplanet has added another 1,234 Bitcoin to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to 12,345 BTC, as the Japanese firm continues to ramp up its ambitious digital asset strategy. The latest acquisition, confirmed in a filing on Thursday, reflects the company’s ongoing pivot toward Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The purchase adds to a string of high-profile moves by Metaplanet this month, including the launch of its sweeping “555 Million Plan,” aimed at raising $5.4b to buy 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027. That figure would represent roughly 1% of the cryptocurrency’s fixed 21m supply. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,234 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 12,345 BTC* pic.twitter.com/ppeGIrfVfe — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 26, 2025 With 54M New Shares Issued, Metaplanet Intensifies Its Push To Corner 1% Of Bitcoin’s Total Supply On June 24, Metaplanet announced it had raised more than $517m on the first day of the 555m Plan through the issuance of 54m shares. That equity was exercised by EVO Fund under an earlier stock acquisition rights agreement. Thursday’s filing reveals that Metaplanet acquired Bitcoin at an average price of ¥15,617,281 per BTC, which translates to about $107,900. The scale of the latest buy cements Metaplanet’s position as one of the largest public corporate holders of Bitcoin in Asia. At current prices, the company’s Bitcoin treasury is worth over $1.3b, according to market trackers. Its holdings are now roughly equivalent to what Tesla held at peak before selling a portion in 2022. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Bet Channels MicroStrategy’s Playbook as Shares Surge The company’s strategy mirrors that of US-based MicroStrategy, which has turned Bitcoin accumulation into a long-term balance sheet strategy. Like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet has pursued equity-linked funding tools to fuel its BTC acquisitions, positioning the stock as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure in traditional capital markets. Since announcing its Bitcoin pivot in April 2024, Metaplanet’s shares have surged more than 500%, drawing interest from both retail traders and global investors looking for regulated exposure to the cryptocurrency. The firm, originally a hospitality business, has rebranded its market identity around Bitcoin in recent months, even naming the strategy a “corporate awakening.” While Metaplanet has not commented on specific future purchase timelines, it has outlined a clear target: to hold more than 200,000 BTC within three years. The company has stated that 96% of all funds raised under the 555M Plan will be allocated toward Bitcoin acquisition, with the remainder used for bond redemptions and yield strategies. With each major purchase, Metaplanet is tightening its alignment with Bitcoin’s long-term thesis as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.

2025-06-26T04:30:44,"Analysts Reveal MAGACOIN FINANCE Quietly Gaining Momentum Among Ethereum and Bitcoin Traders Eyeing Uniswap","Ethereum and Bitcoin Traders Are Broadening Their Horizons Veteran holders of Ethereum and Bitcoin are beginning to reallocate capital as 2025 unfolds. With Ethereum fluctuating around key resistance zones and Bitcoin consolidating post-rally, many traders are adopting a diversified strategy. Instead of relying solely on large-cap momentum, they are identifying promising altcoin entries that offer untapped growth potential. One project standing out in this shift is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a lesser-known altcoin that is beginning to gain traction among serious crypto investors. These early movements are not hype-driven but rather based on structural fundamentals and trader behavior. With both Ethereum and Bitcoin experiencing more modest upside expectations this quarter, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s positioning is drawing sharper focus. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Quiet Accumulation That’s Gaining Traction Unlike previous meme projects that exploded purely off viral hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been building under the radar — and building strong. The project has locked its supply at 170 billion tokens, eliminating dilution risks and giving investors clarity on long-term valuation frameworks. More notably, the code has passed a HashEx audit, boosting confidence among institutional-style traders. Staking has recently gone live, with early participation indicating that buyers are entering with long-term intent. Wallet activity suggests that new entrants are locking tokens rather than flipping them — a critical indicator of healthy market structure. This has led analysts to describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as more than a speculative trade; it’s becoming a strategic hold. Additional elements that are reinforcing investor interest: Token ownership is fully decentralized, with no VC override or insider control. The staking system is live, rewarding early adopters and encouraging retention. A 100% bonus is currently available for new investors using a limited-time access link. Momentum is no longer speculative. On-chain data is showing organic wallet growth, stable concentration patterns, and a healthy transition from early traders to long-term holders. Analysts believe this shift is what separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from earlier meme cycles. Uniswap Watch: A DEX Favorite with Growing Expectations Uniswap recently became the first decentralized exchange (DEX) to surpass $3 trillion in total trading volume, cementing its dominance in the DeFi sector. The platform currently processes around $3.3 billion in daily volume and holds a 23% market share among DEXs, with PancakeSwap trailing at 21%. Despite this achievement, Uniswap’s total value locked (TVL) has fallen below $5 billion, mirroring a broader contraction in DeFi TVL since 2021. Final Thoughts: Positioning for What Comes Next As Bitcoin and Ethereum take a breather and Uniswap awaits a technical breakout, investors are recalibrating for upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a surprising favorite — with fundamentals, participation, and smart tokenomics supporting its momentum. For those seeking an early edge ahead of wider exposure, this project may offer one of the more compelling entry points of the 2025 altcoin market.

More about Moca Chain Moca Chain is more than layer1 protocols like Ethereum and Solana. It is an EVM-compatible, chain-agnostic, modular blockchain for data and identity management. Moca Chain deeply integrates ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) to allow its users to prove the legitimacy of anything without exposing the underlying data. That model guarantees privacy-preserving verification, which is crucial as simple data loss could lead to substantial financial losses as fraudsters dominate the digital assets space. Moca Chain focuses on self-sovereign identity, enabling apps and individuals to manage and move verified data across various platforms without depending on centralized entities. AIR Kit: the gateway to Animoca’s new identity layer The AIR Kit toolset is at the core of Animoca Chain, aiming to streamline user onboarding. It is the entry point for users and developers, linking them to a platform of user-centric apps and identity protocols. The announcement highlighted: We’re building the world’s largest identity network with AIR Kit as the entry point to Moca Chain, where identity protocols and user-centric apps can build on and share a common network of data, users, and applications.

MOCA’s rise is beyond speculative hype – driven by bullish prospects as the altcoin anticipates surged use cases. The token will handle various activities on the Moca Chain, including gas payments, incentivizing validators, staking, and possibly governance. That means impressive demand for MOCA as the Moca network grows, especially as more dApps and identity protocols migrate to this identity-centric L1.

In the last 24 hours, its price has jumped over 19% to $0.63, with trading volume soaring 153% to $285.65 million. The coin has also climbed to the 1 spot on the trending crypto list. According to analyst Kim H. Wong , this surge is an important milestone for Pi Coin, especially with Pi2Day just three days away. The event is expected to bring updates on the project’s progress, ecosystem growth, and AI integration. If Pi breaks above the $0.65 resistance, it could quickly rise to the $0.80 to $1 range. With its all-time high at $3 and a recent low of $0.40, Pi Coin still has room to move higher. Source: Coingecko Analyst Joe Swanson added that this breakout is happening exactly as he expected, and it might be the beginning of a longer rally, one that could gain even more strength as Pi2Day 2025 approaches. Technicals Show Bullish Signs for Short-term Pi Network’s charts show a neutral trend overall, but there are signs of short-term strength. Short-term moving averages (10, 20, and 30-day) are mostly showing buy signals, pointing to a possible upward move. However, the longer-term averages (50 and 100-day) are still flashing sell signs, so the long-term trend remains weak for now. What To Expect On Pi2Day? The rally comes as excitement builds around a possible GenAI announcement on June 28. The Core Team is also expected to reveal major ecosystem updates. Whale activity is also driving the price as one wallet has bought over $173M worth of Pi, likely a big institutional player. The community is waiting for the launch of KYC Sync, making it easier for users to link their ID between the Pi App and Browser. This move pushes millions closer to full Mainnet migration. Will A Correction Follow Next? However, some analysts warn that Pi’s recent rally could be short-lived. While hype and technical momentum are driving the surge, a correction may be on the horizon. Additionally, over 268 million PI tokens are set to unlock in July, the biggest release until 2027, which could put downward pressure on the price. Dr. Altcoin recently shared that the recent Israel-Iran ceasefire is a positive signal for Pi. He says that Pi is unlikely to drop below $0.40 and expects a slow rise starting late August as token unlocks decrease.

After significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump’s vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, today I ordered the Great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage. SO ORDERED pic.twitter.com/Tg9ReJQXC3 — Pulte (@pulte) June 25, 2025 In simple terms, this means that if you own crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP, it could be counted as part of your assets when applying for a mortgage backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Why This Matters This is important because it marks the first time U.S. government-supported mortgage firms have officially recognized crypto as a financial asset. Until now, crypto was often seen as too risky or too new for traditional financial products like home loans. Now, with this new rule, it could open the door for millions of crypto holders in the U.S. to use their digital assets to qualify for mortgages. It’s another clear sign that crypto is becoming more mainstream and accepted by big institutions. What’s Next? This move will likely push private banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo to follow suit. If government-backed firms are doing it, the private sector won’t want to be left behind. This could lead to new crypto-related financial products, loans, and services in the near future. There’s also talk of banks launching their own stablecoins and expanding crypto services like trading and custody for their customers.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-your-bitcoin-help-you-qualify-for-a-home-loan-now-trump-just-said-yes/,"BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T04:00:38,"Nasdaq-Listed Tech Firm Approves 20% Crypto Allocation as Part of Treasury Strategy","Aurora Mobile, a Nasdaq-listed technology firm based in China, has unveiled a new corporate strategy that includes investing a portion of its treasury into cryptocurrency assets. On Tuesday, the company announced that its board of directors had approved the allocation of up to 20% of its total cash and cash equivalents toward digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Sui, and others. Treasury Optimization and Strategic Intent The company emphasized that the crypto investment plan is structured to preserve asset value while exploring additional opportunities for strategic partnerships, market expansion, and ecosystem growth. Aurora Mobile clarified that the new investment direction will not interfere with its day-to-day operations or long-term growth strategies. The firm also assured shareholders that sufficient liquidity will be maintained for ongoing operational requirements, and that the digital asset investments are a part of a balanced portfolio approach. According to Aurora’s official press release, this initiative is aimed at enhancing asset diversification by including exposure to cryptocurrencies, which historically exhibit low correlation with traditional markets. Company Chairman and CEO Weidong Luo noted that the move also reflects Aurora’s intent to keep pace with technological advancements in the financial sector . Luo stated that this step signifies a commitment to “modernizing our treasury management practices,” positioning the firm at the convergence of emerging finance and digital infrastructure trends. Founded in 2011, Aurora Mobile specializes in customer engagement and marketing technologies powered by cloud computing and AI. Despite being primarily focused on enterprise software solutions within China, Aurora is increasingly adopting global financial tools as part of its dual-engine growth strategy, which includes market expansion and AI-driven innovation. Implications for the Broader Crypto and Tech Ecosystem Aurora joins a growing number of publicly traded firms exploring digital assets as part of their corporate treasury strategies. While companies like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) , Gamestop, Metaplanet, and Tesla made headlines with sizable Bitcoin allocations, Aurora’s approach appears more diversified, indicating a broader interest in the overall crypto market. This strategy could serve as a signal to other mid-cap tech firms in Asia looking to explore asset diversification through blockchain-based instruments. The timing of Aurora’s move follows the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to roll back controversial accounting guidance (SAB 121), which previously discouraged banks and publicly listed firms from holding crypto assets. That regulatory shift may have contributed to a more favorable environment for corporate entities to allocate funds into digital assets. With China maintaining a ban on retail crypto trading while showing openness toward blockchain development and central bank digital currency (CBDC) trials, Aurora’s decision could reflect a measured form of engagement that aligns with domestic policy frameworks while targeting global financial exposure.

2025-06-26T04:00:08,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment","Following a quick drop to nearly $98,000 over the weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered most of its recent losses and is now trading above $107,000 at the time of writing. Fresh on-chain data suggests that the short-term holder (STH) floor for BTC has been steadily rising toward the $100,000 level. Bitcoin STH Floor Approaching $100,000 According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor unchained, Bitcoin’s STH Realized Price has been making its slow grind up toward the psychologically important $100,000 level. Notably, the analyst had earlier dubbed this metric as the “fault line” to watch. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, the STH Realized Price represents the average price at which all Bitcoin held for less than 155 days was acquired. It acts as both a key psychological and technical support level. When the market price stays above it, STH are in profit and more confident, whereas if it falls below, fear and selling pressure often increase. Currently, the STH Realized Price hovers around $98,000. The analyst notes that each $500 rise in the STH Realized Price effectively resets the “new buyers’ comfort floor.” As this metric nears six figures, the mental stop-loss for newer investors also moves upward. The following chart illustrates two recent instances where BTC bounced sharply after touching the blue STH Realized Price line. This price action suggests a bullish structure, where selling pressure diminishes as soon as BTC revisits its average cost basis. Meanwhile, the premium – the difference between BTC’s spot price and STH Realized Price – currently hovers around 7.2%. A shrinking premium, typically under 10%, has historically signalled reduced market froth and often preceded the next leg up once open interest began to rebuild. On the long-term side, the long-term holder (LTH) Realized Price remains largely unchanged at $32,000, roughly one-third of the STH Realized Price. The analyst observes that these long-term coins are likely held in cold storage, indicating “strong hands” with little incentive to sell. They concluded: The blue line is climbing relentlessly; as long as BTC lives above it, the prevailing tide is still higher-lows, higher-highs. Lose it on a daily close, and we get our first real gut-check since April – otherwise the bull engine is merely cooling its cylinders. Experts Predict New High For BTC As BTC’s STH Realized Price continues to surge higher – resulting in a higher floor price for the digital asset – several crypto experts seem to agree that the cryptocurrency may soon reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months.

2025-06-26T03:41:50,"FHFA Directs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to Evaluate Crypto Assets in Mortgage Risk Assessments","The U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has instructed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals for including cryptocurrencies in their mortgage risk assessments. This move could allow potential homebuyers to use crypto holdings as reserves when applying for a loan—without needing to convert those digital assets into U.S. dollars. FHFA Director William J. Pulte issued the directive via letter on Wednesday, asking both government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to explore how digital currencies might be treated as part of single-family mortgage loan assessments. The letter calls on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to “prepare a proposal for consideration of cryptocurrency as an asset for reserves in their respective single-family mortgage loan risk assessments, without conversion of said cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars.” Historic Shift in Mortgage Criteria This order marks a significant departure from traditional mortgage qualification standards, where crypto assets have typically been excluded unless liquidated into fiat currency. The FHFA has overseen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since the 2008 financial crisis, when both entities were placed under federal conservatorship. Since then, the two have provided vital liquidity and stability in the housing market by purchasing loans from lenders, allowing banks to issue more credit. By considering crypto as part of a borrower’s financial profile, the FHFA aims to modernize underwriting practices in line with broader digital asset adoption. Aligning with Pro-Crypto Policy Goals In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Pulte emphasized that this decision was made “after significant studying” and aligns with former President Donald Trump’s ambition to establish the U.S. as the “crypto capital of the world.” The directive also includes a condition: only cryptocurrencies that are “evidenced and stored on a U.S.-regulated centralized exchange subject to all applicable laws” will be eligible for consideration. This restriction is designed to ensure compliance and reduce risks associated with unregulated crypto markets. Broader Acceptance of Crypto in Finance The FHFA’s order reflects a broader trend of digital assets becoming more integrated into mainstream financial practices in the United States. Recent reports from Cointelegraph note that JPMorgan plans to allow select wealth management clients to use crypto-backed products, such as Bitcoin ETFs, as collateral for financing. In another development, Circle’s USDC stablecoin will soon be eligible collateral for futures trading, through a collaboration between Coinbase Derivatives and Nodal Clear. Crypto-backed mortgage lending, though still niche, has already begun to emerge. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Bitcoin lending platform Ledn, told Cointelegraph that many Bitcoin holders are using digital assets to secure real estate loans without selling their crypto. “Bitcoin holders have used their digital assets as collateral to purchase real estate,” he said. As digital finance continues to evolve, this latest FHFA move signals a shift in how traditional financial institutions might assess and interact with cryptocurrencies going forward.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/fhfa-directs-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-to-evaluate-crypto-assets-in-mortgage-risk-assessments/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

2025-06-26T03:30:43,"Could XRP and Bitcoin Investors Rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE Trigger a VeChain-Like Rally?","A significant capital rotation is underway in the cryptocurrency market, with investors from established assets like XRP and Bitcoin shifting toward emerging projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a primary beneficiary, raising over $10 million in its presale and drawing comparisons to early-stage successes like Shiba Inu. This migration is driven by regulatory uncertainties around XRP and Bitcoin’s slowing momentum, pushing traders toward high-upside opportunities. Why Investors Are Rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE ROI Potential: Analysts project returns of 50x–100x, citing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s capped supply (170 billion tokens), HashEx-audited contracts, and community-driven model. For instance, a $100 investment could yield $6,360 at its $0.007 listing price and up to $909,000 if it reaches $1. Structural Advantages: Unlike VeChain, which targets enterprise solutions, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines meme virality with deflationary tokenomics and staking rewards, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Market Timing: Bitcoin’s consolidation above $105,000 and XRP’s regulatory baggage have accelerated capital reallocation. On-chain data shows “smart money” accumulation in MAGACOIN FINANCE, signaling bullish sentiment. VeChain’s Rally: A Benchmark for MAGACOIN FINANCE? VeChain (VET) surged to a two-year high of $0.726 in late 2024, fueled by enterprise adoption and Bitcoin’s bull run. However, it now faces resistance at $0.03, with recent pullbacks risking its inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Predictions suggest modest 2025 growth to $0.085, constrained by its $120B market cap and regulatory headwinds. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s low entry point ($0.000266 presale) and political branding could amplify its rally potential. Like VeChain in 2021—which saw a 150% surge—MAGACOIN FINANCE leverages scarcity and hype but with greater retail accessibility. Will the Rotation Trigger a VeChain-Like Surge? Similar Catalysts: VeChain’s 2024 rally was partly driven by Bitcoin’s momentum, mirroring MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current tailwinds from crypto’s “altcoin season”. Diverging Fundamentals: VeChain focuses on supply-chain utility, while MAGACOIN FINANCE prioritizes viral growth and staking APY. The latter’s 5000%+ ROI forecasts dwarf VeChain’s 203% projected 2025 return. Risks: VeChain battles resistance and sell-off pressures, whereas MAGACOIN FINANCE’s success hinges on post-listing demand and meme sustainability. Analyst Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE: Targeted for 2000%–5000% gains in 2025, potentially turning $500 into $10,000. VeChain: Conservative $0.085–$0.12 targets by 2025, with longer-term $1–$2 projections by 2040. Conclusion The rotation from XRP and Bitcoin into MAGACOIN FINANCE could indeed ignite a rally reminiscent of VeChain’s 2021 breakout, but with higher upside potential. While VeChain offers steady enterprise-driven growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum, scarcity model, and political narrative position it for explosive, albeit riskier, gains. For investors seeking asymmetric opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a calculated bet on 2025’s altcoin cycle.

2025-06-26T03:15:22,"XRP Price Prediction For June 26","The post XRP Price Prediction For June 26 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has seen bullish energy in recent days, and XRP is no exception. The popular altcoin has now broken above the $2.20 mark and is just 42% away from its previous all-time high (ATH) of $3.84. The question now is: can XRP keep up this pace, or a pullback is coming? XRP Bounces Strong From Key Support After a period of sluggish price action, XRP recently staged a strong rebound from its critical support zone between $1.92 and $1.95. This move was fueled by improving sentiment across the broader crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin and Ethereum turning bullish in the short term. The $2.19 to $2.20 range acted as a stubborn resistance level in recent sessions. Now that XRP has punched through this zone, it’s likely to flip into a new support area, giving bulls a solid platform to aim for higher targets. Next Key Target: $2.30 to $2.35 The next crucial resistance lies between $2.30 and $2.35. If XRP can clear this hurdle, it opens up the path to revisit May’s high around $2.66, and move closer to the $3 mark in the coming weeks. Despite this promising breakout, XRP’s broader trend on the daily chart still shows a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, a classic sign of an ongoing bearish trend. To truly confirm a shift back to a bullish structure, XRP would need to consistently post higher highs, starting with a decisive move above the $2.35 resistance. Short-Term Outlook: Bullish, But Watch the Levels The recent rally from the June 22nd low has already shown a promising three-wave structure to the upside. While this is encouraging, analysts warn that one more dip remains a possibility, especially if the price fails to hold above the $2.08 support zone. A clean five-wave impulsive move, which would typically signal a stronger, more sustainable uptrend, is what experts are hoping to see next.

2025-06-26T03:01:53,"Zak Folkman highlights growing interest in World Liberty Financial's stablecoin","World Liberty Financial Inc., a decentralized finance platform linked to the Trump family, is attracting significant interest from public companies exploring using its token as a treasury asset, according to co-founder Zak Folkman. Speaking at the Permissionless crypto conference in New York on Wednesday, June 25, Folkman also announced the launch of the new World Liberty Financial App. Folkman anticipates USD1 becoming the biggest stablecoin by market cap Crypto treasury firms have become popular since the success of Strategy, the company Michael Saylor leads. The firm has over $60 billion worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet and a market capitalization surging to over $100 billion. Folkman noted that several companies admire Michael Saylor and his accomplishments. This is particularly true of his strategy and his promotion of companies keeping their crypto reserves. Goodfood Market Corp., Semler Scientific Inc ., and Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. are some companies that have revealed plans or started their own efforts to hold cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, companies are changing the Strategy Playbook by using alternative tokens instead of Bitcoin when implementing their plans. For instance, Upexi raised $100 million to purchase the Solana token last week to keep in its treasury, while Sharplink Inc. holds $425 million worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether. Folkman also weighed on the future potential of World Liberty’s USD1 stablecoin, valued at approximately $2.1 billion. Notably, the largest stablecoin is USDT, from Tether, which has about $156.8 billion in circulation. Based on Folkman’s speculations, they have tackled the challenges that a company will encounter, and now it is just a matter of time before USD1 becomes the biggest stablecoin by market cap. He further anticipated that everyone would come to this conclusion when they witness several developments in the upcoming months. With the Genesis Act , one of the main US stablecoin laws, set to pass into law, digital dollar-pegged assets have become even more attractive to investors. Fintech firms adopt the growing trend of launching stablecoins Apart from public companies showing interest in stablecoins, fintech firms have adopted this trend and aim to follow World Liberty Financial’s lead in launching stablecoins. Fiserv announced that it plans to release a stablecoin, amid increasing interest in the token from US companies as the cryptos move toward the mainstream. The announcement followed the US Senate passing a milestone stablecoin bill that analysts said could represent a turning point in the crypto oversight debate and a breakthrough for a sector stuck in regulatory limbo for years. The fintech company said its stablecoin, FIUSD, will be embedded into its existing banking and payments platform by the end of the year. The company added that FIUSD will use stablecoin infrastructure delivered from Paxos and Circle Internet. Shares of Circle, the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin by market value, were up 15%, and Fiserv and PayPal were up 2.3% and 1.7% respectively. Stablecoins are tied to currencies such as the US dollar and are meant to maintain a consistent value from reserves held. Once a niche corner of crypto, they have become popular for their ability to protect from price swings. Fintech companies and traditional banks use stablecoins more frequently to make cross-border payments easier, speed up transactions, and expand access to digital finance. Analysts at TD Cowen mentioned that they view the launch as a sign of Fiserv’s skill in quickly innovating and utilizing its central role between banks and merchants to connect old and new payment systems.

2025-06-26T03:00:42,"Analysts Explain Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Mirror Bitcoin’s Legendary Growth with Ethereum and Polkadot","Ethereum’s Institutional Strength Continues to Grow Ethereum remains one of the strongest names in the market thanks to a blend of institutional demand, ETF traction, and robust network development. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink recently acquired over $460 million in ETH, staking 95% of its holdings—a move that emphasizes long-term conviction. Meanwhile, the Pectra upgrade has enhanced scalability, and open interest in Ethereum futures hit new highs, signaling continued trader engagement. These developments hint at Ethereum’s potential to move past $2,800–$3,000, yet some early-stage investors are starting to shift capital to assets with more explosive upside—like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as the Wild Card of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention for the same reasons early Bitcoin once did—scarcity, clarity, and unwavering community focus. But unlike Bitcoin, which was once seen as a risk, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering a matured crypto landscape with higher expectations and a clearer investor profile. At the core of its appeal is a fixed 170 billion token supply, meaning no dilution or inflation threats. The project is 100% community-owned with zero VC overrides and was recently audited by HashEx, adding a layer of security that most early-stage coins can’t offer. A major bonus offer, PATRIOTS100X , is now active and delivering a compelling incentive for new buyers to enter early. This is especially important for those who missed the early Bitcoin window and now want to get in before another asset takes off. Polkadot Sees Scalability Gains as Traders Take Notice Polkadot is also gaining traction, buoyed by its Elastic Scaling upgrade and steady expansion in Web3 infrastructure. The token recently climbed above key resistance zones and is testing the $3.00 barrier. Long-term projections remain positive, especially with increased parachain activity and enhanced staking yields on the horizon. While Polkadot’s progress is notable, many investors believe the biggest gains will come from earlier-phase projects with defined tokenomics and clear momentum. Strategic Buyers Are Positioning Early Analysts tracking wallet distribution and on-chain trends have flagged MAGACOIN FINANCE as a clear accumulation play. Key indicators—rising staking deposits, minimal outbound transfers, and growing wallet diversity—are all signs of a token moving from speculative to strategic territory. Veteran traders aren’t just watching—they’re quietly buying. The story here isn’t hype. It’s setup. MAGACOIN FINANCE is exhibiting the same early behaviors seen in historic bull runs. This is why many believe it could mirror Bitcoin’s rise—not in narrative, but in outcome. Final Thoughts Ethereum’s institutional momentum and Polkadot’s tech-focused growth make both strong contenders. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched for something bigger— its potential to become the unexpected leader of 2025 . As more seasoned traders recognize the structural setup, they’re stepping in quietly, before the broader market catches on.

2025-06-26T03:00:36,"Ethereum Gears Up For Breakout Above $2,800 – Bullish Momentum Builds","Ethereum has experienced a strong comeback after weeks of uncertainty and bearish momentum. Following a sharp breakdown below its long-standing consolidation range, ETH found support near the $2,100 level and has since surged 15% from Sunday’s low. The move comes amid improving market sentiment after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran helped ease geopolitical tensions, while broader macroeconomic conditions remain in flux. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply This recent bounce has placed Ethereum back into a critical technical zone, where bulls are once again attempting to reclaim control. After spending much of May and June in a sideways range, ETH is showing signs of renewed strength, fueling optimism that the next decisive move could be to the upside. Top analyst Mister Crypto shared a bullish technical outlook, highlighting that Ethereum is getting ready for a breakout. According to his view, the current price structure and momentum suggest ETH may be preparing to challenge previous resistance levels and enter a new phase of expansion. With on-chain activity starting to pick up and broader market confidence slowly returning, Ethereum could be positioning itself as the key altcoin to lead a potential rally in the coming weeks. Ethereum Reclaims Strength Ethereum has surged more than 15% from Sunday’s lows, recovering from sharp losses triggered by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran sent a wave of relief through global markets, with ETH leading the charge among major altcoins. After briefly losing key support levels, bulls are regaining momentum as Ethereum reclaims price levels last seen before the breakdown. This rebound marks a crucial moment for ETH, as it tests the strength of current market sentiment. While macroeconomic uncertainty continues—driven by growing fears of a U.S. recession, rising bond yields, and a cautious Federal Reserve—Ethereum appears to be consolidating for a potential breakout. The broader crypto market remains on edge, with altcoins underperforming Bitcoin, and many investors watching Ethereum closely as the likely catalyst for the long-awaited altseason. According to Mister Crypto, Ethereum is now preparing for a breakout above the $2,800 resistance. This level represents a major psychological and structural barrier, and a decisive move beyond it could redefine ETH’s trajectory for the remainder of the year. Volume is returning, and on-chain data shows rising confidence from long-term holders, signaling a potential shift in trend. If bulls succeed in pushing ETH past this zone, it could trigger renewed interest across the altcoin market and usher in a wave of fresh capital. As Ethereum flirts with this breakout level, its price action in the coming days may very well set the tone for the next phase of the crypto cycle.

The 8-hour chart shows a clean V-shaped recovery, with bulls pushing the price through the 200 SMA ($2,326), reclaiming short-term control. Volume surged on the way up, confirming strong buying interest during the bounce. However, ETH now faces a test near the $2,450–$2,500 zone, where the 50 and 100 SMAs converge. These moving averages, currently acting as resistance, previously played a key role during Ethereum’s consolidation in early June. A successful breakout above this range would open the door to a retest of the $2,700–$2,800 levels, as suggested by top analysts like Mister Crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Daily EMA-100 Must Hold to Prevent Deep Correction For now, price action remains in a neutral consolidation range with a slight bullish tilt. If Ethereum holds above the 200 SMA while building support above $2,400, the bullish case strengthens. However, failure to break above $2,500 could trigger another pullback toward the $2,300 level. The next few sessions will be crucial to determine whether ETH continues its breakout attempt or enters another phase of sideways consolidation amid broader market uncertainty.
