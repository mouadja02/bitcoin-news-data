Whale Splashes Out $20K on BTC Bull Token Meme Coin as Bitcoin Rebounds to $107K June 26, 2025 • 07:57 UTC A cool $20K purchase marks one whale’s entry into the BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL)’s pool. The move came even as Bitcoin reclaimed $107K after another big pro-crypto move by US President Donald Trump. Bitcoin, currently up 2% in the past 24 hours, retook some ground on the back of the news that Donald Trump had ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider crypto-based federal housing loans. If successful, the move could mark one of the final stages of crypto’s adoption growth; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mack hold over $7T in combined assets. With Bitcoin back on the rise, the $20K whale purchase of $BTCBULL makes sense. BTC Bull Token bets big on Bitcoin bull run, offering investors a way to earn $BTCBULL and $BTC airdrops and profit from Bitcoin’s rise. Visit the BTC Bull Token presale page to learn more. Dogecoin Games with $DOGE Payouts Might Turn DOGE into a Spend & Earn Medium: Meme Coins to Soar Next? June 26, 2025 • 07:57 UTC DogeOS, the new app-layer built on the Dogecoin, is teaming up with mobile publisher PlaysOut to bring 15 casual, Doge-themed mini-games to the blockchain in August 2025. The mini-games will be available in PlaysOut’s app, and will make it possible for players to earn real $DOGE payouts, as well as NFT items dubbed ‘Doginals.’ DogeOS recently completed a $6.9M raise with the help of Polychain Capital for the purposes of building a consumer-app platform on top of Dogecoin’s blockchain. Devs can build dApps with the help of DogeOS, an EVM-compatible layer that connects them through the MyDoge wallet. We expect Solidity compatibility to attract more game studios to the ecosystem and fuel its growth. If successful, the PlaysOut collaboration will likely bring increased adoption to the MyDoge wallet, and further cement Dogecoin’s position as one of the best meme coins .

2025-06-26T07:53:18,"FactCheck: Is Jack Dorsey Satoshi Nakamoto?","The post FactCheck: Is Jack Dorsey Satoshi Nakamoto? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A viral theory circulating online claims that Jack Dorsey — the former CEO of Twitter and founder of Block (formerly Square) — might be the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.The theory, brought back into the spotlight by crypto trader James Wynn , is full of odd coincidences and symbols that make some people believe Jack Dorsey could be the hidden creator of Bitcoin. Claim Jack Dorsey is Satoshi Nakamoto Verdict False Fact-Check by Coinpedia Our research found no credible or verifiable evidence to support this claim. The theory is built on coincidences and online speculation, not facts. Who Made This Claim? The theory recently went viral after crypto trader James Wynn posted a thread suggesting Dorsey could be Satoshi. Matthew Sigel (former Head of Digital Asset Research at VanEck) and Seán Murray also hinted at similar ideas in the past. Coinpedia’s Key Findings and Counter-Evidence 1. Coincidental Timelines and Symbolism Are Not Proof The viral post highlights Dorsey’s 2003 bio mentioning crypto, pseudonyms, and “4 AM hack” sessions, which are said to match timestamps in Bitcoin’s code. However, Coinpedia points out these are circumstantial and not unique to Dorsey. The supposed sailor’s saying in the original Bitcoin code is cited as a nod to Dorsey’s sailing background, but this is speculative and not a direct link. 2. No Concrete Technical or Blockchain Evidence Claims about a Bitcoin address labeled “jD2m” being tied to Dorsey’s San Francisco location are unsubstantiated. There is no verifiable blockchain or cryptographic evidence connecting Dorsey to Satoshi’s wallets or code commits. Coinpedia notes that while Dorsey is a vocal Bitcoin supporter and has worn Satoshi-themed shirts, advocacy does not equate to authorship. 3. Public Behavior and Communication Style Differ Dorsey’s communication style and public persona are well-documented and differ significantly from Satoshi’s writing style in emails and forum posts . Dorsey has publicly supported Bitcoin projects and spoken openly about his involvement, while Satoshi remained anonymous and distanced from all publicity. 4. Time Constraints and Professional Commitments Coinpedia and other researchers highlight that Dorsey was deeply involved in running Twitter (now x) and later Square during the years Satoshi was most active. The enormous time and technical commitment required to create and launch Bitcoin would have been nearly impossible to conceal alongside Dorsey’s public roles. 5. No Cryptographic Proof or Wallet Movement There is no evidence that Dorsey controls any of Satoshi’s original Bitcoin wallets . The early coins attributed to Satoshi have never been moved, and no one has demonstrated the ability to sign a message with Satoshi’s private keys. 6. Community and Expert Skepticism Coinpedia references skepticism from leading crypto researchers, such as Jameson Lopp and BitMEX Research, who argue that the theory relies on unreliable patterns and speculative links, not on hard facts. BitMEX Research, for example, challenges claims about the “Patoshi pattern” and the ability to pinpoint Satoshi’s mining activity or identity based on block timing and forum sign-up dates. Summary Table: Coinpedia’s Evidence Against the Theory Claim Made by Theory Coinpedia’s Counter-Evidence Dorsey’s bio and habits match Satoshi Coincidental, not unique; many cypherpunks had similar interests. “jD2m” address links Dorsey to Satoshi No verifiable blockchain evidence; speculative at best. Satoshi’s actions align with Dorsey’s timeline Dorsey’s public commitments at Twitter/Square make this implausible. Symbolic gestures (shirts, books) Advocacy ≠ authorship; no direct proof. Satoshi’s communication style is like Dorsey’s Writing styles are significantly different. No denial from Dorsey Dorsey has denied being Satoshi in interviews; playful answers are not proof . No cryptographic evidence No access to Satoshi’s wallets or ability to sign messages Conclusion Coinpedia’s research, along with input from blockchain experts, finds no concrete or technical evidence linking Jack Dorsey to Satoshi Nakamoto. The claims are based on coincidences, symbolism, and speculative connections that do not withstand scrutiny. Without cryptographic proof or blockchain evidence, the theory remains just that—a viral internet rumor, not fact.

2025-06-26T07:50:40,"Metaplanet Buys More Bitcoin: Stash Hits 12,345 BTC After $133M Purchase","Tokyo-listed investment firm, Metaplanet, has expanded its Bitcoin holdings with a new purchase of 1,234 BTC worth $133 million. The acquisition pushed its total holdings to 12,345 BTC, secured at an average price of $98,303 per coin. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy With this latest addition , Metaplanet has now surpassed Tesla, which holds 11,509 BTC, to become the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, as it continued with its aggressive accumulation strategy. Announcing the latest milestone, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich tweeted , “1, 2, 3, 4, 5… liftoff. We just climbed past Tesla on the BTC leaderboard. Bolder. Faster. Harder. Elon Musk – meet you on Mars.” The move comes shortly after the firm raised ¥74.9 billion (approximately $515 million), a significant funding round aimed primarily at expanding its Bitcoin treasury. The capital raise was facilitated through the exercise of 540,000 stock-acquisition rights by Metaplanet’s primary backer, EVO Fund, which resulted in the issuance of 54 million new shares. This represents nearly a third of the company’s 20th warrant series, with a significant number of rights still unconverted. The purchase also aligns with Metaplanet’s broader goal to acquire 1% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million coins. This ambition would place it among the most committed corporate adopters of the world’s leading asset. Metaplanet’s $5.4B “555 Million Plan” Earlier this year, the company unveiled its “555 Million Plan,” wherein it proposed the issuance of 555 million new shares to raise roughly $5.4 billion for future bitcoin purchases. That plan represents a 92% dilution of existing shares and is part of a larger roadmap to amass 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Looking further ahead, Metaplanet has outlined targets of reaching 100,000 BTC by 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. This scale of accumulation is matched only by the business intelligence company Strategy, which is currently the top corporate holder with over 592,300 BTC. Data from BitcoinTreasuries revealed that Marathon Digital Holdings stands second in line with 49,179 BTC, followed by Riot Platforms with 19,225 BTC, and CleanSpark with 12,502 BTC, respectively.

2025-06-26T07:44:45,"ChatGPT Predicts: 192,000 XRP for a Home? Here’s How Crypto Is Entering the Real Estate Market","The post ChatGPT Predicts: 192,000 XRP for a Home? Here’s How Crypto Is Entering the Real Estate Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance, many investors wonder how useful their crypto is in daily life. In a big development, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency took a bold step by allowing cryptocurrencies to be counted as assets in mortgage applications. Crypto Now Counts for Home Loans! This new rule means crypto holdings can now help people qualify for loans. It’s a positive move for crypto users and a sign that digital assets are becoming a regular part of the financial system. From rising prices to new rules that recognize digital assets, XRP is stepping out of the trading charts. How much XRP would you need to purchase a home in the United States? Let us explore the details as ChatGPT reveals the answer. As of now, XRP is trading around $2.19. The median price for a typical home in the U.S. is approximately $420,000, though this can vary by state, city and property type. If one were to pay the full cost of the home using XRP, you would need about 192,000 XRP. This is calculated by dividing the home price of $420,000 by the XRP price at $2.19. This amount would cover a typical home purchase in an average market without a mortgage or loan. How Much XRP for a Down Payment? A 20% down payment on a median-priced home would require approximately 38,400 XRP at the current market rate. In high-value real estate markets such as San Francisco or New York City, where property prices often exceed $1 million, the total XRP required for a full purchase could cross 450,000. These figures clearly show how the number of tokens required rise with the property’s value. Also, XRP’s price is highly volatile, so the number of tokens needed may shift over time. At the current price of $2.19, purchasing a median-priced home in the U.S. would take approximately 190,000 to 200,000 XRP. A Larger Shift Globally This shift is part of a larger trend. Japan’s Open House Group now accepts XRP for real estate purchases. Buyers can use XRP to purchase properties in cities like Tokyo and Osaka. The company, already supporting Bitcoin and Ethereum, recently expanded its crypto payment options to include XRP, SOL, and DOGE. Dubai is also using XRP Ledger to Tokenize Real Estate. These moves reflect a growing global trend of using XRP for real-world payments.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/chatgpt-predicts-192000-xrp-for-a-home-heres-how-crypto-is-entering-the-real-estate-market/,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T07:43:38,"Bit Digital Pivots From Bitcoin Mining to ETH Staking Strategy, Stock Drops 8%","Bitcoin mining firm Bit Digital has announced that it is exiting its mining operations to focus solely on Ethereum staking. The company has initiated the transition to become a “pure play” ETH staking and treasury company. The company said Wednesday that it plans to sell its Bitcoin mining assets and to redeploy net proceeds into ETH. In May, the company reported a 17% decrease in revenue for the first quarter, 2025, compared to the previous year. “The decrease was driven by a decline in Digital asset mining revenue following the April 2024 halving,” Bit Digital said at the time. In particular, the firm saw a 64% decrease in revenue from Bitcoin mining and said it had earned only 83.3 Bitcoin during Q1, an 80% decrease from the prior year. $BTBT Market Expansion: On June 25, 2025, Bit Digital, Inc. announced its subsidiary WhiteFiber, Inc.'s proposed IPO and its shift to focus solely on Ethereum staking, holding 24,434 ETH valued at approximately $44.6 million.

The company has steadily increased its holdings since then. Per the official announcement, the company held 24,434.2 ETH and 417.6 BTC as of March 2025. “Bit Digital intends to convert its BTC holdings into ETH over time,” it said. The strategic pivot comes at a time when Ethereum , after it transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, has gained traction in the crypto ecosystem. The world’s second-largest crypto started a fresh upward move above the $2,320 level on Thursday, per CoinMarketCap data . ETH is now showing bullish signs and might aim for a move above the $2,550 zone. In a separate announcement , Bit Digital noted that it will be selling shares to use the net proceeds for Ethereum purchase. It announced an underwritten public offering of its ordinary shares with B. Riley Securities acting as the book-running manager. Stocks Experience 8% Plunge The company’s stock initially fell 3.7% at close on Wednesday, and was further down another 4.3% in after-hours trading, per Yahoo Finance data .

2025-06-26T07:30:00,"Altcoin Winter May Drag On As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Signals It Could Defy Trend","Amid rising military tensions, the crypto market has gone into altcoin winter, which is marked by a period of low growth. According to analysts, the current altcoin winter may continue for a while due to various factors. One of these reasons is that most of the market continues to ignore altcoins, with focus primarily on Bitcoin (BTC). The data shows that while most of the market dipped following the US strikes on Iran, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered quite well, and is now above $103,000, after briefly falling below $100,000. Another reason has been the flood of meme coins into the crypto space. For instance, the pump.fun meme coin platform has created over 6 million meme coins, which has left many newbies confused about which meme coin to purchase. Amid these market conditions, investors are looking into tokens at the bargain-basement pricing, which have real utility and massive upside. One of the main candidates that meets all these conditions is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . So far, the presale for MUTM tokens is doing well and promises to be one of the biggest gainers of 2025 when it goes live. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where it has raised over $11.2 million so far from around 12,450 buyers. At the current price of $0.03, it represents a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. This trend will continue until the final listing price of $0.06. As such, buyers in phase 5 are getting their tokens at a generous 50% discount. Not wanting to miss out on massive gains, investors have bought 50% of the tokens, barely a week after they launched. Another factor pushing the presale forward is the positive forecasts by analysts. According to the analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could go up by 4,500% once they go live. Based on this forecast, a $1,800 investment in the presale at the current price could grow to $81,000. On any scale, that is a massive return that is getting rarer to find in the crypto market. Best of all, the value of MUTM tokens is expected to continue growing, thanks to the design of the protocol. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to offer stable, long-term returns for its holders. One of the ways in which the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team plans to support the long-term value of MUTM tokens is via a buyback and distribution program. In this program, they will purchase MUTM tokens off the open market, which will be distributed to stakers on the platform. These purchases will support the long-term growth of the tokens, helping to attract even more buyers. As a result, it will create a sustainable process of upward growth. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. As lenders on the protocol, they deposit funds, which they can use to earn an annual percentage yield (APY). The yield rate in a pool is determined by the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises, it pushes up the interest rate, which causes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it incentivizes new lenders to join in to benefit from the higher yields. The result is a cycle of liquidity growth and growing user participation that ensures the long-term stability of the ecosystem. Additionally, the design ensures that the protocol achieves optimal capital efficiency. To put it into perspective, if a lender were to deposit $5,000 worth of AVAX in a pool, and the utilization rises, that could push the yield to 20%. An APY of 20% means that the owner would receive $1,000 worth of AVAX on their deposit. That is a convenient means to earn passive income with the least amount of effort possible. To protect lenders on the protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) requires that all loans be overcollateralized. It ensures that all borrowers deposit collateral that is worth more than the value of their deposit. That ensures that if there is rapid price movement that lowers the value of the collateral, liquidators have a buffer in which they can step in and purchase the collateral at a discount. As a result, the protocol is stabilized, while lenders get their full amount back. Conclusion The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is what happens when ingenuity meets determination. By creating real-world utility, it ensures that the value of MUTM tokens will continue to grow over time. The current 50% discount on the tokens in the ongoing presale presents a lucrative opportunity to secure massive gains amid turmoil in the rest of the market. Do not miss this gem of a token that could deliver 45x gains.

The rally has now entered a critical red supply zone between $108,000 and $110,000, where historical rejections have often triggered consolidation phases. Price is pausing just below this resistance, and several indicators hint at an imminent inflection. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) From a multi-timeframe perspective, Bitcoin price action has flipped bullish after a breakout from the descending channel seen on the daily and 4-hour charts. The current rally originated from a liquidity sweep near $98,000, forming a bullish order block and reclaiming the broken structure. BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Price is now testing the same region that caused the last rejection near $108,000. The 1D chart shows this area aligning with the upper trendline projection, where BTC reversed in early June. A breakout above this could initiate a broader expansion phase, while rejection would risk a retracement back toward $104,000–$105,000.

The final requirement? Profitability. Thanks to a recent accounting rule change, Bitcoin could be the catalyst that gets them there. With 592,345 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at over $63.7 billion, MicroStrategy is on track to post one of its most profitable quarters—but only if Bitcoin stays above $95,240 by June 30. What’s Holding MicroStrategy Back? To qualify for the S&P 500, a company must meet these criteria: Be based in the U.S. Have a large market capitalization Maintain adequate share float and trading volume Post positive earnings over the past four quarters MicroStrategy satisfies the first three. However, under previous accounting rules, it had to record unrealized Bitcoin losses—even without selling. These losses kept its earnings negative. According to a post by Bitcoin advocate Alex on X , this was the main obstacle preventing S&P 500 inclusion. Why June 30 Is a Pivotal Date A new accounting rule now allows companies to include fair-value gains from Bitcoin in quarterly earnings. This means if Bitcoin remains above $95,240, MicroStrategy’s profits for Q2 could turn sharply positive—meeting the final S&P 500 requirement. Analyst Jeff Walton points out that such a price level would erase previous losses and unlock S&P eligibility. Current BTC price: $107,753 Q2 performance: +29.2% Probability of Bitcoin holding above $95,240: 91% What Happens If MicroStrategy Is Added? If MicroStrategy joins the S&P 500, every major index fund will be required to include MSTR in their holdings. This creates indirect exposure to Bitcoin across the entire U.S. index ecosystem. Alex notes this could bring a new level of mainstream legitimacy and adoption for Bitcoin. Why Bitcoin Investors Should Watch This Closely MicroStrategy’s potential S&P 500 inclusion could: Accelerate institutional interest in Bitcoin Increase demand for BTC-backed stocks Further cement Bitcoin’s place in traditional finance As June 30 approaches, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s price. If it holds above the $95,240 threshold, MicroStrategy may finally enter the S&P 500, bringing Bitcoin with it.

While Bitcoin continues to lead the way, altcoins are setting up for some interesting moves too. Bitcoin at Key Resistance: Breakout or Pullback? As of now, Bitcoin is testing an important resistance zone between $109,000 and $111,000. While the fundamentals like stock market stability, a steady volatility index, and a growing Coinbase Bitcoin premium are looking positive, analysts are divided on whether Bitcoin can break above this level in the short term. While there’s strong bullish momentum right now, the volume isn’t quite high enough for a confirmed breakout. If Bitcoin gets rejected at this resistance, it could see a pullback before any new highs. Ethereum and XRP: Lagging Behind, But Watching Bitcoin Ethereum (ETH) and XRP haven’t kept up with Bitcoin’s recent surge. Ethereum especially looks weak, still stuck below its key resistance level and struggling to attract volume. XRP, too, is heavily dependent on Bitcoin’s moves and may need a pullback before any serious rally. Altcoins: Calm Before the Storm? Altcoins in general have stabilized but remain at risky levels. A short-term pullback in altcoins is likely before a possible bounce and more sustained upside. The open interest in altcoins remains high, keeping things volatile, but if Bitcoin can hold its ground, altcoins might follow suit soon. However, crypto trader JRNY Crypto is positive about what’s coming next. According to him, Bitcoin reaching $125,000 could kick off a mini altcoin season. If it crosses $150,000, a bigger rally might follow, and if Bitcoin pushes above $180,000, the market could enter a massive, parabolic altcoin season.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/125k-bitcoin-could-launch-mini-altcoin-season-is-xrp-ready-to-run/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP","News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 153,600 followers on the social media platform X that if Bitcoin breaks through resistance at the $105,304 level, it will likely trade sideways for a while before bursting to new all-time highs. “Wanting to see BTC break through the line of resistance to create a multi-month sideward ranging channel, a solid base from which to push to new highs.” Source: Dave the Wave/X The analyst also says key indicators suggest Bitcoin remains in a bullish trend, including that the flagship crypto asset is trading well-above the lower bound of a years-long upward channel. “The main BTC bullish takeaways: Maintaining a multi-year upward technical channel, with price well-positioned within that channel. Multi-year support being found at the one-year moving average, and not too far extended from that average.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Lastly, he says Bitcoin’s recent sideways price action, including a temporary dip into the $90,000 level, is likely due to geopolitical concerns. “BTC continued consolidation. A nervous market with recent developments in the Middle East.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,904 at time of writing, up 1.8% in the last 24 hours.

2025-06-26T06:59:40,"$1.5 Billion Flows Into BTC ETFs This Week as Bitcoin Double Taps $108K","Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen almost $1.5 billion in inflows so far this week as institutional investors are driving the markets. In just three trading days, aggregate inflows for US spot BTC funds totalled $1.48 billion, according to Farside Investors. Additionally, there has not been an outflow day since June 6, almost three weeks ago. Its “absolutely ridiculous,” said ETF Store President Nate Geraci, who observed almost $4 billion in new capital and the total aggregate inflow approaching $50 billion since the products launched 18 months ago. ETFs On Fire BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has been hoovering up the most with a more than 9,400 BTC purchased this week alone. The fund has seen an aggregate inflow of almost $52 billion since it launched, with Wednesday seeing a further $340 million in inflows, according to Farside Investors. Its closest competitor is Fidelity, which saw $115 million in inflows on June 25 and has a total aggregate inflow of $11.7 billion. The other nine products are small fry in comparison. In related news, ETF issuers Invesco and Galaxy filed for a Solana ETF on Wednesday, bringing the total to nine issuers that have filed for Solana funds, reported Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. Meanwhile, Canary Capital filed a 19b-4 form with CBOE for a PENGU ETF that will cover the tokens and Pudgy Penguins NFTs. NEW: @InvescoUS (and @galaxyhq ) just filed for a Solana ETF.

Bitcoin Dominance Surges Bitcoin prices have gained almost 10% since their sub-six-figure dip earlier this week. The asset has tapped $108,100 twice in the past 24 hours but fell back to $107,800 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session. The latest move has resulted in Bitcoin dominance returning to a four-year high of 65.7% this week as Ethereum and the altcoins have remained stagnant . Traditionally, Bitcoin dominance takes 1-2 months to rally from a successful retest of 64% support up to 71%. However, this cycle has shown extended timeframes – for example, a retest that took 2 months in 2019 stretched to 4 months in the current cycle, said analyst ‘Rekt Crypto.’ He added that many traders are hoping for a quick rally to 70% to get the dominance move over with quickly. “But the concern is just that too many people are deeply wishing for a swift rise in Bitcoin Dominance right now, and the market rarely gives people exactly what they want.” The post $1.5 Billion Flows Into BTC ETFs This Week as Bitcoin Double Taps $108K appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/1-5-billion-flows-into-btc-etfs-this-week-as-bitcoin-double-taps-108k/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin ETF",cryptocompare

2025-06-26T06:34:26,"SEC's Hester Peirce claimed in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs are ""definitely coming""","U.S. SEC’s Hester Peirce dropped a hint about the possibility of in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs, saying they were definitely on the horizon. Nasdaq submitted a Form 19b-4 on behalf of BlackRock in January, requesting the U.S. SEC to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin ETFs, a shift from the current cash-based system. Republican U.S. SEC Commissioner Peirce explained that in-kind creations and redemptions would allow ETF issuers to deliver and redeem fund shares using crypto assets directly, rather than cash, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. She suggested that in-kind redemptions would allow investors to withdraw Bitcoin from an ETF to a private (self-custody) wallet. In December of 2023, the U.S. SEC met with all spot Bitcoin ETF issuers and asked them to remove any reference to “in-kind” redemptions from their filings and include “cash creates” only. However, Peirce hinted in December 2024 that in-kind redemptions may be coming to Bitcoin spot ETFs in 2025. Currently, most spot crypto ETFs operate using cash-based creation and redemption processes, which limit efficiency for traditional crypto participants. Peirce says she is not making any promises BREAKING: US SEC COMMISSIONER PIERCE SAYS IN-KIND US #BITCOIN ETFS ARE COMING ETFs DELIVERING REAL BTC. MASSIVE 🚀 pic.twitter.com/2XNlw5qvh7 — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) June 25, 2025 During a Bitcoin Policy Institute panel discussion, Commissioner Peirce confirmed that Form 19b-4 submissions were currently under review, acknowledging a high level of interest in the “in-kind” mechanism. However, she pointed out that although the industry was looking forward to this new model, she was not making any promises. In January, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart argued that the in-kind creations and redemptions mechanism would increase trading efficiency for funds. BlackRock previously presented a plan for a “Revised In-Kind” model that could give the asset manager more flexibility should investors want to redeem their shares for the underlying asset. Vivian Fang, a Finance professor at Indiana University, said asset managers were familiar with the “in-kind” redemption model, adding that retail investors who wanted to redeem their shares would get their share of Bitcoin from BlackRock in return, which could then be turned into cash via a broker-dealer. “You want your one egg back, I’ll give you your one egg back, I don’t have to immediately care about how much that egg is selling for now, it can be $5, it could be $10, but I’m holding one egg for you and you’re getting one egg back when you want it.” -Vivian Fang, Finance Professor at Indiana University However, Fang explained that investors could still get cash back when redeeming their shares, no matter the model. She said the only difference was that the Bitcoin (or egg) had to be sold to raise that cash in the cash model. U.S. SEC seeks comments on in-kind creations and redemptions The U.S. SEC mandated a “cash redemption” model when the initial wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs received approval in January 2024. However, the agency announced in February this year that it sought comments on the proposal to allow in-kind redemptions. In May, the U.S. SEC launched proceedings to assess Nasdaq’s proposed rule change allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Nasdaq filed the proposed rule change on January 24, 2025, and it was published in the Federal Register on February 12, triggering an initial review period. On March 11, the SEC extended its decision deadline to May 13. The May 13 order formally instituted proceedings under Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The U.S. SEC solicited public comments to evaluate whether these changes aligned with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. In January, Cboe and VanEck also filed for in-kind creations and redemptions for their spot Bitcoin ETFs. In April, a BlackRock delegation led by the Head of Regulatory Affairs, Benjamin Tecmire, met with the U.S. SEC’s Crypto Task Force to iron out matters regarding the potential of allowing future in-kind redemptions and creations for crypto ETFs. However, Fang claimed that there was no difference between the cash model and the revised in-kind model from the investor’s point of view. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major fiat currencies, dropped to 97.27 early Thursday, the lowest level since February 2022, according to data source TradingView. The decline follows growing calls for a July Fed rate cut and disappointing data on housing and consumer confidence. The weakening of the dollar, a global reserve currency, tends to ease financial conditions, galvanizing increased risk-taking in financial markets. ""DXY [is] now at the lowest level since March 2022. Very bullish implications for global money supply growth and bitcoin,"" Andre Dragosch, director, head of research - Europe at Bitwise, said on X. BTC and NVDA correlation Meanwhile, shares in Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things AI and emerging technologies, rose 4%.33% Wednesday, hitting a record high of $154.30. Both NVDA and BTC bottomed out in late 2022 and have been in an uptrend ever since. As of the time of writing, the 90-day correlation coefficient between NVDA and BTC was 0.80, indicating a strong positive relationship between the two assets. NVDA's record high came a day after the Nasdaq futures formed a bullish golden cross, signaling a continued risk-on rally. Bonds teasing recession The yield on the U.S. two-year note, which is more sensitive to interest rate expectations, dropped to 3.76% early today, the lowest since May 2. The yield has declined by 24 basis points this month. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has declined by 16 basis points to 4.27%. As such, the spread between the 10- and two-year yields has widened in a move known as the steepening of the yield curve. Historically, recessions have begun with the two-year yield falling alongside a steepening of the yield curve, as noted by wealth advisor Kurt S. Altrichter on X. ""We’re not there yet, but we’re dancing on the edge. The 10Y-2Y spread is bull-steepening. If the 2Y breaks lower, it signals the Fed has lost control. That’s your cue. Watch it closely,"" Altrichter said . Consumer expectations signal an impending recession Consumer confidence dropped last month to a reading of 93, registering a 5.4-point decline from May, with Republican party respondents leading the decline, according to data released by the Conference Board on Tuesday. More importantly, the expectations index, which represents the short-term outlook, slipped to 69, well below the 80 threshold that typically signals an impending recession. Traders price in Fed rate cuts These developments, coupled with the oil price slide and the talk of a July rate cut by some Fed officials, have likely prompted traders to price in an early rate cut by the Fed. According to the CME's FedWatch tool. According to Bloomberg , interest rate swaps are now pricing around four basis points of easing into the July Fed meeting, up from near zero a week ago. Furthermore, traders anticipate a combined 60 basis points of easing over the remaining four meetings this year, up from 45 basis points a week ago.

2025-06-26T06:22:19,"U.S. agency directs mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider crypto assets","Crypto holdings could soon count toward U.S. mortgages under a new directive by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In a directive issued by FHFA director William J. Pulte on June 25, the agency instructed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals for including cryptocurrency holdings in single-family mortgage risk assessments. Previously, digital assets have not been included in mortgage lenders’ risk models unless they are converted to fiat. This policy marks a major shift in the way borrower reserves may be assessed, possibly enabling crypto assets to be considered when approving loans without first being converted into U.S. dollars. Before implementation, each institution must submit board-approved proposals. Only holdings that can be verified on regulated U.S. exchanges will be taken into consideration. After significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump’s vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, today I ordered the Great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage. SO ORDERED pic.twitter.com/Tg9ReJQXC3 — Pulte (@pulte) June 25, 2025 The directive called for extra protections to ensure sound underwriting practices and take market volatility into account. Critics have pointed out that the measure does not include self-custodied assets, which might prevent crypto-native users who value decentralization from participating. You might also like: Trump-backed World Liberty Financial plans USD1 stablecoin audit and new app launch Concerns have also been raised about Pulte’s family’s cryptocurrency ties. As of January 2025, his spouse reportedly owned between $500,000 and $1 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ). Although there are no accusations of misconduct, the timing has sparked questions about potential conflicts of interest. This is not the first time crypto has been accepted as legitimate collateral in U.S. financial systems. In June, JPMorgan Chase began accepting spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, as loan collateral. Despite not being directly related to cryptocurrency, the exposure represents a big change in policy for a major traditional bank. Federally chartered cryptocurrency bank Anchorage Digital also offers crypto-backed loans through its collaboration with Arch Lending, accepting Solana, Ethereum ( ETH ), and Bitcoin as collateral. At the same time, BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, is now accepted as collateral for institutional trading on exchanges like Deribit and Crypto.com. These developments show that traditional finance is becoming more comfortable using digital assets as collateral. With the adoption of the FHFA’s crypto directive, crypto-backed mortgages may become a standard in U.S. housing finance, giving holders of digital assets access to greater financial inclusion.

2025-06-26T06:02:15,"Ninth Solana ETF filing lands as Invesco and Galaxy submit S-1","Invesco and Galaxy have become the ninth issuer to file for a spot Solana ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to a June 26 filing , Invesco and Galaxy’s proposed fund will offer direct exposure to Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Following the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the proposed Solana fund would hold the asset directly under a commodity trust structure. The fund would trade under the ticker symbol “QSOL” on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with Coinbase Custody set to act as custodian for the underlying Solana assets. The ETF may also stake a portion of its SOL holdings to earn additional token rewards, which would be treated as income to the trust. Wednesday’s submission is a Form S-1 registration statement, which informs the commission of the intent to launch a new security. However, before the ETF can be listed, Invesco and Galaxy must also file a Form 19b-4, which proposes a rule change and initiates the formal review process. The SEC will then determine whether the product meets regulatory standards under the Securities Exchange Act. You might also like: Invesco and Galaxy register Solana ETF trust in Delaware Invesco and Galaxy registered the “Invesco Galaxy Solana Trust” in Delaware earlier this month, kickstarting its regulatory process. Other applicants that have filed for Solana ETFs, including VanEck, Bitwise, Grayscale, and Fidelity, are already awaiting SEC review as momentum builds around altcoin ETFs. So far, the SEC has delayed decisions on several Solana ETF applications and has since requested updates from issuers, but has not ruled out eventual approval. The final decision deadline on many of these filings falls in October. However, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have speculated the SEC may act on Solana ETF applications as early as July, with a 90% likelihood of approval. As of now, altcoin ETFs remain unapproved in the United States, with current spot approvals limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the existence of CME-listed Solana futures and growing institutional interest in the asset have strengthened the case for a spot product.

2025-06-26T06:00:05,"Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’","On-chain data shows new investors have been coming into Chainlink (LINK) as the MVRV Ratio signals a potential long-term opportunity for the asset. Chainlink Has Seen Its Total Holder Count Reach A New High In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Total Amount of Holders metric for Chainlink. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses on the LINK network that are carrying some non-zero balance. Related Reading: Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the value of the metric has changed during the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Total Amount of Holders observed an inflection point earlier this year and has since been climbing up at a notable rate. This suggests that new non-empty wallets are popping up on the network. This kind of trend can arise due to a number of reasons. Fresh investors coming into the space or old ones who sold before making a return naturally contribute to an increase in the indicator. Another factor could be existing users creating new wallets to distribute their holdings or for privacy purposes. In general, all of these could be assumed to be occurring simultaneously to a degree whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. As such, the recent uptrend in the metric could indicate that some net adoption (that is, the influx of new investors) has steadily been taking place for Chainlink. Over the past month, 7,903 new non-zero balance addresses have joined the chain, bringing the Total Amount of Holders to a fresh all-time high (ATH) of 769,380. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data of another indicator: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. This metric basically compares how the value held by the BTC investors (the market cap) compares against the value put in by them (the realized cap). In other words, the indicator tells us about the profit-loss balance of the holders. Here, the version of the MVRV Ratio that’s relevant is the 365-day version, capturing the situation of the investors who bought their coins within the past year. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound From the graph, it’s visible that the 1-year MVRV Ratio of Chainlink is currently sitting at a negative 17.3%, an indication that these traders are, on average, holding a loss of 17.3%. Generally, however, investors being underwater isn’t actually a bad thing for the cryptocurrency. This is because holders in profit are the ones more likely to participate in selling. As such, Santiment notes that the trend in the 365-day MVRV Ratio could suggest the asset’s “long-term investing timeframe is in an opportunity zone.” LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading around $13.15, up more than 2% in the last seven days.

2025-06-26T05:54:33,"Online Bank SoFi Brings Back Crypto Trading, Eyes Cross-Border Blockchain Payments","SoFi Technologies is making a return to the cryptocurrency space, less than a year after stepping away due to regulatory hurdles. Key Takeaways: SoFi has reentered the crypto market with trading, remittances, and future DeFi tools. The platform plans to offer stablecoins, staking, and asset-backed borrowing to users. Regulatory shifts in the U.S. have opened the path for SoFi’s renewed crypto strategy. The US-based online banking platform announced Wednesday that it is reintroducing crypto trading and launching blockchain-based international remittances as part of a broader expansion into digital assets. SoFi users will soon be able to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies through their accounts, with future plans to offer stablecoin products, crypto-backed loans, and staking features. SoFi Plans Asset-Backed Borrowing and Expanded Payment Options The company said it aims to create a more comprehensive digital finance experience by expanding payment options and introducing asset-backed borrowing. CEO Anthony Noto said SoFi is “very excited” to leverage blockchain technology across its operations. The planned remittance service will convert fiat to crypto, transmit funds over blockchain rails, and reconvert them into local fiat on the receiving end. “This is just day one,” Noto said, hinting at long-term plans involving crypto, blockchain, and artificial intelligence to improve financial accessibility and cost-efficiency. SoFi’s crypto reboot coincides with projections of rapid industry growth, with the fintech blockchain market expected to reach $49 billion by 2030, up from $3.4 billion in 2024, according to Insider. The firm’s Galileo platform will support third-party crypto infrastructure, including wallets and custody services, positioning SoFi as a serious contender in the expanding digital finance ecosystem. Very excited about the innovation we can drive via blockchain and crypto across our businesses. @Sofi ‘s planned new international payments (frequently called remittances) will convert fiat to crypto, transmit via blockchain, and convert to local fiat. It's only day 1 of the type… https://t.co/KIIyXMEHJo — Anthony Noto (@anthonynoto) June 25, 2025 SoFi exited the crypto space in late 2023 after securing its bank charter, agreeing to the withdrawal under tighter regulatory conditions. However, recent shifts in Washington, such as advancing stablecoin legislation and the Federal Reserve’s rollback of “reputational risk” assessments, have opened the door for traditional banks to work more closely with crypto firms. Shares of SoFi Technologies (SOFI) have climbed roughly 12% over the past week, reflecting renewed investor interest in its pivot back to crypto-enabled services. Venture Capital Backing For Crypto Payment Services on the Rise Earlier this year, crypto payment firm RedotPay closed a $40 million Series A funding round , led by Lightspeed with key investments from HSG, Galaxy Ventures, and other prominent investors including DST Global Partners, Accel, and Vertex Ventures. RedotPay’s funding round came shortly after crypto payments firm Mesh raised $82 million in a Series B funding round to expand its blockchain-based settlement network globally. The round was led by Paradigm, with participation from ConsenSys, QuantumLight, Yolo Investments, Evolution VC, Hike Ventures, Opportuna, and AltaIR Capital. Notably, most of the investment was settled using PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin, highlighting the growing role of stablecoins in financial transactions. Venture capital firms are increasingly backing projects focused on stablecoin services and financial infrastructure. The sector’s potential was further underscored by payments giant Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion last year, signaling strong institutional interest in blockchain-based financial solutions.

Barclays announced a ban on crypto purchases via its credit cards, due to consumer protection concerns. On the legislative front, Senator Cynthia Lummis is very optimistic that two key crypto bills — the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts — could pass by year-end. Overall, these developments shed some light on growing divergence in regulatory approaches between the US and UK during a time of global institutional adoption of digital assets. FHFA Backs Crypto for Home Loans The US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals for recognizing cryptocurrency as a form of asset in mortgage loan risk assessments. In a letter that was issued Wednesday, FHFA director William J. Pulte instructed the two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to explore incorporating crypto holdings into risk assessments for single-family mortgage loans without requiring conversion of those assets into US dollars. This is a big shift in federal housing policy, as digital assets have typically not been factored into traditional mortgage evaluations unless liquidated into fiat currency. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under federal conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis, and are key players in the US housing finance system. Their ability to purchase mortgages from lenders has long helped maintain liquidity and stability in the housing market. Pulte explained that the move comes after extensive study and aligns with President Donald Trump's vision of positioning the US as a global hub for crypto innovation. Importantly, Pulte’s letter specifies that only cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated centralized exchanges and subject to relevant laws should be considered. This cautious approach ensures regulatory compliance while acknowledging the growing role of crypto in the financial ecosystem. The decision was made amid broader trends indicating increasing institutional acceptance of digital assets as legitimate collateral. JPMorgan , for instance, is preparing to let some of its wealth management clients use crypto-based financial products like Bitcoin ETFs as collateral for financing. Additionally, Coinbase Derivatives and clearinghouse Nodal Clear are planning to make Circle’s USDC stablecoin eligible as collateral for futures trading beginning next year. While crypto-backed mortgages are still a niche offering, their use is expanding. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Bitcoin lending platform Ledn, said that many crypto investors have successfully leveraged Bitcoin and Ethereum to purchase property without having to sell their holdings. Barclays Blocks Crypto Credit Card Purchases While US financial institutions might be opening up to crypto, Barclays, one of the United Kingdom’s leading banks, will begin blocking cryptocurrency transactions made through its Barclaycard credit cards starting Friday. This is due to the inherent risks tied to digital assets. The bank stated that the move is driven by concerns over the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies and the lack of regulatory protections for consumers. According to a notice on its website, Barclays stated that falling crypto prices could leave customers in unmanageable debt, especially given that crypto assets are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if something goes wrong. A notice of Barclays website Barclays allowed crypto purchases via its credit cards since at least 2018, giving customers access to crypto markets through major exchanges. Their latest announcement is a huge reversal in policy from a bank that services over five million credit card accounts in the UK. The ban comes during a time of broader debate in the UK over whether additional restrictions should be imposed on using credit to purchase cryptocurrencies. On May 2, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a discussion paper seeking feedback on whether these kinds of transactions should face tighter controls. The Payments Association, a London-based group representing the payments industry, responded critically to the FCA’s suggestion by arguing that it unfairly likens crypto investments to gambling. They pointed out that consumers should have the autonomy to make informed financial decisions within existing credit limits. The Payments Association also mentioned that credit card restrictions already exist for high-risk investments, including crypto. In some cases, banks even block cash purchases of crypto, making credit cards a last resort for some users. However, buying digital assets with a credit card can come at a steep cost. Bankrate reports that many credit card issuers categorize these transactions as cash advances, which often result in higher fees and interest rates. GENIUS and CLARITY Acts Gain Momentum Part of the reason why the US is warming up to crypto could be its recent regulatory progress. In fact, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis said she expects Congress to pass two major crypto bills related to stablecoins and digital asset market structure by the end of 2025. At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Lummis shared some details about the ongoing progress of the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act in the House of Representatives and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in the Senate. While she hopes the legislation will pass before the end of this calendar year, she stated she would be “extremely disappointed” if they were not passed by 2026. Lummis chairs the Senate Banking Committee’s digital asset subcommittee, and acknowledged the political difficulty of securing bipartisan support for crypto bills. At a hearing on Tuesday, she pointed out concerns that legislation might benefit individuals with connections to the current administration. She believes it is very important to ensure both sides of the aisle feel involved in the process to avoid partisan resistance. While some Democrats have supported crypto-related legislation, including the GENIUS Act — which passed the Senate with 68 votes, 18 from Democrats — others are still a bit hesitant . Their concerns center around President Donald Trump’s growing involvement in the crypto sector, including his issuance of meme coins, his ties to the crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and political donations from digital asset industry executives. The path to passage in the House is still uncertain. Lummis’s timeline contrasts with that of Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, He predicted in May that the GENIUS Act could be ready before the congressional recess in August. Trump is also ready to sign the bill without amendments if it passes swiftly through the House. However, with Republicans holding only a slim majority, both the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts will need at least some Democratic support to move forward.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9711/us-government-opens-door-to-crypto-backed-mortgages,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Donald Trump’s Shortlist Just Dropped appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tensions between Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell are heating up again. With Powell’s term set to end in May 2026, Trump is reportedly thinking about announcing a replacement much earlier. According to Wall Street Journal journalist Nick Timiraos , Trump is frustrated with how slowly the Fed is cutting interest rates. However, naming someone too early could backfire, as that person might face more public pressure and be less likely to get the job in the end. Who is the Next FED Chair? SCOOP: As President Trump remains furious at Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he has started deliberating to make his choice of chair and announce it to the world months before Powell's term ends. On the rise in his considerations for Fed Chair are loyalists but with their own… — Brian Schwartz (@schwartzbWSJ) June 25, 2025 While Trump hasn’t officially named his pick, he said during a NATO summit press conference that he’s narrowed it down to “three or four people.” Among the top contenders are known Trump loyalists: Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, Chris Waller, and David Malpass. Additionally, Scott Bessent is being pushed as a strong candidate. These candidates are seen as more likely to support Trump’s push for faster rate cuts and stronger economic growth. [post_titles_links postid=”474867″] Can Trump Fire Jerome Powell ? Even though Trump has hinted at firing Powell, it’s not that simple. A recent Supreme Court ruling confirmed that the Fed operates differently from other government agencies, which means Powell’s job is more secure. During his first term, Trump also thought about removing Powell but backed off after markets reacted badly. This time, he’s been more open, even posting online that he “might change [his] mind” about firing him. A Battle Over FED Interest Rates The disagreement between Trump and Powell mainly revolves around interest rates and inflation. Trump wants the Fed to cut rates to help the economy grow, but Powell is holding firm, saying Trump’s tariff plans could drive up prices. With only 11 months left in Powell’s term, the decision on who leads the Fed next could have a big impact on the U.S. economy, especially if Trump returns to the White House. In short, Trump wants change at the top of the Fed, but legal limits, market reactions, and careful timing could make that tricky.

The market is now betting on a convergence of two trends: dovish Fed commentary and retail’s accelerating rotation into digital assets, traders say. “Crypto will continue its bullish trend,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “Institutional purchases are picking up, and Jerome Powell’s comments hinting at rate cuts have flipped investor sentiment quickly.” Powell this week said rate adjustments remain on the table, contingent on successful trade deals and softening inflation, words that markets took as code for a late-2025 pivot. At press time, bitcoin was trading over $107,800, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Ether ETH is holding at $2,480 with a 1.8% gain. Solana’s SOL SOL, dogecoin DOGE, XRP XRP and BNB Chain’s BNB BNB showed gains under 1%, but could be next to move if BTC and ETH prices further recover. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich said that the overall market capitalization had previously dipped below its 200-day moving average and rebounded sharply, “confirming that level as new support.” Bitcoin also reclaimed its 50-day average, signaling that momentum may accelerate if sentiment holds, he noted, adding that BTC remains about 5% below its recent highs and is lagging behind traditional tech benchmarks, such as the Nasdaq 100, which has just hit fresh all-time highs. “If crypto-related equities maintain this pace, they may soon catch up with traditional finance,” he said. Meanwhile, underlying demand is strengthening. eToro data shows U.S. retail investors are increasing crypto exposure amid a weakening dollar and rising global uncertainty, with 58% reportedly rebalancing their portfolios to favor digital assets.

Invesco ETF Filing – A Clear Tailwind for Solana Per the S-1 registration statement, Invesco has proposed the planned ETF to directly hold Solana, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. The fund will be traded under the ticker symbol QSOL. The recent flurry of filings to track the price of Solana, the sixth-largest crypto by market cap, sets off a wave of optimism across the sector that saw Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals and BTC’s new highs in the recent past.

2025-06-26T05:00:44,"Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Attracting Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors Away From Solana and Litecoin","Analysts are closely watching MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential breakout candidate, with many drawing parallels between its current trajectory and the historic rallies of Solana and Litecoin. This article explores why experts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could mirror the explosive growth of these established cryptocurrencies, and what each project brings to the evolving crypto landscape. The Rise of Solana and Litecoin Solana has become a standout performer in the crypto market, recently surging more than 40% toward the $200 milestone. Its rally is driven by strong technical indicators—such as bullish EMA crossovers and clearing of key resistance levels—alongside robust on-chain activity and rising institutional interest. Solana’s ecosystem continues to expand, with increasing use in payments and stablecoin settlement, solidifying its position as a top-tier Layer 1 blockchain. However, as Solana’s market cap grows, analysts note that the potential for massive early-stage returns diminishes, prompting investors to seek new, high-upside opportunities. Litecoin, often dubbed “digital silver,” is experiencing a resurgence in 2025. With reduced transaction fees, a strong history of reliability, and renewed interest from ETF-related speculation, Litecoin is attracting both long-term holders and traders looking for stability with upside potential. Its price hovers around $85, supported by healthy trading volumes and a loyal user base. Like Solana, Litecoin is considered a blue-chip asset, but its growth prospects are now seen as more incremental compared to early-stage projects. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a focal point for investors seeking the next big asymmetric return. Analysts highlight several reasons for its bullish outlook: Scarcity-Driven Model: MAGACOIN FINANCE features a capped supply (ranging from 100 billion to 170 billion tokens, depending on the source), with a significant portion reserved for presale. This scarcity is designed to drive demand as the project matures. Transparency and Security: The project’s smart contracts have been audited by HashEx, providing confidence to investors wary of the risks common in meme and presale tokens. Community and Narrative: MAGACOIN FINANCE has cultivated a hyper-engaged community and leverages a politically charged narrative, which resonates with investors seeking alternatives to traditional crypto assets. Its rapid presale sellouts and growing holder base signal strong grassroots momentum. Early-Stage Upside: With the token still priced under $0.01 and not yet listed on major exchanges, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the kind of early entry point that historically precedes massive rallies. Analysts project potential returns of 25x to 50x or more, with some models even suggesting the possibility of a $1 valuation if momentum continues. Strategic Capital Rotation As Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilize at higher price levels, investors are rotating capital into established altcoins like Litecoin and high-upside presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. This trend reflects a broader market strategy: balancing reliable blue-chip exposure with the asymmetric return potential of early-stage tokens. Analysts see MAGACOIN FINANCE as uniquely positioned to benefit from this rotation. Its combination of scarcity, transparency, and community-driven growth mirrors the early days of Solana and Litecoin, but with the added advantage of being in its infancy. As the crypto market matures, the window for transformative gains narrows—making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the few remaining opportunities for investors seeking to replicate the massive rallies of previous cycles. In summary MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention not just for its novelty, but for its structural strengths and strategic timing. With Solana and Litecoin serving as both inspiration and cautionary benchmarks, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands at the intersection of community enthusiasm , scarcity, and early-stage potential—making it a compelling candidate for the next big crypto rally.
