2025-06-26T06:34:26,"SEC's Hester Peirce claimed in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs are ""definitely coming""","U.S. SEC‚Äôs Hester Peirce dropped a hint about the possibility of in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs, saying they were definitely on the horizon. Nasdaq submitted a Form 19b-4 on behalf of BlackRock in January, requesting the U.S. SEC to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin ETFs, a shift from the current cash-based system. Republican U.S. SEC Commissioner Peirce explained that in-kind creations and redemptions would allow ETF issuers to deliver and redeem fund shares using crypto assets directly, rather than cash, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. She suggested that in-kind redemptions would allow investors to withdraw Bitcoin from an ETF to a private (self-custody) wallet. In December of 2023, the U.S. SEC met with all spot Bitcoin ETF issuers and asked them to remove any reference to ‚Äúin-kind‚Äù redemptions from their filings and include ‚Äúcash creates‚Äù only. However, Peirce hinted in December 2024 that in-kind redemptions may be coming to Bitcoin spot ETFs in 2025. Currently, most spot crypto ETFs operate using cash-based creation and redemption processes, which limit efficiency for traditional crypto participants. Peirce says she is not making any promises BREAKING: US SEC COMMISSIONER PIERCE SAYS IN-KIND US #BITCOIN ETFS ARE COMING ETFs DELIVERING REAL BTC. MASSIVE üöÄ pic.twitter.com/2XNlw5qvh7 ‚Äî The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) June 25, 2025 During a Bitcoin Policy Institute panel discussion, Commissioner Peirce confirmed that Form 19b-4 submissions were currently under review, acknowledging a high level of interest in the ‚Äúin-kind‚Äù mechanism. However, she pointed out that although the industry was looking forward to this new model, she was not making any promises. In January, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart argued that the in-kind creations and redemptions mechanism would increase trading efficiency for funds. BlackRock previously presented a plan for a ‚ÄúRevised In-Kind‚Äù model that could give the asset manager more flexibility should investors want to redeem their shares for the underlying asset. Vivian Fang, a Finance professor at Indiana University, said asset managers were familiar with the ‚Äúin-kind‚Äù redemption model, adding that retail investors who wanted to redeem their shares would get their share of Bitcoin from BlackRock in return, which could then be turned into cash via a broker-dealer. ‚ÄúYou want your one egg back, I‚Äôll give you your one egg back, I don‚Äôt have to immediately care about how much that egg is selling for now, it can be $5, it could be $10, but I‚Äôm holding one egg for you and you‚Äôre getting one egg back when you want it.‚Äù -Vivian Fang, Finance Professor at Indiana University However, Fang explained that investors could still get cash back when redeeming their shares, no matter the model. She said the only difference was that the Bitcoin (or egg) had to be sold to raise that cash in the cash model. U.S. SEC seeks comments on in-kind creations and redemptions The U.S. SEC mandated a ‚Äúcash redemption‚Äù model when the initial wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs received approval in January 2024. However, the agency announced in February this year that it sought comments on the proposal to allow in-kind redemptions. In May, the U.S. SEC launched proceedings to assess Nasdaq‚Äôs proposed rule change allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF. Nasdaq filed the proposed rule change on January 24, 2025, and it was published in the Federal Register on February 12, triggering an initial review period. On March 11, the SEC extended its decision deadline to May 13. The May 13 order formally instituted proceedings under Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The U.S. SEC solicited public comments to evaluate whether these changes aligned with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. In January, Cboe and VanEck also filed for in-kind creations and redemptions for their spot Bitcoin ETFs. In April, a BlackRock delegation led by the Head of Regulatory Affairs, Benjamin Tecmire, met with the U.S. SEC‚Äôs Crypto Task Force to iron out matters regarding the potential of allowing future in-kind redemptions and creations for crypto ETFs. However, Fang claimed that there was no difference between the cash model and the revised in-kind model from the investor‚Äôs point of view. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-26T06:25:54,"Bitcoin's Bull Case Strengthens as Dollar Index Slides, Nvidia Hits Record High Amid Recession Cues","Bitcoin's BTC price has rebounded nearly 10% from weekend lows, with key developments in traditional markets supporting the case for continued gains ahead. The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major fiat currencies, dropped to 97.27 early Thursday, the lowest level since February 2022, according to data source TradingView. The decline follows growing calls for a July Fed rate cut and disappointing data on housing and consumer confidence. The weakening of the dollar, a global reserve currency, tends to ease financial conditions, galvanizing increased risk-taking in financial markets. ""DXY [is] now at the lowest level since March 2022. Very bullish implications for global money supply growth and bitcoin,"" Andre Dragosch, director, head of research - Europe at Bitwise, said on X. BTC and NVDA correlation Meanwhile, shares in Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things AI and emerging technologies, rose 4%.33% Wednesday, hitting a record high of $154.30. Both NVDA and BTC bottomed out in late 2022 and have been in an uptrend ever since. As of the time of writing, the 90-day correlation coefficient between NVDA and BTC was 0.80, indicating a strong positive relationship between the two assets. NVDA's record high came a day after the Nasdaq futures formed a bullish golden cross, signaling a continued risk-on rally. Bonds teasing recession The yield on the U.S. two-year note, which is more sensitive to interest rate expectations, dropped to 3.76% early today, the lowest since May 2. The yield has declined by 24 basis points this month. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has declined by 16 basis points to 4.27%. As such, the spread between the 10- and two-year yields has widened in a move known as the steepening of the yield curve. Historically, recessions have begun with the two-year yield falling alongside a steepening of the yield curve, as noted by wealth advisor Kurt S. Altrichter on X. ""We‚Äôre not there yet, but we‚Äôre dancing on the edge. The 10Y-2Y spread is bull-steepening. If the 2Y breaks lower, it signals the Fed has lost control. That‚Äôs your cue. Watch it closely,"" Altrichter said . Consumer expectations signal an impending recession Consumer confidence dropped last month to a reading of 93, registering a 5.4-point decline from May, with Republican party respondents leading the decline, according to data released by the Conference Board on Tuesday. More importantly, the expectations index, which represents the short-term outlook, slipped to 69, well below the 80 threshold that typically signals an impending recession. Traders price in Fed rate cuts These developments, coupled with the oil price slide and the talk of a July rate cut by some Fed officials, have likely prompted traders to price in an early rate cut by the Fed. According to the CME's FedWatch tool. According to Bloomberg , interest rate swaps are now pricing around four basis points of easing into the July Fed meeting, up from near zero a week ago. Furthermore, traders anticipate a combined 60 basis points of easing over the remaining four meetings this year, up from 45 basis points a week ago.

2025-06-26T06:22:19,"U.S. agency directs mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider crypto assets","Crypto holdings could soon count toward U.S. mortgages under a new directive by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In a directive issued by FHFA director William J. Pulte on June 25, the agency instructed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals for including cryptocurrency holdings in single-family mortgage risk assessments.¬†Previously, digital assets have not been included in mortgage lenders‚Äô risk models unless they are converted to fiat. This policy marks a major shift in the way borrower reserves may be assessed, possibly enabling crypto assets to be considered when approving loans without first being converted into U.S. dollars. Before implementation, each institution must submit board-approved proposals. Only holdings that can be verified on regulated U.S. exchanges will be taken into consideration. After significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump‚Äôs vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, today I ordered the Great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage. SO ORDERED pic.twitter.com/Tg9ReJQXC3 ‚Äî Pulte (@pulte) June 25, 2025 The directive called for extra protections to ensure sound underwriting practices and take market volatility into account. Critics have pointed out that the measure does not include self-custodied assets, which might prevent crypto-native users who value decentralization from participating. You might also like: Trump-backed World Liberty Financial plans USD1 stablecoin audit and new app launch Concerns have also been raised about Pulte‚Äôs family‚Äôs cryptocurrency ties. As of January 2025, his spouse reportedly owned between $500,000 and $1 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ). Although there are no accusations of misconduct, the timing has sparked questions about potential conflicts of interest. This is not the first time crypto has been accepted as legitimate collateral in U.S. financial systems. In June, JPMorgan Chase began accepting spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, such as BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust, as loan collateral. Despite not being directly related to cryptocurrency, the exposure represents a big change in policy for a major traditional bank. Federally chartered cryptocurrency bank Anchorage Digital also offers crypto-backed loans through its collaboration with Arch Lending, accepting Solana, Ethereum ( ETH ), and Bitcoin as collateral. At the same time, BlackRock‚Äôs tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, is now accepted as collateral for institutional trading on exchanges like Deribit and Crypto.com. These developments show that traditional finance is becoming more comfortable using digital assets as collateral. With the adoption of the FHFA‚Äôs crypto directive, crypto-backed mortgages may become a standard in U.S. housing finance, giving holders of digital assets access to greater financial inclusion.

2025-06-26T06:02:15,"Ninth Solana ETF filing lands as Invesco and Galaxy submit S-1","Invesco and Galaxy have become the ninth issuer to file for a spot Solana ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to a June 26 filing , Invesco and Galaxy‚Äôs proposed fund will offer direct exposure to Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Following the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the proposed Solana fund would hold the asset directly under a commodity trust structure. The fund would trade under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúQSOL‚Äù on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with Coinbase Custody set to act as custodian for the underlying Solana assets. The ETF may also stake a portion of its SOL holdings to earn additional token rewards, which would be treated as income to the trust. Wednesday‚Äôs submission is a Form S-1 registration statement, which informs the commission of the intent to launch a new security. However, before the ETF can be listed, Invesco and Galaxy must also file a Form 19b-4, which proposes a rule change and initiates the formal review process. The SEC will then determine whether the product meets regulatory standards under the Securities Exchange Act.

Other applicants that have filed for Solana ETFs, including VanEck, Bitwise, Grayscale, and Fidelity, are already awaiting SEC review as momentum builds around altcoin ETFs. So far, the SEC has delayed decisions on several Solana ETF applications and has since requested updates from issuers, but has not ruled out eventual approval. The final decision deadline on many of these filings falls in October. However, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have speculated the SEC may act on Solana ETF applications as early as July, with a 90% likelihood of approval. As of now, altcoin ETFs remain unapproved in the United States, with current spot approvals limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the existence of CME-listed Solana futures and growing institutional interest in the asset have strengthened the case for a spot product.

2025-06-26T06:00:05,"Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‚ÄòOpportunity‚Äô","On-chain data shows new investors have been coming into Chainlink (LINK) as the MVRV Ratio signals a potential long-term opportunity for the asset. Chainlink Has Seen Its Total Holder Count Reach A New High In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Total Amount of Holders metric for Chainlink. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses on the LINK network that are carrying some non-zero balance. Related Reading: Tron‚Äôs 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Who Was Behind It Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the value of the metric has changed during the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Total Amount of Holders observed an inflection point earlier this year and has since been climbing up at a notable rate. This suggests that new non-empty wallets are popping up on the network. This kind of trend can arise due to a number of reasons. Fresh investors coming into the space or old ones who sold before making a return naturally contribute to an increase in the indicator. Another factor could be existing users creating new wallets to distribute their holdings or for privacy purposes. In general, all of these could be assumed to be occurring simultaneously to a degree whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. As such, the recent uptrend in the metric could indicate that some net adoption (that is, the influx of new investors) has steadily been taking place for Chainlink. Over the past month, 7,903 new non-zero balance addresses have joined the chain, bringing the Total Amount of Holders to a fresh all-time high (ATH) of 769,380. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data of another indicator: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. This metric basically compares how the value held by the BTC investors (the market cap) compares against the value put in by them (the realized cap). In other words, the indicator tells us about the profit-loss balance of the holders. Here, the version of the MVRV Ratio that‚Äôs relevant is the 365-day version, capturing the situation of the investors who bought their coins within the past year. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound From the graph, it‚Äôs visible that the 1-year MVRV Ratio of Chainlink is currently sitting at a negative 17.3%, an indication that these traders are, on average, holding a loss of 17.3%. Generally, however, investors being underwater isn‚Äôt actually a bad thing for the cryptocurrency. This is because holders in profit are the ones more likely to participate in selling. As such, Santiment notes that the trend in the 365-day MVRV Ratio could suggest the asset‚Äôs ‚Äúlong-term investing timeframe is in an opportunity zone.‚Äù LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading around $13.15, up more than 2% in the last seven days.

2025-06-26T05:54:33,"Online Bank SoFi Brings Back Crypto Trading, Eyes Cross-Border Blockchain Payments","SoFi Technologies is making a return to the cryptocurrency space, less than a year after stepping away due to regulatory hurdles. Key Takeaways: SoFi has reentered the crypto market with trading, remittances, and future DeFi tools. The platform plans to offer stablecoins, staking, and asset-backed borrowing to users. Regulatory shifts in the U.S. have opened the path for SoFi‚Äôs renewed crypto strategy. The US-based online banking platform announced Wednesday that it is reintroducing crypto trading and launching blockchain-based international remittances as part of a broader expansion into digital assets. SoFi users will soon be able to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies through their accounts, with future plans to offer stablecoin products, crypto-backed loans, and staking features. SoFi Plans Asset-Backed Borrowing and Expanded Payment Options The company said it aims to create a more comprehensive digital finance experience by expanding payment options and introducing asset-backed borrowing. CEO Anthony Noto said SoFi is ‚Äúvery excited‚Äù to leverage blockchain technology across its operations. The planned remittance service will convert fiat to crypto, transmit funds over blockchain rails, and reconvert them into local fiat on the receiving end. ‚ÄúThis is just day one,‚Äù Noto said, hinting at long-term plans involving crypto, blockchain, and artificial intelligence to improve financial accessibility and cost-efficiency. SoFi‚Äôs crypto reboot coincides with projections of rapid industry growth, with the fintech blockchain market expected to reach $49 billion by 2030, up from $3.4 billion in 2024, according to Insider. The firm‚Äôs Galileo platform will support third-party crypto infrastructure, including wallets and custody services, positioning SoFi as a serious contender in the expanding digital finance ecosystem. Very excited about the innovation we can drive via blockchain and crypto across our businesses. @Sofi ‚Äòs planned new international payments (frequently called remittances) will convert fiat to crypto, transmit via blockchain, and convert to local fiat. It's only day 1 of the type‚Ä¶ https://t.co/KIIyXMEHJo ‚Äî Anthony Noto (@anthonynoto) June 25, 2025 SoFi exited the crypto space in late 2023 after securing its bank charter, agreeing to the withdrawal under tighter regulatory conditions. However, recent shifts in Washington, such as advancing stablecoin legislation and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rollback of ‚Äúreputational risk‚Äù assessments, have opened the door for traditional banks to work more closely with crypto firms. Shares of SoFi Technologies (SOFI) have climbed roughly 12% over the past week, reflecting renewed investor interest in its pivot back to crypto-enabled services. Venture Capital Backing For Crypto Payment Services on the Rise Earlier this year, crypto payment firm RedotPay closed a $40 million Series A funding round , led by Lightspeed with key investments from HSG, Galaxy Ventures, and other prominent investors including DST Global Partners, Accel, and Vertex Ventures. RedotPay‚Äôs funding round came shortly after crypto payments firm Mesh raised $82 million in a Series B funding round to expand its blockchain-based settlement network globally. The round was led by Paradigm, with participation from ConsenSys, QuantumLight, Yolo Investments, Evolution VC, Hike Ventures, Opportuna, and AltaIR Capital. Notably, most of the investment was settled using PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD stablecoin, highlighting the growing role of stablecoins in financial transactions. Venture capital firms are increasingly backing projects focused on stablecoin services and financial infrastructure. The sector‚Äôs potential was further underscored by payments giant Stripe‚Äôs acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion last year, signaling strong institutional interest in blockchain-based financial solutions.

2025-06-26T05:32:01,"US Government Opens Door to Crypto Backed Mortgages","The United States is making major strides toward integrating cryptocurrency into mainstream financial policy. This is a major shift in federal housing finance and aligns with President Donald Trump‚Äôs vision of positioning the US as a leader in crypto innovation. Only cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated centralized exchanges will be considered to ensure compliance. On the other hand, the UK is tightening restrictions. Barclays announced a ban on crypto purchases via its credit cards, due to consumer protection concerns. On the legislative front, Senator Cynthia Lummis is very optimistic that two key crypto bills ‚Äî the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts ‚Äî could pass by year-end. Overall, these developments shed some light on growing divergence in regulatory approaches between the US and UK during a time of global institutional adoption of digital assets. FHFA Backs Crypto for Home Loans The US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals for recognizing cryptocurrency as a form of asset in mortgage loan risk assessments. In a letter that was issued Wednesday, FHFA director William J. Pulte instructed the two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to explore incorporating crypto holdings into risk assessments for single-family mortgage loans without requiring conversion of those assets into US dollars. This is a big shift in federal housing policy, as digital assets have typically not been factored into traditional mortgage evaluations unless liquidated into fiat currency. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under federal conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis, and are key players in the US housing finance system. Their ability to purchase mortgages from lenders has long helped maintain liquidity and stability in the housing market. Pulte explained that the move comes after extensive study and aligns with President Donald Trump's vision of positioning the US as a global hub for crypto innovation. Importantly, Pulte‚Äôs letter specifies that only cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated centralized exchanges and subject to relevant laws should be considered. This cautious approach ensures regulatory compliance while acknowledging the growing role of crypto in the financial ecosystem. The decision was made amid broader trends indicating increasing institutional acceptance of digital assets as legitimate collateral. JPMorgan , for instance, is preparing to let some of its wealth management clients use crypto-based financial products like Bitcoin ETFs as collateral for financing. Additionally, Coinbase Derivatives and clearinghouse Nodal Clear are planning to make Circle‚Äôs USDC stablecoin eligible as collateral for futures trading beginning next year. While crypto-backed mortgages are still a niche offering, their use is expanding. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Bitcoin lending platform Ledn, said that many crypto investors have successfully leveraged Bitcoin and Ethereum to purchase property without having to sell their holdings. Barclays Blocks Crypto Credit Card Purchases While US financial institutions might be opening up to crypto, Barclays, one of the United Kingdom‚Äôs leading banks, will begin blocking cryptocurrency transactions made through its Barclaycard credit cards starting Friday. This is due to the inherent risks tied to digital assets. The bank stated that the move is driven by concerns over the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies and the lack of regulatory protections for consumers. According to a notice on its website, Barclays stated that falling crypto prices could leave customers in unmanageable debt, especially given that crypto assets are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if something goes wrong. A notice of Barclays website Barclays allowed crypto purchases via its credit cards since at least 2018, giving customers access to crypto markets through major exchanges. Their latest announcement is a huge reversal in policy from a bank that services over five million credit card accounts in the UK. The ban comes during a time of broader debate in the UK over whether additional restrictions should be imposed on using credit to purchase cryptocurrencies. On May 2, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a discussion paper seeking feedback on whether these kinds of transactions should face tighter controls. The Payments Association, a London-based group representing the payments industry, responded critically to the FCA‚Äôs suggestion by arguing that it unfairly likens crypto investments to gambling. They pointed out that consumers should have the autonomy to make informed financial decisions within existing credit limits. The Payments Association also mentioned that credit card restrictions already exist for high-risk investments, including crypto. In some cases, banks even block cash purchases of crypto, making credit cards a last resort for some users. However, buying digital assets with a credit card can come at a steep cost. Bankrate reports that many credit card issuers categorize these transactions as cash advances, which often result in higher fees and interest rates. GENIUS and CLARITY Acts Gain Momentum Part of the reason why the US is warming up to crypto could be its recent regulatory progress. In fact, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis said she expects Congress to pass two major crypto bills related to stablecoins and digital asset market structure by the end of 2025. At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Lummis shared some details about the ongoing progress of the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act in the House of Representatives and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in the Senate. While she hopes the legislation will pass before the end of this calendar year, she stated she would be ‚Äúextremely disappointed‚Äù if they were not passed by 2026. Lummis chairs the Senate Banking Committee‚Äôs digital asset subcommittee, and acknowledged the political difficulty of securing bipartisan support for crypto bills. At a hearing on Tuesday, she pointed out concerns that legislation might benefit individuals with connections to the current administration. She believes it is very important to ensure both sides of the aisle feel involved in the process to avoid partisan resistance. While some Democrats have supported crypto-related legislation, including the GENIUS Act ‚Äî which passed the Senate with 68 votes, 18 from Democrats ‚Äî others are still a bit hesitant . Their concerns center around President Donald Trump‚Äôs growing involvement in the crypto sector, including his issuance of meme coins, his ties to the crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and political donations from digital asset industry executives. The path to passage in the House is still uncertain. Lummis‚Äôs timeline contrasts with that of Bo Hines, executive director of the President‚Äôs Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, He predicted in May that the GENIUS Act could be ready before the congressional recess in August. Trump is also ready to sign the bill without amendments if it passes swiftly through the House. However, with Republicans holding only a slim majority, both the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts will need at least some Democratic support to move forward.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9711/us-government-opens-door-to-crypto-backed-mortgages,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Donald Trump‚Äôs Shortlist Just Dropped appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tensions between Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell are heating up again. With Powell‚Äôs term set to end in May 2026, Trump is reportedly thinking about announcing a replacement much earlier. According to Wall Street Journal journalist Nick Timiraos , Trump is frustrated with how slowly the Fed is cutting interest rates. However, naming someone too early could backfire, as that person might face more public pressure and be less likely to get the job in the end. Who is the Next FED Chair?

On the rise in his considerations for Fed Chair are loyalists but with their own‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Brian Schwartz (@schwartzbWSJ) June 25, 2025 While Trump hasn‚Äôt officially named his pick, he said during a NATO summit press conference that he‚Äôs narrowed it down to ‚Äúthree or four people.‚Äù Among the top contenders are known Trump loyalists: Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, Chris Waller, and David Malpass. Additionally, Scott Bessent is being pushed as a strong candidate. These candidates are seen as more likely to support Trump‚Äôs push for faster rate cuts and stronger economic growth. [post_titles_links postid=‚Äù474867‚Ä≥] Can Trump Fire Jerome Powell ? Even though Trump has hinted at firing Powell, it‚Äôs not that simple. A recent Supreme Court ruling confirmed that the Fed operates differently from other government agencies, which means Powell‚Äôs job is more secure. During his first term, Trump also thought about removing Powell but backed off after markets reacted badly. This time, he‚Äôs been more open, even posting online that he ‚Äúmight change [his] mind‚Äù about firing him. A Battle Over FED Interest Rates The disagreement between Trump and Powell mainly revolves around interest rates and inflation. Trump wants the Fed to cut rates to help the economy grow, but Powell is holding firm, saying Trump‚Äôs tariff plans could drive up prices. With only 11 months left in Powell‚Äôs term, the decision on who leads the Fed next could have a big impact on the U.S. economy, especially if Trump returns to the White House. In short, Trump wants change at the top of the Fed, but legal limits, market reactions, and careful timing could make that tricky.

Invesco ETF Filing ‚Äì A Clear Tailwind for Solana Per the S-1 registration statement, Invesco has proposed the planned ETF to directly hold Solana, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. The fund will be traded under the ticker symbol QSOL. The recent flurry of filings to track the price of Solana, the sixth-largest crypto by market cap, sets off a wave of optimism across the sector that saw Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals and BTC‚Äôs new highs in the recent past.

2025-06-26T05:00:44,"Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Attracting Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors Away From Solana and Litecoin","Analysts are closely watching MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential breakout candidate, with many drawing parallels between its current trajectory and the historic rallies of Solana and Litecoin. This article explores why experts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could mirror the explosive growth of these established cryptocurrencies, and what each project brings to the evolving crypto landscape. The Rise of Solana and Litecoin Solana has become a standout performer in the crypto market, recently surging more than 40% toward the $200 milestone. Its rally is driven by strong technical indicators‚Äîsuch as bullish EMA crossovers and clearing of key resistance levels‚Äîalongside robust on-chain activity and rising institutional interest. Solana‚Äôs ecosystem continues to expand, with increasing use in payments and stablecoin settlement, solidifying its position as a top-tier Layer 1 blockchain. However, as Solana‚Äôs market cap grows, analysts note that the potential for massive early-stage returns diminishes, prompting investors to seek new, high-upside opportunities. Litecoin, often dubbed ‚Äúdigital silver,‚Äù is experiencing a resurgence in 2025. With reduced transaction fees, a strong history of reliability, and renewed interest from ETF-related speculation, Litecoin is attracting both long-term holders and traders looking for stability with upside potential. Its price hovers around $85, supported by healthy trading volumes and a loyal user base. Like Solana, Litecoin is considered a blue-chip asset, but its growth prospects are now seen as more incremental compared to early-stage projects. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a focal point for investors seeking the next big asymmetric return. Analysts highlight several reasons for its bullish outlook: Scarcity-Driven Model: MAGACOIN FINANCE features a capped supply (ranging from 100 billion to 170 billion tokens, depending on the source), with a significant portion reserved for presale. This scarcity is designed to drive demand as the project matures. Transparency and Security: The project‚Äôs smart contracts have been audited by HashEx, providing confidence to investors wary of the risks common in meme and presale tokens. Community and Narrative: MAGACOIN FINANCE has cultivated a hyper-engaged community and leverages a politically charged narrative, which resonates with investors seeking alternatives to traditional crypto assets. Its rapid presale sellouts and growing holder base signal strong grassroots momentum. Early-Stage Upside: With the token still priced under $0.01 and not yet listed on major exchanges, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the kind of early entry point that historically precedes massive rallies. Analysts project potential returns of 25x to 50x or more, with some models even suggesting the possibility of a $1 valuation if momentum continues. Strategic Capital Rotation As Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilize at higher price levels, investors are rotating capital into established altcoins like Litecoin and high-upside presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. This trend reflects a broader market strategy: balancing reliable blue-chip exposure with the asymmetric return potential of early-stage tokens. Analysts see MAGACOIN FINANCE as uniquely positioned to benefit from this rotation. Its combination of scarcity, transparency, and community-driven growth mirrors the early days of Solana and Litecoin, but with the added advantage of being in its infancy. As the crypto market matures, the window for transformative gains narrows‚Äîmaking MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the few remaining opportunities for investors seeking to replicate the massive rallies of previous cycles. In summary MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention not just for its novelty, but for its structural strengths and strategic timing. With Solana and Litecoin serving as both inspiration and cautionary benchmarks, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands at the intersection of community enthusiasm , scarcity, and early-stage potential‚Äîmaking it a compelling candidate for the next big crypto rally.

2025-06-26T05:00:31,"Bitcoin Eyes $120K? Analyst Reveals What Comes After BTC‚Äôs 50-Day EMA Breakout","Bitcoin has resumed its upward movement, maintaining strength above the $107,000 level as market momentum builds toward the asset‚Äôs recent all-time high above $111,000. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $107,242, reflecting a 1.3% gain over the past 24 hours and a 2.7% rise in the past week. The market‚Äôs rebound comes after a brief dip last weekend, suggesting that investor confidence remains resilient heading into the next potential leg up. Contributing to the bullish outlook, CryptoQuant analyst ƒ∞brahim CO≈ûAR recently highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs successful reclaim of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which he described as a key level to track for short-term price trends. Related Reading: Fast-Tracking A Bitcoin Rally: Expert Identifies 3 Bullish Catalysts Bitcoin Reclaims Key Technical Level, Eyes $120K Potential According to CO≈ûAR, the 50-day EMA often acts as dynamic support during corrections, and regaining this level typically precedes a price rally. In past cycles, similar conditions have led to gains between 10% to 20% shortly after the level was reclaimed. CO≈ûAR further noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs reclaim of the 50-day EMA occurred after a short-lived breakdown, which was quickly reversed with three consecutive daily closes above the level. This technical setup mirrors previous instances that preceded substantial upward moves. CO≈ûAR also cautioned that while the technical structure favors continued gains, geopolitical uncertainties, especially involving the US, Israel, and Iran, could introduce sudden volatility. As a result, he advised market participants to avoid leveraged positions in the short term and remain prepared for potential price swings. CO≈ûAR wrote: That said, geopolitical developments‚Äîparticularly any positive or negative news involving the U.S., Israel, and Iran‚Äîcould trigger sudden volatility in BTC‚Äôs price. Please avoid using leverage during this period and remain cautious in the face of potential market swings. Further Into Technicals: Analyst Points to Bullish Flag Adding to the conversation, independent crypto analyst Captain Faibik suggested that Bitcoin‚Äôs price pattern is forming a bullish flag, a common continuation pattern in technical analysis. According to Faibik, while the structure indicates a likely breakout, a final corrective dip to the $97,000‚Äì$98,000 range may occur before upward momentum resumes.

2025-06-26T05:00:05,"Wait‚ÄîRipple Came Before Bitcoin? Newly Uncovered Document Says So","Ripple‚Äôs backstory just got a little twist. According to a set of emails from 2014, early notes on what became Ripple go as far back as 2004. That‚Äôs four years before Satoshi Nakamoto put out the Bitcoin whitepaper. These emails, shared by XRP community figure SMOQE, feature comments from tech writer Reutzel Bailey and industry insider Jeffrey Cliff. They hint that Ripple‚Äôs seed was planted long before anyone mined the very first bitcoin block in January 2009. Email Exchange Raises Timeline Questions In the 2014 thread, Bailey points out that Ryan Fugger first sketched out a payment system in 2004. Back then, it wasn‚Äôt meant to be a public, mined cryptocurrency. It was called RipplePay, and it let folks move value without banks. Bailey says Chris Larsen later saw Bitcoin‚Äôs buzz and steered Ripple in a crypto direction. Cliff jumps in to stress that Ripple‚Äôs idea ‚Äúpredates Bitcoin,‚Äù though he argues it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcopycat math-based currency‚Äù riding on Bitcoin‚Äôs hype. 2014 E-mails confirm: ‚ÄúRipple is older than Bitcoin.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/9c8cOF4065 ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 24, 2025 RipplePay‚Äôs Early Vision Based on reports, Fugger‚Äôs 2004 project aimed to speed up payments between trusted parties. It leaned on digital trust rather than mining. Transactions were approved by a small group of validators‚Äînot by open mining. That setup made it fast, but also private. It wasn‚Äôt until 2011 that developers began talking about an open network, one anyone could join to validate deals, rather than a gated club. XRP Ledger Emerges In 2012 In 2011, Jed McCaleb teamed up with Arthur Britto and David Schwartz to code what they called the XRP Ledger . They wanted a version of Bitcoin that skipped proof-of-work. By 2012, Fugger passed the torch, and McCaleb, Larsen and others launched NewCoin. The name switched to OpenCoin in 2013, then to Ripple in 2015. Based on the timeline, XRP the token went live in 2012‚Äîthree years after Netflix hit 1 million subscribers in the US, and about 10 years before McCaleb sold his last coins in 2022. Token Gifts And Executive Moves When XRP started, its founders gifted 80 billion tokens to the company. McCaleb got 9.5 billion XRP of that stash. He agreed to sell his holdings bit by bit to avoid sudden market shocks. His final XRP sales wrapped up in 2022. After exiting, he helped start Stellar. Larsen stayed on and today leads Ripple as its chairman. Even though Bitcoin gets the credit as the first real cryptocurrency, Ripple actually laid the groundwork years earlier ‚Äì at least according to the document ‚Äî showing that the dream of sending value without a middleman was already taking shape.

2025-06-26T04:39:11,"Profitability Metrics Reveal Diverging Sentiment Across Top Cryptocurrencies","Fresh on-chain data that keeps track of the percentage of total supply in profit provides a revealing look into the health and sentiment of the crypto market‚Äôs largest players. This metric approximates what part of a cryptocurrency‚Äôs circulating supply is currently held at a profit (the current market price is higher than the average price at which holders acquired their tokens). The new data comes from Glassnode, a crypto analytics firm that provides on-chain insight into the market. The information reveals that Bitcoin and Ethereum lead by a wide margin, with the vast majority of their holders comfortably in the green. In the meantime, coins such as Cardano and Chainlink are lagging behind, with more than half of their supply underwater. These figures not only indicate the market‚Äôs current dynamics but also suggest possible directions for future price action. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead With High Confidence‚ÄîAnd Some Caution At the top of the list, with a staggering 94.5% of its circulating supply currently in profit, is bitcoin. This means that nearly 19 out of every 20 BTC in existence is held by someone who purchased it at a price lower than that of today. Such a percentage is rather indicative of strong market confidence. Most holders are in the green and very likely maintaining their positions in the face of minor price dips. Ethereum is not far behind; 88.7% of its supply is in profit. When one looks at the numbers for BTC and ETH together, they depict a scene where the market has handsomely rewarded both long-term holders and late-cycle buyers. Historically, moments of this kind have coincided with periods of high momentum and bullish sentiment. Nonetheless, there‚Äôs a catch. When profit-taking becomes widespread‚Äîand in nearly all cases, the nearly all holders are sitting on gains‚Äîthat very fact leads to increased selling pressure. Not a guaranteed trigger for a correction, of course, but such metrics are often viewed as a signal that the local market could be reaching a top, especially if momentum is fading or adverse macroeconomic conditions are emerging. Mid-Tier Coins Show Mixed Sentiment and Slower Recovery XRP and Dogecoin further down the list take on a more moderate look. XRP has 65.1% of its supply in profit, and Dogecoin follows closely at 64.7%. These two figures suggest that a majority of holders are in the green, but a significant portion‚Äîroughly one in three‚Äîare still waiting to break even or return to profitability. The split profile underscores a much less even performance during the past several market cycles. The two assets have seen their share of wild volatility and hype thanks to the media, but haven‚Äôt consistently managed to generate (or maintain) the upward price movement that seems (or seemed) baked into the price forecasts for Bitcoin or Ethereum. The middle-ground profitability of these mid-cap crypto assets could be an inflection point for investors in them. They seem almost to be on the verge of being profitable, yet they are under far less immediate profit-taking pressure than Bitcoin and Ethereum. If the mid-cap assets have a rally, that confidence that was restored in 2020 could very quickly see sidelined capital re-engaging with these assets. Cardano and Chainlink Hold the Most ‚ÄúUnderwater‚Äù Supply Chainlink and Cardano are at the lower end of the list. Only 59.4% of LINK‚Äôs supply is in profit, and just 46.5% of ADA‚Äôs‚Äîmeaning that more than half of Cardano‚Äôs holders are currently sitting at a loss. These numbers reflect a more bearish sentiment, and that indeed holds for a few cryptos right now . . . an amount of frustration over the long term growing among the holders who bought during the previous peaks. But this could position ADA and LINK as potential high-reward plays when the market again moves into a bullish phase, which is certainly not being ruled out at this point. When a lower percent of supply is in profit, it also suggests that the market might be in some form of seller exhaustion, where the weak hands have already dumped their holdings and the remainder of the market is long-term bullish. Additionally, with such a large portion of the supply held at a loss, there is less incentive for immediate profit-taking during a price recovery. This leaves more room for a sustained uptick in prices once demand comes back. Here is the Percent of Total Supply in Profit for six top-cap cryptocurrencies. This metric tracks the percentage of each asset‚Äôs circulating supply currently held at a profit (meaning the market price is higher than the average on-chain acquisition price). As of the latest‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/2jBKekDMnH ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 24, 2025 Even though Bitcoin and Ethereum may appear to be artificially inflated at present, cryptocurrencies like Cardano might be more promising simply because today‚Äôs prices may not be reflective of their true value. The reason for this is that today‚Äôs prices for Cardano‚Äîand other similar coins‚Äîare also significantly lower than their all-time highs. Conclusion The metric of the Percent of Supply in Profit is more than just a historical snapshot. It offers a psychological map of the market. Right now, Bitcoin and Ethereum are both flying high. This is good for sentiment but raises caution flags around potential corrections. As for the mid-tier assets like XRP and Dogecoin, they strike a more balanced appearance when it comes to the outlook. Finally, these two projects, Cardano and Chainlink, look beaten down in the market. But there‚Äôs potential there‚Äîin terms of a recovery that could happen.

2025-06-26T04:36:00,"Metaplanet Scoops Up 1,234 More BTC, Holdings Reach 12,345","Metaplanet has added another 1,234 Bitcoin to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to 12,345 BTC, as the Japanese firm continues to ramp up its ambitious digital asset strategy. The latest acquisition, confirmed in a filing on Thursday, reflects the company‚Äôs ongoing pivot toward Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The purchase adds to a string of high-profile moves by Metaplanet this month, including the launch of its sweeping ‚Äú555 Million Plan,‚Äù aimed at raising $5.4b to buy 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027. That figure would represent roughly 1% of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs fixed 21m supply. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,234 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 12,345 BTC* pic.twitter.com/ppeGIrfVfe ‚Äî Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 26, 2025 With 54M New Shares Issued, Metaplanet Intensifies Its Push To Corner 1% Of Bitcoin‚Äôs Total Supply On June 24, Metaplanet announced it had raised more than $517m on the first day of the 555m Plan through the issuance of 54m shares. That equity was exercised by EVO Fund under an earlier stock acquisition rights agreement. Thursday‚Äôs filing reveals that Metaplanet acquired Bitcoin at an average price of ¬•15,617,281 per BTC, which translates to about $107,900. The scale of the latest buy cements Metaplanet‚Äôs position as one of the largest public corporate holders of Bitcoin in Asia. At current prices, the company‚Äôs Bitcoin treasury is worth over $1.3b, according to market trackers. Its holdings are now roughly equivalent to what Tesla held at peak before selling a portion in 2022. Metaplanet‚Äôs Bitcoin Bet Channels MicroStrategy‚Äôs Playbook as Shares Surge The company‚Äôs strategy mirrors that of US-based MicroStrategy, which has turned Bitcoin accumulation into a long-term balance sheet strategy. Like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet has pursued equity-linked funding tools to fuel its BTC acquisitions, positioning the stock as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure in traditional capital markets. Since announcing its Bitcoin pivot in April 2024, Metaplanet‚Äôs shares have surged more than 500%, drawing interest from both retail traders and global investors looking for regulated exposure to the cryptocurrency. The firm, originally a hospitality business, has rebranded its market identity around Bitcoin in recent months, even naming the strategy a ‚Äúcorporate awakening.‚Äù While Metaplanet has not commented on specific future purchase timelines, it has outlined a clear target: to hold more than 200,000 BTC within three years. The company has stated that 96% of all funds raised under the 555M Plan will be allocated toward Bitcoin acquisition, with the remainder used for bond redemptions and yield strategies. With each major purchase, Metaplanet is tightening its alignment with Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term thesis as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.

2025-06-26T04:30:44,"Analysts Reveal MAGACOIN FINANCE Quietly Gaining Momentum Among Ethereum and Bitcoin Traders Eyeing Uniswap","Ethereum and Bitcoin Traders Are Broadening Their Horizons Veteran holders of Ethereum and Bitcoin are beginning to reallocate capital as 2025 unfolds. With Ethereum fluctuating around key resistance zones and Bitcoin consolidating post-rally, many traders are adopting a diversified strategy. Instead of relying solely on large-cap momentum, they are identifying promising altcoin entries that offer untapped growth potential. One project standing out in this shift is MAGACOIN FINANCE ‚Äî a lesser-known altcoin that is beginning to gain traction among serious crypto investors. These early movements are not hype-driven but rather based on structural fundamentals and trader behavior. With both Ethereum and Bitcoin experiencing more modest upside expectations this quarter, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs positioning is drawing sharper focus. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Quiet Accumulation That‚Äôs Gaining Traction Unlike previous meme projects that exploded purely off viral hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been building under the radar ‚Äî and building strong. The project has locked its supply at 170 billion tokens, eliminating dilution risks and giving investors clarity on long-term valuation frameworks. More notably, the code has passed a HashEx audit, boosting confidence among institutional-style traders. Staking has recently gone live, with early participation indicating that buyers are entering with long-term intent. Wallet activity suggests that new entrants are locking tokens rather than flipping them ‚Äî a critical indicator of healthy market structure. This has led analysts to describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as more than a speculative trade; it‚Äôs becoming a strategic hold. Additional elements that are reinforcing investor interest: Token ownership is fully decentralized, with no VC override or insider control. The staking system is live, rewarding early adopters and encouraging retention. A 100% bonus is currently available for new investors using a limited-time access link. Momentum is no longer speculative. On-chain data is showing organic wallet growth, stable concentration patterns, and a healthy transition from early traders to long-term holders. Analysts believe this shift is what separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from earlier meme cycles. Uniswap Watch: A DEX Favorite with Growing Expectations Uniswap recently became the first decentralized exchange (DEX) to surpass $3 trillion in total trading volume, cementing its dominance in the DeFi sector. The platform currently processes around $3.3 billion in daily volume and holds a 23% market share among DEXs, with PancakeSwap trailing at 21%. Despite this achievement, Uniswap‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) has fallen below $5 billion, mirroring a broader contraction in DeFi TVL since 2021. Final Thoughts: Positioning for What Comes Next As Bitcoin and Ethereum take a breather and Uniswap awaits a technical breakout, investors are recalibrating for upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a surprising favorite ‚Äî with fundamentals, participation, and smart tokenomics supporting its momentum. For those seeking an early edge ahead of wider exposure, this project may offer one of the more compelling entry points of the 2025 altcoin market.

More about Moca Chain Moca Chain is more than layer1 protocols like Ethereum and Solana. It is an EVM-compatible, chain-agnostic, modular blockchain for data and identity management. Moca Chain deeply integrates ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) to allow its users to prove the legitimacy of anything without exposing the underlying data. That model guarantees privacy-preserving verification, which is crucial as simple data loss could lead to substantial financial losses as fraudsters dominate the digital assets space. Moca Chain focuses on self-sovereign identity, enabling apps and individuals to manage and move verified data across various platforms without depending on centralized entities. AIR Kit: the gateway to Animoca‚Äôs new identity layer The AIR Kit toolset is at the core of Animoca Chain, aiming to streamline user onboarding. It is the entry point for users and developers, linking them to a platform of user-centric apps and identity protocols. The announcement highlighted: We‚Äôre building the world‚Äôs largest identity network with AIR Kit as the entry point to Moca Chain, where identity protocols and user-centric apps can build on and share a common network of data, users, and applications. MOCA Coin turns bullish on increasing roles and utility Moca Network‚Äôs native token exhibited a bullish stance at press time. It trades at $0.07811, up nearly 10% on its 24-hour price chart. Chart by Coinmarketcap Technical indicators highlight the emerging momentum shift to bullish. For instance, the 4H MACD displays green histograms after an upside crossover with the signal line. Also, the RSI at 58 suggests more room for MOCA gains before overbought conditions surface. MOCA‚Äôs rise is beyond speculative hype ‚Äì driven by bullish prospects as the altcoin anticipates surged use cases. The token will handle various activities on the Moca Chain, including gas payments, incentivizing validators, staking, and possibly governance. That means impressive demand for MOCA as the Moca network grows, especially as more dApps and identity protocols migrate to this identity-centric L1. With testnet scheduled for the third quarter and mainnet in Q4 2025, developers and investors are watching what might become a foundational platform for identity infrastructure.

In the last 24 hours, its price has jumped over 19% to $0.63, with trading volume soaring 153% to $285.65 million. The coin has also climbed to the 1 spot on the trending crypto list. According to analyst Kim H. Wong , this surge is an important milestone for Pi Coin, especially with Pi2Day just three days away. The event is expected to bring updates on the project‚Äôs progress, ecosystem growth, and AI integration. If Pi breaks above the $0.65 resistance, it could quickly rise to the $0.80 to $1 range. With its all-time high at $3 and a recent low of $0.40, Pi Coin still has room to move higher. Source: Coingecko Analyst Joe Swanson added that this breakout is happening exactly as he expected, and it might be the beginning of a longer rally, one that could gain even more strength as Pi2Day 2025 approaches. Technicals Show Bullish Signs for Short-term Pi Network‚Äôs charts show a neutral trend overall, but there are signs of short-term strength. Short-term moving averages (10, 20, and 30-day) are mostly showing buy signals, pointing to a possible upward move. However, the longer-term averages (50 and 100-day) are still flashing sell signs, so the long-term trend remains weak for now. What To Expect On Pi2Day? The rally comes as excitement builds around a possible GenAI announcement on June 28. The Core Team is also expected to reveal major ecosystem updates. Whale activity is also driving the price as one wallet has bought over $173M worth of Pi, likely a big institutional player. The community is waiting for the launch of KYC Sync , making it easier for users to link their ID between the Pi App and Browser. This move pushes millions closer to full Mainnet migration. [post_titles_links postid=‚Äù473564‚Ä≥] Will A Correction Follow Next? However, some analysts warn that Pi‚Äôs recent rally could be short-lived. While hype and technical momentum are driving the surge, a correction may be on the horizon. Additionally, over 268 million PI tokens are set to unlock in July, the biggest release until 2027, which could put downward pressure on the price. Dr. Altcoin recently shared that the recent Israel-Iran ceasefire is a positive signal for Pi. He says that Pi is unlikely to drop below $0.40 and expects a slow rise starting late August as token unlocks decrease.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has officially ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two of America‚Äôs biggest government-backed mortgage companies, to start recognizing cryptocurrency as an asset when people apply for home loans. On social media platform X (formerly Twitter), FHFA Director Bill Pulte announced this decision. He explained that after careful study, and in line with President Trump‚Äôs goal to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must now prepare their businesses to accept cryptocurrency as part of mortgage applications. After significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump‚Äôs vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, today I ordered the Great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage. SO ORDERED pic.twitter.com/Tg9ReJQXC3 ‚Äî Pulte (@pulte) June 25, 2025 In simple terms, this means that if you own crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP, it could be counted as part of your assets when applying for a mortgage backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Why This Matters This is important because it marks the first time U.S. government-supported mortgage firms have officially recognized crypto as a financial asset. Until now, crypto was often seen as too risky or too new for traditional financial products like home loans. Now, with this new rule, it could open the door for millions of crypto holders in the U.S. to use their digital assets to qualify for mortgages. It‚Äôs another clear sign that crypto is becoming more mainstream and accepted by big institutions. What‚Äôs Next? This move will likely push private banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo to follow suit. If government-backed firms are doing it, the private sector won‚Äôt want to be left behind. This could lead to new crypto-related financial products, loans, and services in the near future. There‚Äôs also talk of banks launching their own stablecoins and expanding crypto services like trading and custody for their customers.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-your-bitcoin-help-you-qualify-for-a-home-loan-now-trump-just-said-yes/,"BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T04:00:08,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment","Following a quick drop to nearly $98,000 over the weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered most of its recent losses and is now trading above $107,000 at the time of writing. Fresh on-chain data suggests that the short-term holder (STH) floor for BTC has been steadily rising toward the $100,000 level. Bitcoin STH Floor Approaching $100,000 According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor unchained, Bitcoin‚Äôs STH Realized Price has been making its slow grind up toward the psychologically important $100,000 level. Notably, the analyst had earlier dubbed this metric as the ‚Äúfault line‚Äù to watch. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, the STH Realized Price represents the average price at which all Bitcoin held for less than 155 days was acquired. It acts as both a key psychological and technical support level. When the market price stays above it, STH are in profit and more confident, whereas if it falls below, fear and selling pressure often increase. Currently, the STH Realized Price hovers around $98,000. The analyst notes that each $500 rise in the STH Realized Price effectively resets the ‚Äúnew buyers‚Äô comfort floor.‚Äù As this metric nears six figures, the mental stop-loss for newer investors also moves upward. The following chart illustrates two recent instances where BTC bounced sharply after touching the blue STH Realized Price line. This price action suggests a bullish structure, where selling pressure diminishes as soon as BTC revisits its average cost basis. Meanwhile, the premium ‚Äì the difference between BTC‚Äôs spot price and STH Realized Price ‚Äì currently hovers around 7.2%. A shrinking premium, typically under 10%, has historically signalled reduced market froth and often preceded the next leg up once open interest began to rebuild. On the long-term side, the long-term holder (LTH) Realized Price remains largely unchanged at $32,000, roughly one-third of the STH Realized Price. The analyst observes that these long-term coins are likely held in cold storage, indicating ‚Äústrong hands‚Äù with little incentive to sell. They concluded: The blue line is climbing relentlessly; as long as BTC lives above it, the prevailing tide is still higher-lows, higher-highs. Lose it on a daily close, and we get our first real gut-check since April ‚Äì otherwise the bull engine is merely cooling its cylinders. Experts Predict New High For BTC As BTC‚Äôs STH Realized Price continues to surge higher ‚Äì resulting in a higher floor price for the digital asset ‚Äì several crypto experts seem to agree that the cryptocurrency may soon reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surprise Bears: $100K‚Äì$110K Range Shows Rising Short Interest For instance, Bitcoin is forming a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern on the three-day chart, eyeing a potential ATH of as high as $150,000.
