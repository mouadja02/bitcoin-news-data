2025-06-26T18:50:45,"Coinbase launches regulated alternative to offshore crypto perpetuals","Offshore perpetuals come with counterparty risk, custody concerns, and regulatory uncertainty. Coinbase’s new U.S.-based alternative offers leverage without the baggage, bringing a potential game-changer for cautious but yield-hungry traders. In an a nnouncement on June 26, crypto exchange Coinbase revealed plans to launch U.S. Perpetual-Style Futures on its derivatives platform—marking one of the first regulated attempts to replicate the functionality of offshore perpetual contracts. Slated for a July 21 rollout, the products will feature nano-sized Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) futures with an unusually long five-year expiration, coupled with a funding rate mechanism to maintain alignment with spot prices. Unlike traditional quarterly futures, these contracts will trade 24/7, accrue funding hourly, and settle twice daily. The structure is designed to appeal to both retail and institutional traders seeking perpetual-like exposure without the legal gray areas of offshore venues. You might also like: Judge rejects SEC, Ripple motion on XRP sales and $125m penalty A regulated answer to an offshore dominated market Coinbase’s move is a strategic play to capture a market that has, until now, existed largely in regulatory limbo. Perpetual futures dominate crypto trading globally, accounting for nearly 93% of all crypto derivatives volume, according to Cornell research. Yet U.S. traders have been locked out of this liquidity, forced to either accept clunky, expiration-bound contracts or take their business to offshore exchanges like Bybit and Binance, where regulatory oversight is minimal and counterparty risk remains high. With its new five-year expiring contracts, Coinbase is attempting to repackage the perpetual model in a way that fits within U.S. legal parameters. Unlike traditional futures, which reset quarterly and often drift from spot prices, Coinbase’s contracts apply hourly funding payments to tether positions closely to market rates. Traders pay or receive funding every 12 hours based on long or short positioning, a system borrowed from offshore perpetuals but streamlined for U.S. compliance. The nano sizing (0.01 BTC and 0.10 ETH) lowers the barrier to entry, appealing to retail traders who might otherwise avoid futures entirely. Critically, the five-year expiration is a nod to long-term holders. Most crypto derivatives require rollovers every few months, creating friction for multi-year strategies. By minimizing expiration pressure, Coinbase is betting that traders will prefer holding these contracts over juggling quarterly expiries or risking exposure on offshore platforms. If successful, Coinbase’s initiative could pressure rivals to launch similar hybrid instruments, reshaping the U.S. crypto derivatives landscape.

In May, a scammer called the victim, 68, pretending to represent her bank and claiming that her cards had been compromised, per a press release from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The scammer said a courier would come to collect her old cards and sent a driver from a rideshare company to pick them up. An hour later, the same scammer told the woman that all of her financial accounts had been compromised and sent a second rideshare “courier” to pick up all of her cards. The scammer also obtained the victim’s PINs over the phone and used the stolen cards and her personal info to drain CA$60,000 ($43,687) from her account. Police have tracked down one of the rideshare drivers, who is cooperating with the investigation, but they have been unable to locate the second driver. RCMP investigators say the victim’s cards were driven to the parking lot of a Home Depot, where they were picked up by a man wearing a face covering. The RCMP says it will continue to investigate the crime but notes that the chances of recovering stolen funds are low. Similar “bank courier” scams occurred in New York state earlier this year.

According to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director William Pulte on the social media platform X, mortgage lending giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been told to “count cryptocurrency” as an asset in mortgage loan applications. “After significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump’s vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, today I ordered the Great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage.” Source: William Pulte/X Per the image of the order shared on the social media platform, the only digital assets that will count will be those held on a US-regulated crypto exchange. “U.S. Federal Housing FHFA, as conservator, hereby directs each Enterprise to prepare a proposal for consideration of cryptocurrency as an asset for reserves in their respective single-family mortgage loan risk assessments, without conversion of said cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars.

2025-06-26T18:31:41,"Blockchain-Powered Pokies: How Crypto Payments are Changing Online Slot Play","Online pokies and casino gaming are becoming more and more popular. Thanks to technology, online slot enthusiasts can easily access and enjoy classic and modern pokies with real payouts in a safe environment. So let's take a look at how blockchain and crypto payments in particular, are changing slot play in online pokies. From faster transactions to probably fair gaming, blockchain is reshaping the online slots experience. There are a number of benefits that come with blockchain-powered platforms, including greater security, transparency most importantly, excitement. The evolution of online slots in the age of blockchain Online slots have come a long way since their digital debut in the late 1990s. What started out as a basic, browser-based game with simple graphics and fruit symbols has evolved into immersive experiences. Slot games now feature rich visuals and themes, interactive bonus rounds and progressive jackpots. The integration of blockchain technology marks the next major shift in the industry. The use of decentralised networks and crypto tokens has meant that game developers and casinos are now able to offer players features that were previously impossible. This includes direct crypto wagering, tokenised rewards and smart contract-driven payouts. Blockchain is not just a payment method. It's technology that is completely changing the infrastructure of online gaming platforms, enabling great autonomy and fairness in each and every spin. Enhancing player trust One of the main advantages of using blockchain technology in online casinos is the enhanced trust it offers. Most traditional slot games operate on random number generators (RNGs), but players have historically had to take the casino's word that games are fair. Whereas blockchain has introduced provably fair gaming. This is where the fairness of each spin can be independently verified by players through publicly accessible cryptographic proofs. This level of transparency helps to build confidence among users, knowing they are playing on a platform where manipulation is virtually impossible. This is crucial in the digital world where digital identity is so important and there are so many risks out there. Every spin's outcome is recorded on the blockchain, which has helped to make disputes easier to resolve and also ensures the overall integrity of the game. Faster and safer payments Speed and security have become critical to any online gambling experience. Traditional payment methods like bank transfers or credit cards will often come with delays, fees and in some regions, restrictions on gambling transactions. Whereas blockchain-based casinos allow players to deposit and withdraw using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , Ethereum and stablecoins, which all typically come with near-instant processing times. Cryptocurrency payments are direct; they are peer-to-peer transactions. There are no third parties or intermediaries involved, which means payments tend to be quicker, come with lower fees and come with a reduced risk of fraud or chargebacks. Blockchain payments also come with more privacy, which is perfect for players who are seeking discretion when enjoying online slots. A new gaming ecosystem Beyond payments and fairness, blockchain is driving a new wave of community-driven innovation in the online pokies space. Decentralised casinos and gaming platforms often involve players directly in the decision-making through governance tokens, allowing them to vote on game features, platform updates or promotional campaigns. By participating, a platform can strengthen player loyalty and create an ecosystem where users feel genuinely invested. Plus, collaborations between blockchain developers and game studios are giving rise to unique pokies concepts, from NFT slot themes to cross-game jackpots that link multiple titles across platforms. The growing appeal of classic and modern pokies with real payouts Whether you prefer the nostalgic charm of fruit machines or the thrill of cutting-edge video slots, blockchain-powered platforms cater to a wide audience. They offer everything from simple three-reel games to sophisticated slots with advanced features. Many blockchain platforms incorporate native tokens or loyalty programs too. This has helped to further enhance the value players recieve. These innovations not only help to increase engagement, but also provide new opportunities to win and cash out real rewards securely. So what's next for blockchain integration in online slots The future of blockchain in online slots is full of exciting possibilities. We can expect to see greater adoption of smart contracts, enabling fully automated payouts and bonus triggers. Cross-platform tokens might allow players to transfer balances seamlessly between different casinos or games. Additionally, innovations like NFT-based game assets or community-owned slots could also create more personalised and interactive gaming experiences. Blockchain is completely transforming online slots in a way that benefits both players and operators. From provably fair gaming and faster crypto payments to the emergence of community-driven platforms, the technology is creating a safer, more transparent and engaging experience. As the industry continues to evolve, players can look forward to even greater innovation and opportunity. So whether you're a casual spinner or an experienced slot enthusiast, the future of blockchain-powered pokies promises exciting possibilities on every reel.

2025-06-26T18:30:05,"The Trump Effect: How His Bitcoin (BTC) Treasury Plan Impacts its Race Against Ethereum (ETH)","Donald Trump's approach to managing Bitcoin reserves has sent ripples through the crypto world. This strategic move could shape Bitcoin's standing in its ongoing competition with Ethereum . As the dynamics shift, it raises the question: which cryptocurrency is poised for growth? The article delves into the potential impacts and explores what this means for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin Price Dynamics: Mixed Signals and Clear Price Zones Bitcoin recorded a 1.52% dip over the last month paired with a modest weekly gain of nearly 2.77%, while a robust rise of 14.41% over the past six months marked its extended performance. Price action revealed a period of cautious progress as short-term retracements gave way to an overall upward trend. Oscillator readings have presented mixed signals with softened momentum alongside moderate RSI readings, reflecting a balancing act between upward liquidity and profit-taking pressures. Historical trends indicate Bitcoin has experienced periods of consolidation that allow the market to digest prior highs while paving the way for upcoming bullish rallies. Present trading sees Bitcoin stabilizing between roughly $94,832 and $113,326.8, with significant technical levels anchored at nearest support of $84,880.08 and immediate resistance of $121,869.42. A secondary support around $66,385.41 and resistance at about $140,364.09 further demarcate the battle zones between buyers and sellers. Bulls show promise as indicated by a momentum indicator reading close to 985.37, yet the negative awesome oscillator value near -1,037.44 hints at underlying selling pressure. RSI sits at a balanced 57.36, and mixed technical recommendations necessitate careful trade planning. Trading ideas include seeking long entries near support with measured stops just below the next level, while resistance areas should be watched for potential profit-taking before a sustained move can be confirmed. Ethereum's Recent Downturn and Key Price Levels for Action Ethereum faced a moderate drop of about -3.23% over the past month and a sharper decline of -25.51% in the last six months. Price adjustments have pushed the current range between $1923.57 and $2961.91. This period has seen noticeable loss pressure with overall bearish movements impacting investor sentiment. Monthly and half-year changes indicate that price correction remains the prevailing trend, reflecting market forces that have favored sellers and resulted in significant downtrends that warrant caution among traders. Current prices hover within a tight band, setting the nearest resistance at $3395.40 and the closest support at $1318.72, with a second resistance level at $4433.74 and a deep support around $280.38. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator at -163.45 and Momentum Indicator at -63.69 reflect a market leaning towards bearish pressure, while the Relative Strength Index at 50.11 shows no clear momentum for buyers or sellers. Trading strategies could involve shorting if upward moves stall near resistance while preparing for potential reversals at support levels, advocating for cautious tactics within these ranges amid uncertainties. Conclusion BTC 's potential treasury plan could boost its position. This move may attract more institutional interest. Such backing could drive BTC's value and mainstream acceptance higher. While ETH focuses on improving its ecosystem, BTC may gain a lead in investor confidence. This evolving dynamic will shape the future standings of both cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-26T18:27:52,"Blockchain Smashes the Casino Cage: Your Crypto Keys to a Fairer UK Gamble","Forget clunky old systems. Blockchain is crashing into online gambling, providing UK players with top-notch security, super-fast transactions, and verifiable fairness. This article gives you the real deal. Want to stop relying on blind luck and faceless algorithms when placing an online wager? Blockchain technology is taking over the UK iGaming industry, and it's a bloody time. No doubt, the UK Gambling Commission is on the case, but this tech tango between crypto and entertainment is forging a radically transparent future for your bets. Blockchain Storms the Gaming Arena The magic of blockchain lies in its brutal honesty. Every transaction, every game result is etched onto a decentralized, shared ledger. It's a public record that no one can tamper with - not the casino, not a hacker, nor anyone. And that ends the old dynamic where you cross your fingers and hope the house plays straight. Probable fair systems can change the game for casinos. Verify a roulette spin: With cryptography, platforms give you a hash before you play so you can check the math and be sure the outcome is random. Speed is another advantage - blockchain removes banking middlemen, so deposits can be instant and withdrawals can take minutes. That means lower fees too. All players worldwide can join, but players must register to access licensed casino content in the UK . Smart contracts make payouts and rewards automatic, reducing human errors and delays. Plus, using crypto means your banking details are secret. Licensing: The Rulebook Rewritten for Crypto Mixing volatile crypto with online gambling? Regulators were bound to sit up. The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) isn’t asleep at the wheel. They haven’t outlawed crypto, but licensed operators using it face a regulatory gauntlet. Online security’s come a long way – from flimsy padlocks (SSL) to fortress walls (TLS and 2FA). Blockchain slams on another deadbolt: an immutable transaction history that’s near-impossible to forge. For UK sites flirting with crypto, the UKGC demands ironclad Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) drills. This means grilling players about their crypto’s origin story and deploying hardcore Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, especially for hefty bets. Crucially, your Bitcoin or Ether doesn’t stay crypto for long on UKGC platforms. They swiftly convert it into pounds sterling within your account. This shields your stake from crypto’s infamous rollercoaster rides while you play. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also keeps crypto businesses on a tight leash, demanding registration and rigorous risk controls. It’s a high-wire act: fostering innovation without letting the cowboys in. Why This Tech Tango Wins for UK Players So, what’s actually in it for you, placing bets from Birmingham or Brighton? This isn’t just tech hype; the perks bite hard. Privacy gets a serious shot in the arm. Crypto transactions cloak your real-world financial identity better than traditional methods. Security? Blockchain’s cryptographic muscle makes transactions virtually unhackable. Every quid wagered or won leaves an indelible, verifiable trail – fraud’s nightmare. Speed offers an instant adrenaline rush, with crypto payouts hitting your digital wallet immediately after a win, avoiding lengthy withdrawals. Fees are often minimal, bypassing traditional bank charges. Sticking to UKGC-licensed sites is essential for safety, but some platforms enhance access to global games and offer exclusive bonuses for crypto users. The standout feature? Provable Fairness, giving you the ability to verify that the game is fair. It's a powerful shift in trust. UK Platforms Dipping Toes (and Tokens) in Crypto Hunting for a shouting, full-throttle blockchain casino licensed by the UKGC right now? Keep your shirt on. The regulatory heat means big players prioritise compliance over crowdfunding revolutions. But look closer: a growing crew now quietly accept crypto payments alongside cards and e-wallets. Their UKGC mandate? Prove they can handle crypto’s risks: bulletproof AML/KYC, instant conversion to GBP, and meticulous fund tracking. Pioneers of tokenised economies and DAO-governed casinos often operate in less regulated spaces, unlike the UK, which, despite its caution, could foster responsible innovation. Operators focusing on crypto security, speed, and fairness are poised to lead the next wave. For inspiration, look at ""EVE Frontier,"" a sci-fi MMO with deep Ethereum integration, where players own NFTs like spaceships and trade ERC-20 tokens in a player-run market. This concept suggests a future where gambling platforms could adopt similar decentralised technologies, allowing for player-owned experiences and DAO casinos with token holder votes on the house edge. Crypto Gambling's Next Hand: What’s the Deal? The crypto gamble in the UK is just the first spin. Watch regulators like the UKGC and FCA refine their playbook as the tech evolves . But blockchain’s core strengths of transparency, blistering speed, ironclad security, and giving players real agency align shockingly well with responsible gambling aims. Will provably fair mechanics become the baseline demand, even on fiat sites? You’d bet on it. Fully decentralised platforms, running entirely on-chain via unbreakable smart contracts? They’re the dream, but UK regulatory mountains loom large. Tokenised rewards programs, where your play earns crypto assets you can trade or stake? That’s got legs. And what about those quantum randomness beacons – spooky science magic guaranteeing cosmic-level unpredictability? Could they become the ultimate fairness seal? One thing’s certain: crypto is forcing the industry to lay its cards on the table. Players win when trust is engineered into the system, not just marketed. The tech provides the toolkit. Smart regulation and operator guts will decide if the UK builds the fairest game in town. Place your bets. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The rollout includes 42 games across crash, slots, table games, bingo, and arcade-style formats — all playable in over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), USDT, and USDC. Galaxsys is known for fast-cycle gameplay and transparent mechanics — a natural match for Cloudbet’s high-frequency bettors. Crash leaders like Crash, Crasher, Tower Rush, and Rocketon feature rising multipliers, instant resolution, and peak volatility, with potential payouts reaching up to x700,000. In March, Tower Rush was named “Best Crash Game 2025” at SiGMA Africa — its third industry award after receiving the “Best New Game 2025” accolade at the AIBC Eurasia Awards. “These titles reflect our commitment to quality-first curation,” said Cloudbet’s casino product manager. “They align with how crypto players engage — high-speed formats, scalable risk, and real-money outcomes without delay. Galaxsys understands that rhythm, and the games slot naturally into our most active segments.” Crash games have become a cornerstone of crypto gambling, favored for their rapid pace, minimal friction, and high-volatility structure that mirrors the crypto market itself. The core mechanic — riding a rising multiplier and cashing out before the crash — delivers instant resolution and real-money tension in under ten seconds. That simplicity, combined with scalable risk and always-on access, makes crash an ideal fit for the habits of crypto-native bettors. Cloudbet , which launched in 2013, was one of the first crypto casinos to support crash games at scale. Today, instant-win staples like Aviator by Spribe — which alone accounts for more than 33% of daily activity in the site’s instant-win segment — continue to dominate player engagement. Alongside Aviator, games like Mines, Dice, and Plinko, longstanding Spribetitles in Cloudbet’s lineup, each capture between 8% and 12% of daily activity. The Galaxsysintegration adds depth to the category without overlap or filler content. The Galaxsys drop also includes top-ranking slots like Olympian Legends and Funny Faces, along with table game staples Blackjack, RouletteX, and HiLo. Instant-win fans get fresh options too, with arcade-style picks like Maestro, Magic Dice, CoinFlip, and Ninja Crash. All Galaxsys games are now live. Players can browse, demo, or play — no KYC required. $3,000 Cloudbet x Galaxsys tournament now live To celebrate the launch, Cloudbet is running a $3,000 Galaxsys Tournament.

2025-06-26T18:15:32,"Ex-Blackstone Exec, Tether Co-Founder to Launch $1B Crypto Reserve SPAC","A Bloomberg report has revealed that former Blackstone Inc. executive Chinh Chu and Reeve Collins, co-founder of stablecoin giant Tether, are teaming up to raise $1 billion for a listed crypto vehicle that aims to build a portfolio of digital assets. The capital is being raised through M3 Brigade Acquisition V Corp, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) backed by the two. A Multi-Token Approach Anonymous sources cited in the report said that the vehicle would hold a diversified mix of tokens, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL). They also revealed that the fundraising effort is ongoing, meaning that the details, including the $1 billion target, may change. Cantor Fitzgerald LP is among the parties advising on the deal. Furthermore, Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce in U.S. President Donald Trump’s first administration, has reportedly been tapped to serve as vice chair alongside Binance board chairman Gabriel Abed. The venture will also have ex-Hut 8 Mining head Jaime Leverton as CEO in an acting capacity. Chu and Collins’ multi-token approach is markedly different from that taken by the likes of Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. The former has bought over 592,000 BTC, currently valued at more than $60 billion. The latter now holds 12,345 BTC worth over $1.33 billion and recently passed Tesla to become the seventh-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Meanwhile, others like SharpLink Gaming have taken an Ether-focused approach. The Minneapolis-based company owns 188,478 ETH worth about $457 million and is staking 100% of it to support the Ethereum network. This strategy followed a $425 million private placement led by Consensys and the appointment of Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman. Tether Co-Founder Buys $6.47M SPAC In May 2025, Collins acquired a controlling stake in M3-Brigade for $6.47 million. The deal included 7.19 million Class B shares and 5.04 million private placement warrants, with plans to purchase an additional 3.29 million from Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. Following the transaction, Collins was named CEO, with Chinh coming in as the SPAC’s new president. The crypto entrepreneur, who has also just joined the advisory board of Canadian-listed digital asset ETF company Fineqia, was instrumental in founding Tether, NFT platform BLOCKv, and Smart Media Technologies. He is currently chairman of STBL.com (formerly Pi), a yield-bearing stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum and Solana. This decentralized platform enables yield retention from tokenized RWAs such as U.S. Treasuries and money market funds. Meanwhile, Chu was Blackstone’s longest-serving dealmaker before leaving in 2015. While at the firm, he sponsored several SPACs, including deals for Getty Images and Utz Brands.

2025-06-26T18:05:24,"Crypto Trader Unveils Major Level Ethereum Must Break Above To Trigger Rally, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin","A closely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) has to break through one resistance level to ignite a bull rally. In a new thread, crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 549,100 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum needs to reclaim the area around $2,500 as support before ETH can mount an explosive move to the upside. “After holding the orange circled area for about six full weeks, Ethereum ended up following through on the blue circled scenario. Still, this orange box is the macro range low ($2,200), and price needs to effectively reclaim around $2,500 to rally across the range.” Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst also says that until Ethereum closes above $2,500 on the daily chart, ETH will likely hold $2,200 as support as it trades sideways. “For the time being, Ethereum is treating the ~$2,500 level as resistance after it previously held for almost six weeks. But Ethereum just needs a daily close above ~$2,500 to start the reclaim process. Until then, ETH will meander between $2,200-$2,500.” ETH is trading for $2,425 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is showing bullishness on the daily timeframe, having smashed through a downtrend line for the second time in June. “Bitcoin has broken two two-week downtrends over the past month.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,302 at time of writing, flat on the day.

According to respected crypto analyst Casitrades, this key support line is “everything right now,” and the market’s reaction to it may signal whether XRP is ready to ignite its next leg upward. A Precise Bounce from Key Support XRP recently tapped the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.145—a zone that also marks the apex of its recent consolidation structure. This convergence of technical levels makes $2.145 a vital area to hold in the short term. So far, the price has responded positively, bouncing cleanly off this support, which suggests strength and renewed bullish momentum. Casitrades described this level as “the most critical on the chart, short-term,” warning that a drop below it would indicate weakness . However, XRP is currently holding above it with confidence. “This is the kind of price action you want to see if XRP is serious about continuing this new trend to the upside,” Casitrades wrote. This Trendline Is Everything Right Now! I’ve been tracking this trendline support as the key level to hold and we just got a clean reaction off it. This correction already reached the .382 retracement at $2.145, which also happens to be the apex of consolidation… that’s… pic.twitter.com/bA79dP1c99 — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 25, 2025 The current structure, where price remains above the consolidation range while showing impulsive upward moves, is often a strong sign of trend continuation. Resistance at $2.25: The Next Test As XRP stabilizes above support, attention now turns to the $2.25 resistance level. According to Casitrades, this is the next major hurdle. A breakout above $2.25 would be a bullish confirmation and could open the door to a move toward $2.69—the next Fibonacci retracement target. “Price is now trying to push back toward the $2.25 resistance. That’s the next big test,” Casitrades noted. “If we can flip that level, we’ll likely open the path toward the $2.69 retrace test—and from there, the breakout potential increases dramatically.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A move beyond $2.69 could trigger an even stronger rally, potentially signaling the ignition of a powerful wave 3, typically the most explosive phase in Elliott Wave theory. Momentum Building Across the Market XRP’s price action is unfolding as the broader altcoin market shows signs of revival. With Bitcoin consolidating, many traders are shifting focus to high-potential assets like XRP. Market indicators such as RSI and Stochastic RSI are also aligning in favor of the bulls, hinting at growing upward momentum. Volume is beginning to increase as XRP approaches resistance, suggesting rising interest and accumulation. Meanwhile, the price continues to respect key support levels, reinforcing the bullish structure. For now, all eyes are on whether XRP can clear $2.25 and confirm a breakout. But one thing is clear: as Casitrades rightly said, “This trendline is everything.” How XRP behaves around it could determine the direction of the next major move.

2025-06-26T17:55:52,"XRP 3 Hammers and 3 Rockets, Here’s What’s Next?","Market analyst EGRAG Crypto has projected when the XRP uptrend will resume after identifying what he calls hammers and rockets on the daily chart. His analysis comes on the back of XRP's consolidation phase, which began after a drop from the $3.4 top in mid-January. Specifically, after XRP collapsed from the $3.4 peak , it immediately relinquished the $3 mark and has since consolidated around $2 over the past five months.XRP Sees Hammers and Rockets Within Descending ChannelWhile the broader market takes a similar path, Bitcoin (BTC) has been witnessing new all-time highs . Now, EGRAG believes XRP is on the verge of breaking out of this consolidation phase, calling attention to a descending channel that has prevailed over the daily chart since November 2024.Interestingly, EGRAG's chart shows that XRP's upswings and declines since November have led to what he calls ""3 hammers"" and ""3 rockets."" Specifically, a hammer refers to the resistance presented by the bears when XRP attempts to break above the channel. Meanwhile, a rocket is the recovery push after XRP retests support at the channel's lower trendline.Notably, each hammer (or roadblock) has eventually resulted in a price correction, while each rocket (recovery effort) has led to a push toward a breakout. XRP Descending Channel | EGRAG Crypto For context, XRP saw three rockets at $1.95 on Dec. 20, 2024, at $1.76 on Feb. 3, 2025, and then at $1.61 on April 7, 2025.However, the three hammers came in at $3.4 on Jan. 16, 2025, at $3.02 on March 2, 2025, and then most recently at $2.65 on May 12, 2025.EGRAG Predicts When XRP Bull Run Will ResumeFollowing the three iterations of each pattern, EGRAG asked for audience opinions on whether XRP would break out or go lower. In his view, the next direction from here could be upward. According to him, XRP could break out from this channel or consolidation structure by mid-June, with the uptrend persisting until August to September 2025.However, his projection came up days before the Israel-Iran war began, which has since skewed the direction of the market. As a result of the conflict, this timeline could be delayed. Meanwhile, EGRAG provided several immediate targets around the breakout from the descending channel. Specifically, XRP would need to breach the $2.6 resistance to break above the channel. From the current price of $2.16, XRP must rise 20.3% to reach this price mark.XRP Breakout TargetsFollowing a breakout from the channel, XRP's next immediate target could be the $3 psychological level, which it has failed to reclaim since March. Beyond this, the next target would be the yearly peak of $3.4. A break above this mark could open the door for greater price heights.While EGRAG failed to present his ultimate targets for when the bull run resumes, he had in previous instances suggested that XRP could reach the $20 range this cycle. Most recently, he predicted that XRP's top for this cycle could be $24. Meanwhile, last month, he predicted a possible XRP rally to $27.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/26/xrp-3-hammers-and-3-rockets-heres-whats-next/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-3-hammers-and-3-rockets-heres-whats-next,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T17:50:16,"Coinbase launches Bitcoin-rewarding credit cards and futures trading, July 21","Coinbase is rolling out a new Bitcoin-backed credit card and launching two US-based crypto futures contracts on July 21, aimed at deepening the exchange’s footprint in both consumer spending and derivatives trading. But unlike cashback cards from traditional banks, this product reportedly gives users crypto, and unlike global futures markets, this product follows US rules. The new credit card, expected to drop this fall, will let users earn up to 4% back in BTC every time they swipe. But there’s a gate: you’ll need to subscribe to Coinbase’s premium trading service to even apply. Rewards go directly into your Coinbase account, not through third-party processors. This setup is designed to appeal to those already in the ecosystem, but not everyone’s on board. New card offers Bitcoin rewards, but comes with strings The idea of crypto rewards isn’t original. Exchanges like Gemini and Crypto.com already offer similar cards. But what makes this one different is the underlying asset, Bitcoin, and how volatile that can get. With cashback, what you earn is steady. With crypto, your 4% could spike or tank depending on what the market does. So you’re low-key investing, whether you like it or not. That risk comes on top of standard credit card hazards: high interest, debt buildup, and personal data exposure. Coinbase says its platform has never lost any customer funds to wallet breaches, and that card rewards are deposited into Coinbase wallets, not external providers. Gemini confirmed that rewards go into a Gemini wallet with full platform-level security. Some long-timers in the crypto space aren’t feeling it though. Graham Friedman, who leads crypto venture deals at Republic, isn’t sold. “I got into bitcoin in 2012 and a lot of it was about privacy, libertarianism, etc. And credit cards, by nature, swap your private information across a variety of companies,” Graham said . He added that for someone like him, who travels for work, airline cards with seat upgrades and miles are a better fit. “I can just go buy my own investment assets.” Still, for others, the idea of stacking BTC through normal purchases feels like an easy win. Buying coffee, booking flights, paying bills, etc., all become part of a long-term crypto strategy. That’s the appeal Coinbase is apparently banking on. Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading go live July 21 On the derivatives side, Coinbase announced the launch of two US-based perpetual-style futures contracts through its Coinbase Derivatives Exchange. These will go live on July 21 and include a nano Bitcoin contract at 0.01 BTC and a nano Ether contract at 0.10 ETH. These aren’t just any contracts—they’re designed to function like global perpetual futures but under US regulatory oversight. Futures like this have already taken over international crypto markets. In some cases, they account for over 90% of total crypto trading volume. But until now, Americans have had to go offshore to trade them. That workaround adds extra baggage—custody concerns, regulation issues, counterparty risk. Coinbase says this new product removes all that friction by offering a legal, domestic alternative with the same trading perks. The contracts are built with five-year expirations and will trade 24/7. They include a funding rate mechanism that keeps the futures prices synced with the spot market. Funding builds up every hour, then settles twice per day. At each settlement point, the funding collected is either credited or debited to the trader’s account based on their position. The goal, Coinbase says, is to offer the feel of spot trading while still giving access to leverage, capital-efficient trading, and regulated clearing. The contracts are small, so traders can size their positions with more precision. No need to overexpose just to get in the game. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-26T17:36:48,"What is a Crypto Exchange? A Beginner’s Guide to Trading Platforms","Cryptocurrencies have rapidly gained popularity over the past decade, evolving from a niche concept to a global phenomenon. As digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum become increasingly mainstream, more people are looking to participate in this exciting market. At the heart of this participation are crypto exchanges—platforms that serve as gateways for buying, selling, and trading digital currencies. Whether you’re interested in investing, trading, or simply exploring the world of crypto, understanding these exchanges is crucial. This guide is designed to help beginners navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges, providing a clear and straightforward explanation of what they are, how they work, and what features to look for when choosing the right platform. By the end of this guide, you’ll have the foundational knowledge needed to confidently engage with the cryptocurrency market. What is a Crypto Exchange? A crypto exchange is an online platform that facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. These exchanges act as intermediaries, matching buyers with sellers and enabling transactions in various digital currencies. Unlike traditional financial exchanges, which deal with stocks, bonds, or commodities, crypto exchanges exclusively handle digital assets. They offer users the ability to convert fiat currency (like USD or EUR) into cryptocurrency and vice versa, as well as trade one cryptocurrency for another. This makes them essential tools for anyone looking to participate in the cryptocurrency market. Types of Crypto Exchanges Crypto exchanges come in various forms, each offering unique features and catering to different user needs. Understanding the types of crypto exchanges is essential for choosing the right platform for your trading or investment goals. Centralized Exchanges (CEX) Centralized exchanges (CEX) are the most common type of crypto exchange, operated by a central authority or company. These platforms, such as Binance and Coinbase, act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, providing a user-friendly interface and robust security features. Users trust the exchange to manage their funds, which often includes fiat-to-crypto conversions and advanced trading tools. While CEX platforms are known for their ease of use and high liquidity, they come with drawbacks such as potential security risks due to centralization and the need to comply with regulatory requirements, which may limit privacy. Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) In contrast, decentralized exchanges (DEX) operate without a central authority, relying on blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peecr transactions . Platforms like Uniswap and PancakeSwap allow users to trade directly from their wallets, ensuring greater privacy and control over their assets. DEX platforms eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing the risk of hacks and censorship. However, they often lack the liquidity and user-friendliness of centralized exchanges, making them more challenging for beginners to navigate. Hybrid Exchanges Bridging the gap between CEX and DEX platforms, hybrid exchanges combine the benefits of both. These exchanges offer the security and decentralization of DEX platforms while maintaining the liquidity and user experience of CEX platforms. By integrating the strengths of both types, hybrid exchanges provide a balanced approach, catering to users seeking a secure yet accessible trading environment. Understanding these types of exchanges helps you choose the one that aligns best with your needs and trading preferences. How Crypto Exchanges Work Understanding how crypto exchanges operate is crucial for effectively navigating the platform and making informed decisions. Account Registration To start using a crypto exchange, the first step is account registration. This typically involves providing personal information, creating login credentials, and setting up security features like two-factor authentication (2FA). Most exchanges require compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations to prevent fraud and ensure legal compliance, meaning users must verify their identity before trading. Deposits and Withdrawals Once registered, users can deposit funds into their exchange account. This can be done using fiat currency or transferring cryptocurrency from an external crypto wallet. Understanding wallet addresses is key—these are unique identifiers used to send and receive crypto securely. When withdrawing funds, it’s important to double-check these addresses to avoid errors. Additionally, enabling security features, such as 2FA, is essential to safeguard your assets. Trading on a Crypto Exchange With funds in your account, you can start trading. Crypto exchanges offer various types of trading, including: spot trading; margin trading; futures. Spot trading involves buying or selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery, while margin trading allows users to trade with borrowed funds, increasing potential profits but also risks. Futures trading involves contracts to buy or sell assets at a future date. Understanding trading pairs—like BTC and ETH—and how to execute different orders, such as market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders, is crucial for managing your trades effectively. Key Features to Look for in a Crypto Exchange Choosing the right crypto exchange involves evaluating several key features that can significantly impact your trading experience. Security Measures Security is paramount when selecting a crypto exchange. Essential features include two-factor authentication (2FA), cold storage for storing assets offline, and encryption to protect sensitive data. These measures help safeguard your funds and personal information from potential threats. User Interface and Experience A user-friendly interface is crucial, especially for beginners. A well-designed platform should be intuitive, easy to navigate, and provide clear access to trading tools and account management features. This ensures a smooth and efficient trading experience. Fees and Charges Understanding the fee structure of an exchange is vital. This includes trading fees, withdrawal fees, and deposit fees. Fees can vary widely between exchanges, so it’s important to compare them to find the most cost-effective option for your needs. Liquidity Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. High liquidity on an exchange means quicker transactions and more stable prices, which is essential for active traders. Customer Support Reliable customer support can make a significant difference, particularly in resolving issues quickly. Look for exchanges that offer responsive and helpful support through multiple channels, such as live chat, email, or phone. Supported Cryptocurrencies Before choosing an exchange, check the list of supported cryptocurrencies to ensure it offers the assets you want to trade. Additionally, consider emerging new crypto exchanges that may provide unique or niche cryptocurrencies not available on more established platforms. Pros and Cons of Using Crypto Exchanges Using crypto exchanges offers numerous benefits, but it also comes with potential risks. Here’s a breakdown of the main advantages and disadvantages: Advantages Accessibility and Convenience: Crypto exchanges provide a user-friendly platform for trading digital assets, making it easy for users to buy, sell, and manage their cryptocurrencies from anywhere. Wide Range of Cryptocurrencies and Trading Options: Exchanges offer access to a diverse selection of cryptocurrencies and various trading pairs, catering to different investment strategies and preferences. Potential for Profit: Engaging in crypto trading can offer significant profit opportunities, especially with price fluctuations and market trends. AI-Powered Cryptocurrencies: Advanced AI-powered cryptocurrencies can enhance trading strategies by utilizing predictive analytics and automated decision-making, offering more sophisticated trading opportunities. Disadvantages Security Risks: Centralized exchanges are susceptible to security breaches and hacks, which can lead to significant financial losses and compromised personal information. High Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, which can result in substantial financial losses due to sudden price swings. Regulatory Concerns: Regulatory issues can impact exchanges and users, including potential legal implications and compliance requirements that vary by jurisdiction. How to Choose the Right Crypto Exchange for You Assessing Your Trading Needs Before selecting an exchange, consider your investment goals. Determine whether you’re interested in long-term investment strategies or more active trading. Your objectives will influence which exchange features are most important to you. Researching Exchange Reputation Thoroughly investigate the reputation of potential exchanges. Read user reviews and consider industry recognition. Pay attention to factors such as security history, customer support quality, and overall user satisfaction. A well-regarded exchange is crucial for a positive trading experience. Testing the Platform Once you’ve narrowed down your options, test the exchange with a small investment. This allows you to evaluate the platform’s functionality, user interface, and trading process without significant financial risk. Use this opportunity to ensure the exchange meets your needs before committing larger sums. Conclusion Crypto exchanges are essential platforms for anyone venturing into the world of digital assets. By understanding the types of exchanges, their features, and the pros and cons of using them, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your trading goals and risk tolerance. As you begin your cryptocurrency journey, remember to prioritize security, research thoroughly, and start small. The crypto market offers exciting opportunities but comes with risks. Approach it with knowledge and caution, and stay informed about new developments like AI-powered cryptocurrencies. Choosing the right exchange is a crucial step in your crypto journey. With the right platform and a clear strategy, you’ll be well-equipped to navigate this dynamic and potentially rewarding financial landscape.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/what-is-a-crypto-exchange-a-beginners-guide-to-trading-platforms/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Crypto News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T17:33:45,"Отскок Биткоина отошел на второй план – Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) взлетает на 68% за сутки","Рынки вздохнули с облегчением после новостей о подтвержденном перемирии между Ираном и Израилем, что вызвало ралли облегчения по всему спектру глобальных активов. Биткоин (BTC) отскочил до $108 000, восстановив позиции и вернув надежду на фоне недельной напряженности на рынке. Но если Bitcoin просто восстановился, то Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) буквально взорвался. Финансово подкованный лягушонок в деловом костюме вырос на 68% за ночь, достигнув $0.000068984 – не только обогнав BTC, но и превзойдя почти весь сектор мем-коинов за один скачок. И это не случайность: успех WEPE держится на процветающей экосистеме и последовательной реализации дорожной карты. После громкой предпродажи в начале года, проект стабильно выполняет обещания. А все эти “зеленые свечи” – просто еще одно самодовольное похлопывание по груди в зале заседаний. Победная серия WEPE продолжается Рост цены Wall Street Pepe особенно выделился на фоне просевшего рынка. За последние 24 часа общая капитализация крипторынка снизилась на 1,37%, а сектор мем-коинов упал на 4,3%. Но WEPE остался на плаву и даже показал положительную динамику. Фактически, токен оказался в числе топ-гейндеров за ночь, уступив только Daddy Trump (TADDY) и Degen Arena (DEGEN). Особенно впечатляет, что оба конкурента имеют рыночную капитализацию менее $1 млн, в то время как WEPE уже приближается к отметке в $10 млн. Он играет в высшей лиге – и побеждает. Причем такая динамика для WEPE не в новинку. На прошлой неделе, когда рынок просел, и большинство активов показали двузначные потери, WEPE вырос на 84%, в очередной раз доказав, что способен расти на волатильности. С начала месяца токен уже прибавил 243%, и этот рост отражает расширение экосистемы.У проекта более 80 000 держателей в сети и свыше 1 200 активных участников в закрытом чате Alpha Chat. Многие из них сообщают о доходности от 500% до 1000% на основе инсайдерских сигналов. И эти держатели не просто фиксируют прибыль – они продолжают покупать, и именно это подталкивает WEPE все выше. Восхождение WEPE напоминает ранний взлет PEPE Wall Street Pepe начинает повторять путь, который уже доказал свою эффективность. В 2023 году PEPE стартовал с одним лишь тикером и мемом. Без дорожной карты, без утилиты, без крупных инвесторов. Но у него было главное – поддержка со стороны розничных трейдеров. Люди покупали, держали и превратили шутку в крипто-гиганта. Результат? Доходность 16,928% от дна до текущей цены и третье место среди мем-коинов по рыночной стоимости. Источник: CoinGecko WEPE не пытается стать следующим PEPE, но идет по той же проторенной дороге. Это живое доказательство того, что происходит, когда обычные трейдеры, а не киты, берут торговые графики под контроль. Сообщество не ждет листинга на биржах и не зависит от инфлюенсеров. Оно уже действует: покупает, удерживает и создает такой объем торгов, который невозможно игнорировать. При текущей рыночной капитализации у WEPE очевидно есть потенциал для роста. Он пока еще на ранней стадии по сравнению с более знаменитыми мем-гигантами, и именно это привлекает трейдеров. Этот интерес усилился после того, как Bitfinex, одна из старейших централизованных криптобирж, ретвитнул официальный пост WEPE две недели назад. Публикация моментально вызвала волну спекуляций в социальных сетях о возможном листинге. Пока ничего не подтверждено, но Bitfinex не склонен к случайным действиям: если они что-то делают, за этим часто следует событие. Как присоединиться к росту WEPE Путь Wall Street Pepe только начинается. Чтобы стать частью движения, перейдите на официальный сайт Wall Street Pepe , подключите свой кошелек (например, Best Wallet ) и получите доступ к WEPE Army, приобретя токены WEPE. Также вы можете присоединиться к текущей кампании QuestN – выполняйте задания в соцсетях и блокчейне, поднимайтесь в лидерборде, получайте награды и открывайте доступ к грядущей NFT-коллекции из 5 000 предметов, при этом держатели WEPE получат преимущество при начислении очков. На данный момент в кампании уже участвуют более 150 000 человек, а общее число просмотров превысило 10,8 млн. Все это помогает WEPE расширять свое присутствие в Web3 и выходить за рамки простой динамики цены.

2025-06-26T17:32:07,"Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Footsteps in India, Home to 1.5 Billion People – Here’s Everything We Know","Pradeep Bhandari, the national spokesperson of India’s ruling party, has called for the launch of a Bitcoin reserve pilot program, arguing that the country needs to make a strategic move towards Bitcoin. According to Bhandari, the US's establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and Bhutan's national mining initiatives present a significant window of opportunity for India. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, launched under the administration of US President Donald Trump in January 2025, brought digital assets to the global economic agenda. The reserve, which reached over $20 billion as of June 2025, shows that Bitcoin is increasingly positioned as a store of value. Within the scope of the reserve, the US evaluates the approximately 200,000 BTC seized as a buffer against inflation. At the Crypto Summit held at the White House last month, it was announced that Bitcoin purchases would continue with budget-friendly methods to expand this reserve. Three states have already enacted laws allowing Bitcoin purchases with public funds. These developments reveal that Bitcoin has begun to be evaluated as a financial resistance tool. Related News: While Everyone Expects a Rate Cut in September, Morgan Stanley Makes a Surprise Prediction! Announces 2025 and 2026 Forecasts! Bhutan, which has been mining Bitcoin with hydroelectric resources since 2021, has accumulated a reserve of over $1 billion as of May 2025. This reserve helps the country finance public services and contributes to its sustainable development goals. India is far ahead of Bhutan in terms of renewable energy capacity and has the potential to implement a similar mining model at scale, but regulatory infrastructure and institutional readiness remain a challenge. India is currently among the countries that tax cryptocurrencies but do not regulate them clearly. India, which led the crypto working group established under the leadership of the IMF during its 2023 G20 presidency, has played an important role in the formation of global standards, but is cautious about domestic regulations. The classification of Bitcoin as a capital asset by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) further strengthens the need for a clear legal framework in India. Regulations will both boost investor confidence and pave the way for institutional adoption. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-26T17:30:52,"Bitcoin Treasury Capital Unveils Bold $7M BTC Purchase for Long-Term Strategy","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Capital Unveils Bold $7M BTC Purchase for Long-Term Strategy The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news that further solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset for corporate balance sheets. In a significant move, Swedish-listed firm Bitcoin Treasury Capital has announced a substantial purchase, signaling a growing trend of institutional players embracing the digital gold. Bitcoin Treasury Capital: A Bold New Era of Corporate Strategy Unveiled In an exciting development shared via their official X account, Bitcoin Treasury Capital has officially embarked on what they term a “long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy.” This strategic initiative kicked off with the acquisition of 66 Bitcoin (BTC). The total value of this BTC purchase stands at approximately $7 million USD, or 66 million Swedish kronor (SEK), with an average price per coin around $105,270. This initial investment marks a clear commitment from the Swedish firm to integrate digital assets into its core financial planning, setting a precedent for others in the European market. What exactly does a “long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy” entail? It typically involves a company holding Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, similar to how traditional companies might hold cash, gold, or bonds. The rationale often includes: Inflation Hedge: Protecting capital against the eroding effects of fiat currency inflation. Potential for Appreciation: Believing in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential for significant returns. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to the corporate balance sheet to reduce overall portfolio risk. Why This BTC Purchase Matters for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The decision by Bitcoin Treasury Capital is more than just a single transaction; it’s a powerful statement in the ongoing narrative of institutional Bitcoin adoption . For years, Bitcoin was primarily seen as a retail investment or a speculative asset. However, the landscape has dramatically shifted. Major corporations, investment funds, and even sovereign nations are now exploring or actively engaging with Bitcoin. This growing trend underscores a maturing market and increasing confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. Consider the impact of other companies that have adopted similar strategies: MicroStrategy: Perhaps the most vocal advocate, MicroStrategy has amassed a significant amount of Bitcoin, turning its corporate strategy into a de facto Bitcoin holding company. Their commitment has often influenced market sentiment. Tesla: While their holdings have fluctuated, Tesla’s initial purchase brought immense mainstream attention to corporate Bitcoin holdings. These examples illustrate that holding Bitcoin is no longer a fringe idea but a legitimate consideration for forward-thinking companies. The move by Bitcoin Treasury Capital adds another reputable name to this growing list, particularly from the European financial sector. Navigating the Bitcoin Strategy Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities While the prospects of a robust Bitcoin strategy are appealing, companies embarking on this journey must also contend with various challenges. The volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market is often cited as a primary concern. Bitcoin’s price can experience significant swings, which can impact a company’s financial statements and investor perception. Other challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential risks related to compliance and future policy changes. Security Concerns: Safeguarding large sums of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks or theft. This often involves partnering with specialized custodians. Accounting and Reporting: Integrating Bitcoin into traditional accounting frameworks can be complex, requiring careful consideration of how to value and report these digital assets. Despite these hurdles, the opportunities presented by a well-executed Bitcoin strategy are compelling. Companies that strategically allocate capital to Bitcoin may position themselves for substantial long-term growth, tap into new investor bases, and demonstrate innovation in their treasury management practices. The potential for Bitcoin to act as a hedge against global economic instability or as a store of value continues to attract corporate interest. What Does This Mean for Your Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? The strategic move by Bitcoin Treasury Capital offers valuable insights for other corporations contemplating or expanding their corporate Bitcoin holdings . It highlights the importance of a clear, long-term vision rather than short-term speculation. Before making such a significant investment, companies should conduct thorough due diligence, which includes: Risk Assessment: Understanding and mitigating the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency volatility and security. Custodial Solutions: Exploring reputable third-party custodians that offer institutional-grade security for digital assets. Legal and Tax Implications: Consulting with legal and tax experts to navigate the complex regulatory environment in their respective jurisdictions. Stakeholder Communication: Clearly articulating the rationale and strategy to investors, employees, and the public to ensure transparency and build confidence. This strategic step by a Swedish-listed firm serves as a powerful example of how traditional businesses are adapting to the digital asset revolution. It underscores a growing conviction that Bitcoin is not just a passing trend but a fundamental shift in how value is stored and managed globally. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Bitcoin Treasury Capital ‘s decisive $7 million investment in Bitcoin marks a significant milestone, not just for the company itself, but for the broader acceptance of digital assets within corporate finance. This bold move signals a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. As more institutions follow suit, the landscape of global treasury management is set to evolve, with Bitcoin increasingly taking center stage. This development reinforces the idea that strategic corporate Bitcoin holdings are becoming an essential component of a forward-thinking financial strategy.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin’s path to $150k in 2025 could ignite a 20x rally in altcoins under $10, fueled by halving hype and institutional flow. Table of Contents Why $150,000 Bitcoin is no longer a fantasy Altcoin surge: Why coins under $10 could 20x Little Pepe: Memecoin with real Infrastructure Render: Infrastructure for AI and metaverse growth Injective Protocol: Scalable DeFi layer-1 Sui: High-speed layer-1 with object-oriented architecture VeChain: Enterprise blockchain for supply chain and RWAs Conclusion: The time for strategic exposure is now Bitcoin’s potential surge to $150,000 in 2025 could spark significant gains in low-priced altcoins under $10, driven by rising investor sentiment, small market caps, and untapped narratives, particularly following the 2024 halving and growing institutional interest. Below, we explore why a six-figure BTC is plausible and highlight eight altcoins under $10 that could potentially return 20x or more in such a scenario. Why $150,000 Bitcoin is no longer a fantasy There are a few things that support the bullish thesis: Post-Halving Supply Shock: The 2024 Bitcoin halving cut new supply by half. Because of tightening supply dynamics, this has led to a 12–18-month rally in the past. Spot ETFs and Institutional Capital: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has given institutions more exposure than ever before. Companies like BlackRock and Fidelity are making it easy to invest in BTC, and a significant amount of money is still flowing into the market. Global Macro Trends: As central banks move toward looser monetary policy, risk-on assets like BTC are again appealing. This situation sets the stage for Bitcoin to aim for $150,000, potentially marking the start of one of the best altcoin seasons ever. You might also like: This memecoin priced under $0.0015 can surpass ADA’s market cap Altcoin surge: Why coins under $10 could 20x In bull markets, low-cost altcoins have three main advantages: Coins under $10 with smaller market caps need less capital to surge, making them attractive and psychologically appealing to retail investors. Strong Narratives: Tokens linked to popular areas, such as AI, gaming, DeFi, or Layer-2 solutions, can perform better when the market turns bullish. Let’s explore eight tokens under $10 that could deliver 20x returns if Bitcoin (BTC) reaches $150,000. Little Pepe: Memecoin with real Infrastructure Little Pepe, currently priced at $0.0012 in Stage 3 of its presale, is one of the market’s most technically ambitious memecoins today. Unlike traditional memecoins that rely solely on community hype, LILPEPE is backed by real infrastructure — its own Layer 2 blockchain, designed exclusively for memecoin launches. With ultra-low fees, sniper bot resistance, zero-tax trading, and lightning-fast transactions, the project delivers both meme culture and high performance. Led by anonymous developers with a track record of success in top memecoin cycles, LILPEPE is gaining serious traction. As of now, 1,664,536,298 tokens have been sold out of the 2.25 billion allocated for Stage 3, representing 73.98% progress. The team has already raised $1,822,444 out of a $2,525,000 target. The price will soon rise to $0.0013 in the next stage, ahead of the final presale price of $0.0028. In addition to its technical edge, LILPEPE is running a $777,000 giveaway campaign, where 10 lucky winners will each receive $77,000 worth of tokens. The token is confirmed for listings on two major centralized exchanges at launch, with hints of a future debut on the world’s largest exchange. Although the final listing price is yet to be disclosed, analysts speculate an initial range between $0.0035 and $0.0055. Based on the current presale price, a return of 20x or more is plausible if LILPEPE reaches its $1 billion market cap target, highlighting the asymmetric upside potential for early adopters. Render: Infrastructure for AI and metaverse growth Render is trading at approximately $2.87 and sits at the crossroads of several explosive sectors, including artificial intelligence, virtual production, and the metaverse. RNDR’s decentralized rendering network connects creators to idle GPU resources, solving a major bottleneck in digital content creation. As AI and web3 content generation scale, Render’s unique offering could gain serious traction. A 20x surge would place RNDR around $57, reflecting the explosive growth in GPU demand. Injective Protocol: Scalable DeFi layer-1 Injective (INJ) currently trades at $9.88 and has positioned itself as a powerhouse for building high-performance DeFi applications, especially derivatives. Its Layer-1 architecture features fast finality, interoperates with other chains, and enables trading without gas fees. INJ could grow rapidly as decentralized finance evolves with new applications and more institutions adopt it. A 20x price move would bring it to nearly $200, in line with previous DeFi breakouts from smaller valuations. Sui: High-speed layer-1 with object-oriented architecture Sui, priced at $2.51, is a relatively new entrant quickly gaining attention due to its unique object-based storage and programming model. Built using the Move language, initially developed by Facebook’s Libra team, SUI enables parallel transaction execution for massive scalability. It’s attracting developers who are building advanced dApps in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Should its ecosystem continue expanding and Bitcoin catalyze another L1 narrative, SUI reaching $50 is well within the realm of possibility. VeChain: Enterprise blockchain for supply chain and RWAs VeChain is priced at a modest $0.019 but offers strong fundamentals with an enterprise-first approach. VET’s blockchain is being utilized for logistics, anti-counterfeiting, and carbon tracking across various industries. As the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) becomes a major trend in the crypto world, VeChain’s partnerships with companies like Walmart China and BMW may provide the credibility and utility needed for a breakout. A 20x rally would bring VET close to $0.40, which is still a reasonable price, considering its historical price. Conclusion: The time for strategic exposure is now It’s now more possible than ever for Bitcoin to reach $150,000 because of lower supply, growing institutional demand, and better overall economic conditions. If this happens, altcoins that cost less than $10 could see huge gains. A mix of infrastructure tokens, such as Injective and Render, as well as speculative plays like Little Pepe and Dogecoin, could provide the most exposure to various sectors. XRP and ADA provide regulatory and academic strength, respectively, while SUI and VeChain highlight novel and enterprise-level use cases.

2025-06-26T17:08:17,"India’s ruling party spokesperson urges pilot for national Bitcoin reserve","A spokesperson for India’s ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has urged the government to explore a sovereign Bitcoin reserve as the regulatory framework for digital assets in the country remains in limbo. According to a June 26 article titled “US Bitcoin Reserve signals a shift: An opening for India,” BJP national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari called for India to consider launching a Bitcoin reserve pilot. “Three US states have now passed legislation authorising the deployment of public funds to purchase and hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset, with more expected to follow. These measures reflect a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential to bolster fiscal resilience and serve as a hedge in uncertain economic conditions,” Bhandri wrote. He argued that creating a national Bitcoin reserve would align India with emerging global trends and also strengthen its economic resilience. In his article, Bhandari drew attention to Bitcoin’s properties as a decentralized asset with fixed supply, high liquidity, and transparency, and even called it “digital gold” while stressing that it could act as a hedge in uncertain economic environments. “The IMF’s recent classification of Bitcoin as a capital asset further sharpens the need for direction. Clear regulation could bring both transparency and the required oversight to this emerging asset class—enabling responsible innovation while protecting a rising investor class,” he noted. Further, Bhandari pointed to Bhutan’s Bitcoin strategy, which uses hydropower to mine and accumulate digital assets. Since 2021, Bhutan has built a reserve exceeding $1 billion, which now supports public services and long-term sustainability goals. Drawing a parallel, he noted that India’s expanding renewable energy infrastructure positions it well to pursue a similar sovereign Bitcoin strategy aligned with its national interests. According to him, these initiatives would not be a “reckless pivot” but rather a “calculated step” toward embracing the legitimacy of digital assets. Regulatory clarity is key Bhandari also touched upon India’s heavily taxed, yet unregulated crypto market. Despite lacking a formal regulatory framework, cryptocurrency trading in India is taxed under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act at a flat 30%, along with a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on all transactions above ₹10,000. Meanwhile, a long-promised policy discussion paper, initially expected after India’s G20 presidency, has faced repeated delays. Officials say it’s being “recalibrated” in light of global shifts, but no timeline has been set. Bhandari criticised this one-sided approach, calling for regulatory clarity that he believes is essential to “unlock” India’s full potential in the digital asset space. He recalled that during India’s G20 presidency in 2023, the government played a key role in coordinating a crypto-focused working group with the International Monetary Fund. Yet, while India awaits a broader consensus, Bhandari warned that others are not standing still. “While [India’s] recommendations will take their due course, we are seeing other jurisdictions, including Russia, China, and Brazil from the BRICS, and other G20 nations led by the US, race ahead—not pausing for consensus.” Bhandari concluded by urging policymakers to act decisively, arguing that delay could cost India both strategic and economic ground. “India stands at a pivotal juncture. A measured Bitcoin strategy—perhaps a reserve pilot—could strengthen economic resilience and project modernity,” Bhandari wrote, adding that India should consider this as a “unique opportunity to lead.” The post India's ruling party spokesperson urges pilot for national Bitcoin reserve appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/26/indias-ruling-party-spokesperson-urges-pilot-for-national-bitcoin-reserve/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","Crypto|Crypto regulation|India|USA",cryptocompare

The analyst, Master Ananda, sees a possible case scenario where the asset drops below the $100,000 price mark. In a post shared on Tradingview, the analyst asserts that the rising bearish sentiments will only be validated if the asset breaks below the $100,000 support level. He explained that the bear trend would have fully kicked in at this point, and Bitcoin could continue in a downward trend. The analyst sees the asset going down to $88,888 and potentially trading at $82,500 if the bears remain in control. An excerpt of his post reads; “Bitcoin being bearish is only true if the $100,000 support level breaks. If it breaks expect the market to dive down, deep and fast and reach around $82,500 or $88,888. But this is only if the support breaks.” On the flip side, the analyst explains that Bitcoin may continue on an upward trajectory and possibly attain a higher price level if support holds. Should selling pressure soar, “the flush is likely to be super fast and strong, which means that you will still get higher prices in the coming weeks,” he added. This means that the long-term outlook is still bullish, although the bears could take control for a brief period, according to the analyst. He observed that the bearish pressure has resulted in the liquidation of long positions, but maintains optimism about Bitcoin’s ability to bounce back. “It will be nice to see how it all develops, but it shouldn’t take more than two weeks. We are likely in the clear in a matter of days (2-3 days). Do not be afraid if the market shakes, Bitcoin is going up; Crypto will grow, regardless of the short-term.” He concluded.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/analyst-sees-bitcoin-crashing-to-80000-during-this-period/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

According to Adler, it is a striking pattern for long-term investors (LTH) to increase their positions before every major rise in Bitcoin. Adler stated that this situation was first observed at $ 28,000 levels. He stated that with the increase in the LTH rate compared to short-term investors (STH), Bitcoin rose to $ 60,000 after an accumulation period of approximately 1-2 months. The second example occurred during the consolidation process at $60,000. Similar accumulation dynamics paved the way for the price to reach $100,000.

2025-06-26T16:50:19,"Semler Scientific: Unlocking a New Era of Bitcoin Purchases","BitcoinWorld Semler Scientific: Unlocking a New Era of Bitcoin Purchases The world of corporate finance is abuzz with news that Semler Scientific, a company primarily known for its medical technology, is now trading at a significant premium relative to its substantial Bitcoin holdings . This development marks a pivotal moment, signaling a potential resumption of aggressive BTC purchases and underscoring the growing confidence in their unique corporate Bitcoin strategy . What’s Driving Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin Premium? For the first time in three weeks, Semler Scientific ‘s stock has surged, trading at a premium to the value of its Bitcoin reserves. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a strong indicator of investor confidence. According to CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten, the company’s multiple net asset value (mNAV) currently stands at an impressive 1.149. To put it simply, Semler’s market capitalization of $550 million now significantly exceeds its $477.8 million in Bitcoin holdings. But what exactly does ‘trading at a premium’ mean in this context? It means that investors are willing to pay more for Semler Scientific’s stock than the sum of its underlying assets, particularly its Bitcoin. This suggests that the market sees value beyond just the raw Bitcoin held on the balance sheet. Investors might be factoring in: Management’s Strategic Acumen: Belief in Semler’s leadership to effectively manage and grow their Bitcoin treasury. Future Bitcoin Appreciation: Anticipation that Bitcoin itself will continue to appreciate, thereby increasing the value of Semler’s holdings. Ease of Access: For some investors, buying Semler stock is an easier way to gain exposure to Bitcoin compared to direct cryptocurrency purchases. Innovation Premium: Acknowledgment of Semler’s bold move to embrace Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, setting a precedent in the medical technology sector. This shift from previously trading at a discount to now commanding a premium highlights a significant positive sentiment change around Semler’s financial strategy. The Strategic Accumulation of Bitcoin Holdings: A Growing Trend? Bitcoin holdings by public companies are becoming an increasingly significant trend, and Semler Scientific is at the forefront of this movement. While MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, companies like Semler are demonstrating that this isn’t just a niche strategy for tech giants. Semler’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset and a strategic investment reflects a broader shift in how companies view their balance sheets. Why are more companies looking to accumulate Bitcoin? Inflation Hedge: In an era of rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a digital gold, offering a hedge against currency debasement. Store of Value: Its decentralized nature and finite supply make it an attractive long-term store of value. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury assets beyond traditional fiat currencies and bonds. Innovation and Investor Appeal: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a forward-thinking approach, potentially attracting a new class of investors interested in digital assets. Semler’s current holding of 4,449 BTC, valued at $477.8 million, places it among the top publicly traded companies by Bitcoin reserves. This substantial holding isn’t just a static asset; it’s a dynamic part of their financial planning, constantly evaluated against market conditions and strategic goals. Decoding the Premium Trading Phenomenon: Why is it a Game-Changer? The fact that Semler Scientific is now experiencing premium trading relative to its Bitcoin assets is a profound development. Historically, companies that held significant amounts of volatile assets like Bitcoin sometimes traded at a discount, as investors priced in the perceived risk. The current premium signifies a fundamental shift in market perception. This premium suggests that investors are not just tolerating Semler’s Bitcoin strategy; they are actively rewarding it. It implies that the market believes Semler’s management can: Generate Value: Effectively leverage their Bitcoin holdings to create more value for shareholders than simply the sum of the parts. Mitigate Risk: Navigate the volatility of the crypto market more skillfully than the average investor might on their own. Execute Future Strategy: Successfully achieve their stated goals, such as reaching their ambitious 10,000 BTC target. This premium serves as a powerful validation of Semler’s pioneering approach, potentially encouraging other companies to consider similar strategies. It moves Bitcoin from being a speculative asset on a company’s books to a core, value-generating component of its financial identity. Will Semler Resume Aggressive BTC Purchases to Hit its Target? The million-dollar question on everyone’s mind is: will Semler Scientific resume aggressive BTC purchases ? The signs certainly point in that direction. Semler has publicly stated its ambitious goal of reaching 10,000 BTC by the end of the year. With current holdings at 4,449 BTC, they are still significantly short of this target, needing to acquire an additional 5,551 BTC. The company’s market cap now exceeding its Bitcoin holdings is a critical trigger. When a company’s stock trades at a discount to its Bitcoin assets, it might be hesitant to buy more, as it essentially means buying Bitcoin at a higher price than the market values its existing holdings. However, trading at a premium reverses this dynamic. It suggests that every dollar invested in Bitcoin by Semler is now perceived by the market as adding more than a dollar of value to the company’s stock. This positive feedback loop creates a strong incentive for Semler to continue its acquisition strategy. Renewed large-scale purchases by a publicly traded company could have several implications: Market Impact: Significant purchases could provide upward price pressure on Bitcoin, especially if done in substantial blocks. Investor Confidence: It would reinforce Semler’s commitment to its Bitcoin strategy, potentially attracting more investors. Precedent Setting: Further validates Bitcoin as a viable corporate treasury asset for companies outside the tech sector. The path to 10,000 BTC will be closely watched by both traditional finance and crypto enthusiasts alike. Crafting a Resilient Corporate Bitcoin Strategy: Lessons from Semler Corporate Bitcoin strategy is no longer a fringe concept; it’s a sophisticated financial decision being adopted by an increasing number of forward-thinking companies. Semler Scientific’s journey offers valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of integrating Bitcoin into a company’s treasury. Their success in achieving a premium valuation underscores the potential rewards for a well-executed strategy. Benefits of a Strong Corporate Bitcoin Strategy: Capital Appreciation Potential: Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests significant long-term growth potential. Inflation Hedging: A robust defense against the eroding purchasing power of fiat currencies. Diversification of Assets: Reduces reliance on traditional financial instruments and their associated risks. Enhanced Investor Appeal: Attracts a new demographic of investors keen on digital asset exposure. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations require robust risk management protocols. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies can present uncertainties. Accounting and Reporting: Complexities in how Bitcoin holdings are valued and reported on financial statements. Security: Safeguarding significant digital assets requires specialized cybersecurity measures. Semler’s experience suggests that transparency, clear communication of strategy, and consistent execution are key to gaining investor trust and achieving positive market reception for such a bold move. Their commitment to a specific Bitcoin target demonstrates a long-term vision rather than short-term speculation. What This Means for You, The Investor For investors, Semler Scientific’s current position offers a unique perspective. If you’re interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency, companies like Semler provide an indirect route. Their stock performance becomes intertwined with Bitcoin’s, offering a leveraged play on the digital asset’s future. It’s an opportunity to invest in a company that has strategically positioned itself at the intersection of traditional business and the burgeoning digital economy. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in a company like Semler involves both the risks associated with its core business (medical technology) and the volatility of Bitcoin. Due diligence is always paramount. This development also serves as a strong signal for the broader market: institutional adoption of Bitcoin is not just continuing; it’s maturing and gaining significant validation from investors. A Bold Future for Corporate Treasury Semler Scientific’s journey into substantial Bitcoin holdings and its current premium trading status marks a significant milestone in the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance. Their ambitious target of 10,000 BTC by year-end, coupled with the current market dynamics, strongly suggests that we could soon see a fresh wave of BTC purchases from the company. This isn’t just about Semler; it’s a testament to the evolving perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate, value-adding asset for corporate treasuries. As more companies observe Semler’s success, we may well witness a broader paradigm shift in how businesses manage their capital in the digital age.

Bitwise had originally filed for the Dogecoin ETF in January and followed with the Aptos ETF application in March. The San Francisco-based asset manager already has other crypto ETF offerings like the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and several other applications pending, including one for an XRP-focused fund. Bitwise DOGE and Aptos ETF filings amended Bitwise’s initial DOGE S-1 filing showed that it was requesting the registration of its ETF under the Securities Act of 1933, also known as the ’33 Act. This differs from earlier applications by firms Rex Shares and Osprey Funds, which used the Investment Company Act of 1940 framework. The ’40 Act has more profound investor protections, including stricter governance requirements, but the ’33 Act is used for commodity-based and physically-backed ETFs. The approach may give Bitwise flexibility in structuring these funds, although it also subjects them to a different regulatory lens. Meanwhile, Bitwise’s Aptos ETF, if approved, would become the first US-based fund focused solely on APT, the native token of the Aptos blockchain. The firm registered a Delaware trust for the Aptos ETF on February 28 and filed the corresponding S-1 with the SEC on March 5. The fund does not propose a staking mechanism, even though Aptos is a proof-of-stake blockchain. The firm will also need to submit a 19b-4 form to trigger the SEC’s official review window. Once the SEC acknowledges the filing, a 240-day countdown begins for the agency to issue a final decision. ‘In-kind’ creation is an addition to the Dogecoin ETF filing One update in Bitwise’s amended Dogecoin ETF filing is the inclusion of in-kind creations and redemptions. This could allow authorized participants to deliver or receive Dogecoin directly rather than converting to or from cash. The initial January filing lacked this provision. In-kind transactions are favored for reducing slippage and improving tax efficiency, and their inclusion is seen as a regulatory necessity for future spot crypto ETFs. Coinbase Custody will serve as the custodian for the Dogecoin ETF as well. However, the SEC has yet to approve the fund , having extended its review period on June 12 to assess concerns over market risks and investor protection. The Dogecoin ETF was initially filed on March 3 and opened to public comment shortly after. On Wednesday, asset manager IDX filed for a hybrid ETF offering exposure to both gold and Bitcoin. The proposed fund will not hold physical assets but will instead invest through a mix of futures, options, swaps, and other exchange-traded products. Per the SEC’s prospectus , the fund will operate via a Cayman Islands subsidiary and comply with US tax laws on a 1.25x leveraged exposure.

2025-06-26T16:40:14,"Bitcoin Miner Profits Face Steep Crisis: Daily Revenue Plunges to Yearly Low","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Miner Profits Face Steep Crisis: Daily Revenue Plunges to Yearly Low The world of cryptocurrency mining, often seen as a lucrative frontier, is currently facing a significant downturn. Recent data reveals a dramatic plunge in Bitcoin miner profits , sending ripples of concern throughout the digital asset ecosystem. What exactly is happening to the backbone of the Bitcoin network, and what does this mean for the future of crypto mining? The Alarming Plunge in Bitcoin Miner Profits : A Deep Dive For those who dedicate computing power to secure the Bitcoin network and earn rewards, June 2024 has delivered a harsh reality check. According to analytics firm CryptoQuant, Bitcoin miner profits have plummeted to their weakest levels in over a year. Daily revenue, which encompasses both newly minted BTC from block rewards and transaction fees, has reportedly dropped to a mere $34 million. This figure marks the lowest point since April 2023, painting a stark picture of eroding profit margins for these crucial network participants. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a significant contraction that signals mounting pressure on miners. Historically, periods of reduced profitability have led to increased selling pressure from miners, who need to cover operational costs. Understanding the components of this decline is essential: Reduced Transaction Fees: A significant portion of miner revenue comes from fees paid by users to prioritize their transactions. A decrease in network activity or a shift towards cheaper alternatives can directly impact this income stream. Falling Bitcoin Price: The primary driver of miner revenue is the value of the Bitcoin they mine. When the price of BTC drops, the fiat equivalent of their block rewards diminishes, directly impacting their profitability. Increasing Mining Difficulty: As more powerful mining hardware comes online and more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining a block increases. This means miners need to expend more computational power (and thus energy) to earn the same reward. This confluence of factors creates a challenging environment, forcing miners to re-evaluate their strategies and operational efficiencies. Decoding the Decline in BTC Mining Revenue : Where Did the Money Go? To truly grasp the severity of the situation, we need to dissect the components that contribute to overall BTC mining revenue . Traditionally, a miner’s daily earnings are a combination of two main sources: the block subsidy (newly minted Bitcoin) and transaction fees paid by users. Post-halving, the block subsidy has been cut in half, making transaction fees an even more critical component of a miner’s income. Let’s consider a simplified breakdown of miner revenue: Revenue Component Description Impact on Current Decline Block Subsidy Newly minted Bitcoin awarded for successfully mining a block (e.g., 3.125 BTC post-halving). Halved in April 2024, significantly reducing the base income for miners. Transaction Fees Fees paid by users to include their transactions in a block. Declined significantly in June due to reduced network congestion and less speculative activity. While the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 was a pre-programmed and anticipated reduction in block rewards, the subsequent sharp decline in transaction fees has caught many off guard. During periods of high network demand (like the Ordinals boom or periods of intense price volatility), transaction fees can skyrocket, sometimes even surpassing the block subsidy as a revenue source. However, the current environment sees these fees at much lower levels, leaving miners with significantly less supplementary income. This dual impact—halved block rewards coupled with dwindling transaction fees—is the primary reason for the dramatic reduction in overall BTC mining revenue . Miners are essentially getting less for their efforts, while their operational costs (energy, hardware, maintenance) remain largely constant or even increase. The Unrelenting Impact of Bitcoin Price Drop : A Direct Hit on Profitability Perhaps the most direct and visible factor influencing miner profitability is the market value of Bitcoin itself. The recent Bitcoin price drop has had an immediate and profound effect on the bottom line of mining operations worldwide. When the price of BTC falls, the fiat equivalent of the Bitcoin that miners earn also decreases. For operations that have significant fiat-denominated expenses—such as electricity bills, rent, and employee salaries—a lower Bitcoin price means less revenue to cover these costs. Consider this scenario: A miner earns 3.125 BTC for a block. If Bitcoin is trading at $70,000, that block is worth approximately $218,750. However, if the Bitcoin price drop brings BTC down to $60,000, the same block is suddenly only worth $187,500. This $31,250 difference per block can quickly accumulate, eroding profit margins and pushing less efficient miners into the red. The volatile nature of Bitcoin’s price has always been a key risk for miners. They are essentially betting on the future value of the asset they produce. Prolonged periods of price stagnation or decline can lead to what is known as “miner capitulation,” where miners are forced to sell their accumulated Bitcoin holdings to cover costs, or even shut down operations entirely, adding further selling pressure to the market. This dynamic creates a feedback loop: lower prices reduce miner profitability, which can lead to miners selling more BTC, potentially driving prices even lower. It’s a challenging cycle that the crypto mining industry is currently navigating. Navigating Challenges in the Crypto Mining Industry : Beyond Price and Fees While the declining Bitcoin price and transaction fees are immediate concerns, the broader crypto mining industry faces a myriad of challenges that contribute to the current profitability crisis. These aren’t new issues, but they become significantly more pressing during downturns: Energy Costs: Electricity remains the single largest operational expense for miners. Fluctuating energy prices, regulatory changes, and environmental pressures can significantly impact profitability. Regions with cheap, stable, and sustainable energy sources become highly competitive. Hardware Obsolescence and Depreciation: Mining rigs are specialized computers that become less efficient over time as newer, more powerful models are released. The rapid pace of technological advancement means significant capital expenditure is required to remain competitive, and older machines quickly depreciate in value. Increasing Network Difficulty: As more powerful mining hardware comes online and more miners join the network, the mining difficulty adjusts upwards. This means that each miner gets a smaller piece of the pie for the same amount of computational effort, requiring continuous upgrades to maintain hashing power. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are increasingly looking at the environmental impact and energy consumption of crypto mining. Potential bans, taxes, or restrictions can create significant uncertainty and operational hurdles for miners. Competition: The industry is highly competitive, with large, well-funded operations often having significant advantages in terms of purchasing power for hardware, access to cheaper energy, and economies of scale. Smaller miners often struggle to keep up. These challenges, combined with the recent revenue slump, are testing the resilience of mining operations globally. Only the most efficient, well-capitalized, and strategically positioned miners are likely to weather this storm effectively. Strategies for Sustaining Miner Profitability : Adapting to a New Reality In the face of these formidable challenges, how can mining operations ensure their long-term miner profitability ? Adaptation and innovation are key. The industry is not static, and successful miners are constantly evolving their strategies: 1. Optimizing Energy Consumption and Sourcing: Renewable Energy: Shifting to solar, hydro, or wind power can significantly reduce operational costs and mitigate environmental concerns, attracting more favorable regulatory attention. Demand Response Programs: Participating in programs that allow miners to curtail operations during peak grid demand in exchange for incentives can optimize energy spending. Waste Heat Utilization: Exploring innovative uses for the heat generated by mining, such as heating greenhouses or homes, can create additional revenue streams or offset costs. 2. Enhancing Operational Efficiency: Hardware Upgrades: Regularly investing in the latest, most energy-efficient ASICs is crucial to maintain competitive hash rates per unit of energy. Improved Cooling Systems: Efficient cooling reduces energy consumption and extends the lifespan of expensive hardware. Software Optimization: Utilizing advanced mining software and firmware to fine-tune performance and maximize output. 3. Financial Hedging and Diversification: Hedging Strategies: Miners can use futures contracts or options to lock in a future selling price for their mined Bitcoin, protecting against price drops. Diversification: Some miners explore mining other profitable cryptocurrencies or offering services like hosting to diversify revenue streams. Strategic Bitcoin Holdings: Balancing the need to sell BTC for operational costs with holding onto a portion for future price appreciation. 4. Geographic Relocation: Moving operations to regions with abundant, cheap electricity and favorable regulatory environments remains a powerful strategy for maintaining miner profitability . Countries with cold climates can also offer natural cooling advantages. The current downturn is a stress test, but it also serves as a catalyst for innovation. Miners who can implement these strategies effectively will be better positioned to not only survive but thrive when market conditions improve. Conclusion: Navigating the Storm for Future Prosperity The recent plunge in Bitcoin miner profits to a yearly low of $34 million daily is a stark reminder of the volatile and challenging nature of the crypto mining industry. The combination of declining transaction fees and a significant Bitcoin price drop has created an undeniable squeeze on margins, forcing miners to confront difficult decisions about their operations. This period of reduced BTC mining revenue is a critical juncture, separating the resilient and innovative from those unable to adapt. However, the Bitcoin network has a long history of enduring such market cycles. While the current environment presents substantial hurdles, it also drives efficiency, innovation, and a focus on sustainability within the crypto mining industry . Miners who prioritize energy efficiency, strategic financial management, and continuous technological upgrades are better equipped to weather these storms and emerge stronger. The long-term outlook for Bitcoin mining remains tied to the growth and adoption of the network itself. As Bitcoin continues to mature as a global financial asset, the demand for secure and robust mining operations will persist, making periods like this a necessary, albeit painful, part of its evolutionary journey. The resilience of miners will ultimately determine the future strength of the network.

2025-06-26T16:20:01,"Unveiling Crucial Bitcoin Accumulation Trends: Glassnode Reveals Divergent Holder Strategies","BitcoinWorld Unveiling Crucial Bitcoin Accumulation Trends: Glassnode Reveals Divergent Holder Strategies As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its dynamic journey in the digital asset landscape, hovering around key psychological price levels, understanding the underlying movements of its holders becomes paramount. Unlike traditional markets where data can be opaque, the transparent nature of blockchain technology offers an unprecedented window into investor actions. On-chain market intelligence platforms like Glassnode are at the forefront of providing these crucial insights, helping us decipher the collective sentiment and strategic maneuvers of various market participants. Their recent observations paint a fascinating picture of contrasting approaches to Bitcoin accumulation trends among different types of holders, signaling a complex interplay of market forces. Understanding Bitcoin Accumulation Trends: What Glassnode’s Latest Analysis Reveals In a recent update shared on X, the renowned on-chain analytics firm Glassnode highlighted a significant divergence in how Bitcoin holders are currently approaching the market. While Bitcoin attempts to regain momentum, particularly eyeing the $108,000 mark, the data indicates that not all participants are playing by the same rules. This insight is critical for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of current market dynamics beyond just price charts. Glassnode’s findings pinpoint a clear distinction in accumulation strategies based on the size of a holder’s wallet. This stratification of behavior offers a granular view into who is buying, who is selling, and what that might imply for future price action. It underscores the importance of looking beyond aggregate market data to truly grasp the nuances of investor sentiment. Decoding BTC Holder Behavior: Small Fish vs. Whales The core of Glassnode’s recent revelation lies in the contrasting BTC holder behavior across different wallet sizes. This distinction is often simplified to ‘small fish’ versus ‘whales,’ but Glassnode’s data provides more precise categories: Small Holders (1-10 BTC): Wallet addresses holding between 1 and 10 Bitcoin have shown a consistent tendency to sell. This could be indicative of smaller investors taking profits, managing risk, or reacting to short-term market volatility. Their selling pressure, while individually minor, can collectively contribute to market dynamics. Mid-Tier Holders (10-100 BTC): In stark contrast, wallet addresses holding between 10 and 100 Bitcoin are showcasing a clear buying tendency. These are often considered more established individual investors or smaller institutional players who may be accumulating for long-term positions, viewing current price levels as attractive entry points or opportunities to add to their existing holdings. This dichotomy suggests a sophisticated market where different segments react uniquely to similar price signals. The continuous selling by smaller entities, juxtaposed with the consistent buying by mid-tier holders, creates a fascinating push-and-pull within the market. It implies that while some are exiting, others are demonstrating conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Why the Divergence in Accumulation? Several factors could contribute to these distinct patterns in BTC holder behavior : Profit Taking: Smaller holders, especially those who entered during previous dips, might be capitalizing on recent price recoveries to secure profits. Risk Management: Retail investors often have lower risk tolerance and might reduce exposure during periods of uncertainty or consolidation. Long-Term Conviction: Larger holders typically have a longer investment horizon and may view current prices as opportunities to accumulate at a discount, anticipating future growth. Capital Deployment: Mid-tier entities might have more substantial capital reserves, allowing them to buy into dips without immediate pressure to sell. The Significance of On-Chain Metrics: The Accumulation Trend Score Explained Beyond individual wallet movements, Glassnode provides powerful aggregate tools like the Accumulation Trend Score . This particular on-chain metric is designed to reflect the relative size of entities that are actively accumulating coins on-chain, weighted by their BTC holdings. It’s a sophisticated indicator that moves from 0 (strong distribution) to 1 (strong accumulation). Glassnode’s recent report highlighted a notable rally in this score, which has increased from 0.25 to 0.57. This upward movement is highly significant: A score of 0.25 indicates a period of slight accumulation or neutrality, leaning towards distribution. A rally to 0.57 signifies a shift towards more pronounced accumulation. It suggests that, on balance, larger entities are increasingly adding to their Bitcoin holdings. While not yet in the ‘strong accumulation’ zone (closer to 1), this upward trend indicates growing conviction among significant players. This rise in the Accumulation Trend Score, despite smaller holders selling, reinforces the idea that the market’s underlying strength might be driven by more substantial, long-term focused participants. It’s a testament to the power of on-chain metrics in providing a transparent, real-time view of market sentiment that traditional financial data cannot offer. Actionable Cryptocurrency Market Insights: Navigating Divergent Strategies What do these insights from Glassnode analysis mean for the average investor? Understanding these divergent accumulation trends offers valuable cryptocurrency market insights that can inform your own strategy: Benefits of On-Chain Data Transparency: On-chain data provides unparalleled transparency into the actions of market participants, unlike traditional markets where institutional moves are often hidden. Early Signals: Changes in accumulation or distribution patterns can often precede significant price movements, offering early signals to informed investors. Sentiment Gauging: Metrics like the Accumulation Trend Score help gauge the overall market sentiment, particularly among different holder cohorts. Challenges to Consider Complexity: Interpreting raw on-chain data requires expertise. Platforms like Glassnode simplify it, but understanding the nuances still takes effort. Lag: While real-time, on-chain data reflects past actions. Future price movements are not guaranteed solely based on accumulation trends. Context is Key: Data must always be viewed within the broader market context, including macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and global events. Actionable Insights for Investors Given these observations, here are some actionable insights: Don’t Panic Sell: If you are a long-term investor, the selling by smaller holders might represent noise. Focus on the actions of larger entities who often have deeper market understanding. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): The ongoing accumulation by mid-tier holders suggests that strategic, consistent buying, regardless of short-term fluctuations, remains a viable strategy for long-term growth. Utilize On-Chain Tools: Explore resources from Glassnode and similar platforms to complement your technical and fundamental analysis. These tools can provide a unique edge. Understand Your Own Strategy: Reflect on whether your investment horizon aligns with that of smaller (short-term) or larger (long-term) holders. This self-awareness is crucial. Conclusion: A Deeper Look into Bitcoin’s Future The latest Glassnode analysis offers a compelling narrative of a Bitcoin market in flux, characterized by fascinatingly divergent accumulation trends. While smaller wallet addresses show signs of distribution, more substantial holders are actively accumulating, pushing the overall Accumulation Trend Score higher. This intricate dance between different market participants underscores Bitcoin’s maturity as an asset class, where various strategies coexist and influence market dynamics. For investors, these on-chain metrics provide invaluable transparency, allowing for more informed decisions beyond mere price action. As Bitcoin continues its journey, keeping an eye on these underlying holder behaviors will be crucial for navigating its volatile yet promising future. The insights from Glassnode remind us that beneath the surface of daily price swings, a powerful story of conviction and strategic positioning is constantly unfolding.

2025-06-26T16:13:20,"India Mulling Bitcoin Reserve as Global Interest Grows","The United States has established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) valued at over $20 billion. This move has started new conversations around the world, including in India. Pradeep Bhandari, a spokesperson for India’s ruling party, recently shared his views in a local news article. He believes that India should explore the idea of having its own Bitcoin Reserve. His message has brought fresh attention to India’s position on cryptocurrency. The United States Sets a New Direction The state of Texas reportedly signed the Bitcoin Reserve bill into law just five days before Bhandari’s article was published. In his article, Bhandari stated that India needs to update its financial policy to keep pace with global changes. He suggested that the government could start with a small Bitcoin Reserve project. He believes this could help India grow its economy and show that the country is open to new ideas. Many countries are now thinking about doing the same. Reports say that Pakistan is also planning to start a Bitcoin Reserve . India Needs To Set Clear Crypto Rules India has had a mixed history with cryptocurrency. In 2013, the Reserve Bank of India issued a warning against its use. In 2018, a ban was imposed, which was later overturned by the Supreme Court. Even now, India lacks clear guidelines on how to use or manage digital assets. Bhandari pointed out that India taxes crypto, but there are no proper laws to guide the industry. This confuses and slows progress. He stated that India needs clear rules to maximize the benefits of Bitcoin and protect investors. He also stated that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recently classified Bitcoin as a capital asset. This shows why India needs to move fast. During its G20 presidency in 2023 , India had a chance to lead on crypto policy. The country leaders worked with the IMF but did not create a clear national plan. Many people believe this delay is hindering India’s full potential to benefit from cryptocurrency. India Can Mine Bitcoin Using Clean Energy Bhandari also spoke about India’s energy strength. The country has plenty of renewable energy, like solar and hydropower. This can be used to mine Bitcoin cleanly and affordably. He gave the example of Bhutan, which has been mining Bitcoin since 2021, utilizing its excess hydropower. Bhutan now has a Bitcoin Reserve worth over $1 billion. This shows that smaller countries can also benefit from smart crypto strategies. Many people in India’s crypto industry agree with Bhandari. CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta stated that cryptocurrency is not just a means to generate wealth, but also a strategic and economic tool. He welcomed the fact that political leaders are now talking about it. He also said that India needs more such voices that understand where the world is going.

2025-06-26T16:10:37,"Unveiling Crypto Liquidity: Binance’s Bitcoin Dominance & Bitget’s Altcoin Ascent Revealed","BitcoinWorld Unveiling Crypto Liquidity: Binance’s Bitcoin Dominance & Bitget’s Altcoin Ascent Revealed In the fast-paced world of digital assets, understanding crypto liquidity is paramount. It’s the lifeblood of any healthy market, determining how easily and efficiently assets can be bought and sold without significantly impacting their price. A recent analysis from CoinGecko, a leading cryptocurrency data aggregator, has shed fascinating light on the current landscape of liquidity across major centralized exchanges (CEXes). Their “Crypto Liquidity on CEXes 2025” report offers crucial insights, particularly highlighting the strengths of industry giants like Binance and emerging powerhouses such as Bitget. The Unrivaled Strength of Bitcoin Liquidity on Binance When it comes to the king of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), one exchange stands head and shoulders above the rest in terms of liquidity: Binance. According to the CoinGecko report, which analyzed data from March 19 to May 18, Binance commanded a staggering 32% of the total BTC liquidity among the eight leading centralized exchanges. This dominance is not just a statistic; it reflects a deep and robust market where large orders can be executed with minimal slippage. The report revealed that the median market depth for BTC across these top exchanges hovered between $20–$25 million within a $100 range of Bitcoin’s price. Binance, however, significantly outpaced its competitors, demonstrating an impressive $8 million in depth on both the buy and sell sides. This means that a substantial amount of Bitcoin can be traded on Binance without causing a noticeable ripple in its price, making it an ideal venue for large-volume traders and institutions. Key Bitcoin Liquidity Figures (March 19 – May 18): Binance: $8 million (32% of total BTC liquidity) Bitget: $4.6 million OKX: $3.7 million This concentrated Bitcoin liquidity on Binance reinforces its position as the go-to platform for BTC trading. For traders, this translates into tighter spreads, faster execution, and overall more efficient trading experiences. For the broader market, it signifies a healthy and stable environment for Bitcoin, as large movements are less likely to destabilize its price. Bitget’s Ascendancy in Altcoin Liquidity While Binance reigns supreme in Bitcoin, the CoinGecko report brings another exciting development to the forefront: Bitget’s remarkable leadership in the altcoin liquidity market. For cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitget has carved out a dominant position, surpassing even established players like Binance and OKX. This is a significant achievement for Bitget, indicating its growing influence and specialized focus on providing robust trading environments for a diverse range of alternative cryptocurrencies. Altcoins, by their nature, can be more volatile and have shallower markets than Bitcoin. Therefore, strong liquidity in these assets is even more crucial to prevent price manipulation and ensure fair trading conditions. Why Bitget Excels in Altcoins: Diverse Offerings: Bitget has consistently expanded its altcoin listings, attracting a wider range of traders. Targeted Campaigns: The exchange likely employs strategies to incentivize altcoin trading, fostering deeper markets. User Experience: A focus on seamless trading for a variety of assets can draw in altcoin enthusiasts. For traders specializing in altcoins, Bitget’s strong altcoin liquidity offers significant advantages. It means they can enter and exit positions more easily, with less concern about price impact, even for less common tokens. This fosters a more dynamic and accessible altcoin market, benefiting both individual traders and project developers. Understanding Market Depth : Why It Matters for Crypto Exchanges The CoinGecko report frequently refers to “market depth,” a critical concept in understanding liquidity. So, what exactly is it, and why is it so important for crypto exchanges ? Market depth refers to the ability of a market to absorb large buy or sell orders without significantly affecting the price of the asset. It’s essentially a measure of the volume of buy and sell orders at various price levels. A market with good depth has many orders on both sides of the order book, indicating strong demand and supply. This translates to: Reduced Slippage: When you place a large order, it gets filled at or very close to your desired price. Tighter Spreads: The difference between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price is smaller, meaning lower transaction costs. Price Stability: Less susceptible to large price swings from significant trades. Easier Entry/Exit: Traders can enter and exit positions quickly and efficiently. For crypto exchanges , cultivating deep markets is a competitive advantage. It attracts more traders, especially institutional players who require reliable execution for large volumes. The CoinGecko report’s focus on market depth provides a quantitative measure of how well exchanges are serving their users by providing these crucial conditions. The Broader Implications of the CoinGecko Report The findings of the CoinGecko report offer more than just a snapshot of current liquidity; they provide valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. The report underscores the growing maturity of the CEX landscape, where specialization and strategic focus are becoming increasingly evident. Key Takeaways for Traders and Investors: Choose Your Exchange Wisely: Depending on whether you primarily trade Bitcoin or a diverse portfolio of altcoins, your choice of exchange can significantly impact your trading efficiency and costs. Binance remains king for BTC, while Bitget is emerging as the leader for altcoins. Liquidity Drives Efficiency: Always prioritize exchanges with strong liquidity for the assets you trade. This minimizes slippage and ensures better execution prices. Market Maturation: The presence of deep markets, even for altcoins, signals a maturing industry. This increased liquidity can attract more institutional capital and reduce overall market volatility. Data-Driven Decisions: Reports like CoinGecko’s are invaluable tools for making informed decisions. They move beyond anecdotal evidence to provide concrete data on market health. The report also highlights the ongoing competition among crypto exchanges to attract and retain users by providing superior trading conditions. As the market continues to expand, liquidity will remain a critical factor in determining an exchange’s success and reputation. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Liquidity The insights from the CoinGecko report set the stage for future developments in the crypto market. As institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies grows, the demand for even deeper and more reliable liquidity will intensify. Exchanges that can consistently provide this will solidify their positions as industry leaders. We can anticipate a continued focus on improving market depth across a wider range of assets, not just BTC and major altcoins. Furthermore, advancements in trading technology, such as improved order matching engines and increased API capabilities, will likely contribute to even more efficient markets. The battle for liquidity among crypto exchanges is far from over, and it’s a battle that ultimately benefits the end-user through better trading experiences. Conclusion: A Liquid Future for Crypto The CoinGecko “Crypto Liquidity on CEXes 2025” report offers a compelling look into the current state of cryptocurrency liquidity. It firmly establishes Binance’s continued dominance in Bitcoin liquidity , a testament to its vast user base and robust infrastructure. Simultaneously, it celebrates Bitget’s impressive rise to leadership in altcoin liquidity , showcasing its strategic focus and appeal to a diverse trading community. Understanding these dynamics, coupled with a grasp of essential concepts like market depth , empowers traders and investors to navigate the exciting world of digital assets more effectively. As the crypto ecosystem matures, the pursuit of deeper and more accessible liquidity will remain a cornerstone of its growth and stability.

2025-06-26T16:00:21,"Ethereum Reclaims $2,444 Level – Bullish Continuation In Focus","Ethereum has bounced back sharply, reclaiming the $2,400 level after a volatile week marked by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Last weekend, ETH briefly dipped below the $2,200 mark as panic selling swept across global markets following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The sell-off triggered a sharp fakeout that briefly pushed ETH out of its multi-week trading range. However, bulls are regaining control, and Ethereum’s price action now signals the early stages of a potential recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For Breakout Above $2,800 – Bullish Momentum Builds Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is reclaiming the key $2,444 resistance level — a zone that previously acted as both support and resistance throughout May and June. If bulls maintain momentum above this threshold, it could open the door for a bullish continuation toward the higher end of the established range. While uncertainty remains due to lingering macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, Ethereum’s current structure shows renewed strength. Market participants are watching closely, as ETH often serves as a leading indicator for broader altcoin performance. Holding above $2,400 could become a catalyst for a broader rally, especially if Bitcoin continues to stabilize and approach new all-time highs. Ethereum Battles For Breakout As Market Awaits Direction Ethereum is trading at a critical juncture after a turbulent week of price action driven by geopolitical instability and macroeconomic uncertainty. Following a sharp drop below $2,200 amid panic selling over the Middle East conflict escalation, ETH has recovered significantly, now hovering around the $2,444 level. This price zone is key, not only as a technical resistance but also as a sentiment marker for traders watching for signs of a trend reversal or confirmation of a deeper pullback. Analysts remain divided on what comes next. Some believe Ethereum’s recent recovery could signal the beginning of a bullish continuation, especially if price action holds and pushes above the upper range levels near $2,600. A breakout from this zone would indicate renewed strength and could set the tone for a broader altcoin rally, particularly as Ethereum often leads sector momentum. Others, however, warn that the recovery might be short-lived, and a retreat to lower demand zones could occur if macro conditions worsen. Ted Pillows notes that Ethereum is currently reclaiming the $2,444 resistance level. He emphasizes that bullish continuation into the range highs is necessary to confirm breakout strength. Until then, traders are watching closely, as any rejection at this level could shift momentum back to the downside. With global tensions and monetary tightening from central banks continuing to influence markets, the coming weeks may determine whether ETH enters a new uptrend or retreats further into its long-standing consolidation range. Related Reading: Chainlink Reclaims Key Structure – Quiet Accumulation Could Fuel $25–$30 Surge ETH Faces Long-Term Resistance The weekly chart of Ethereum (ETH/USD) shows a strong recovery from the $2,189 low, with ETH currently trading at $2,463 — a 10.5% gain so far this week. This sharp bounce comes after a fakeout below the $2,200 level and suggests renewed buying pressure following recent geopolitical volatility. However, price is now testing a major confluence zone formed by the 50-week ($2,660), 100-week ($2,625), and 200-week ($2,437) simple moving averages. This cluster of moving averages is acting as resistance, capping ETH’s upside momentum. Historically, when Ethereum breaks through these long-term trend lines, a significant trend continuation follows. But for now, bulls must decisively clear this $2,450–$2,660 zone to confirm a breakout and open the door toward the $3,000 psychological level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply Volume has slightly increased, indicating rising interest, but the rejection wicks from prior weekly candles suggest the market remains indecisive.

2025-06-26T15:50:52,"Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: India’s Bold Vision for Economic Resilience","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: India’s Bold Vision for Economic Resilience Imagine a future where a nation’s core financial strength isn’t solely tied to gold or traditional fiat currencies, but also to a decentralized digital asset like Bitcoin. This intriguing prospect just gained significant traction in India, one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies. Pradeep Bhandari, a national spokesperson for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has openly advocated for recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a profound statement that could signal a monumental shift in how India views and potentially integrates cryptocurrencies into its national financial framework. The implications of a major global power considering a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve are far-reaching, sparking conversations about financial sovereignty, technological innovation, and India’s position in the evolving global financial landscape. Why is a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Being Considered for India? To understand the significance of Bhandari’s statement, it’s crucial to grasp what a ‘strategic reserve asset’ truly entails. Traditionally, nations hold reserves of gold, foreign currencies (like the U.S. dollar), and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) from the IMF. These assets serve as a nation’s financial bedrock, providing stability during economic crises, facilitating international trade, and bolstering confidence in the national currency. They are crucial for managing exchange rates and external debt. So, why Bitcoin? Proponents argue that Bitcoin possesses several unique characteristics that make it an attractive candidate for a modern strategic reserve: Decentralization and Censorship Resistance: Unlike traditional assets controlled by central banks or governments, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, making it resistant to political interference or seizure. This offers a level of financial sovereignty that traditional assets cannot. Scarcity and Predictable Supply: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it a truly scarce asset. This fixed supply contrasts sharply with fiat currencies, which can be inflated at will by central banks, potentially eroding their value over time. This predictability offers a hedge against inflation. Global Liquidity and Portability: Bitcoin is a globally traded asset, accessible 24/7. Its digital nature allows for easy, rapid, and cost-effective transfer across borders, potentially streamlining international transactions and reducing reliance on traditional, slower banking rails. Protection Against Sanctions and Geopolitical Risks: In an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, holding a non-sovereign asset like Bitcoin could offer a nation an alternative means of conducting transactions and preserving wealth, particularly if faced with economic sanctions. For a nation like India, which aims for greater economic autonomy and global influence, exploring a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve could be a forward-thinking move to diversify its financial holdings and embrace the future of digital finance. How is India Crypto Regulation Evolving? India’s journey with cryptocurrencies has been a rollercoaster of caution, skepticism, and gradual openness. For years, the prevailing sentiment from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government leaned towards a ban, citing concerns about financial stability, money laundering, and investor protection. There were even proposals for a blanket prohibition on private cryptocurrencies, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty for millions of Indian crypto users and businesses. However, recent times have seen a noticeable shift. India’s presidency of the G20 in 2023 brought cryptocurrency regulation to the forefront of international discussions. India actively pushed for a globally coordinated framework for crypto assets, recognizing that unilateral bans are ineffective in a borderless digital world. This G20 initiative, spearheaded by India, resulted in a synthesis paper from the IMF and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) offering recommendations for a comprehensive regulatory approach. This marked a significant pivot from outright prohibition to a more nuanced, regulatory stance. Pradeep Bhandari’s statement, therefore, isn’t an isolated incident but rather a public manifestation of this evolving mindset within the ruling party. It suggests that the discussion around crypto in India is moving beyond mere regulation of trading and usage, towards considering its fundamental role in national finance. This indicates a growing recognition that digital assets, and Bitcoin in particular, cannot be ignored but must be understood and potentially integrated into the broader economic strategy. The direction of India Crypto Regulation is clearly shifting from one of apprehension to one of strategic consideration. What Does Broader Digital Asset Adoption Mean for India? Beyond its potential as a strategic reserve, broader Digital Asset Adoption holds immense promise for India across various sectors. India, with its vast, tech-savvy youth population and a rapidly expanding digital infrastructure, is uniquely positioned to leverage blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Potential Benefits: Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies can provide financial services to India’s unbanked and underbanked populations, offering access to savings, credit, and investment opportunities without traditional banking intermediaries. Remittances: India is the world’s largest recipient of remittances. Blockchain-based systems can significantly reduce the cost and time involved in cross-border money transfers, benefiting millions of families. Technological Innovation and Job Creation: A supportive regulatory environment for digital assets can foster a thriving blockchain industry, attracting investment, nurturing startups, and creating high-skilled jobs in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 development. Smart Contracts and Supply Chain Efficiency: Beyond Bitcoin, the underlying blockchain technology can revolutionize various industries through smart contracts, enhancing transparency and efficiency in areas like land records, healthcare, and supply chain management. Challenges to Overcome: Despite the immense potential, the path to widespread Digital Asset Adoption is not without hurdles: Regulatory Clarity: While the sentiment is shifting, a clear, comprehensive, and consistent regulatory framework is still needed to provide certainty for businesses and investors. Public Education: There’s a significant need to educate the general public about the risks and opportunities associated with digital assets to prevent scams and foster responsible participation. Infrastructure: Ensuring robust and secure digital infrastructure, including reliable internet access and cybersecurity measures, is crucial for mass adoption. Energy Consumption: The energy consumption of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin remains a concern, especially for a country like India committed to sustainability goals. Addressing these challenges proactively will be key to unlocking the full potential of digital assets for India’s growth story. How Could Bitcoin Impact the Indian Economy ? The potential integration of Bitcoin into India’s strategic reserves, or even just a more open stance towards digital assets, could have profound effects on the Indian Economy . This isn’t just about a new asset class; it’s about potentially reshaping economic policies and investment flows. Opportunities for the Indian Economy: Diversification of Reserves: Adding Bitcoin could diversify India’s foreign exchange reserves, reducing reliance on a single currency or commodity and potentially hedging against global economic volatility. Attracting Foreign Investment: A progressive stance on digital assets could make India a more attractive destination for global blockchain and crypto businesses, leading to increased foreign direct investment (FDI) and capital inflows. Innovation Hub: By embracing digital assets, India could solidify its position as a global innovation hub, particularly in fintech and blockchain technology, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of startups and talent. Inflation Hedge: As a scarce asset with a fixed supply, Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation, offering a potential tool to preserve purchasing power for the national treasury. Potential Risks for the Indian Economy: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant concern. Holding a volatile asset in national reserves could expose the economy to considerable fluctuations. Regulatory Arbitrage: Lack of clear global regulations could lead to regulatory arbitrage, where illicit activities might flow through jurisdictions with weaker oversight. Systemic Risk: Uncontrolled growth and integration of digital assets without proper oversight could introduce new systemic risks to the financial system. Careful consideration and a phased approach would be essential to mitigate these risks while harnessing the opportunities for the Indian Economy . Could Bitcoin Redefine India’s Role in the Global Financial System ? India’s consideration of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset is not just an internal policy matter; it carries significant weight for its standing in the Global Financial System . Historically, the U.S. dollar has dominated as the world’s primary reserve currency, alongside gold. Any move by a major economy like India to diversify its reserves into a non-sovereign digital asset could have ripple effects globally. If India were to proceed with accumulating Bitcoin, it would join a small but growing list of nations and entities exploring this path. El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, and various corporations have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. However, a major G20 economy doing so for its national reserves would be a game-changer, potentially accelerating the global legitimization of Bitcoin as a serious financial asset. Such a move could: Influence Other Nations: India’s decision could inspire other developing and even developed nations to re-evaluate their reserve strategies and consider digital assets. Challenge the Dollar’s Hegemony: While unlikely to dethrone the dollar overnight, a widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset could gradually reduce global reliance on a single fiat currency, fostering a more multipolar financial world. Promote Financial Multilateralism: By embracing a decentralized asset, India could champion a more inclusive and resilient global financial architecture, less susceptible to the whims of individual national policies. Enhance India’s Soft Power: Taking a pioneering role in digital asset integration could boost India’s image as a technologically advanced and forward-thinking nation on the world stage. The conversation around Bitcoin’s place in the Global Financial System is no longer theoretical; it’s becoming a tangible policy debate in key economies like India, potentially paving the way for a new era of international finance. The Road Ahead: Actionable Insights for India’s Crypto Future Pradeep Bhandari’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset is a significant moment, but it’s just the beginning of a complex journey. For India to effectively navigate this path, several actionable insights come to the fore: Develop a Clear Policy Roadmap: The government needs to move beyond statements to formulate a detailed, transparent policy framework for digital assets, covering taxation, regulation, and potential reserve integration. Foster Public-Private Dialogue: Engaging with industry experts, blockchain developers, and the crypto community is crucial to crafting informed and effective policies. Invest in Research and Development: India should invest in research into blockchain technology, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and the broader digital asset ecosystem to stay at the forefront of innovation. International Collaboration: Continuing to advocate for global regulatory harmonization, as initiated during the G20 presidency, is vital to manage the cross-border nature of digital assets. Pilot Programs: Consider small-scale pilot programs for Bitcoin integration or other digital asset initiatives to gather data and learn before full-scale implementation. The path forward requires a balanced approach, weighing the immense opportunities against the inherent risks, and building robust frameworks to ensure financial stability and protect investors. Conclusion: India’s Digital Dawn? The statement from BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful signal that India, a nation poised to become a global economic powerhouse, is seriously considering a revolutionary shift in its financial strategy. The idea of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for India moves the discussion from mere speculation to a tangible policy debate. While the journey of India Crypto Regulation has been cautious, this endorsement highlights a growing recognition of digital assets’ potential. Embracing broader Digital Asset Adoption could unlock significant opportunities for the Indian Economy , from financial inclusion to technological leadership. Moreover, such a move could redefine India’s influence within the Global Financial System , positioning it as a pioneer in the digital age of finance. The road ahead will undoubtedly be challenging, requiring careful planning and robust regulatory frameworks. However, if India successfully integrates Bitcoin into its national strategy, it could set a powerful precedent, paving the way for a new era of economic resilience and digital sovereignty.

2025-06-26T15:49:19,"Bitcoin Illiquid Supply Exceeds 14 Million BTC Amid Institutional FOMO","The illiquid supply of Bitcoin has reached a new milestone, exceeding 14 million BTC, according to data from Glassnode. For context, this metric refers to coins held in wallets with little to no history of spending, suggesting they are unlikely to be sold anytime soon. In other words, only about 7 million BTC out of the total 21 million supply remain readily available.With such a large portion locked away, this suggests that more investors are opting for long-term storage over active trading.Steep Rise in BTC Locked AwayThe accompanying chart shows a steady rise in the number of Bitcoin tokens becoming illiquid. As of December 2024, when the price of Bitcoin first surpassed the six-figure level, the illiquid supply was under 13.95 million. Despite Bitcoin consistently trading above $100K, the accumulation trend continues, as evidenced by the ongoing increase in illiquid supply, now at 14.35 million.Since late March, the illiquid supply of Bitcoin has seen a sharp increase, while price action during this period has remained relatively volatile.Specifically, the trend confirms that more investors are shifting toward self-custody, moving coins off exchanges and into cold storage. This behavior suggests a growing conviction among holders for higher BTC prices. Chart showing steady rise in illiquid Bitcoin | Glassnode Institutional FOMO in BitcoinThis trend is further evidenced by the increasing number of companies adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. This week alone, more than five companies have announced new Bitcoin acquisitions.Specifically, Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC purchased 3,724 BTC for $386.5 million, followed by another 1,208 BTC for $128 million, totaling 4,932 BTC worth $514.5 million. Moreover, Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquired 245 BTC after a $1 billion purchase the previous week.Smarter Web expanded its long-term Bitcoin treasury with a new acquisition of 197 BTC. Méliuz S.A. also acquired 275.43 BTC following a share offering, bringing its total to 595.67 BTC. The Blockchain Group added 75 BTC, bringing its total to 1,728 BTC.Earlier today, Metaplanet announced the acquisition of 1,234 BTC for approximately $132 million. The company now holds 12,345 BTC, purchased for a total of $1.20 billion.https://twitter.com/gerovich/status/1938070014889714005With this heightened trend of accumulation, combined with the fact that fewer coins are readily available on the market, Bitcoin may be setting up for its next major rally due to a looming supply shock.How Bitcoin Price Could React to a Supply ShockSpeaking at Bitcoin Conference 2025, Eric Trump argued that BTC could hit $170K by the end of 2026 due to surging demand outpacing available supply.He cited that a year ago, fewer than 100 companies held Bitcoin; now, that number has more than doubled. OTC desks and exchanges are reporting dwindling BTC inventory, making it harder for institutions to acquire more. “Everyone wants Bitcoin, and no one wants to sell,” Eric said, suggesting that this supply squeeze could fuel significant price gains.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/26/bitcoin-illiquid-supply-exceeds-14-million-btc-amid-institutional-fomo/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-illiquid-supply-exceeds-14-million-btc-amid-institutional-fomo,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T15:46:09,"While Bitcoin Whales Prefer Binance, Altcoin Whales Are Rushing to This Exchange!","In its latest research, CoinGecko announced the exchanges most preferred by whales for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin transactions. Accordingly, Bitget, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently emerged as the best platform for altcoins, leaving Binance and Coinbase behind. According to Coingecko's research, Bitget has become the leader in altcoin liquidity, leaving Binance behind. While analyzing the liquidity of the largest cryptocurrencies, Coingecko determined that Bitget dominates for Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and XRP. While Bitget led the way for top altcoins, Binance remained the top platform for Bitcoin liquidity across all market depths. “Binance offered the most liquidity for Bitcoin, while Bitget was the most liquid platform for altcoins, ranging from 0.3% to 0.5%.” Speaking to Coindesk, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen commented on the Coingecko research and said that Bitget’s leadership stems from its infrastructure. “Altcoin liquidity is a measure of market depth and this ranking shows how far Bitget has come. Today, institutions drive 80% of our spot volume, futures activity by professional firms has doubled, and 80% of top funds trade on Bitget.” In XRP, Bitget dominated with a depth range of 0.3% (with a variance of $0.006), while Binance and Coinbase lagged behind with a depth level of 1% (with a variance of $0.006). A similar situation was true for Solana, while Bitget led other major exchanges with a 32% share in the 0.6% range in liquidity for SOL. According to the report, Bitget also led other exchanges by small margins in ETH and DOGE, but Binance maintained its leading position for Bitcoin.
