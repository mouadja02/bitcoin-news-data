2025-06-26T12:58:42,"Best Crypto to Buy Now—Bitcoin’s $110K Push Fueling Layer 2 Mayhem","Bitcoin’s sharp rebound to $107K, driven by ETF inflows and dovish Fed signals, is igniting a wave of layer 2 development. As institutional demand rises, infrastructure projects for Bitcoin are gaining unprecedented traction. Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme coin project to build on Bitcoin as a layer 2, combining Solana-like speed with Bitcoin’s security. It bridges $2T liquidity with the meme economy, positioning itself as a breakout contender. Bitcoin has taken the lead again, with a sharp surge from $98,225 two days ago to $107,200 at press time. It has regained the crucial $107,000 support level, with recent movements reflecting global news around Middle East tension and broader market sentiment . Image Courtesy: TradingView Demand in the crypto market was further boosted by a profit booking in oil prices and dovish speculations around the Fed interest rates. Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman is open to cutting rates at the July policy meeting. Additionally, the CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 20.7% chance of a 25-basis-point cut, up from 12.5% last week. The technical and fundamental catalysts are in place to push Bitcoin to a new all-time high above $110,000. This rally could fuel the next Bitcoin layer 2 Mayhem, accelerating institutional inflows into infrastructure projects. Built directly on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe has become an early leading contender in the layer 2 race. The project addresses Bitcoin’s major limitations, like speed and scalability, that have prevented it from capturing the explosive meme coin market. Bitcoin Pepe solves this with a layer 2 solution that brings lightning-fast speed to Bitcoin's rock-solid foundation. Bitcoin ETFs see the biggest monthly inflow, and the layer 2 mayhem begins The US spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded the largest monthly inflow for June, on the 24th, at $588.6 million, continuing the streak of 11 consecutive net positive days. According to Coinglass data , BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted significant investments of $436.3 million. Image Courtesy: Coinglass Vincent Liu, Kronos Research's chief investment officer , said, “Persistent inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs spotlight the strengthening story of BTC as digital gold. Investors are seeking stability through scarcity.” Growing enthusiasm and investor confidence in Bitcoin and digital assets show that the layer 2 rally is not far away. Projects focusing on solving infrastructure problems are already getting massive traction. The spotlight has shifted to projects focusing on smart solutions that fix Bitcoin’s weaknesses or build on what it already does well. These three projects clearly stand out as the best crypto to buy now before Bitcoin makes its next big move: Bitcoin Pepe: Layer 2 presale hits $15.6m before listing If there’s one project perfectly positioned to capitalize on the upcoming layer 2 madness, it is Bitcoin Pepe . It is the world’s first meme ICO on Bitcoin, building the technical infrastructure of Solana on Bitcoin. The PEP-20 token standard introduced by Bitcoin Pepe brings unlimited asset creation to BTC for the first time ever, while its proprietary layer 2 tech delivers Solana-like speed and scalability. Now, imagine the kind of massive market that could grow from a huge $2 trillion liquidity injection into meme coins. Bitcoin Pepe is building the bridge between Bitcoin's $2 trillion liquidity and the explosive meme market. Now, anyone can create projects on the Bitcoin network without sacrificing high security. With $15.6m raised at $0.0437, BPEP is positioned at the centre of Bitcoin’s institutional demand and the retail-driven meme sector. Smart money is already increasing their exposure after the confirmed BitMart listing and rumors that big CEX players could onboard on the June 30th announcement. Experts call it one of the easiest ways to ride the Bitcoin layer 2 wave set to shake the market this year. Polygon: Leading the layer 2 scaling on Ethereum While Bitcoin Pepe emerges as the best layer 2 project building on Bitcoin for the first time, Polygon is a leading layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The project is designed to make transactions faster and cheaper. It helps reduce network congestion by processing transactions off-chain while staying connected to Ethereum’s security. Its ecosystem supports DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more. Image Courtesy: CoinMarketCap However, since it reached an all-time high in 2024, Polygon has experienced immense selling pressure. Currently trading at $0.182, a surge of 8% in the last two days has reinforced investor confidence after weeks of correction. Analysts attribute this spike to a positive shift in the broader market sentiment. The coin's technical analysis positions it above its multiple crucial moving averages, proving positive momentum for sustained medium-term market growth. Traders who look at the $0.20 resistance level predict that the POL price can reach new highs, backed by its ability to maintain this psychological milestone. Arbitrum: Offering an optimistic rollup solution Arbitrum is a layer 2 scaling solution that uses optimistic rollups to process transactions faster and at lower cost. Unlike Polygon, which uses a sidechain and multiple scaling methods, Arbitrum stays more closely tied to Ethereum’s base layer. Why Arbitrum Might Be DeFi’s Most Undervalued Bet Right NowIn the golden years of DeFi, one of the best strategies for spotting undervalued protocols was targeting those with a market cap-to-TVL ratio below 1. It signaled that the protocol’s value was lagging behind the… pic.twitter.com/3WTTji7cK0 — CryptoJZ (@0xCryptoJZ) June 24, 2025 Why include Arbitrum in a list of the best crypto to buy now? Because Arbitrum is a strong layer 2 player and has excellent narrative alignment. If the premise that Ethereum scaling is key to mass adoption is true, Arbitrum could be one of this cycle's largest gainers. The network acts as the bridge to faster, cheaper Ethereum transactions, and the growing interest in DeFi and layer 2 solutions is another massive boom for the platform. The Layer 2 explosion starts now Investors are cheering Bitcoin’s rebound to $107,000, confirming that a major capital shift is now underway. Major layer 2 projects are about to become a playground for traders, application developers, and degens looking to build on-chain, and Bitcoin layer 2 is the biggest opportunity. Bitcoin Pepe , the first Bitcoin layer 2 solution, fits the mold perfectly. The project addresses infrastructure needs that have become highly valuable as the market expands. And this could be one of 2025’s breakout projects still available for just $0.0437 with another CEX listing announcement coming on June 30th.

2025-06-26T12:50:54,"Flowdesk Secures Pivotal $100 Million Digital Asset Credit Facility","BitcoinWorld Flowdesk Secures Pivotal $100 Million Digital Asset Credit Facility In a significant stride for the digital asset sector, Flowdesk, a prominent digital asset trading and technology firm, has successfully secured a substantial $100 million credit facility. This landmark Flowdesk funding announcement not only underscores growing institutional confidence in the crypto space but also positions Flowdesk for an ambitious phase of global expansion and technological advancement. For anyone closely watching the evolution of finance, this move signals a powerful shift towards more sophisticated and capital-efficient operations within the digital asset ecosystem. What Does This Flowdesk Funding Breakthrough Mean? The news, initially reported via a press release on Business Wire, highlights Flowdesk’s strategic partnership with Two Prime Lending Limited, a notable player in the digital asset lending arena. This substantial credit facility is earmarked to fuel Flowdesk’s global ambitions, enabling them to expand their reach and further develop their cutting-edge, capital-efficient trading infrastructure. This isn’t just about more money; it’s about smart money – empowering Flowdesk to optimize its operations and serve a broader client base. The facility itself is structured as a multiple drawdown term loan, offering Flowdesk the flexibility to access funds as needed, rather than in a single lump sum. This adaptable structure is crucial for a dynamic firm operating in a fast-evolving market like digital assets. Furthermore, the loan carries an initial 365-day term, with an option for extension, subject to lender approval, providing both short-term liquidity and potential long-term stability. The Power of Digital Asset Credit in Today’s Market The ability to secure a significant digital asset credit facility is a testament to Flowdesk’s robust business model and the increasing maturity of the crypto lending market. Unlike traditional loans, digital asset credit often leverages the unique properties of cryptocurrencies, offering new avenues for capital generation and liquidity management. For a firm like Flowdesk, which operates at the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets, such a facility is indispensable for maintaining high levels of liquidity and operational efficiency. Key Benefits of Digital Asset Credit Facilities: Enhanced Liquidity: Provides ready access to capital without liquidating existing digital asset holdings, which can be crucial in volatile markets. Capital Efficiency: Allows firms to leverage their digital assets as collateral, freeing up other capital for investment and operational needs. Operational Flexibility: Structured facilities like term loans with drawdown options offer adaptability to fluctuating market conditions and business demands. Strategic Growth: Enables significant investments in technology, infrastructure, and global expansion, fostering long-term development. This type of credit facility underscores a growing trend where digital assets are no longer just speculative investments but are increasingly recognized as viable collateral and foundational elements for sophisticated financial products. Leveraging Bitcoin: Understanding the Bitcoin-Backed Loan A significant aspect of this credit facility is its collateral: a portion of Flowdesk’s Bitcoin holdings. The decision to back the loan with Bitcoin speaks volumes about the evolving perception of BTC as a legitimate and valuable asset, even in institutional lending contexts. A Bitcoin-backed loan allows firms to unlock liquidity from their crypto assets without selling them, thus avoiding potential tax events or missing out on future price appreciation. While using Bitcoin as collateral comes with its own set of considerations, primarily related to its price volatility, the structuring of such a loan typically involves sophisticated risk management strategies. This can include over-collateralization requirements, dynamic margin calls, and robust monitoring systems to protect both the borrower and the lender from market fluctuations. The fact that Two Prime Lending Limited is comfortable providing a $100 million facility backed by Bitcoin highlights their expertise in managing digital asset risks and their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Navigating the Evolving Crypto Lending Landscape The broader crypto lending landscape has seen its share of challenges and triumphs. Following the tumultuous events of 2022, which saw several high-profile collapses in the crypto lending sector, the market has been working towards greater transparency, regulation, and robust risk management. This Flowdesk-Two Prime deal can be seen as a positive indicator of this maturation process. Institutional players are increasingly demanding secure, compliant, and well-structured lending solutions. Firms like Two Prime Lending Limited, which specialize in digital asset lending, are crucial in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. Their ability to assess and manage the unique risks associated with digital assets is paramount to fostering trust and stability in this nascent yet rapidly growing sector. This transaction demonstrates that despite past hurdles, the demand for sophisticated crypto lending services remains strong, driven by the operational needs of leading digital asset firms. Fueling Institutional Crypto Growth: A Look Ahead This substantial credit facility is not just a win for Flowdesk; it’s a significant milestone for the entire institutional crypto sector. As more traditional financial institutions, corporations, and sophisticated investors enter the digital asset space, the demand for reliable, compliant, and scalable infrastructure grows exponentially. Flowdesk, with its focus on capital-efficient trading technology, is directly addressing these needs. The ability to secure such a large credit line empowers Flowdesk to: Expand Global Reach: Open new offices, onboard more international clients, and comply with diverse regulatory frameworks worldwide. Innovate Trading Solutions: Invest further in their proprietary technology, enhance trading algorithms, and develop new financial products tailored for institutional clients. Strengthen Market Position: Compete more effectively with established players by offering superior liquidity and execution capabilities. Attract Top Talent: With increased funding, Flowdesk can invest in human capital, bringing in the best minds to drive future growth and innovation. This development signals a clear trend: institutional adoption of digital assets is not just about holding Bitcoin or Ethereum. It’s about building the complex financial plumbing necessary to integrate these assets into the global financial system. Deals like Flowdesk’s credit facility are critical steps in this ongoing evolution, demonstrating that the market is moving towards greater sophistication, stability, and widespread acceptance. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Digital Asset Finance Flowdesk’s securing of a $100 million credit facility from Two Prime Lending Limited is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement about the resilience, growth, and increasing institutionalization of the digital asset industry. This strategic injection of capital will enable Flowdesk to solidify its position as a leader in digital asset trading and technology, fostering global expansion and enhancing its capital-efficient infrastructure. It underscores the growing confidence in crypto assets as viable collateral and highlights the crucial role of specialized digital asset lenders in facilitating market growth. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, such pivotal funding rounds will be instrumental in shaping a more robust, liquid, and accessible financial future.

From making over $6.8 million in one day to losing nearly $10 million within just 3 days, Qwatio’s journey is nothing short of a thriller. $6.8M Profit Turned Into Liquidation According to Lookonchain, it all started when Qwatio made headlines by earning over $6.8 million in a single day. He went all-in on Bitcoin and Ethereum using 50x leverage, right before Trump signed an executive order that shook the crypto market.

2025-06-26T12:46:52,"Top Altcoins to Explode as Analyst Predicts Altcoin Season Approaching","Kevin Svenson, a cryptocurrency trader with 83.3K YouTube subscribers, has published some interesting insights about the $OTHERS chart. $OTHERS tracks the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies except the top 10 largest assets. The chart is now forming a pattern very similar to what it saw between March and November 2024. As Svenson’s graph illustrates, 2024 was marked by a sharp fall in the crypto market cap, followed by a brain-melting 140% rally. The analyst has pointed out that something similar, i.e., a considerable downward sell-off, has happened between December 2024 and June 2025. He now expects another bullish rally from here , with $OTHERS forming a new all-time-high. Read on for more insights on $OTHERS and how it ties up with Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index. We’ll also suggest the top altcoins to explode as the next crypto rally takes shape. $OTHERS’ Correlation with $BTC and the S&P Index Svenson said that the 140% rally coincided with the time when both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index made fresh all-time highs. In the current context, $BTC made an all-time high on May 22, 2025, hitting $112K. Since then, it has been consolidating around the $100K mark, which seems to be a strong support zone. Currently, $BTC is only 4% away from a fresh all-time high . Similarly, the S&P 500 index has seen a rally of around 20% since mid-April and is only 1.15% away from a new all-time high. Both $BTC and the S&P index aren’t too far away from fresh highs, which Kevin expects will push the market cap of $OTHERS to $570B (a nearly 150% increase from its current market capitalization of $229B). Considering the huge upside potential, this could be the perfect time to invest in altcoins poised to benefit from the next rally. If you’re looking for high-potential picks, here are a few top cryptos worth investing in . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Top Altcoin to Explode Now, Layer-2 for Fast & Cheap $BTC Transactions Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could turn out to be the most successful low-cap coin come the next Bitcoin rally. After all, it’s designed to supercharge the Bitcoin ecosystem in a way that no other meme coin has attempted before. This new cryptocurrency project aims to solve Bitcoin’s biggest problems as a blockchain, namely slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability. It will do so by building a new Layer-2 (L2) solution that integrates the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and a Canonical Bridge to seamlessly support $BTC transfers between the Bitcoin L1 & Hyper’s L2. The wrapped $BTC that Hyper mints on the L2 can be used to speed up transactions, reduce gas fees, and support complex operations. In other words, it’s paving the way for Bitcoin-compatible NFTs, yield farming, and DeFi services. Bitcoin Hyper is currently in presale, with over $1.6M in early investor funding. You can buy $HYPER for just $0.012025, which puts you in a great position to benefit from its potential 12,370% surge over the next few years . 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Top Altcoin to Ride Bitcoin’s Growth BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a new presale that’s quickly gaining traction thanks to its unique mission of building a thriving community of Bitcoin maximalists. The benefits of becoming a $BTCBULL owner include getting a chance to participate in Bitcoin’s price surge and winning free $BTC. Essentially, every time Bitcoin reaches a new major milestone, like $150K and $200K, for the first time, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will get to partake in free $BTC airdrop events. Additionally, the developers will also burn a part of the total token supply with rising Bitcoin prices. Every time $BTC is up $50K (such as when reaching $125K, $175K, and $225K), the BTC Bull Token’s supply will go down. By creating an urgency among potential investors to buy $BTCBULL before Bitcoin hits new all-time highs, the token has masterfully planned to spike its demand and price alongside Bitcoin’s. One $BTCBULL is currently selling for just $0.00258, and the project has in total raised over $7.4M at the time of writing. Here’s how to buy $BTCBULL to support the project. 3. CZ’s Dog ($BROCCOLI) – Best Dog-Themed Meme Coin of 2025 CZ’s Dog ($BROCCOLI) is the first major meme token on BNB, carrying forward the legacy of the most successful dog meme coin of 2025. $BROCCOLI, in case you’re wondering, is based on the pet dog (called Broccoli) of Binance’s ex-CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao. It all started when CZ engaged in a fun banter on X, where he not only approved the idea of meme coins but also expressed his desire to launch a meme coin based on his own pet dog. The crypto community was quick to pick up the pictures he shared of Broccoli and launched several $BROCCOLI tokens. Some of the most successful ones recorded over 1,000% gains in just over a week, and while CZ’s Dog has a long way to go before it could compete against its dog-themed predecessors, the fact that it’s the only major dog meme coin on BNB has been working in its favor. The token is up 15% over the past 7 days , and if momentum holds, we can see it surge past $0.030 very soon. It’s currently trading at $0.02591. Bottom Line With both $BTC and the S&P 500 index nearing new all-time highs, expert traders like Kevin Svenson believe that the next altcoin season is just around the corner. If you want front-row seats to the upcoming altcoin frenzy, new tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) are top choices. However, bear in mind that investments in crypto are highly risky.

The vehicle, M3-Brigade Acquisition V, plans to rebrand and use the cash to buy a basket of tokens including bitcoin BTC, ether ETH and Solana's sol SOL. The move comes as public companies worldwide are rushing to add cryptocurrencies as treasury assets. Many, however, are focusing on bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, alone.

2025-06-26T12:42:23,"Bitcoin Miner Revenues Hit Two-Month Low, Selling Activity Remains Muted: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin miner revenues have fallen to their lowest levels in two months, according to analysts at on-chain and market data CryptoQuant . On June 22, daily earnings dropped to $34 million, a level not seen since April 20, 2025. The downturn is mainly being attributed to reduced transaction fees and a decline in the market price of Bitcoin. The combination of these factors is leading to an environment where miners are experiencing some of the lowest compensation rates recorded in the past year. As reported in CryptoQuant’s weekly analysis, miners are currently “the most underpaid they have been in the last year.” Bitcoin miners just saw their worst payday in a year. Daily revenue slipped to $34 million in June, the lowest since April. Falling fees and Bitcoin’s price drop are crushing margins. pic.twitter.com/TXdN06CU1F — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 26, 2025 Hashrate Falls, But Miner Selling Stays Low Despite the drop in revenue, miners have not responded with increased selling. CryptoQuant reports that Bitcoin outflows from miner wallets have steadily decreased, falling from a peak of 23,000 BTC per day in February to around 6,000 BTC today. This represents a significant reduction in selling activity, especially given the recent price volatility. Notably, the network’s hashrate has experienced a 3.5% drawdown since June 16, marking the largest decline in nearly a year. However, this drop in computational power has not translated into heightened liquidations by miners. In addition, so-called “Satoshi-era” miners have sold only 150 BTC so far in 2025, compared to nearly 10,000 BTC in 2024. Miner Reserves Grow Despite Lower Income CryptoQuant analysts also note that instead of selling, miners are increasing their reserves. Addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have grown their combined holdings from 61,000 BTC on March 31 to 65,000 BTC as of late June. This is the highest level of reserve accumulation by this group of miners since November 2024. The steady accumulation trend suggests that most miners are not facing immediate financial stress, even amid falling revenues. Their continued reserve growth indicates a long-term outlook and confidence in future price recovery, rather than capitulation under current market conditions. Overall, while Bitcoin miner revenues have declined to a two-month low, there is no evidence of widespread selling pressure in response. CryptoQuant’s findings portray a mining sector that, though underpaid by recent standards, remains resilient and strategically focused on long-term accumulation.

2025-06-26T12:40:33,"ARK Invest’s Strategic Shift: Why Cathie Wood Divested Millions in Robinhood Shares","BitcoinWorld ARK Invest’s Strategic Shift: Why Cathie Wood Divested Millions in Robinhood Shares In the dynamic world of finance, where every institutional move sends ripples across markets, a recent decision by ARK Invest has captured significant attention. Led by the visionary Cathie Wood, ARK Investment Management has once again made headlines, this time with a notable divestment from one of the most talked-about retail trading platforms: Robinhood. This move isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a strategic indicator that prompts a deeper look into the evolving landscape of digital trading and institutional investment strategies. The Sale Unpacked: What Exactly Happened with Robinhood Shares? On June 25, 2024, ARK Investment Management, under the leadership of Cathie Wood , executed a significant sale. The firm offloaded 55,949 shares of Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), the popular U.S. trading platform known for both stocks and cryptocurrencies. This transaction amounted to approximately $4.63 million, as reported by Ark Invest Daily on X. While a single sale might seem minor in the grand scheme of a multi-billion dollar fund, it’s the context and the potential implications that make this particular move by ARK Invest noteworthy. Institutional investors like ARK often signal broader trends or shifts in their outlook through such actions. To put this into perspective, let’s consider the nature of Robinhood itself: Dual Platform: Robinhood offers trading for both traditional stocks and a growing number of cryptocurrencies, appealing to a wide demographic of retail investors. Retail Focus: Its user-friendly interface and commission-free trading model have made it a favorite among new and younger investors. Market Volatility: The platform has been at the epicenter of several retail trading phenomena, including meme stock surges and crypto booms, often experiencing significant volatility. Why the Divestment? Decoding Cathie Wood’s Investment Strategy When a prominent fund like ARK Invest makes a move, especially one involving a divestment, analysts and investors alike scramble to understand the underlying reasons. Cathie Wood’s investment strategy is famously centered around disruptive innovation, long-term growth, and identifying companies poised to revolutionize their industries. So, why would ARK choose to sell a significant chunk of its Robinhood shares? Several factors could be at play: Portfolio Rebalancing: ARK Invest actively manages its portfolios, often rebalancing to maintain desired asset allocations or to trim positions that have seen significant gains, allowing capital to be redeployed into other high-conviction ideas. Profit Taking: If Robinhood shares had appreciated significantly since ARK’s initial investment, the sale could simply be a strategic move to lock in profits, especially in a volatile market environment. Changing Outlook on Robinhood’s Growth Trajectory: While Robinhood has been a pioneer, the competitive landscape for brokerage firms and crypto trading platform s is intensifying. ARK might be reassessing Robinhood’s long-term growth potential against emerging competitors or regulatory headwinds. Regulatory Concerns: Robinhood has faced scrutiny from regulators regarding its business practices, payment for order flow, and crypto offerings. Potential future regulations could impact its profitability and operational model. Shifting Focus to Other Disruptors: ARK’s philosophy is to invest in companies at the forefront of innovation. Perhaps new opportunities in other sectors or technologies are presenting more compelling growth prospects, prompting a reallocation of capital. It’s important to remember that ARK’s decisions are often driven by a long-term outlook, not short-term market fluctuations. This divestment might reflect a refined view on where the most significant disruptive potential lies in the coming years. Impact on Robinhood: A Glimpse into HOOD’s Future An institutional sale, particularly from a high-profile investor like ARK Invest, can certainly influence market sentiment towards Robinhood shares . While the $4.63 million sale is a fraction of Robinhood’s market capitalization, the ‘Cathie Wood effect’ can sometimes amplify the perception of such moves. What could this mean for Robinhood? Investor Confidence: A sale by a prominent institutional investor might lead some retail and institutional investors to re-evaluate their own positions in HOOD, potentially leading to increased selling pressure in the short term. Strategic Review: For Robinhood itself, such a move from a respected fund might prompt an internal review of its strategic direction, especially concerning its growth avenues and risk management. Focus on Diversification: Robinhood has been actively working to diversify its revenue streams beyond just trading, including expanding into IRAs, credit cards, and other financial services. This sale could underscore the urgency for Robinhood to prove its long-term viability and expand its offerings. Despite the sale, Robinhood remains a significant player in the retail trading space. Its ability to attract new users and its foray into diverse financial products will be key to its future performance. Robinhood’s Role as a Crypto Trading Platform: Challenges and Opportunities A significant part of Robinhood’s appeal, especially to younger investors, has been its role as an accessible crypto trading platform . It offers a simplified gateway to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, making digital assets more approachable for the mainstream. However, this segment of its business also comes with unique challenges. Key aspects of Robinhood’s crypto operations: Aspect Description Implication Ease of Access Simple interface, low minimums, commission-free trading. Attracts new crypto investors, but may lack advanced features for seasoned traders. Limited Coin Selection Offers a curated list of popular cryptocurrencies. Reduces complexity for beginners, but limits choice for those seeking altcoins. Regulatory Scrutiny Operating in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment for digital assets. Potential for new rules to impact business model, compliance costs. Security & Custody Robinhood holds user crypto, simplifying custody but raising questions for self-custody advocates. Convenient for users, but contrasts with the decentralized ethos of crypto for some. The future success of Robinhood as a crypto platform hinges on its ability to navigate regulatory hurdles, expand its offerings responsibly, and maintain user trust in an increasingly competitive market. Institutional moves like ARK’s sale might also reflect a broader institutional caution towards the volatile and regulatory-uncertain crypto market. Broader Market Implications: What Does This Mean for Retail Investors and Investment Strategy? The sale of Robinhood shares by ARK Invest isn’t an isolated event; it’s a piece of a larger puzzle that reflects current market dynamics and evolving investment strategy among institutional players. For retail investors, such actions offer valuable insights into how large funds are positioning themselves amidst economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and technological shifts. Here are some broader takeaways: Adaptability is Key: ARK’s willingness to adjust its portfolio, even exiting positions in companies it once championed, highlights the importance of adaptability in investment. Markets are constantly changing, and what was a strong conviction yesterday might not be today. Focus on Fundamentals: Beyond the hype, institutional investors ultimately look at a company’s underlying fundamentals, its competitive advantages, and its ability to execute its long-term vision. This sale could suggest a re-evaluation of Robinhood’s fundamental strengths in a maturing market. Diversification Remains Crucial: For retail investors, observing institutional moves reinforces the timeless principle of diversification. Relying too heavily on a single stock or sector, even one favored by a prominent investor, can expose one to undue risk. Monitor Institutional Flow, But Do Your Own Research: While it’s insightful to track what funds like ARK Invest are doing, their investment horizons and risk appetites are often different from individual investors. Always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Volatile Market What can you, as an investor, take away from ARK Invest’s decision to sell Robinhood shares? Review Your Portfolio: Use this as an opportunity to assess your own holdings. Are your investments aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance? Stay Informed on Regulatory Changes: Especially if you’re invested in crypto or fintech platforms, keep an eye on evolving regulations that could impact their business models. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just react to headlines. Try to understand the potential reasons behind institutional moves. Is it profit-taking, a change in fundamental outlook, or a strategic reallocation? Consider Long-Term Trends: Cathie Wood’s focus is on disruptive innovation. While ARK may be adjusting its short-to-medium term positions, the underlying trends of digital finance and decentralized technologies continue to evolve. This move by ARK Invest serves as a reminder that even the most innovative companies are subject to rigorous evaluation by large funds, and their positions can shift as market conditions and competitive landscapes evolve. It’s a testament to the dynamic nature of investing, where continuous assessment and strategic adaptation are paramount.

2025-06-26T12:39:10,"MSTR stock vs. MSTY stock: Which offers better returns in a Bitcoin bull run?","The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF has grown into a $4.8 billion fund, driven by its 136% dividend yield and its connection to Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. MSTY’s inflows have increased each month this year, with the net amount reaching $3.9 billion. This trajectory may continue if Bitcoin ( BTC ) breaks out and hits a new all-time high, as Polymarket traders expect. Demand is also rising because Strategy’s core stock does not pay a dividend. Instead, MSTY generates its monthly distributions through a covered call strategy. MSTY ETF inflows | Source: ETF In a covered call approach, the fund invests a portion of its capital in Strategy stock and benefits as the stock rises. It then sells call options on the stock, generating premium income, which it distributes to investors. A call option is a contract that gives the investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specific price within a certain time period. If MSTR stock drops below the strike price, the option becomes worthless since the stock can be bought directly on the market. If the stock rises above the strike price, the call option is exercised. In this case, the fund retains the premium but sacrifices additional upside if the rally continues. If the stock remains flat, the ETF still generates a return through the monthly premium. These scenarios explain why MSTY and other covered call ETFs offer high dividend yields. MSTY has a lower total return than MSTR The 136% dividend yield is highly enticing to many income investors. For instance, a $10,000 investment would yield a gross annual dividend payment of $13,600 if the yield remains constant. However, a closer look reveals that MSTY’s total return has lagged behind MSTR’s. Data shows that MSTY has declined by 18% year to date, while MSTR stock is up 34%. The best measure of an ETF’s performance is the total return, which includes dividends. In this case, MSTR stock has risen 34.20% this year, while MSTY has gained 29%. As shown below, MSTY’s total return over the past 12 months was 107%, compared to MSTR’s 160%. MSTY vs MSTR | Source: SeekingAlpha A similar trend appears across most covered call ETFs. For example, Coinbase stock has advanced 60% in the past 12 months, while the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF (CONY) has risen 24%. Similarly, the $40 billion JEPI ETF consistently lags behind the S&P 500 Index.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/mstr-stock-vs-msty-stock-which-offers-better-returns-in-a-bitcoin-bull-run/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|stocks|Strategy",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T12:27:19,"VivoPower CEO Credits ‘XRP Army’ for $121M Treasury Move, Calls Bitcoin Treasuries Crowded","The post VivoPower CEO Credits ‘XRP Army’ for $121M Treasury Move, Calls Bitcoin Treasuries Crowded appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News VivoPower recently announced plans to become the first publicly traded company to adopt XRP as a treasury reserve asset. This decision came shortly after the company successfully completed a $121 million private offering, making headlines in both the crypto and business worlds. Why XRP? The CEO Explains In a recent interview with Tony Edwards, VivoPower’s CEO Kevin Chin opened up about why the company chose XRP over more popular options like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. Chin shared that his belief in XRP isn’t new. He’s been following and investing in digital assets for years. But what really stood out, according to him, is XRP’s potential in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) space. “I have genuine conviction in XRP and what it can do for markets,” Chin explained. He also said that while Bitcoin treasuries have become common, with over 100 companies holding BTC in their reserves, the market for XRP is still relatively untapped. “We saw a gap in the market,” he added, hinting that VivoPower wanted to be the first mover in this space. “I think there’s more than 100 Bitcoin treasury companies as well. We felt that it was quite crowded already. And there are people doing it very well in the markets already. Similarly, with Solana and ETH, there were already other players,” he said. XRP’s Loyal Following Played a Role Another reason behind the move was XRP’s strong and passionate global community, famously known as the ‘XRP Army.’ Chin admitted that the company has been part of this community and recognizes the influence and dedication of XRP holders worldwide. A Big Win for XRP Adoption This decision marks a big moment for XRP and its supporters. As more traditional businesses explore cryptocurrencies, VivoPower’s announcement could inspire others to look beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, opening new opportunities for digital assets like XRP in the corporate world.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/vivopower-ceo-credits-xrp-army-for-121m-treasury-move-calls-bitcoin-treasuries-crowded/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

Previously, ZachXBT investigated the whale for aggressively trading MELANIA and other tokens. One of the high-profile whales, previously identified by ZachXBT as William Parker, is back with high-profile positions on Hyperliquid. The whale is also known for his social media handle @qwatio , with no live posts after deleting most of its content since 2015. The whale joined the league of James Wynn and Aguila Trades in a new trend of high-profile traders in recent weeks. MELANIA has a track record The same trader has returned multiple times with new wallets, causing havoc on Hyperliquid with some of the most destructive trades, especially linked to draining liquidity pools. @qwatio’s trading practice informed a subsequent deliberate manipulation of the JELLY token, again with the goal of draining the liquidity pool. In the past few months, @qwatio used four known addresses. Three of the previous ones are inactive, with no new positions. The whale, known as William Parker, or @qwatio, opened two new short positions on BTC and ETH. | Source: Hyperliquid The latest known address is $436K underwater, based on its short positions for BTC and ETH. This time around, the positions had a notional value above $210M, with no clear signs of deliberate counter-trading. The unrealized profit and loss may change, though the trader has shown readiness to keep the positions. On-chain data shows he posted $4.5M USDC collateral to extend his short positions and avoid liquidation. The whale is now considered to be in gambling mode, after six liquidations in the past three days. Hyperliquid becomes top crypto summer venue The stories of high-profile whales added to Hyperliquid’s fame as the go-to chain for derivative trading. It often competes with some of the biggest centralized exchanges in terms of volumes and open interest. In June, Hyperliquid activity slowed down a bit, with open interest of $7.2B. Hyperliquid remains a leader in 24-hour fees, surpassing Ethereum, Solana and other top apps and networks. Based on Artemis data, Hyperliquid generated $2.1M in fees. The perpetual futures DEX also carries $6.8B in 24-hour volumes, with over 500K daily active users. The market shows a mix of organic traffic and activity that aims to tap an eventual second airdrop of HYPE tokens, based on user activity. Since its launch, Hyperliquid has allowed whales to withdraw over $81B, with over $46B in liquidated positions. As of June 2025, Hyperliquid still carried over 60% of decentralized perpetual swaps traffic. The success of the platform inspired other attempts to copy its success. The perps DEX uses more than 64% of all USDC on Arbitrum for its liquidity purposes. The DEX drew in a total of $3.56B USDC, with around $2.91B remaining as available liquidity. HYPE took a step back in June, after peaking above $45. HYPE retains open interest above $1.5B, of which $1.1B is on the Hyperliquid exchange. Currently, short positions make up about 38% of the open interest, on expectations of further correction from peak prices. The native token currently trades around $37 and is closely watched for a rebound, based on recent whale activity. HYPE rallied after the inclusion of high-profile trades, which some consider deliberate attempts to draw attention to Hyperliquid.

MVRV Z-score remains low, signaling altcoins have room to grow before peak levels. Trump-linked tokens like LINK, ONDO, and AAVE attract attention ahead of policy shifts. With June coming to a close, a historical pattern that has reliably marked the bottom for the altcoin market seems to be playing out again.

2025-06-26T12:10:46,"Altcoin Season Index Reveals Crucial Shift: Navigating Bitcoin’s Dominance in the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Reveals Crucial Shift: Navigating Bitcoin’s Dominance in the Crypto Market Are you feeling the shift in the cryptocurrency winds? The latest reading from the Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric tracked by CoinMarketCap, indicates a strong move into what’s known as Bitcoin Season . At a modest 18 as of June 26, this index score is a clear signal for investors to re-evaluate their strategies in the dynamic crypto market . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a proprietary metric developed by CoinMarketCap (CMC) to provide a snapshot of the broader cryptocurrency market’s health and sentiment. It serves as a compass, guiding investors through the often-turbulent waters of digital assets. Unlike simple market capitalization comparisons, this index delves deeper, analyzing the relative strength of altcoins against Bitcoin. The methodology behind the Altcoin Season Index is straightforward yet insightful. It meticulously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The core principle is simple: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during the specified 90-day period. This signifies a broad rally across the altcoin spectrum, often driven by speculative interest, technological advancements, or a general ‘risk-on’ sentiment in the crypto market . Bitcoin Season: Conversely, if 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is deemed to be in Bitcoin Season . This suggests that capital is primarily flowing into Bitcoin, or that altcoins are struggling to maintain their value relative to the leading cryptocurrency. The current index reading of 18 clearly places us in this latter category. The index score itself ranges from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a stronger lean towards altcoin dominance and lower numbers signaling Bitcoin’s ascendancy. A score of 18, as reported, is a definitive indicator of Bitcoin’s current reign. Decoding Bitcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominates the Crypto Market The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 18 isn’t just a number; it’s a declaration that we are firmly entrenched in Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for the everyday crypto enthusiast or investor, and why does Bitcoin often take the lead in the broader crypto market ? Bitcoin Season signifies a period where Bitcoin (BTC) not only outperforms most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) but also often dictates the overall market sentiment. During such times, capital tends to flow primarily into BTC, either from fiat currencies or from altcoins, as investors seek relative safety or anticipate Bitcoin-specific rallies. Several factors contribute to the onset and persistence of Bitcoin Season : Flight to Safety: In times of market uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or broader economic downturns, investors often view Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ or a safer haven compared to the more volatile and less established altcoins. Its larger market cap and longer track record make it a more trusted asset. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock events, known as halvings, historically precede significant bull runs. The anticipation leading up to and immediately following a halving often draws immense attention and capital into BTC, temporarily overshadowing altcoin performance. Institutional Interest: With the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors, large capital inflows from these entities tend to concentrate on BTC due to its liquidity and regulatory clarity compared to the vast array of altcoins. Dominance Cycle: The cryptocurrency market often moves in cycles. Periods of Bitcoin accumulation and price appreciation are frequently followed by an ‘altcoin catch-up’ phase. The current Bitcoin Season could be seen as part of this natural market ebb and flow. Market Consolidation: After periods of rapid altcoin growth, the market may consolidate, with capital rotating back into Bitcoin as profits are taken or as investors seek more stable ground before the next speculative wave. Impact on Altcoin Performance: What Investors Need to Know For those holding a diverse portfolio of digital assets, the shift to Bitcoin Season directly impacts altcoin performance . When Bitcoin takes center stage, altcoins typically struggle to keep pace, often seeing their value decrease relative to BTC, even if their fiat value remains somewhat stable or sees minor gains. Key observations regarding altcoin performance during Bitcoin Season include: Underperformance Against BTC: Even if an altcoin sees a modest price increase in USD terms, it’s likely losing value when measured against Bitcoin. This means your portfolio’s Bitcoin weighting naturally increases if you hold both, simply because BTC is outperforming. Reduced Liquidity: Capital tends to consolidate in Bitcoin, leading to thinner trading volumes for many altcoins. This can result in larger price swings on smaller trades and makes it harder to enter or exit positions without significant price impact. Narrative Shift: The market narrative during Bitcoin Season often revolves around Bitcoin’s price movements, adoption, and upcoming events. Altcoin-specific news or developments may get less attention, hindering their individual price action. Psychological Impact: Seeing your altcoin holdings lag behind Bitcoin can be frustrating. It tests investor conviction and often leads to premature selling or ‘altcoin fatigue’. While some strong fundamental altcoins might still show resilience or even modest gains, the broad trend for altcoin performance during this period is one of relative weakness against Bitcoin. Navigating Current Cryptocurrency Trends: Strategies for Success Understanding the prevailing cryptocurrency trends , especially the current Bitcoin Season , is paramount for informed decision-making. Rather than panic, investors can adopt strategic approaches to navigate these market conditions effectively. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Assess your current exposure to Bitcoin versus altcoins. During Bitcoin Season , it might be prudent to increase your BTC weighting, or at least ensure your altcoin positions are in projects with strong fundamentals that you believe will survive and thrive long-term. Focus on Research: This period offers an excellent opportunity to deep-dive into projects. Identify altcoins that have genuine utility, strong development teams, active communities, and clear roadmaps. These are the ones most likely to recover and outperform when altcoin season eventually returns. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider implementing a DCA strategy. Regularly investing a fixed amount into Bitcoin or select altcoins can average out your purchase price over time, reducing the risk of buying at peaks. Risk Management is Key: Set clear stop-loss orders or establish profit-taking targets, especially for more speculative altcoin holdings. Volatility can be extreme, and protecting your capital should be a priority. Patience and Long-Term Vision: Market cycles are a natural part of the crypto landscape. A Bitcoin Season is often followed by an Altcoin Season . Those with a long-term perspective and the patience to hold through quieter periods are often the ones who reap the greatest rewards. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A rising dominance suggests capital is flowing into BTC, while a declining dominance could signal the beginning of a shift back towards altcoins. Challenges and Opportunities in a Bitcoin-Led Market While the current cryptocurrency trends lean heavily towards Bitcoin dominance, this period presents both distinct challenges and unique opportunities for savvy investors. Challenges: Underperforming Altcoins: The primary challenge is the potential for significant underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, leading to ‘opportunity cost’ if your capital is tied up in lagging assets. Increased Volatility: While Bitcoin might be seen as ‘safer,’ the overall crypto market remains highly volatile. Altcoins can experience sharper drops during downturns. Psychological Strain: Watching your portfolio stagnate or decline while Bitcoin soars can be emotionally taxing, leading to impulsive decisions. Opportunities: Accumulation Phase: For long-term investors, Bitcoin Season can be an excellent time to accumulate high-conviction altcoins at discounted prices against Bitcoin. This allows for a stronger position when the tide eventually turns. Learning and Research: With less frenetic price action in altcoins, this period provides an ideal environment to educate yourself, research new projects, and refine your investment thesis without the pressure of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Focus on Fundamentals: The ‘noise’ of speculative altcoin pumps often quiets down, allowing fundamental analysis to come to the forefront. Projects with real utility and strong development continue to build, regardless of the immediate market sentiment. Bitcoin Exposure: If you believe in the cyclical nature of the market, increasing your Bitcoin exposure during Bitcoin Season can position you well for potential future gains as BTC solidifies its position or makes new all-time highs. When Will the Altcoin Season Index Signal a Change? The burning question for many is: when will the Altcoin Season Index signal a return to more favorable conditions for altcoin performance ? While no one can predict the future with certainty, historical patterns and prevailing cryptocurrency trends offer some clues. A shift back towards Altcoin Season typically requires one or a combination of the following catalysts: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Often, after a significant Bitcoin rally, BTC enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows capital to rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Major Altcoin-Specific Developments: Significant upgrades (like Ethereum’s upcoming advancements), successful mainnet launches, or major adoption news for prominent altcoins can trigger individual or sector-wide rallies, pulling the index higher. Broader Market Bull Run: A general ‘risk-on’ sentiment across global financial markets, coupled with increasing institutional and retail interest in crypto, can lift all boats, including altcoins. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: Monitoring the Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) is crucial. A sustained downtrend in BTC.D, particularly when Bitcoin’s price is stable or rising modestly, often precedes or accompanies an Altcoin Season. The Altcoin Season Index serves as a lagging indicator to some extent, confirming trends rather than predicting them. Therefore, continuous monitoring of market sentiment, technological developments, and macro-economic factors is essential to anticipate when the scales might tip back in favor of altcoins. The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 18 is a clear testament to the ongoing Bitcoin Season . This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a crucial piece of information for navigating the complex crypto market . Understanding these cyclical shifts, from Bitcoin Season to eventual Altcoin Season , empowers investors to make more informed decisions regarding their altcoin performance and overall portfolio strategy. By focusing on strong fundamentals, practicing diligent risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can transform periods of Bitcoin dominance into opportunities for strategic accumulation and growth. The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and staying abreast of key cryptocurrency trends like the Altcoin Season Index is vital for long-term success.

2025-06-26T12:03:25,"Altcoin Season 2025: Top Seven Low-Cap Tokens To Buy Now","The post Altcoin Season 2025: Top Seven Low-Cap Tokens To Buy Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News June has historically been a weak month for both Bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin is down 2% in the month, and Ethereum is down nearly 3%, while the overall market momentum remains weak. But this period could be setting the stage for a powerful reversal, especially in AI-focused altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is approaching historical peak levels, which is often a sign of an upcoming shift in favor of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index has also hit its lowest in two years, indicating that altcoins may be due for a breakout. If the market starts to turn around, small AI-focused altcoins could rally hard, similar to the surge seen in April during the tariff-related uncertainty. Here are some promising AI tokens to watch for the next altcoin season. GRIFFAIN An AI Agent on Solana, Griffain rose from a $30 million to $130 million market cap in May, delivering a 6x return in a short period. Although it has cooled off since then, if the AI hype returns, it could be a strong contender again. It is currently trading at $0.03956, down 7.2% in the past day. June looks bearish for the token, and it could trade between $ 0.028372 and $ 0.040441. In July, the outlook improves, and prices may rise to an average of $0.0318. TARS AI This is another Solana-based AI agent marketplace that surged from $0.025 to $0.14 in April, which is a 6–7x increase. TARS offers a unified platform where users and businesses can access AI tools and services, helping them smoothly move from Web2 to the Web3 world. With a market cap of over $50 million, the token may see renewed interest if broader sentiment improves. It is currently trading at $0.08612, down over 3% in the past day. RAI (Reploy) This token climbed from $0.24 to $1.50 in May, but its recent inactivity on social platforms has raised concerns. Investors should approach with caution and monitor for project updates. It is currently priced at $0.6183, down 4.6% in the past day. AIOZ Network This token doubled from around $0.22 to $0.50 in May. It is not as volatile as others, but is still showing potential. It is currently trading at $0.3171, down 1.5% in the past day. Its 24-hour trading volume is $10,513,924, representing a 6.40% increase. Render (RNDR) Render is a more established AI coin with a large market cap of around $1.7B. It went from $3.30 to $5 in May, and recently bounced again from $2.60 to $3.25. This is one of the go-to options for retail investors interested in AI and GPUs. It is currently trading at $3.08, down 4.8%. In June 2025, Render is expected to trade around $3.94, with a potential range between $3.07 and $4.35. The outlook remains positive for July, and it could range from $3.81 to $4.13. Creator Bid Since April, the token rose from $0.035 to $0.12. Although it is less volatile than others, it continues to show upward movement. It is currently trading at $0.1195, up 6%. In July, Creator Bid could see its prices ranging between $0.0788 and $0.0864, and an average of around $0.0834. Virtuals Protocol Virtuals is also an AI agent ecosystem that jumped from $0.45 to $2.50 between April and May. The team remains active with ongoing developments and product launches. It is currently trading at $1.45, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours. June may be rough for Virtual Protocol, with prices expected to dip to around $1.21. However, July brings a more optimistic outlook. Many of these coins are still trading close to their recent lows and well below their previous highs, which could present early opportunities. Even though the market is uncertain, the AI trend could regain strong momentum.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-2025-top-seven-low-cap-tokens-to-buy-now/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|AIOZ","News|Altcoins|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T12:02:04,"Bitcoin Price Prediction – If Bitcoin Breaks This Level, Expect a Fast Move to New All-Time Highs","This week, Bitcoin (BTC/USD) surged to $108,182, briefly breaching a key resistance level that now holds the potential to trigger a new wave of bullish momentum. At the moment, BTC is trading around $107,300, the cryptocurrency is up nearly 10% in just three days, driven by a combination of short liquidation, technical breakouts, and easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Traders widely anticipated the move past $108K. The level represented a significant liquidity zone, and its breach forced aggressive short positions to unwind. BTC 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass Data from CoinGlass confirms that this rally absorbed much of the high-leverage short interest built around recent price consolidation, effectively clearing the path for a potential breakout toward higher resistance levels. Popular analysts, such as Matthew Hyland , describe the current environment as “bulls in control,” while others, like the Titan of Crypto, highlight a recent breakout above the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling further upside potential. #BTC past $106.5k $109k next Bulls are in control https://t.co/mp3zBsQwX9 pic.twitter.com/Ibsaupn3YE — Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) June 25, 2025 Technical models now indicate $110,448 and $111,944 as potential upside targets, provided BTC can maintain its traction above $108,251. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Setup Signals Possible Acceleration From a charting perspective, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bullish after BTC recently formed a three-bar bullish pattern, similar to a modified “three white soldiers” setup, indicating strong buyer commitment. However, price action is stalling just below a long-standing descending trendline, suggesting that $108,251 remains a critical inflection point. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Support levels: $106,237 (Fib 0.236), $105,081 (50-EMA), and $103,984 (Fib 0.5) Resistance targets: $110,448 and $111,944 MACD status: Bullish crossover, but histogram momentum flattening Candlestick signal: Spinning top forming under trendline, indicating potential hesitation If BTC closes above $108,251 with high volume, we could see a quick move to $111K. If not, we could see a short-term pullback to $105,000-$103,900. Macro Outlook: Russia is Back in Focus Middle East tensions have eased, but geopolitical risk remains. Market sentiment has shifted back to Eastern Europe as tensions between NATO and Russia escalate. According to QCP Capital, the risk premium on global assets is evolving from a short-term hedge to a long-term assumption. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced a slight bounce, a temporary calm, but macroeconomic uncertainty remains a headwind. For BTC, any increase in global volatility, especially from traditional markets, could bring in safe-haven flows into crypto assets. However, BTC’s structure remains bullish. With on-chain data indicating lower realized profits and technical indicators suggesting a continuation, the path to new all-time highs remains open if $ 108,000 holds. Conclusion: BTC is at a crossroads. A close above $108,251 could signal a quick move to $111K and beyond. If not, we could see a pullback to key support zones. Traders are watching – this level will define the next move. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.4M Hard Cap as Presale Enters Final Hours With Bitcoin trading near $105,000, investor focus is shifting toward BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a rising altcoin that is nearly fully allocated during its presale. As of today, the project has raised $7,438,492.88 of its $8,397,441 target, leaving under $1 million to be raised before the token price moves to the next tier. Currently priced at $0.00258, early buyers have a limited time to enter before the subsequent price increase takes effect. Bitcoin-Linked Tokenomics and Burn Mechanism BTCBULL ties its value directly to Bitcoin’s price through two smart systems: BTC Airdrops: Distributed to holders, with priority for presale participants. Supply Burns: Triggered automatically when BTC rises in $50,000 increments. APY: 55% annually Lockups: None Liquidity: Immediate Total Pool: 1,925,149,417 BTCBULL This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand.

2025-06-26T11:58:05,"Bitcoin (BTC) Faces Market Crossroads as Net Taker Volume Surges Past $100M","Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market have staged an impressive recovery following an escalation in tensions between Israel and Iran that rattled the markets across the world. As Bitcoin trades above $107K, new data suggest that the leading crypto asset is approaching a critical juncture as on-chain and macroeconomic signals converge. Market Fundamentals Warn of Possible Correction On June 24, Binance’s Net Taker Volume, which happens to be an indicator of buying and selling pressure, exceeded $100 million for the first time since June 9. While this spike may suggest increased bullish momentum, CryptoQuant stated that such surges often stem from aggressive retail participation or the liquidation of over-leveraged short positions rather than sustainable investor demand. At the same time, the total stablecoin net outflows from derivative exchanges have topped $1.25 billion, the largest exodus since mid-May. This trend points to weakening structural support for long positions and reflects a broader withdrawal of capital from risk-on environments. Interestingly, the latest market movement coincided with growing speculation about a shift in US monetary policy. During his semiannual testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted that future commercial and economic conditions could warrant interest rate cuts. The statement is a significant change in tone from the central bank, which indicates a possible pivot toward monetary easing. Further validating this narrative, the US 2-year Treasury yield has entered a clear downtrend, a pattern typically interpreted as the market pricing in future rate cuts. Investors are increasingly seeking safety in short-duration government bonds, which evidences rising caution. Elsewhere in the global currency markets, the Swiss Franc surged past 1.24 against the US dollar for the first time in several years, which, again, depicts an increased demand for traditional safe-haven assets. Together, these indicators suggest a rising risk-off sentiment in financial markets. While the Net Taker Volume spike may fuel short-term volatility, the significant outflow of stablecoins from derivative platforms raises concerns about the ability of Bitcoin’s price to sustain upward momentum. With macro uncertainty intensifying and liquidity thinning, the market could be nearing a near-term correction. Binance Open Interest Spikes; Long-Term Holders Trim Exposure As volatility returns and structural support wanes, Bitcoin’s internal market indicators are flashing additional cautionary signals worth close attention. In fact, data from Binance shows the 24-hour Open Interest (OI) percentage change has exceeded 6% for the third time in two months. Previous surges, observed around May 26 and June 10, were followed by price dips or periods of consolidation. This recurring trend could mean that increased inflows into leveraged positions may precede short-term profit-taking and de-risking by market participants. Additionally, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Realized Cap has sharply declined from over $57 billion to just $3.5 billion. This significant drop indicates that long-term holders are reducing exposure and are likely capitalizing on recent price gains and reacting to evolving macroeconomic conditions. While these developments do not necessarily point to an immediate bearish reversal, CryptoQuant said that it does highlight a rising market sensitivity. As such, the market may be entering a profit-taking phase, where short-term pullbacks or sideways movement are more likely as speculative interest builds and long-term conviction wanes.

In a recent feat, Solana has signed an MoU with Kazakhstan to launch Central Asia’s first Solana Economic Zone. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 51.2% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our latest Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030.

With RSI at 46.21 and price trading below the 20-day SMA at $148.56, SOL shows consolidation signs. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130.

Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

IRS Letters Signal Start of 1099-DA Enforcement appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a new wave of warning letters to crypto investors, signaling a crackdown ahead of the upcoming 1099-DA regulation, which is set to take effect in 2026. This aggressive move has sparked anxiety across the crypto community, especially as many investors face confusion over reporting requirements. Crypto Tax Anxiety Surges After IRS Letters According to David Kemmerer , Co-founder and CEO of CoinLedger, crypto investors across the U.S. have received various types of IRS letters urging them to review and update their crypto tax filings. If left unaddressed, these warnings could lead to serious investigations. “We’re seeing a wave of confusion and fear among everyday crypto investors, many of whom made their best effort to report taxes accurately,” Kemmerer explained. Why Is the IRS Sending Crypto Warning Letters? The IRS is stepping up its visibility into digital asset transactions as the U.S. continues its push for financial transparency in the crypto space. This includes matching reported income with blockchain data, third-party records, and new forms like the 1099-DA. Kemmerer emphasized the urgency of proactive compliance: “With Form 1099-DA on the horizon, this kind of enforcement is only going to accelerate. The IRS has more visibility into crypto than ever before, but without accurate cost basis data, even compliant investors can get mistakenly flagged.” [post_titles_links postid=”475048″] Types of IRS Warning Letters Sent to Crypto Investors Here are the key letters crypto investors are receiving: Letter 6174 : A reminder that investors must report taxable crypto activity and update previous filings. Letter 6173 : A more serious notice demanding a response by a set deadline and requiring investors to file missing tax returns involving crypto. Letter CP2000 : Indicates that the IRS has already calculated underreported income or tax owed. Investors are given 30 days to respond. Form 1099-DA: What’s Coming in 2026? Starting in 2026, all crypto trades conducted in 2025 through digital asset brokers will be reported directly to the IRS using Form 1099-DA. This marks a major shift in how the IRS collects crypto tax data—and it will likely trigger widespread audits and possible criminal investigations for non-compliant taxpayers. Kemmerer warns: “If crypto investors fail to report their taxes accurately, especially after the rollout of 1099-DA, they could receive a CP2000 letter or face severe action.” Final Word: A Crucial Grace Period for Crypto Users The current wave of warning letters serves as a wake-up call for investors. This is a grace period —a final opportunity to get crypto tax filings in order before the IRS enforces stricter penalties. Investors are urged to: Organize transaction history Track cost basis and taxable events File or amend returns proactively Avoiding action now could lead to audit risks , fines, or worse once 1099-DA becomes mandatory.

The IRS (Internal Revenue Service) is the U.S. federal agency responsible for collecting federal taxes and enforcing the nation’s tax laws. Its primary function is to fund government operations by collecting revenue. Why is the IRS sending new warning letters to crypto investors? The IRS is sending letters to increase financial transparency in crypto and prepare investors for the upcoming 1099-DA regulation, aiming to ensure accurate tax reporting and compliance. What are the potential consequences of ignoring IRS crypto warning letters? Ignoring these letters could lead to serious investigations, including audits, fines, or even criminal investigations, especially after Form 1099-DA becomes mandatory.

2025-06-26T11:50:37,"U.S. Dollar Index Plunge: Unprecedented Impact on Crypto Markets","BitcoinWorld U.S. Dollar Index Plunge: Unprecedented Impact on Crypto Markets Are you closely watching the gyrations of the global financial markets, particularly how traditional assets influence the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies? If so, you’re not alone. A significant shift has just occurred that demands your attention: the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has plummeted to 97.48, marking its lowest point since February 2022. This dramatic movement isn’t just a headline for forex traders; it carries profound implications for the burgeoning crypto market, potentially reshaping investment strategies and the future trajectory of digital assets. Let’s dive into what this substantial DXY decline means for your crypto portfolio and the broader financial landscape. Understanding the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): What Just Happened? The U.S. Dollar Index , often simply referred to as the DXY, is a measure of the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of six major world currencies. These currencies include the Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Swedish Krona (SEK), and Swiss Franc (CHF). It’s essentially a barometer for the dollar’s strength or weakness against its major trading partners. Recently, the DXY has been on a noticeable downward trajectory. According to MarketWatch data, it has fallen to 97.48, a level not seen since early 2022. This represents a significant 10.1% year-to-date DXY decline . To put this into perspective, consider these key points: Historical Context: The DXY had reached multi-decade highs in late 2022, driven by aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Its current level signifies a considerable reversal from those peaks. Magnitude of the Drop: A 10.1% year-to-date decline is not a minor fluctuation; it indicates a substantial shift in global investor sentiment towards the U.S. dollar. Key Currency Basket: The Euro holds the largest weight in the DXY basket (57.6%), meaning the dollar’s performance against the Euro heavily influences the index’s movement. This weakening of the dollar has ripple effects across various asset classes, and the cryptocurrency market is no exception. Understanding the drivers behind this dollar weakness is crucial for anticipating its future impact. Why the Dollar Weakness is Making Waves: Key Drivers What’s behind this significant dollar weakness ? Several macroeconomic factors are converging to push the DXY lower. The primary drivers include shifts in monetary policy expectations, evolving inflation outlooks, and changes in global economic growth projections. Is the Fed’s Stance Fueling Further Dollar Weakness? A major catalyst for the recent DXY decline is the changing narrative around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. For much of 2022, the Fed was aggressively raising interest rates to combat soaring inflation, making the dollar more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. However, the market is now increasingly pricing in an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle, with expectations of potential rate cuts in the near future. This shift in sentiment reduces the dollar’s yield advantage over other currencies, diminishing its appeal. Interest Rate Differentials: As other central banks (like the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan) potentially catch up or even surpass the Fed in hawkishness, the interest rate differential narrows, reducing the incentive to hold dollars. Inflation Expectations: While inflation remains elevated, there’s a growing belief that it has peaked and is on a downward trend. This lessens the urgency for the Fed to maintain an ultra-tight monetary policy, further contributing to dollar weakness . Economic Slowdown Concerns: Persistent concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. also weigh on the dollar. A weaker economy might necessitate more accommodative monetary policy, which typically leads to a weaker currency. The interplay of these factors creates a challenging environment for the dollar, directly influencing its standing on the global stage and, by extension, its relationship with risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The Profound Crypto Market Impact: A New Era? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, a weakening dollar often signals a potentially bullish environment. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the U.S. Dollar Index and the performance of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. How Does Dollar Weakness Reshape the Bitcoin Price Narrative? When the dollar weakens, assets priced in dollars, such as commodities and cryptocurrencies, can become more attractive. This is because it takes fewer units of other currencies to buy dollars, making dollar-denominated assets relatively cheaper for international investors. More importantly, a weaker dollar can signify a broader flight from traditional fiat currencies into alternative stores of value. Bitcoin as a Digital Gold: The narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold” or an inflation hedge gains traction during periods of dollar depreciation. As the purchasing power of the dollar diminishes, investors may seek assets with a fixed supply and perceived scarcity, like Bitcoin, to preserve wealth. This can lead to upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Increased Liquidity: A weaker dollar can also lead to more global liquidity, as central banks potentially ease monetary policies. This increased liquidity often flows into riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, boosting overall crypto market impact . Investor Sentiment: The psychological effect of a declining dollar can shift investor sentiment towards assets outside the traditional financial system. This encourages diversification into digital assets, viewing them as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. While the DXY decline doesn’t guarantee an immediate surge in the Bitcoin price or the broader crypto market, it certainly creates a more favorable macroeconomic backdrop. Many analysts are now closely watching how this sustained dollar weakness might catalyze the next phase of growth for digital assets. Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Opportunities While the narrative of a weakening dollar benefiting crypto is compelling, it’s crucial to approach the current market with a balanced perspective. The relationship is not always straightforward, and other factors significantly influence the crypto market impact . What Should Crypto Investors Watch Out For Amidst This DXY Decline? The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the U.S. Dollar Index . Regulatory developments, technological advancements, institutional adoption, and specific project news all play significant roles. For instance, a sudden regulatory crackdown or a major hack could overshadow any positive influence from a weakening dollar. Challenges to Consider: Correlation vs. Causation: While an inverse correlation often exists, it’s not always a direct causal relationship. Other macro factors, such as global economic growth or geopolitical events, can also drive both DXY and crypto movements. Regulatory Headwinds: Increased scrutiny from global regulators could dampen enthusiasm, regardless of the dollar’s performance. Market Liquidity: While a weaker dollar can imply more liquidity, a sudden tightening by other central banks or a global financial shock could still impact crypto negatively. “Risk-On” vs. “Risk-Off” Sentiment: Sometimes, the dollar weakens because investors are taking on more risk globally (risk-on), which can benefit crypto. Other times, it might be due to specific U.S. economic concerns that don’t necessarily translate to immediate crypto gains. Despite these challenges, the current environment presents opportunities. The ongoing DXY decline , combined with increasing institutional interest and technological advancements within the crypto space, could set the stage for significant long-term growth. Investors who understand these dynamics are better positioned to capitalize on potential shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Understanding the intricate relationship between the U.S. Dollar Index and the crypto market can empower you to make more informed investment decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Macroeconomic Indicators: Keep a close eye on the DXY, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve announcements. These traditional financial indicators provide valuable context for anticipating crypto market movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin often leads the charge, consider a diversified crypto portfolio that includes established altcoins and promising new projects. This can help mitigate risk and capture broader market gains. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the volatility, consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of market fluctuations, can be a prudent strategy. This helps average out your purchase price and reduces the impact of short-term swings. Stay Informed on Regulatory News: Regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) can significantly impact crypto prices. Keep abreast of developments in major jurisdictions. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: While short-term DXY movements can create trading opportunities, the long-term success of cryptocurrencies depends on their underlying technology, adoption, and utility. The current period of dollar weakness is not just a fleeting trend; it reflects deeper shifts in global finance. For those invested in or considering the crypto space, this moment offers a unique lens through which to view potential future growth and strategic positioning. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Digital Assets The dramatic drop in the U.S. Dollar Index to its lowest point since February 2022 signals a significant turning point in global finance. This 10.1% year-to-date DXY decline , driven by evolving monetary policies and shifting economic outlooks, directly impacts the perceived value and attractiveness of the dollar. For the cryptocurrency market, this period of sustained dollar weakness presents a compelling narrative, potentially bolstering the case for assets like Bitcoin as alternative stores of value. While the inverse correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin price is not absolute, the current macroeconomic environment certainly offers a more favorable backdrop for digital assets. As we navigate these dynamic shifts, staying informed and adopting a strategic approach will be key to unlocking the opportunities that this unprecedented financial recalibration presents for the future of money.

2025-06-26T11:50:32,"Time Traveler Predicts When to Get $50,000 Profit on 1000 XRP Investment","Dustin Layton, a digital asset analyst known for his involvement in the XRP community through his “Time Traveler” persona, recently shared a highly optimistic projection regarding XRP’s potential price performance in the coming months. He stated that anyone holding 1,000 XRP could expect to earn a minimum profit of $50,000 by the end of 2025. At the token’s current price of approximately $2.19, 1,000 units are valued at $2,190. Layton’s claim implies that each token would need to reach at least $52.20 within the year, representing a 2,300% return on investment. Layton encouraged followers to save his post and revisit it in the future, emphasizing that the predicted profit is for 2025 alone. If you hold 1000 XRP in 2025, you will see $50,000 minimum in profit just this year alone. Bookmark this. — Time Traveler (@Traveler2236) June 24, 2025 Reaction from the Community The reaction to Layton’s prediction was mixed, with many expressing cautious optimism or outright skepticism. Some users, while hopeful, acknowledged that the estimate appears unrealistic. A user named Ellian Betan commented that such forecasts tend to overlook real-world limitations. Others questioned the practical implications of such growth. For instance, one user asked whether Layton would delete his account if XRP failed to reach the projected price. Another user, Tobias, observed that while significant profits might be attainable, the return is determined by the token’s future price, not the cost at which it was acquired. Therefore, whether an investor bought XRP at $0.07 or $2.00, the key factor remains the token’s price performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Capitalization Implications of a $50 XRP If XRP were to exceed $50 per coin, its total market capitalization would surpass $3 trillion. For comparison, this would place XRP above Bitcoin’s current market value, making the target highly ambitious. Despite the boldness of Layton’s claim, he is not the only analyst proposing large price movements for XRP. In March, Elliott Wave analyst XForceGlobal predicted XRP could reach between $20 and $40 either this year or next, based on a 5-wave pattern. Similarly, a market analyst known as Steph suggested that if the global cryptocurrency market grows to $7 trillion and XRP captures a 30% share, the token could climb to $34.20. Other commentators have issued even more aggressive forecasts. Javon Marks, for example, has floated the idea that XRP could approach $99 during this market cycle, though he did not offer a specific timeline. Conservative Estimates Remain Cautious In contrast to these bullish views, some market analysts and platforms have adopted a more cautious stance. Forecasts from Changelly and Telegaon suggest that XRP may not reach the $50 milestone until at least 2035. These projections significantly diverge from Layton’s 2025 outlook, highlighting the divide between short-term optimism and long-term realism. While Layton’s prediction of a $50,000 profit from holding 1,000 XRP has generated considerable attention, it remains a speculative outlook. The wide range of price targets, from $34 to nearly $100, demonstrates the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s future valuation.

Arthur Hayes Reveals ‘Bull Market Checklist’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin could be heading for new all-time highs , at least if Arthur Hayes has it right. The BitMEX co-founder recently shared a bullish take on the market, pointing to key regulatory changes that he believes are setting the stage for a major crypto rally. From stablecoin reforms to broader shifts in global finance, Hayes sees the pieces falling into place for Bitcoin to surge. Bull market checklist: – UST SLR exemption progressing – Genius Act hands US stablecoin mrkt to banks, next essay will explain y +ve – Ignore the reality, Trump, Bibi, and Kahmenei are all pretending the conflict is finished so investors should too $BTC ATHs are coming — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 26, 2025 SLR Exemption Could Spark a Crypto Liquidity Boost Hayes highlights the U.S. Treasury’s Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption as a major factor. If reinstated, this policy would let banks free up more capital, allowing them to hold stablecoins and crypto-related assets with fewer restrictions. That means more liquidity, stronger support from big institutions , and a smoother path for crypto to integrate with the traditional financial system. For Hayes, it’s a clear sign that markets are preparing for a new bull cycle. The Genius Act: Giving Banks Control of Stablecoins Another big piece of the puzzle is the proposed Genius Act . This legislation could shift control of the U.S. stablecoin market to banks—a move Hayes believes is actually a good thing. Rather than slowing innovation, this could bring legitimacy and stability to stablecoins , making them a trusted part of the financial system. That kind of trust, in turn, can lift confidence in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Hayes: Ignore the Drama, Watch the Market Hayes also pointed out how world leaders, like Trump, Netanyahu, and Iran’s Khamenei, are caught up in political and geopolitical tensions. But he urges investors to look past the headlines and focus on market signals instead. He points to a 22% surge in stablecoin market cap this year, now hitting $251 billion. To Hayes, that’s a strong sign that capital is flowing back into crypto and that investors are positioning for a run. [post_titles_links postid=”475102″] Not His First Rodeo Hayes’s view ties into his past commentary, where he’s connected crypto market trends with global economic policy. He’s written before about the impact of central banks, like the Bank of Japan, on risk assets like Bitcoin. Now, as macro conditions shift and regulators appear more open to crypto, Hayes sees all signs pointing to another breakout moment. Bitcoin’s Setup for a New Rally? With policies like the SLR exemption and the Genius Act bringing crypto and traditional finance closer together, Hayes believes Bitcoin is primed for big gains. Stablecoins may be laying the groundwork—but Bitcoin, he argues, is the real beneficiary. If his call plays out, we could be entering a new phase of adoption, with Bitcoin leading the charge toward another all-time high.

If reinstated, the SLR exemption could significantly boost crypto liquidity by allowing banks to hold more stablecoins and crypto assets, potentially fueling a bull run due to increased institutional participation. How might the Genius Act change stablecoin stability and investor trust in crypto? The Genius Act, by potentially giving banks control over stablecoins, aims to bring legitimacy and stability, making them a more trusted part of the financial system and thereby increasing overall investor trust in crypto. Could geopolitical tensions distract investors from market signals like stablecoin growth? Yes, geopolitical tensions often create market uncertainty, leading some investors to retreat to safer assets.

2025-06-26T11:46:51,"Riot Platforms' Diversification Plan May Face Immense Competition","Summary I rate RIOT a hold at $9.09/share, reflecting a balanced outlook amid operational growth and competitive pressures in data center hosting. Riot Platforms’ expansion at Corsicana and the Rhodium acquisition may boost power and hash rate, but legal and market risks can potentially persist. The data center hosting market is highly competitive, with hyperscalers like Oracle dominating the market. Riot’s Bitcoin mining profitability may be pressured by rising power costs and Bitcoin price volatility, limiting near-term upside despite strong Bitcoin treasury holdings. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) is in the process of expanding its Corsicana facility from 400MW to 600MW in capacity with the intention of hosting third-party hyperscalers at its data center site. With the ambition of navigating into a new market opportunity, I believe Riot may face certain hurdles in hosted shared space given the current competitive market environment. Valuing RIOT as an organization, I believe shares should be priced at $9.09/share at 5.41x eFY26 price/sales. I am recommending RIOT shares with a hold rating. Riot Platforms Operations Corporate Reports Riot closed the acquisition of certain assets of Rhodium at the Rockdale Facility in Q1’25. The acquisition included Rhodium’s 125MW of power capacity, as well as its existing operating assets at the facility. The acquisition was valued at $185mm, inclusive of $49mm in Riot common shares. In addition to acquiring the facility, compute capacity, and power capacity, Riot and Rhodium entered into an agreement to conclude all litigation. Prior to the announced acquisition, Rhodium filed a $300mm suit against Riot as a result of Riot’s acquisition of Whinstone and the cancellation of Rhodium’s power supply agreement for 100MW of power. Years prior, in 2023, Riot filed a suit against Rhodium over an alleged $26mm in unpaid fees. Staying on the topic of litigation, investors filed a suit against Rhodium in December 2024, suggesting that Rhodium misled investors by concealing critical information and engaging in self-dealing. The suit also suggests that Rhodium failed to disclose the pending sale of the organization’s operating facilities to Riot, creating conflict over power contracts. Given that Rhodium’s sale was an asset sale as opposed to the company being absorbed by Riot, Riot may be somewhat shielded from the suit. Other legacy suits were filed in Riot’s March 2025 10-Q , bearing no mention of the investor suit. As a result of the acquisition, management is anticipating increased hash rates, reduced operating losses, and gained power capacity for future development. At the end of Q1’25, Riot had 33.7EH/s in capacity, producing a total of 1,530 Bitcoin in the quarter. Riot began purchasing Bitcoin in Q4’24 to bolster its treasury while leveraging its holdings for a collateralized $100mm credit facility through Coinbase . Accordingly, this credit facility will ideally provide Riot with adequate financing to slow the dilution of the float. Riot ended Q1’25 with 19,223 Bitcoin. Using $105k as the base price, Riot’s Bitcoin holdings amount to $2b. TradingView As part of its growth strategy, Riot invested a substantial proportion of its capital outlay for Q1’25 in the development of its 600MW substation expansion at the Corsicana facility in Navarro County, Texas. According to Riot’s website , the facility currently has 400MW in capacity, with the option to expand to 1GW. Using a like-for-like approach, the expansion to 600MW should get the facility to 23.55EH/s in capacity. The data center buildout may also involve sourcing data center tenants, primarily targeting hyperscaler customers. Though data center hosting may be an appealing market for Riot, Riot will be competing with Oracle Corp . ( ORCL ), which develops purpose-built data centers with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as well as engages in a MultiCloud strategy, developing data center sites for hyperscaler customers. The growth factor management mentioned was that the existing GenAI capacity calls for 5GW of capacity with the expectation of growing to 30GW by 2030. Though this may be the case, I suspect a significant proportion of capacity will derive from enterprises rather than consumers, potentially limiting the full, total addressable market to a narrower figure. In addition to this, hyperscalers are investing in developing their data center footprints given the size and scale of compute capacity needed to operate AI models on their infrastructure. Referencing Oracle’s data center developments, OpenAI has partnered with Oracle to develop its first 1.2GW site in Abilene, Texas , and will likely continue working with Oracle for new site developments. What makes Oracle’s data center business stand out above Riot is that Oracle develops modular, autonomously operating data center facilities. Though I have no doubt that Riot will be successful in enticing tenants for its AI/HPC data center site, I believe that the data center hosting business will be fierce, particularly when considering the total cost to operate. The area in which I can see Riot competing is in its engineering and manufacturing business with ESS Metron for critical switchgear. This business could potentially add value to third-party customers in the data center business and may help debottleneck the electrical equipment market. Riot Platforms' Financial Position Corporate Reports One of the biggest costs Riot must address in Bitcoin mining, net of machine depreciation, is the cost of power. In the organization’s FY24 presentation , Riot reported that the cost to mine a single Bitcoin was 96.9% of the value of the coin. Corporate Reports Granted, the price per Bitcoin is substantially higher today when compared to all of FY24; however, power consumption may be a persistent headwind, particularly as electricity prices are set to increase with power demand for growing data centers and industrial footprints. Net of Bitcoin price appreciation, increasing power costs can create significant headwinds for Riot in the coming quarters, particularly as more connected infrastructure is added to the grid. TradingView Looking to eQ2’25, I’m forecasting Riot to generate $152mm in net revenue, with a diluted EPS of -$0.23/share. This is predicated on strong Bitcoin mining growth and sales for the quarter as a result of the high value of Bitcoin quarter-to-date. Risks Related to Riot Platforms Bull Case The price of Bitcoin has created a more appealing operating environment for Riot, potentially leading to the organization delivering positive adjusted EBITDA for eQ2’25. With data center power capacity being widely constrained, the organization may be well-positioned to advantageously take on hosted customers, potentially expanding its brand beyond Bitcoin mining and engineering operations. Bear Case The data center environment is highly competitive, potentially creating certain challenges for Riot to enter the space. The organization has also faced legal challenges relating to contractual power distribution that may deter third-party hyperscaler customers. Bitcoin remains highly volatile and may not sustain its $105k+/- price range, potentially impacting Riot’s revenue stream going forward. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports RIOT currently trades at 1.61x price/BV BTC, assuming a $105k price per Bitcoin. This is relatively comparable to its competitor CleanSpark ( CLSK ), which trades at roughly 1.89x, considering its 12,502 Bitcoin holdings. Despite this factor, investors in RIOT must consider its other operating unit in engineering and its aim to act as a data center host, creating a certain operating complexity when compared to CleanSpark. Valuing RIOT as an organization, I believe shares should be priced at $9.09/share at 5.41x eFY26 price/sales. I am recommending RIOT shares with a hold rating. Corporate Reports Using the model: the valuation table above references my financial forecast in the firm’s “financial position” section and ties it to the stock’s historical trading premiums. The trading premium array is derived through the normal operating cycle, with the blue-sky scenario being the stock’s peak multiple and the gray-sky scenario being the lowest point. The target multiple aims for the midpoint, or the most likely trading range for the company’s stock. The trading multiples from there are set to a probability factor based on the likelihood of the stock trading at that premium based on its historical presence. From there, the trading multiple is tied to the probability factor to derive its relative market cap and relative multiple.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797423-riot-platforms-diversification-plan-may-face-immense-competition?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","CLSK|RIOT",cryptocompare

The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 867,400 followers on the social media platform X that on the higher time frames, the Bitcoin trend is up and the day-to-day fluctuations in price are just “noise.” According to Pentoshi, the demand for Bitcoin is currently outstripping the new supply of Bitcoin and more demand is likely to come in amid potential currency debasement. “There is factually more BTC being bought on any given day than is being mined. Until that trend changes, try to just relax a bit and enjoy the ride. It increasingly looks like more debasing will occur. And BTC is a hedge against debasement.” Pentoshi, however, warns that there’s danger lurking for Bitcoin from the corporations accumulating the crypto king in their balance sheets. The widely followed analyst says some of these companies will “hurt” Bitcoin in a couple of years when they will be potentially forced to liquidate their BTC holdings to pay the debt they will have incurred for purposes of accumulating the flagship digital asset. “I think many will end up being forced sellers eventually.

2025-06-26T11:42:15,"Nobitex Hack pulls curtains on months of suspicious fund movements","The recent hack on Nobitex, Iran’s largest crypto exchange, dealt a major blow to the country’s crypto industry, draining millions in user funds. But the breach may have revealed more than just security flaws, as troubling on-chain history raises questions over the platform’s operations. According to BeInCrypto, an investigation by blockchain intelligence firm Global Ledger into the June 18 Nobitex hack has found that the platform may have been engaging in stealthy fund movements well before the cyberattack. Per the report, on-chain analysis has revealed a pattern of practices typically linked to money laundering, such as peelchains, one-use wallets, and systematic balance sweeps, deeply embedded in the exchange’s infrastructure. The attack on Nobitex affected multiple chains, resulting in the loss of over $90 million in assets. Shortly after the breach, Nobitex moved 1,801 BTC (worth around $187 million) from exposed wallets to new addresses. While the exchange described this as a protective measure, the investigation shows similar movement patterns had been occurring quietly for months. Hot Wallets, Cold Moves: Nobitex’s shady crypto shuffle Since as far back as October 2024, Nobitex has been using a stealth tactic known as peelchains, a method where funds are gradually split and passed through intermediaries or one-time-use wallets. This technique is used to quietly move large amounts of crypto, while obscuring their trail and making them difficult to trace. On multiple occasions, several hot wallets tied to Nobitex repeatedly passed exactly 30 BTC between addresses, often through one-time-use intermediaries. Funds in these flows were eventually sent to exchange addresses or, in some cases, destinations linked to illicit actors. You might also like: Nobitex hackers leak full source code after $100m crypto heist Additionally, the investigation traced funds moving in and out of a wallet cluster that behaved like a central mixing layer. Many of these wallets had a short lifespan and were used just once before being abandoned, suggesting an intentional scheme to avoid detection. Further evidence shows that Nobitex’s “rescue wallet,” which was supposedly deployed after the hack to safeguard the remaining funds, was found to have been active for months prior, consistently receiving chipped-off funds. The exchange has also continued similar asset movements post-hack and is said to still hold substantial reserves. Global Ledger’s findings now raise questions about Nobitex’s operational transparency, including possible ties to illicit activity such as money laundering. Gonjeshke Darande, the pro-Israel hacker group that claimed responsibility for the attack, previously accused Nobitex of being Iran’s “favorite sanctions violation tool.” The group also cited this as a key reason for targeting the exchange, claiming it as part of a broader retaliation effort tied to the Israel-Iran conflict.

2025-06-26T11:40:43,"Unveiling the Trump-Backed Crypto Project: WLFI Token Sparks Tremendous Corporate Treasury Interest","BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Trump-Backed Crypto Project: WLFI Token Sparks Tremendous Corporate Treasury Interest In the rapidly evolving world of digital finance, a new player is emerging with significant backing that’s turning heads: World Liberty Financial (WLFI). This Trump-backed crypto project is reportedly drawing considerable attention from public companies looking to diversify their treasury holdings with digital assets. The news, first reported by Bloomberg and affirmed by WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman at the prestigious Permissionless conference in New York, signals a potentially groundbreaking shift in how traditional businesses view and utilize cryptocurrencies. What is the Buzz Around This Trump-Backed Crypto Initiative? The concept of a cryptocurrency project explicitly linked to a prominent political family like the Trumps immediately ignites curiosity and debate. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) aims to leverage this unique association to build a robust ecosystem around its native token. According to Zak Folkman, the co-founder, the project is designed to offer a new avenue for financial empowerment and digital asset utilization. The Trump family’s involvement, while not fully detailed in its scope, provides an undeniable spotlight, potentially attracting a demographic not typically immersed in the crypto space, alongside traditional institutional investors. The core proposition of WLFI appears to revolve around providing a stable, reliable digital asset that can serve various financial functions, including acting as a treasury reserve. This ambition places WLFI in a unique position, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy, with a distinct political flavor that sets it apart from other crypto ventures. The project’s narrative suggests a focus on liberty and financial freedom, themes that resonate strongly with its political affiliations. Why are Public Firms Eyeing the WLFI Token for Treasury? The interest from public companies in using the WLFI token as a treasury asset is a significant development. For years, corporate treasuries have primarily relied on traditional assets like cash, short-term government bonds, and money market funds. However, with inflation concerns and the search for higher yields, companies are increasingly exploring alternative assets. Bitcoin, pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, has shown the viability of digital assets for treasury management. The appeal of WLFI for these firms could stem from several factors: Diversification: Adding a crypto asset, particularly one with perceived stability or unique backing, can diversify a company’s treasury portfolio. Inflation Hedge: Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as potential hedges against inflation, preserving purchasing power in a volatile economic climate. Growth Potential: While aiming for stability, the inherent growth potential of a nascent crypto project could offer higher returns than traditional low-yield assets. Strategic Alignment: For some companies, aligning with a project backed by a prominent political figure might offer strategic benefits or appeal to a specific customer base. Zak Folkman’s statements suggest that WLFI is positioning itself as a credible and attractive option for corporate balance sheets, aiming to provide a digital asset that meets the stringent requirements of public companies for liquidity, security, and regulatory compliance. The Michael Saylor Connection: A Blueprint for Corporate Treasury Assets? One of the most intriguing aspects highlighted by Folkman is WLFI’s close relationship with Michael Saylor , the executive chairman of MicroStrategy. Saylor is widely recognized as a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, having famously converted MicroStrategy’s treasury into a significant Bitcoin holding. His strategy has become a de facto blueprint for other public companies considering similar moves. The association with Saylor lends considerable credibility to WLFI’s treasury aspirations. It suggests that the project is not merely dabbling in the idea but is potentially consulting with, or learning from, one of the most experienced figures in the corporate crypto treasury space. Saylor’s insights could help WLFI navigate the complexities of regulatory frameworks, institutional onboarding, and the technical infrastructure required to support large-scale corporate adoption. This connection indicates a serious intent to position WLFI as a viable, institutional-grade asset for companies seeking to optimize their balance sheets in the digital age. For companies considering a digital asset for their treasury, the Saylor endorsement, even if indirect, provides a level of reassurance and a potential roadmap for implementation. It transforms WLFI from just another crypto project into one with a strategic vision for corporate integration. Insights from the Permissionless Conference : What’s Next for WLFI? The Permissionless conference in New York served as a crucial platform for Zak Folkman to share updates on WLFI’s progress and vision. Such industry events are vital for networking, attracting investors, and building community trust. Folkman’s comments at the conference underscore the project’s ambition to become a significant player in the institutional crypto space. While specific details about the tokenomics or technical architecture of WLFI remain somewhat under wraps, the focus on corporate treasury interest suggests a priority on stability, compliance, and scalability. Future developments for WLFI will likely include: Regulatory Engagement: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies will be paramount, especially for attracting public companies. Technological Development: Ensuring the WLFI token and its underlying blockchain infrastructure are robust, secure, and scalable to handle large institutional transactions. Partnerships: Forming strategic alliances with financial institutions, custodians, and other blockchain service providers to facilitate corporate adoption. Transparency: Providing clear communication regarding the project’s roadmap, financial backing, and governance model to build investor confidence. The project’s success will largely depend on its ability to deliver on these fronts and to convince traditional finance players that a politically-backed crypto asset can be a secure and beneficial addition to their balance sheets. Navigating the Landscape of Digital Asset Adoption: Benefits and Challenges The increasing interest in digital assets for corporate treasuries, exemplified by WLFI, highlights a broader trend towards institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. This trend comes with both significant benefits and inherent challenges. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Digital assets can offer 24/7 liquidity, unlike traditional markets. Lower Transaction Costs: Blockchain-based transactions can potentially reduce fees associated with traditional financial transfers. Faster Settlements: Near-instantaneous settlement times compared to traditional banking systems. New Revenue Streams: Opportunities for yield generation through staking, lending, or DeFi protocols. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent global regulations remains a significant hurdle. Volatility: While some tokens aim for stability, the crypto market is inherently volatile, posing risks to treasury values. Security Risks: The threat of hacks, scams, and loss of private keys requires robust security protocols. Accounting and Tax Implications: Complexities in how crypto assets are treated for accounting and tax purposes. Public Perception: The association with a political figure could be a double-edged sword, attracting some while alienating others. For public companies, a meticulous due diligence process is essential before integrating any digital asset into their treasury strategy. This includes assessing the asset’s underlying technology, regulatory compliance, security measures, and the reputation of its backers. A Glimpse into the Future: Actionable Insights for Investors and Corporations The emergence of WLFI and its reported corporate interest provides several actionable insights: Monitor Institutional Trends: The move towards corporate treasury crypto indicates a maturing market. Keep an eye on which types of companies are adopting digital assets and why. Understand Project Backing: For investors, the backing of a project, whether by a political family or a prominent industry figure like Michael Saylor, can significantly influence its trajectory and perceived legitimacy. Assess Regulatory Readiness: Projects that actively engage with regulators and prioritize compliance are more likely to gain institutional trust. Diversify Smartly: For corporations considering crypto treasury, start small, understand the risks, and consult with experts in legal, accounting, and cybersecurity fields. The narrative around WLFI highlights a fascinating intersection of politics, finance, and technology. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, projects with unique value propositions and strong strategic backing will undoubtedly shape the future of corporate finance. Conclusion: A New Era for Corporate Treasury? The reported interest from public firms in the Trump-backed crypto project, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing institutional adoption of digital assets. With the WLFI token seemingly positioning itself as a viable corporate treasury asset , and the strategic alignment with figures like Michael Saylor , the project stands at the forefront of a potential paradigm shift. While challenges remain, particularly around regulation and market volatility, the discussions at the Permissionless conference confirm a growing appetite among traditional businesses to explore cryptocurrencies beyond speculative trading. As WLFI continues its journey, its progress will offer valuable insights into the future of corporate finance and the broader acceptance of digital currencies in mainstream economic activity.

2025-06-26T11:40:31,"Here’s what China’s RSA quantum computer breakthrough could mean for crypto security","A research team in China managed to successfully factor a 22‑bit RSA integer using a quantum computer, signifying a breakthrough in encryption decoding. What could it mean for crypto security? Using a quantum annealer from D‑Wave, a team of researchers at Shanghai University managed to factor a 22‑bit key using a novel method that translates the task into a form the quantum machine can handle, according to a report by Earth.com. RSA, which stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, is a public-key cryptosystem that is commonly used for secure data transmission. Systems that use the encryption system include online bank accounts, web browsers, email providers, messaging services, VPNs, and cloud services. Although 22-bit is still a small number compared to the larger 2,048‑bit keys or even 3072-bit used in real-world encryption, the breakthrough is significant because it proved that quantum computing can reach beyond the previous 19-bit record. By tweaking model parameters, the researchers raised success rates and showed how their approach could scale more bits in the future. This means that in the future, with more computational resources per bit, the unbreakable RSA could be decrypted. As a result, many institutions like NIST and the White House are already rolling out quantum-safe standards and urging agencies and companies to switch to post-quantum cryptography, warning of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. You might also like: Cisco Talos: New North Korean threat ‘PylangGhost’ targets crypto workers through fake job sites Does cryptocurrency use RSA encryption? Though RSA is widely used in many aspects of our digital systems, most modern cryptocurrencies do not use the encryption for signing transactions or wallet security. Instead, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) rely heavily on Elliptic Curve Cryptography or ECC, including Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ECDSA and the later model EdDSA in newer projects. Although this is the case, the crypto space does make use of the encryption model in other areas that are just as crucial to security. For instance, certain crypto exchanges, custody services and payment platforms may still use RSA encryption for SSL/TLS infrastructure. Additionally, some cold storage systems or older crypto projects and old wallets containing sensitive information may still rely on RSA for internal key storage or back-up encryption. The same applies for encrypted data archives and back-ups at crypto custodians or blockchain companies. You might also like: Chinese researchers claim 48-bit encryption cracked with quantum computing Why the RSA quantum breakthrough matters for ECC? Although the experiment applies to RSA, this does not mean that ECC is untouchable. Both RSA and ECC are vulnerable to quantum attacks via Shor’s algorithm. Shor’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently factor large numbers and solve discrete logarithm problems. The algorithm poses a significant threat to the security of many modern cryptographic systems. While this does not directly pose a threat to current more advanced crypto systems, it indicates that quantum progress not just a theoretical concept anymore. The deeper issue is that if quantum hardware can scale factoring algorithms, then the decryption of ECC is not far behind. A powerful enough quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could bypass ECC by forging blockchain transactions, breaking encrypted communication between wallets and nodes, as well as gain access to private keys from public BTC or ETH wallets. In the meantime, crypto projects should stay alert and prevent security breaches by performing audits on vulnerable areas such as TLS certificates, API encryption, VPNs and off-chain key management.

However, Binance’s delisting update has sent shockwaves across various crypto communities. The leading exchange by trading volume has announced the removal of Komodo, LTO Network, Stella, Biswap, and LiverFi from its ecosystem from 4 July 2025. Wu Blockchain @WuBlockchain · Follow According to the official announcement, Binance will delist and cease trading of all spot trading pairs for the following tokens on July 4, 2025, at 03:00 (UTC): Stella (ALPHA), Biswap (BSW), Komodo (KMD), LeverFi (LEVER), and LTO Network (LTO). binance.com/en/support/ann… 12:37 pm · 26 Jun 2025 22 Reply Copy link Read 22 replies The move is part of Binance’s periodic review to delist weak projects and ensure high standards across the ecosystem. The affected tokens reacted to the news within minutes, presenting diverging performances. Komodo and LTO Network fell sharply, losing approximately 33% of their value after Binance’s announcement. The massive slide underscores shaken investor trust as the tokens brace for a liquidity crunch. On the other hand, Biswap (BSW) gained over 65%, as Stella’s ALPHA (+2) and LEVER (+3.50%) demonstrated resilience despite bearish news. What prompted the delists? The crypto market evolves every day. To keep pace, Binance regularly reviews listed assets to ensure that they meet user expectations and industry standards. According to the official statement, the evaluation follows a thorough analysis based on factors like: The team’s dedication to the project Roadmap progress and ongoing developer activity Liquidity and trading volumes Transparency and engagement among community members. Alertness during due diligence Fraudulent or unethical dealings While most projects debut with high promises and key upgrades, most fail to survive. The five projects didn’t meet Binance’s existing benchmarks, possibly due to slowed development, dwindled market traction, or governance issues. What’s next for holders? Binance will remove all spot trading pairs for ALPHA, LTO, KMD, BSW, and LEVER starting 4 July. Notably, trading bots linked to these assets will automatically go offline. The exchange will close all spot copy trading positions and force sale or shift the assets to Spot Accounts by 3 July at 03:00 UTC. Users are strongly advised to update or cancel their Spot Copy Trading portfolios prior to Binance Spot Copy Trading delisting time to avoid potential losses. Meanwhile, investors will have until 3 September 2025 to withdraw the delisted tokens. Binance will halt withdrawals after that. The exchange might choose to convert the remaining balances into stablecoins after missed deadlines. KMD and LTO price actions While BSW, ALPHA, and LEVER soared amidst the uncertainty, Komodo and LTO Network’s native tokens endured substantial dips on their daily charts. KMD trades at $0.06617 after a slight rebound from intraday lows. The 400% surge in 24-hour trading volume highlights intensified trader actions. Rising volumes during price dips indicate more participants dumping to avoid losses. LTO hovers at $0.02210 with a significant bearish structure. It has also seen a nearly 500% increase in trading volumes. Source – CoinMarketCap Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean the projects have hit a dead end. While delisting by leading trading platforms is indeed a notable setback, Binance’s move will potentially slow down investments and adoption of the impacted assets.

2025-06-26T11:30:37,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 74: Navigating the Market’s Bold Ascent","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 74: Navigating the Market’s Bold Ascent Are you feeling the buzz in the air? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular barometer for market sentiment, has recently climbed to a significant 74, firmly placing the cryptocurrency market in the ‘Greed’ zone. This eight-point jump from the previous day, as of June 26, signals a notable shift in investor psychology. But what does this rising tide of optimism truly mean for your investments, and how should you navigate these increasingly confident waters? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Pulse Check on Market Sentiment At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It’s a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 100, where: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are highly concerned, often leading to selling pressure. 25-49: Fear – Uncertainty and anxiety prevail, but not to extreme levels. 50-74: Greed – A growing sense of optimism and a willingness to buy. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over, often signaling a potential market top as assets become overvalued. Why is this index so crucial? Because emotions often drive investment decisions, especially in volatile markets like crypto. By aggregating various data points, the index attempts to give a more objective view of collective market sentiment , helping investors avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on emotion. What Does a Score of 74 in the ‘Greed’ Zone Imply for the Cryptocurrency Market? A score of 74 is a clear indicator that optimism is running high. Investors are feeling confident, and there’s a strong appetite for buying. While this might sound universally positive, seasoned crypto enthusiasts know that periods of ‘Greed’ can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reflects strong momentum and potential for further price appreciation as more capital flows into the cryptocurrency market . On the other hand, extreme greed can sometimes precede market corrections, as assets become overbought and ripe for profit-taking. Historically, legendary investors like Warren Buffett have advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” This contrarian approach suggests that times of widespread greed might be opportune moments for caution, perhaps even for trimming positions, rather than blindly chasing pumps. It’s about recognizing when the crowd might be getting ahead of itself. Dissecting the Drivers: The Six Pillars of the Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of six distinct factors, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall market sentiment. Understanding these components is key to grasping the index’s movements: 1. Volatility (25% Weighting) What it measures: This component analyzes the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. What it means for sentiment: High volatility often indicates a fearful market (big price drops) or an extremely greedy one (rapid pumps). Stable, lower volatility might suggest calm before a storm or a period of consolidation. 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25% Weighting) What it measures: It looks at the current trading volume and market momentum, comparing them with the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. What it means for sentiment: High buying volumes in a rising market indicate strong positive momentum and increasing greed. Conversely, high selling volumes suggest fear. 3. Social Media (15% Weighting) What it measures: This factor analyzes social media trends, specifically tracking hashtags and mentions related to cryptocurrencies, their volume, and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). What it means for sentiment: A surge in positive social media mentions, particularly on platforms like Twitter (X), often correlates with rising excitement and greed. It’s a direct gauge of the public’s chatter. 4. Surveys (15% Weighting – Currently Paused) What it measures: Historically, this component gathered data from weekly polls, asking thousands of people about their perception of the crypto market. What it means for sentiment: Although currently paused, surveys offer a direct insight into investor confidence. Their reintroduction could provide another valuable layer of sentiment data. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10% Weighting) What it measures: This refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. What it means for sentiment: A rising Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors flock to the perceived safety and stability of Bitcoin during uncertain times. A falling dominance, on the other hand, suggests that investors are moving into altcoins, which typically happens during periods of higher risk appetite and greed (often called ‘altcoin season’). 6. Google Trends (10% Weighting) What it measures: It analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. What it means for sentiment: A sudden increase in search terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” often signals fear, while a surge in general terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “crypto investment” can indicate growing public interest and potential greed. Here’s a quick overview of the index’s components: Factor Weighting Impact on Index (General) Volatility 25% High volatility can indicate fear or extreme greed. Market Momentum/Volume 25% High buying volume = Greed; High selling volume = Fear. Social Media 15% Positive sentiment = Greed; Negative sentiment = Fear. Surveys (Paused) 15% Direct investor opinion. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Rising dominance = Fear; Falling dominance = Greed (altcoin season). Google Trends 10% Search interest for buying = Greed; Panic searches = Fear. The Pivotal Role of Bitcoin in Shaping Market Sentiment It’s no secret that Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency market. Its price movements and overall health significantly influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Given its dominant market capitalization and its status as the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s performance often dictates the general mood of investors. When Bitcoin is rallying, optimism tends to spread across altcoins, pushing the index higher into the ‘Greed’ zone. Conversely, a sharp correction in Bitcoin’s price can quickly send the index plummeting into ‘Fear’ or ‘Extreme Fear’, as investors become risk-averse. This strong correlation highlights why keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s fundamentals and technical analysis, alongside the sentiment index, is crucial for any comprehensive investment strategy . A rising Bitcoin price, coupled with high social media engagement and trading volume, directly contributes to the current ‘Greed’ reading of 74. Crafting Your Investment Strategy in a ‘Greedy’ Market So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashing ‘Greed’, how should you adjust your investment strategy ? Here are some actionable insights: Exercise Caution: While it’s tempting to jump into a rising market, remember that ‘Greed’ often precedes corrections. Consider taking some profits if you’re holding significant gains, especially on assets that have seen parabolic increases. Rebalance Your Portfolio: Use this period to re-evaluate your portfolio. Are you over-allocated to risky assets? Perhaps it’s time to rebalance towards a more diversified mix, or even increase your stablecoin holdings. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): The higher the index, the stronger the FOMO. Don’t let emotional impulses drive your decisions. Stick to your pre-defined investment plan and risk tolerance. Research Thoroughly: Even in a bull market, not all projects are created equal. Use this time to research fundamentally strong projects that still have room to grow, rather than chasing speculative pumps. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your capital. If you’re entering new positions or holding existing ones, setting appropriate stop-loss orders can help mitigate potential losses if the market suddenly reverses. Look for Contrarian Opportunities: While most assets might be overvalued, there could still be gems that haven’t caught the market’s attention yet, or assets that are temporarily undervalued despite the overall optimism. Challenges and Limitations of Relying Solely on Sentiment While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to understand its limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects current sentiment, which is often a reaction to past price movements. It doesn’t predict the future with certainty. Not a Trading Signal: It should not be used as a standalone buy or sell signal. A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, nor does ‘Fear’ guarantee a bounce. Market Manipulation: Large institutional players or ‘whales’ can sometimes influence market sentiment, making the index less reliable for predicting short-term movements. Context is Key: The meaning of a particular score can vary depending on the broader macroeconomic environment, regulatory news, and technological advancements within the crypto space. Conclusion: Navigating the Emotional Rollercoaster with Prudence The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74 is a significant indicator of robust optimism within the cryptocurrency market. It reflects a period where confidence is high, and the appetite for digital assets, particularly Bitcoin , is strong. While this environment presents exciting opportunities, it also calls for heightened awareness and a disciplined investment strategy . By understanding the factors that drive this index and combining its insights with thorough fundamental and technical analysis, investors can make more informed decisions, mitigate risks, and potentially capitalize on the market’s emotional ebb and flow. Remember, true success in crypto often comes from maintaining a clear head when others are losing theirs.

2025-06-26T11:30:22,"Bitcoin Price Set for New All-Time High in Just 42 Days","The post Bitcoin Price Set for New All-Time High in Just 42 Days appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin Price is gaining momentum, now only 4% shy of its all-time high, as a wave of optimism sweeps through the crypto market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. attracted over $547 million in inflows on Wednesday, extending their winning streak to 12 consecutive days, a bullish signal backed by institutional demand. But it’s not just ETF data fueling the rally. Crypto Gets Major Boost from U.S. Housing Policy In a landmark move, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has instructed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to recognize crypto assets when evaluating mortgage eligibility. This unprecedented step toward mainstream crypto adoption is being hailed as a long-term bullish catalyst for the industry. Technical Setup Signals Bitcoin Breakout Technically, Bitcoin is showing a strong V-shaped recovery, with its price hovering near $107,383, a key resistance level. A breakout above this zone could flip the market structure and pave the way to a new all-time high (ATH). According to crypto analyst Ran Neuner, Bitcoin’s next ATH may arrive in just 42 days, driven by a steady upward climb rather than a sudden spike. He emphasizes that the recent global ceasefire has given financial markets the breathing room they needed, and Bitcoin is leading the charge. “The rally won’t be a single big green candle. It’s already happening gradually,” Neuner stated. Jerome Powell’s Testimony Fuels the Bull Case Another bullish driver? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent testimony. Powell noted that the Fed might have already begun rate cuts if not for inflation risks stemming from Trump’s proposed tariffs. Still, Powell confirmed that the Fed is on track for three interest rate cuts this year in July, September, and December. Lower rates often boost risk-on assets like Bitcoin, making this a critical green light for investors. Dollar Weakens, Wall Street Cheers Following Powell’s remarks, the U.S. dollar began to slide, another bullish signal for Bitcoin. Wall Street responded swiftly: the NASDAQ hit a new ATH, and the S&P 500 is on the verge of confirming a golden cross — a highly regarded bullish technical pattern. Interestingly, historical data shows that Bitcoin tends to hit a new ATH around 41 days after the S&P 500 does. That correlation is now catching the eye of analysts who view this as a signal that Bitcoin’s next major breakout is already in motion. Altcoin Season? Not So Fast While Bitcoin looks poised for liftoff, most altcoins may not follow — at least not right away.According to Neuner, the altcoin rally will be selective, favoring tokens backed by institutional interest. A full-blown altcoin season is unlikely unless Wall Street throws its weight behind specific projects. He teases that a curated list of these high-potential altcoins will be revealed soon.

2025-06-26T11:30:00,"As $4 Billion In BTC And ETH Options Expire, Traders Look to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) For Fresh Gains","At the end of last week, over $4.1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options expired, which led to speculations of price swings. Amid this speculation, hostilities in the Middle East escalated, which put further pressure on the crypto market. Most of the value was in Bitcoin contracts, which accounted for $3.5 billion, while Ethereum options were worth around $565 billion. The put-to-call ratio for BTC was 1.0, which suggested a neutral stance; meanwhile, ETH had a ratio of 0.69, which suggests a rise in bullish expectations. Crypto markets remain in a cautious mood amid fears that conflict in the Middle East could escalate, causing global economic problems. Despite the challenges, BTC has recovered to over $100k after briefly falling below the level over the weekend. While all of this is going on, investors are looking for opportunities for growth elsewhere, and one of their best options so far has been the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. Based on the current performance of the presale, MUTM tokens could be one of the biggest gainers of 2025. There are various factors driving the current performance, which include the project’s focus on utility. Additionally, the protocol’s design that ensures continuous growth has been pivotal to helping drive up participation in the presale. Details OF The MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, over $11.2 million worth of tokens have been sold to around 12,450 buyers. In the upcoming phase of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The token price has attracted massive attention from the crypto market, which has led to 50% of the tokens set aside for phase sold less than a month after they went live. One of the main reasons for this fast pace is that tokens in the current phase are going for a 50% discount on the planned listing price of $0.06. Analysts are extremely confident about the future of MUTM tokens, and they forecast the price could go up by 31x when the tokens go live. Based on this massive upside forecast, a $1,700 purchase in the presale now could grow to over $52,000. Coupled with the massive discount available right now, this is one opportunity that you do not want to miss. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Design A major reason for the high interest in MUTM tokens is the design of the protocol. It is built as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their assets in exchange for an annual percentage yield (APY) that is dictated by the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool and take loans, the utilization rate rises, which thus increases the interest rate. The rising interest rate prompts borrowers to repay loans in the pool, which incentivizes more lenders to deposit liquidity in a pool to benefit from the higher yields. Over time, this will boost the total liquidity in the pool, which will ensure a stable ecosystem. At the same time, this design ensures that the protocol achieves optimal capital efficiency on its own. By offering a system where the market forces set the optimal market rates, it could attract more users, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the biggest DeFi ecosystems by user numbers. A good example of how this system works is when a user deposits $10,000 worth of USDT into a pool. If the APY rises to 17% due to high utilization, the depositor stands to make $1,700 a year. That is a massive income that requires no trading expertise or complex trading strategies. On top of that, users of the protocol enjoy massive protection in the form of overcollateralization. That simply means that borrowers must deposit collateral worth more than the value of the loan they plan to take. The overcollateralization level varies based on the exact type of asset they use as collateral. For more volatile assets, more conservative overcollateralization is required due to the possibility of a sudden market movement. The requirement creates a buffer in which liquidators can act to stabilize the ecosystem. When a loan position falls below the liquidation threshold, a liquidation event is triggered, allowing the liquidators to purchase the collateral at a discount. This discount ensures that liquidators have a monetary incentive to act for the benefit of the protocol’s health. It can be increased as needed to incentivize liquidators to act faster to protect the solvency of the ecosystem. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect entry point to position yourself for the upcoming altcoin rally. With a generous 50% discount on the MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale, this is the best opportunity you have to make life-changing returns in the crypto sector.

2025-06-26T11:20:33,"Tether CEO’s Bold Vision: 1 Trillion AI Agents to Revolutionize Crypto Settlements","BitcoinWorld Tether CEO’s Bold Vision: 1 Trillion AI Agents to Revolutionize Crypto Settlements Imagine a world where your refrigerator orders groceries, pays for them, and manages its own maintenance schedule – all autonomously, using cryptocurrency. Or perhaps, self-driving cars negotiating fuel prices and settling payments in real-time. This isn’t science fiction anymore; it’s the audacious future envisioned by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. During a recent appearance on The Block’s Big Brain podcast, Ardoino made a truly groundbreaking projection: within the next 15 years, one trillion AI agents will be leveraging stablecoins like USDT and decentralized assets like Bitcoin to execute seamless financial transactions and crypto settlements . This isn’t just about AI using crypto; it’s about each of these autonomous entities possessing its own digital wallet, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of finance and automation. Unpacking the Tether CEO’s Vision: A Trillion AI Agents in the Crypto Economy Paolo Ardoino, known for his forward-thinking perspective and leadership at the helm of the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, painted a vivid picture of an AI-driven financial ecosystem. His forecast isn’t merely speculative; it stems from the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and the growing utility of blockchain technology. The core of his prediction revolves around the sheer scale: one trillion distinct AI entities, each empowered with financial autonomy through its own crypto wallet. Scale of Adoption: One trillion AI agents is an astronomical number, suggesting a pervasive integration of AI into every facet of commerce and daily life. Financial Autonomy: Each AI agent would possess its own crypto wallet, implying direct control over funds for specific tasks, removing intermediaries and human intervention for routine transactions. Core Currencies: The focus on USDT and Bitcoin highlights their established roles. USDT for efficient, stable value transfer in high-volume micro-transactions, and Bitcoin as a robust, decentralized store of value and ultimate settlement layer. Time Horizon: The 15-year timeline suggests a relatively rapid evolution, pushing the boundaries of current technological development and regulatory frameworks. This vision suggests a paradigm shift from humans managing money to intelligent machines executing economic activity on our behalf, or even independently. The implications for efficiency, global trade, and the very nature of work are profound. How Will AI Agents Drive Crypto Settlements? The concept of AI agents conducting crypto settlements is not just about making payments; it’s about automating complex financial interactions that currently require significant human oversight and traditional banking infrastructure. Consider the following potential applications: Micro-transactions and Automated Services AI agents could facilitate ultra-small, high-frequency transactions for services that are currently impractical or too costly to process via traditional means. Think of an AI negotiating real-time energy prices for a smart home, or paying for fractional access to data sets in a decentralized marketplace. USDT, with its stability and low transaction fees, would be ideal for these scenarios. Supply Chain Optimization Imagine AI agents managing every step of a supply chain, from ordering raw materials and paying suppliers upon delivery verification (using smart contracts), to tracking inventory and settling freight costs. This would bring unprecedented transparency and efficiency, with Bitcoin potentially serving as a reserve asset or a final settlement layer for larger, inter-company transactions. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and AI AI agents could become integral components of DAOs, executing governance decisions, managing treasuries, and even initiating proposals based on predefined parameters. Their crypto wallets would allow them to directly interact with the DAO’s smart contracts and financial resources. Content Creation and Monetization AI agents generating creative content (articles, music, art) could autonomously license their work and receive payments directly into their wallets, managing royalties and distribution without human intermediaries. Here’s a simplified look at how AI agents might interact with crypto: AI Agent Function Crypto Application Primary Crypto Used Smart Home Energy Management Automated utility payments based on real-time usage USDT Supply Chain Logistics Automated payments to suppliers upon delivery verification USDT, Bitcoin Data Marketplace Agent Buying/selling data sets in fractional amounts USDT Autonomous Trading Bot Executing trades and managing portfolio Bitcoin, various altcoins The Pivotal Role of USDT and Bitcoin in AI’s Financial Future Ardoino’s specific mention of USDT and Bitcoin is not arbitrary. These two cryptocurrencies represent fundamental pillars of the digital asset space, each offering distinct advantages crucial for an AI-driven economy. Why USDT for AI Transactions? Tether’s USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. Its stability is paramount for AI agents needing to conduct predictable transactions without worrying about price volatility. Furthermore, USDT’s widespread adoption across numerous blockchains (Ethereum, Tron, Solana, etc.) ensures liquidity and accessibility. For micro-transactions, automated payments, and high-frequency trading, USDT offers: Price Stability: Essential for consistent value transfer, allowing AI agents to budget and execute transactions without the risk of sudden asset devaluation. Speed and Efficiency: Transactions on various blockchains are often faster and cheaper than traditional banking rails, enabling real-time settlements. Programmability: As a token on smart contract platforms, USDT can be integrated into complex automated agreements. Why Bitcoin for AI’s Long-Term Value? While USDT handles the day-to-day transactional needs, Bitcoin serves a different, yet equally critical, role. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, scarcity, and robust security make it a premier store of value. For AI agents, Bitcoin could function as: A Digital Reserve: AI agents or the systems they operate within could hold Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset, similar to how nations hold gold. Ultimate Settlement Layer: For larger, less frequent, or more critical inter-AI or AI-to-human settlements, Bitcoin’s finality and security provide unparalleled assurance. Censorship Resistance: In a world increasingly reliant on AI, the ability to transact without fear of central control or censorship becomes vital, a core tenet of Bitcoin. The combination of a stable transactional currency (USDT) and a secure, decentralized store of value (Bitcoin) creates a robust financial backbone for an AI-powered future. Navigating the Challenges of an AI-Powered Crypto Landscape While Ardoino’s vision is inspiring, the path to a trillion AI agents with crypto wallets is fraught with significant challenges. Addressing these will be crucial for successful implementation: 1. Scalability: Can Blockchains Handle the Load? A trillion AI agents would generate an unimaginable volume of transactions. Current blockchain technologies, even with advancements like layer-2 solutions, face hurdles in processing such a massive throughput without congestion or exorbitant fees. New scaling solutions, sharding, or entirely new blockchain architectures might be necessary. 2. Security: Protecting AI Wallets from Malice Each AI agent having its own wallet presents a massive attack surface. How will these wallets be secured against hacking, malicious AI takeovers, or sophisticated phishing attempts? The integrity and security of the underlying AI systems and their interaction with blockchain protocols will be paramount. 3. Regulation and Governance: Who is Accountable? The legal and ethical implications of autonomous AI agents conducting financial transactions are immense. Who is liable if an AI agent makes a costly error or engages in illicit activities? Establishing clear regulatory frameworks, accountability models, and international cooperation will be essential to prevent chaos and foster trust. 4. Interoperability: Bridging Diverse AI and Blockchain Systems AI agents will likely operate on different platforms and interact with various blockchains. Ensuring seamless communication and transaction capabilities across these diverse ecosystems will require robust interoperability standards and protocols. 5. Ethical Considerations: Control and Autonomy As AI agents gain more financial autonomy, questions about human control, decision-making biases, and the potential for unintended consequences will become critical. Designing ethical AI and ensuring safeguards against runaway financial autonomy will be a societal imperative. Preparing for the Future: Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For individuals, developers, and businesses in the cryptocurrency space, Ardoino’s projection isn’t just a fascinating thought experiment; it’s a call to action. The next 15 years could redefine the digital economy, and being prepared is key. For Developers and Innovators: Focus on building highly scalable, secure, and interoperable blockchain solutions. Research into AI-blockchain integration, autonomous agent programming, and novel consensus mechanisms will be invaluable. For Businesses: Begin exploring how AI can automate existing financial processes using crypto. Consider pilot programs for micro-payments, supply chain tracking, or automated data exchange. Understanding stablecoins like USDT and the foundational role of Bitcoin will be critical. For Regulators and Policymakers: Proactive engagement with AI and blockchain experts is essential. Developing adaptive and forward-looking regulatory frameworks that foster innovation while mitigating risks will be crucial. For Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors: Stay informed about the convergence of AI and blockchain. Understanding the underlying technologies and the potential for new use cases will be vital for navigating the evolving market. The convergence of AI and blockchain is not a distant dream but a rapidly approaching reality. Ardoino’s vision highlights the immense potential for efficiency, automation, and global financial inclusion that this synergy can unlock. Paolo Ardoino’s bold prediction of one trillion AI agents settling trades with USDT and Bitcoin within 15 years paints a truly revolutionary picture of our financial future. This vision, while ambitious, underscores the transformative power of decentralized finance and artificial intelligence. The seamless integration of AI autonomy with the immutable and efficient nature of blockchain promises an era of unprecedented automation and efficiency in global commerce. While challenges related to scalability, security, and regulation remain, the potential benefits for efficiency, transparency, and innovation are immense. The journey to an AI-driven crypto economy has just begun, and the insights from the Tether CEO serve as a powerful beacon, guiding us towards a future where intelligent machines are active, autonomous participants in the global financial landscape.

2025-06-26T11:00:56,"Pro-XRP Lawyer Reacts to This Bullish CoinDesk’s XRP Report","XRP is once again making headlines—this time for all the right reasons. In a recent report, CoinDesk highlighted a bullish technical pattern forming on XRP’s chart, one that closely resembles the setup seen in Bitcoin before its massive rally to $100,000. According to the report, XRP has shown remarkable strength, maintaining a tight range between $2.00 and $2.60, despite broader market volatility. Many traders believe this stabilization is a possible sign of an impending major breakout. Reacting to this development, pro-XRP attorney John Deaton took to X to comment on the shift in media sentiment. “Is it me, or has the coverage of XRP significantly changed from 3 years ago?” Deaton wrote, noting what appears to be a growing willingness among major crypto outlets to recognize XRP’s evolving role in the digital asset space. Is it me or has the coverage of XRP significantly changed from 3 years ago? https://t.co/WZt0TmRHeB — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 26, 2025 CoinDesk Signals a Turning Point CoinDesk’s technical analysis draws attention to the current strength in XRP’s price action. While many altcoins have struggled to hold support, XRP has remained firm, resisting downward pressure and flashing signs of accumulation. Analysts believe the current consolidation above $2.00 is a bullish signal, particularly as volume builds and volatility narrows—conditions that often precede sharp upward moves. This setup is being compared to Bitcoin’s price behavior in earlier cycles, particularly before its surge to new all-time highs. According to the report, if momentum continues to build, XRP could soon attempt a breakout above $2.60, potentially targeting the $3.00 to $3.50 range, levels last seen during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. XRP Price Update: Holding Firm at $2.35 As of reporting, XRP is trading at approximately $2.35, showing resilience amid a mixed crypto market. Data from CoinMarketCap and TradingView confirm that XRP has spent the last several weeks in a tight consolidation range, with strong support at $2.00 and resistance near $2.60. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On-chain indicators further support the bullish case. Exchange reserves for XRP, particularly on Binance have declined, suggesting reduced selling pressure. At the same time, large wallet addresses have steadily accumulated, signaling growing confidence from long-term holders and possibly institutions. Deaton’s Insight: A Shift in Media Tone John Deaton’s comment reflects a broader trend: the changing perception of XRP in the crypto community. Once viewed with skepticism, especially during the height of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC—XRP is now gaining renewed attention and respect. Deaton, who played a prominent role defending XRP holders in court, has frequently criticized what he saw as unfair media bias. His latest remark points to a more balanced narrative taking shape. With Ripple expanding globally, launching its RLUSD stablecoin, and pushing major updates to the XRP Ledger, the ecosystem around XRP continues to strengthen. Combined with increasingly bullish technical signals and a notable shift in sentiment, XRP may be entering a pivotal new chapter—one that even the skeptics are beginning to acknowledge.

2025-06-26T11:00:33,"Here’s How BlockDAG’s Fair Launch Model Revives the Bitcoin Spirit in 2025","In a market where early access and private deals often dominate, BlockDAG is doing something different. Its presale model is gaining attention not for added features, but for what it avoids. No VC involvement. No pre-mined coins. No discounts for insiders. For many, it’s the closest the industry has come to a fair launch since Bitcoin. This isn’t just a marketing angle. BlockDAG’s setup, including its infrastructure deployment and community-led approach, presents a very different picture from today’s typical Layer-1 launches. At a time when decentralisation is often more of a buzzword, BlockDAG is taking it seriously. Skipping VC Backing for a Community-Centred Launch Many top Layer-1 networks, like Solana, Aptos, and Avalanche, started with large VC support. While this helped them scale, it also created risks like concentrated supply and central control. These early backers often got steep discounts and influence over decision-making. BlockDAG chose a different route. The team confirmed that no VC money has been accepted. Every BDAG purchase has come from the public sale. No private deals, no early pricing advantages, and no hidden stakeholders. This design avoids the usual friction between early buyers and the broader community, giving the network space to grow with less pressure from early sell-offs. A Presale Without Pre-Mining or Insider Holdings Pre-mining has long been debated in crypto. Ethereum created about 72 million ETH in its early days. Solana’s launch heavily favoured early participants. Newer players like zkSync and Starknet have also drawn criticism for favouring insiders. BlockDAG’s approach looks very different. There was no pre-mine. All BDAG in circulation today comes from the public presale, which includes over 23.3 billion BDAG sold and $323 million raised. This equal footing matters. Those buying now are entering on the same terms as everyone else. No one has a secret head start from a two-year-old private sale. That level of openness is rare in today’s crypto market. User Participation & Infrastructure Before Price Action BlockDAG’s design goes beyond fair distribution. Its governance and network rollout reflect a launch model focused on the community. Here’s what that looks like: 2M+ users are already active on the X1 Miner app, using a Proof-of-Engagement system that makes participation simple and device-free. 18,000+ ASIC miners have been sold, spreading mining power across individuals and businesses. Validator nodes and mining pools will be run by the community before trading begins, helping build true decentralisation. There’s no centralised treasury or hidden team allocation. Instead, BlockDAG is leaning into an open network design, where users shape the protocol from day one. Raising Funds Without Giving Up Control Critics often say fair launches slow progress. But BlockDAG shows that strong community support can deliver results. With $323 million raised (halfway to its $600 million goal), it ranks among the top presales in crypto history, and it did this without institutional funding. And that funding is already working. The testnet is active. A low-code dApp builder is live. Developer grants are being distributed. The roadmap is in motion, and the mainnet is set to go live four weeks before listing. This progress proves that community-first projects can still move fast and scale, without compromising their values. A Return to Fundamentals That Could Redefine Launch Standards Bitcoin is still seen as the model for decentralisation, partly because it launched without early allocations or private deals. Many projects since then have chosen speed and capital over fairness. BlockDAG is going back to basics. It’s building a network that processes transactions like Kaspa, supports smart contracts like Ethereum, and decentralises like Bitcoin. And it’s doing this without the early-stage shortcuts most projects rely on. Whether BDAG reaches $1 or $4 as some predict, the bigger story may be the example it sets. In today’s market, where users demand more transparency, fairness isn’t just ethical; it could be a long-term advantage.

2025-06-26T11:00:25,"AI Copyright Law: Crucial Victory for Meta AI Models in Fair Use Battle","BitcoinWorld AI Copyright Law: Crucial Victory for Meta AI Models in Fair Use Battle In a significant development for the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and intellectual property, a federal judge recently delivered a pivotal ruling in favor of Meta. This decision, concerning the use of copyrighted books for training Meta AI Models , marks a crucial moment for the technology sector, offering a glimpse into how courts are interpreting AI Copyright Law in the digital age. For anyone tracking the intersection of technology, content creation, and legal precedent, this case sets an important tone for future innovation and content protection. Understanding the Fair Use Doctrine in AI Training At the heart of Meta’s recent legal triumph is the concept of ‘fair use.’ A federal judge, Vince Chhabria, granted a summary judgment in favor of Meta in a lawsuit initiated by 13 authors, including Sarah Silverman. The authors alleged that Meta illegally trained its AI models using their copyrighted works. However, Judge Chhabria determined that Meta’s actions in this specific case fell under the Fair Use Doctrine of copyright law, thereby making it legal. This decision aligns with a similar ruling just days prior, where a federal judge sided with Anthropic in a comparable lawsuit. These rulings collectively signal a favorable turn for the tech industry, which has long argued that training AI models on copyrighted materials constitutes fair use. The core argument often revolves around whether the AI’s use of the material is ‘transformative’—meaning it doesn’t merely reproduce the original work but uses it to create something new, like an AI model capable of generating original content. What Does This Mean for Meta AI Models and Beyond? While celebrated by tech giants, these judicial decisions are not without their caveats. Both judges emphasized the limited scope of their rulings. Judge Chhabria explicitly stated that his decision does not universally validate all AI model training on copyrighted works. Instead, he noted that the plaintiffs in the Meta case ‘made the wrong arguments’ and failed to provide sufficient evidence regarding the market effects of Meta’s use. The judge highlighted that in future cases, especially those with better-developed records on the market impact of AI’s use of copyrighted material, plaintiffs might often prevail. This nuance is critical for understanding the ongoing legal battles. For Meta AI Models , this means their specific training methodology for books was deemed fair use, but the door remains open for challenges based on different types of content or stronger evidence of market harm. Navigating AI Training Data and Legal Boundaries A key factor in the fair use determination is whether the copying of copyrighted works harms the market for those authors. In Meta’s case, the plaintiffs ‘presented no meaningful evidence on market dilution at all,’ according to Judge Chhabria. This highlights the importance of demonstrating direct economic harm or market displacement caused by AI training. Without such evidence, establishing a copyright violation becomes significantly more challenging. The outcomes for both Anthropic and Meta involved training AI models on books. However, the legal landscape is far from settled, particularly concerning other forms of AI Training Data . There are numerous active lawsuits targeting technology companies for using different types of copyrighted works: The New York Times vs. OpenAI and Microsoft: This lawsuit concerns the training of AI models on news articles. Disney and Universal vs. Midjourney: These media powerhouses are suing over the training of AI models on films. Judge Chhabria’s decision acknowledges that fair use defenses are highly case-specific, and the strength of these arguments can vary significantly across industries. He noted that ‘markets for certain types of works (like news articles) might be even more vulnerable to indirect competition from AI outputs.’ This suggests that while books might have a higher bar for proving market harm from AI training, other content forms like news articles or films could present stronger cases for copyright holders. The Broader Implications for Tech Industry Lawsuits These recent rulings provide a significant, albeit narrow, victory for the tech industry. They affirm that simply training an AI model on copyrighted content does not automatically constitute infringement, especially if the use is deemed transformative and no clear market harm is demonstrated. This could encourage continued innovation in AI development without the immediate threat of sweeping legal injunctions based solely on data acquisition. However, the judges’ cautionary remarks underscore that these are not blanket permissions. Future Tech Industry Lawsuits will likely focus more intently on the ‘market effects’ criterion of fair use, and the specific nature of the copyrighted material. Companies developing AI must remain vigilant, understanding that the legal precedents are still being forged, and what is fair use for one type of data or model may not be for another.

Boston, MA | July 15 REGISTER NOW The Evolving Landscape of AI Copyright Law The recent court decisions involving Meta and Anthropic represent significant milestones in the ongoing debate over AI Copyright Law . They provide a degree of clarity for tech companies engaging in AI model training, particularly concerning literary works. However, they also serve as a stark reminder that each case will be judged on its specific merits, with the ‘transformative’ nature of the use and the ‘market impact’ being paramount considerations. As AI capabilities expand and integrate deeper into various industries, the legal battles over intellectual property will undoubtedly intensify. These rulings do not provide a definitive answer for all AI training scenarios but rather lay down markers for how future cases might be argued. The balance between fostering AI innovation and protecting creators’ rights remains a complex challenge that courts, policymakers, and the industry will continue to navigate.
