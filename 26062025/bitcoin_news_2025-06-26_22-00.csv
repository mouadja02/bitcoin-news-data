2025-06-26T19:58:02,"IntelBroker Indicted: British National Faces Charges for $25M+ Data Breach on BreachForums","A British national has been indicted in the United States for allegedly orchestrating a large-scale hacking operation under the alias “IntelBroker,” resulting in over $25 million in damages to businesses and institutions worldwide. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced the indictment of 25-year-old Kai West on Wednesday. West is accused of using his “IntelBroker” identity to infiltrate computer networks, steal sensitive data, and sell it on underground cybercrime forums. Hacker “West” Ran Global Data Theft Operation, Used Monero to Obscure $2.4M in Sales Authorities say West led a cybercriminal group known as “CyberN[——],” which infiltrated systems belonging to a telecommunications company, a municipal healthcare provider, an internet service firm, and dozens of other organizations. Prosecutors say West and his associates stole sensitive data and sold it online, often requesting payment in Monero, a cryptocurrency favored for its privacy features. Serial hacker “IntelBroker” charged in $25 million cyber scheme. “New Yorkers are all too often the victims of intentional cyber schemes and our office is committed to bringing these remote actors to justice,” said USA Jay Clayton. https://t.co/CrMzWtJ1fR pic.twitter.com/ob6gJDsALF — US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) June 25, 2025 Over a two-year period, from 2023 to 2025, West allegedly posted and offered stolen data across at least 158 public threads. He listed data for sale in 41 of those posts, asking prices that totaled over $2.4 million. In many cases, he gave away stolen information in exchange for forum credits or to boost his reputation within the hacker community. One breach included patient data from a healthcare provider, exposing names, Social Security numbers, and health records. In another case, West reportedly accessed servers of a U.S. telecom firm and sold customer details. Prosecutors allege that West even served as the “owner” of BreachForums between August 2024 and January 2025, further solidifying IntelBroker’s profile in the cybercrime space. “This action reflects the FBI’s commitment to pursuing cybercriminals around the world,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “New Yorkers are all too often the victims of intentional cyber schemes, and our office is committed to bringing these remote actors to justice.” FBI Assistant Director Christopher G. Raia described West as a “serial hacker” who profited off stolen data and caused harm to organizations across borders. “Today’s announcement should serve as a warning to anyone thinking they can hide behind a keyboard and commit cybercrime with impunity,” he added. According to the complaint, an undercover agent paid IntelBroker $250 in Bitcoin for stolen data, which included admin-level credentials. The payment was sent to an address linked to Conor Brian Fitzpatrick (aka IntelBroker), and the data was delivered. Fitzpatrick and his associates allegedly tried to sell more data for over $2 million. West was arrested in France in February 2025. The U.S. is seeking his extradition to face prosecution. He is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, unauthorized access to protected computers, and wire fraud. If convicted on all counts, he faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison. The case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan B. Finkel leading the prosecution. West remains in custody in France pending the outcome of the extradition request. The charges remain allegations, and he is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Massive Credential Leak Raises New Alarms After IntelBroker Indictment Following the indictment of British national IntelBroker for allegedly trafficking stolen data worth over $25 million via BreachForums, a new report from Cybernews has added fuel to the fire, revealing one of the largest credential leaks ever recorded. According to researchers, over 16 billion login credentials linked to platforms like Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, and GitHub have been exposed in a sweeping breach. But this wasn’t a single incident. Over 16 billion login records from Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, and GitHub exposed in fresh malware-based data breaches. #cybersecurity #databreach https://t.co/YncLGPv9MU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 The data, traced back to early 2024, comes from infostealer malware, credential stuffing attacks, and several previously undisclosed leaks. Some individual sets contained as many as 3.5 billion records, with the average around 550 million. For crypto users, the implications are serious. Wallets and exchanges often tie to compromised email providers or cloud services. A breach in one could mean direct access to digital assets. Cybernews urges users to change passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and scan devices for malware immediately. This follows a grim 2024, where the FBI recorded $9.3 billion in crypto fraud losses , up 66% from 2023. The Bureau also reported over 149,000 complaints, and had to intervene in suicide cases linked to crypto scams.

2025-06-26T19:55:27,"New Bitcoin All-Time High In the Cards, According to Analyst Michaël van de Poppe – Here’s His Timeline","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) surging to a new all-time high (ATH) is still a very real scenario. In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 792,000 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap looks poised to hit a new ATH by the end of next month, also noting that he expects BTC to dip before skyrocketing. “Bitcoin continues to push upwards and break the all-time high. I still think we’ll have a slight consolidation before the big breakout happens, which means that an all-time high is on the cards for July ’25.” Van de Poppe says that in order for the crypto king to shatter its previous best, it needs to first hurdle a key resistance level at $108,900. “Bitcoin has taken the liquidity. That’s great, there’s a lot of upside momentum here. However, this is the FINAL hurdle before a new ATH. I think we’ll consolidate slightly and break towards new ATHs in the coming 1-2 weeks max.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X According to the analyst, BTC rallying would also send altcoins skyrocketing due to them being short-squeezed, or a rapid increase in price driven by short sellers covering their positions. “Altcoins are looking primed for a big move upwards. If Bitcoin is able to break up, Altcoins are likely to outperform. How? Massive short squeezes across the board accelerating the price action of those altcoins upwards vanishing losses away in days/weeks.” Bitcoin is trading for $107,633 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

2025-06-26T19:38:20,"Ethereum Price Prediction – ETH Forms Rare ‘Death Cross’ Pattern Last Seen in 2022 – What’s Going On?","The Ethereum price has risen slightly to $2,447 today , making this move as the crypto market as a whole loses 3% in the past 24 hours. Ongoing instability in the Middle East has put the market on a shaky foundation this week, while today’s news regarding Judge Torres’ rejection of a final settlement between the SEC and Ripple has also weighed on prices. ETH therefore remains down by 2% in a week and by 8% in a month, with its two-week chart forming a very bearish death cross that could indicate further losses. However, such crosses precede a clearing out of weaker hands, and with Ethereum’s fundamentals remaining as strong as ever, the long-term ETH price prediction remains bullish. Ethereum Price Prediction – ETH Forms Rare ‘Death Cross’ Pattern Last Seen in 2022 – What’s Going On? Looking at ETH’s two-week chart, we can see that its 20-period average (orange) has just dropped below the 50-period (blue), following the coin’s declines since the start of the year. And if you scan back in time, you can see that the last time these two averages formed a death cross was in September 2022, when the Ethereum price went from around $1,750 to $1,150 by December. Source: TradingView This is a 34% decline, implying that we may be about to see a similarly steep drop in the coming weeks and months. There are other parallels with the second half of 2022, such as the fact that Ethereum’s moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue) has recently turned negative. And after turning negative in the middle of 2022, it remained below the baseline for more or less a year, as ETH struggled to regain the highs it had enjoyed in late 2021. Of course, past patterns are no guarantee of the future, and it’s possible to argue that circumstances are different this time, what with a pro-crypto White House. But we can also argue that, with the situation tense in the Middle East , the crypto market could encounter shocks that drag down the Ethereum price. ISRAEL & IRAN WAR WILL CONTINUE They will break caesefire, $BTC will dump I spent night reading ALL data and reports Here's 8 things you MUST know and where #crypto goes now (it will save u millions) pic.twitter.com/AAqLckmphe — ᴛʀᴀᴄᴇʀ (@DeFiTracer) June 24, 2025 On a more positive note, we could also suggest that a death cross on ETH’s two-week chart was the beginning of a consolidating period which eventually resulted in new growth. And because Ethereum remains the biggest layer-one network in terms of TVL , it’s a prime position to grow again once conditions are more favorable. Based on this, we can expect that, after dipping in the coming weeks, the Ethereum price will return to $3,000 by Q4, and to $3,500 by the end of the year. Solaxy Continues to Rally After Big Launch and $58 Million Presale: Best New Coin? For those traders worried that history may repeat itself for Ethereum, there are newer tokens that are showing more positive momentum in the near term. A strong example of this is Solaxy (SOLX), a new layer-two platform that has recently listed after raising a massive $58 million in its presale. Solaxy is now LIVE on CoinGecko https://t.co/2PJM0PlkXt pic.twitter.com/5tCJc9WWNY — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 23, 2025 Its native token SOLX has now listed on Uniswap and Raydium, and it’s up by 5% in the past 24 hours, as of writing. In fact, it had a massive opening earlier this week, reaching its current record high of $0.001284 on Tuesday, which made for a 108% gain over its lowest price on the day (Monday) it listed. Investors have been flocking to Solaxy because of its interesting fundamentals, with the project launching Solana’s first proper layer-two network. As such, it offers ultra-low transaction fees and very fast confirmation times, helping users to avoid the congestion that can still impact Solana. It enables instant bridging between itself and Solana, while in the future its team plans to expand its compatibility to other chains. The next few weeks will see the arrival of its own token launchpad, Igniter, through which anyone will be able to issue their own coins. Its own DEX is also on the way, helping to make Solaxy one of the most exciting new platforms in crypto. Holders of its native token, SOLX, will be able to stake the coin for passive income, something which should boost demand for the token over time. And with more exchange listings rumored, now could be a very time to buy the token, while it remains relatively cheap.

2025-06-26T19:26:57,"Kraken Floats Krak App To Explore Global Payments","Kraken, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has launched a new app called Krak App. This app is designed to enable people to send and receive both digital and traditional money worldwide seamlessly. Krak is built to be simple, fast, and low-cost. It was released ahead of Kraken’s planned initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market in 2026. The app supports more than 300 cryptocurrencies. Krak Follows A Consumer-Focused Approach Ripple is recognized for facilitating the transfer of money across international borders for banks and large companies. Krak, on the other hand, is built for everyday people and small businesses. Users can transfer money to other Krak app users or directly to their bank accounts, with no transaction fee. This is designed to help people save money when sending funds, making digital payments easy and affordable for everyone. Meanwhile, the Krak app is part of Kraken’s bigger goal to expand its business. In the past months, the exchange introduced zero-fee trading on U.S. stocks and also bought a futures trading platform for $1.5 billion . With Krak, Kraken is now entering the fintech world, competing with popular apps like Venmo, Revolut, Cash App, and Coinbase Payments. Kraken To Expand Krak Use Beyond Digital Payments Kraken has plans to add more features to the app. Soon, Krak users will have access to both physical and virtual debit cards. These cards will let them spend their money directly from the app, just like a regular bank account. Later, Kraken will also offer loans and credit services through the app, demonstrating its plans to become a comprehensive financial service provider. By leveraging the existing strong systems, the company hopes Krak will attract both new and experienced users. Additionally, Krak will offer rewards to users, allowing them to earn up to 10% returns on selected assets. Most recently, Kraken partnered with Babylon, an innovative staking protocol, to let users earn rewards on their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings . This is part of the company’s plan to give more value back to users. Industry Experts See Big Potential in Krak Many experts believe the Krak app is an important move for Kraken. Analysts from Oppenheimer say that Krak could become a bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional financial tools. Financial firms, such as Citi and PwC, also support this view, stating that the timing is right. This comes as new global rules are making it easier for digital money apps to grow safely. However, these experts believe that a good user experience will be key to Krak’s success. At the same time, Ripple is also growing. Its new RLUSD stablecoin was added to Alchemy Pay, making it easier for people to move between traditional money and crypto. Nevertheless, Krak focuses more on helping everyday users make fast and free payments.

2025-06-26T19:23:40,"Bitcoin did go to $1,000,000 this cycle, according to crypto sleuth Pledditor. What does it mean?","On June 24, 2025, a blogger using the Pledditor handle published an X post that kicks off like this: Bitcoin did go to $1,000,000 this cycle, it’s just the value wasn’t captured by “you”. It was captured by “them”. Then, Pledditor explains how 10x mNAV may help Bitcoin pioneers holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin to trade BTC at $1,000,000. How realistic is this scheme? A sleuth using the Pledditor moniker on Twitter made headlines in 2023 when they shared deleted tweets of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. The person behind this account is an avid critic of Bitcoin treasury companies, which they refer to as “grift.” It’s worth saying that Pledditor is far from being a Bitcoin skeptic; rather, they advocate for self-custody and a DIY approach in general. Table of Contents What is the scheme described by Pledditor? Likening treasuries to SPACs Which treasuries can boast 10x mNAV? What is the scheme described by Pledditor? In a recent Twitter thread, Pledditor dissects how the “Bitcoin OGs” (i.e., David Bailey, Adam Back, Ten31, Swan, and others) can trade Bitcoin at one million during the current cycle. Bitcoin did go to $1,000,000 this cycle, it's just the value wasn't captured by ""you"". It was captured by ""them"". If you are a bitcoin OG with a bunch of coins, what you do is securitize your BTC stack by SPAC'ing it on the public markets. You then create a ""irresponsibly long… — Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 24, 2025 In the post, Pledditor describes the way the early Bitcoin holders with huge bags can securitize their holdings. According to them, they may launch a Strategy-like treasury company and hype up people on Twitter, urging them to buy their stocks. They may do it themselves or via a third-party frontman (“influencer”). As soon as the market net asset value reaches ten, the company founder may exit the common stock while keeping preferred shares for themselves. Given that the mNAV is 10 and the BTC price is $100,000, the company founder technically sells their bitcoins at $1,000,000 while not fully departing with their bitcoins thanks to keeping preferred shares. In the following tweets, Pledditor adds that the base Bitcoin for such ventures is coming from “Bitcoin OGs,” not even from the OTC desk. So, the impact on the market BTC price is zero. Pledditor concludes , “They tell you buying common gives you __ amount of BTC per share, when in reality *they* own all the preferreds, *they* own the BTC.” Earlier, Pleddior replied “Correct” to a tweet saying that Strategy is an exit scam for executives and Bitcoin OGs. Likening treasuries to SPACs On top of that, in the post, Pledditor compares the treasury companies to Special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Lately, this comparison has been occurring across the crypto Twitter repeatedly; Pledditor is not the only one to bring it up. Bitcoin and other crypto treasury companies are the new SPACs. The only people that got rich off the SPAC model 4 years later were those who created it. It’s financial engineering. It never ends well for retail. Most SPACs are down 90% or more. Only a few are above initial price. — Beanie (@beaniemaxi) June 12, 2025 SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, are shell companies created to raise capital via IPOs to merge with a public company or to acquire it. SPACs have no operations. SPACs may be seen as an attractive way to release shares without having to go through the normal disclosures required for companies going public. Two waves of SPAC popularity (in the late 2000s and the early 2020s) ended up rough for retail investors. Most of the time, they saw negative return rates for years. One of the latest popular SPACs was the 2024 Trump Media company merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp. Currently, the DJT stock is traded well below the merging period price. No wonder the comparison between SPACs and treasuries is unfavorable and hints at the lack of real, practical purpose behind companies like Strategy, Metaplanet, and their copycats. Both SPACs and treasuries don’t produce anything and have only a speculative value. While Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy raises concerns as it may seem too risky, Goldman Sachs analysts claimed Bitcoin has to dip 50% to put the company at real risk. According to Fakhul Miah from Go Mining Institutional, newer Bitcoin treasuries don’t have proper safeguards . If the BTC price goes below $90,000, it may trigger liquidations and a ripple effect that will affect bigger treasuries too. More than that, as regulation will allow companies to hold BTC self-custody, Bitcoin ETFs and stocks of Bitcoin treasuries may lose their attraction for corporations. Read more: Will Michael Saylor pull the rug? However, some Bitcoin enthusiasts find Michael Saylor’s lack of interest in Bitcoin adoption disturbing. While he is advertising Bitcoin and urging everyone to buy Bitcoin, whatever it costs, Strategy is busy selling MSTR stocks, not exposing investors to direct Bitcoin ownership. Micheal ""SELL YOUR CHAIRS"" Saylor must be tripping, telling everyone to buy Bitcoin for years then watching everyone pile into every imaginable explicitly non-bitcoin financial product he offers. Truly amazing, absolute genius on his part. — P (@pmilanovich_bfs) June 24, 2025 Which treasuries can boast 10x mNAV? While most treasuries’ mNAV rate doesn’t exceed a 3.0 mark, several companies already reached the threshold brought up by Pledditor in the post. On June 6, 2025, NYDIG shared the mNAV rates based on the SEC filings. It indicates that GameStop and Nakamoto have mNAV rates above the 10 mark, while Metaplanet and Strive are near this value, with 7.6 and 9.1 rates, respectively. It’s worth saying that GameStop is leading the charge mostly because it had a substantial market cap before allocating Bitcoin, and the BTC share of GameStop’s reserve is relatively small. Was the Pledditor’s post aimed directly at David Bailey, whose company Nakamoto has an mNAV rate above 10? Probably so. The amount of criticism towards Bitcoin treasuries grows accordingly with the number of companies following the footsteps of Strategy. Time will show who’s right.

The flagship coin dropped slightly to trade at about $107,472 on Thursday, June 26, during the mid-North American session. After recording an impressive comeback, following the 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs in April, BTC price has been forming a potential reversal pattern. The bearish sentiment for BTC price has been forming amid the growing demand from institutional investors, led by Strategy, and Metaplanet. Major Factors Weighing Down on Midterm Bullish Sentiment for Bitcoin Price Technical Headwinds The BTC price, in the daily timeframe, has been forming a falling trend following a bearish breakout from a rising wedge formed in late May 2025. The midterm bearish sentiment for BTC price is bolstered by the falling daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) with the MACD line having crossed below the zero line. From a technical analysis standpoint, BTC price is well-positioned to retest the support level above $92k again in the coming weeks. The ultimate support level for BTC price was established above $76k earlier this year. High Cumulative Short Liquidation Leverage Bitcoin price faces intensified bearish sentiment fueled by cumulative short liquidation leverage of about $12 billion around $112k. Ideally, it is safe to say that more institutional investors are seeking to suppress BTC price through the futures and leveraged markets to acquire as many coins as possible before the highly anticipated parabolic rally.Furthermore, on-chain data shows that institutional investors have been aggressively accumulating more BTC through leveraging equity markets.

2025-06-26T19:00:55,"Trader Pin Points Why XRP Is Being Suppressed So Hard","XRP is once again at the center of controversy in the crypto community, as traders weigh in on the token’s potential and the forces that may be working to hold it back. The conversation reignited after Blockchain Backer posted: “If it isn’t clear yet, XRP is a threat to Bitcoin.” That statement quickly drew a strong reaction from popular XRP advocate Cobb, who responded, “THIS IS WHY THEY TRY TO SUPPRESS XRP SO HARD.” Cobb’s comment reflects a belief shared by many in the XRP community: that XRP’s unique design and growing real-world use cases have positioned it as a direct challenge to Bitcoin’s dominance. And for that reason, it faces persistent suppression from both market influencers and regulatory powers. THIS IS WHY THEY TRY TO SUPPRESS XRP SO HARD https://t.co/xLQkJra2a0 — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 26, 2025 XRP vs. Bitcoin: A Fundamental Divide At the heart of this debate is the contrast between Bitcoin and XRP in both function and philosophy. Bitcoin was created as a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value. Its slow transaction speeds and high energy consumption are often defended as trade-offs for its security and decentralization. XRP, by contrast, was built for speed, efficiency, and utility, especially in cross-border payments. With transaction finality in seconds, negligible fees, and the ability to handle over 1,000 transactions per second, XRP offers a practical solution for real-time settlement that Bitcoin simply cannot match. This performance gap has led many analysts to argue that XRP threatens Bitcoin’s position, not just in market cap, but in relevance. If institutions and governments begin to prioritize utility over store-of-value narratives, XRP could emerge as the preferred blockchain solution for global finance. The Suppression Theory Cobb’s claim that XRP is being “suppressed” taps into a longstanding theory within the community: that XRP’s growth has been deliberately stalled to protect entrenched interests in Bitcoin and legacy financial systems. This theory gained momentum during Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which began in December 2020. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The timing of the SEC’s lawsuit—just as XRP was gaining traction with institutional partners—raised eyebrows. For nearly three years, XRP was delisted from major U.S. exchanges and excluded from key bull market rallies, while Bitcoin and Ethereum soared. Though the legal cloud is partially lifted, many believe the damage was already done. Cobb and others suggest that XRP’s sidelining wasn’t accidental. With its deep ties to banks, central banks, and payment providers, XRP threatens not only Bitcoin’s dominance but also the interests of those who benefit from the current system. A Real Threat to the Old Guard? The question now is whether XRP can reclaim its momentum. As Ripple expands into CBDCs, tokenized assets, and institutional finance, XRP’s utility continues to grow. And with renewed attention on Bitcoin’s limitations, XRP is once again being viewed as a legitimate alternative. Cobb’s pointed reaction, “This is why they try to suppress XRP so hard”, sums up the sentiment of a growing number of traders who believe that XRP’s biggest obstacle isn’t technology or demand, but the fear it inspires in those who stand to lose the most.

2025-06-26T19:00:24,"Bitcoin Is Not The First Cryptocurrency? Shocking Ripple Revelation Takes XRP Community By Surprise","For years, Bitcoin has been regarded as the genesis of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is widely credited with laying the foundation for the modern digital asset industry since its creation in 2009 by the anonymous figure Satoshi Nakamoto. Interestingly, some investors have occasionally challenged the origin story of cryptocurrencies. A resurfaced claim is catching attention across the crypto community, particularly among XRP supporters, due to new evidence that Ripple’s XRP may have been created before Bitcoin. XRP’s Origins In 2004 The discussion kicked off on the social media platform X after a user and crypto commentator known as SMQKE on the platform posted an interesting comment: “2014 E-mails confirm: ‘Ripple is older than Bitcoin.’” The post was accompanied by a screenshot from a 2014 email exchange that sheds some light on Ripple’s lesser-known history. The email thread, dated February 2014, includes contributions from journalist Bailey Reutzel and developer Jeffrey Cliff. In it, Reutzel confirms that “The first iteration of Ripple was conceived by Ryan Fugger in 2004.” At this time, Satoshi Nakamoto had not yet introduced the concept of blockchain-decentralized digital payments. Fugger’s original vision of XRP was RipplePay, which is a peer-to-peer trust network designed to allow communities to issue and exchange credits long before any mention of a blockchain or mining. However, the platform struggled with issues related to uncommitted participants. As Reutzel explains in the message, Fugger sought ways to address these issues and eventually handed over the reins to Chris Larsen, who later co-founded Ripple Labs and XRP in 2012. Under Larsen’s leadership, Ripple began pivoting toward what we now understand as a blockchain-based cryptocurrency platform. But according to Reutzel, the shift was more about capitalizing on Bitcoin’s growing mainstream popularity at the time rather than copying its fundamentals. Cliff, in the same email exchange, pushed back on the idea that Ripple was a reaction to Bitcoin hype. He stated: “Not true. Ripple predates Bitcoin, and the hype that followed.” XRP’s Early Structure: Not Really A Crypto? The emails make a clear distinction between Ripple as a network and XRP as a currency. It is well-known that Ripple wasn’t initially designed to be a crypto in the way Bitcoin was. In fact, Reutzel’s remarks clarify that Larsen positioned XRP as a cryptocurrency mainly to draw attention, not because the Ripple platform itself was about cryptocurrencies at the time. XRP did not rely on proof-of-work or blockchain in its earliest form, but its purpose aligned with decentralizing financial exchange and cross-border payments. This concept would later be popularized through Bitcoin’s architecture. That alone makes the argument that the altcoin is technically older than Bitcoin difficult to dismiss outright, even if it wasn’t fully crypto in structure during its creation. Nonetheless, many crypto investors would argue that Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency . It continues to maintain that title till now as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a current 64.8% share of the total industry.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-xrp-origin-revelation/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Bailey Reutzel|bitcoin|Chris Larsen|Jeffrey Cliff|ripple|ripple news|RipplePay|Ryan Fugger|SMQKE|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T19:00:20,"Ethereum Not Out Of The Woods Yet: Why Another 30% Crash To $1,800 Is Coming","Crypto analyst Crypto Wave has indicated that Ethereum could witness another significant price crash, presenting a bearish outlook for the altcoin. This price crash is expected to mark Wave C of a corrective move, with ETH dropping to as low as $1,800. Why Ethereum Could Still Drop To As Low As $1,800 In an X post, Crypto Wave declared that the primary expectation remains that Ethereum will see one more leg down in wave c of wave 2, targeting the zone between $1,950 and $1,700. Specifically, his accompanying chart showed that the largest altcoin by market cap could drop to around $1,800. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash To $2,100 Triggers Fear, But Why Are Analysts Predicting A Rally To $6,000? The crypto analyst revealed that Ethereum has already hit the 0.5 fib retracement at $2,100, which is the minimum target for a Wave 2 correction. However, structurally, he claimed that this drop still looks like wave A only. Crypto Wave further explained that these ABC corrections are always three-part moves, and that is what he sees forming now for ETH. The broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin, has bounced back following the ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Ethereum has also rebounded, having dropped to as low as $2,100 last week. However, Crypto Wave suggested that the current market sentiment doesn’t invalidate this bearish setup for ETH and that it could still witness a deeper sell-off. The crypto analyst alluded to the fourth quarter of last year when Ethereum was underperforming heavily while many altcoins rallied. In line with this, he remarked that there could be a repeat of this scenario. However, on the other hand, Crypto Wave claimed that if ETH breaks above $2,880 impulsively, especially in one clean wave, then the correction could be over. He added that this would also put the altcoin in the early stages of a new bull cycle. 2021 Pattern Playing Out For ETH In an X post, crypto analyst Merlijn drew similarities between the current Ethereum price action and that of 2021. He stated that the 2021 playbook is repeating, with ETH having a dead count bounce, then a final retest before the parabolic leg. The analyst expects the altcoin to retest the $2,000 level before the massive move to the upside. Related Reading: Market Expert Who Predicted Ethereum Price Crash At $2,800 Reveals What’s Coming Next His accompanying chart showed that Ethereum could rally to as high as $11,000 on this uptrend. Merlijn had remarked that ETH has more firepower this time around than in 2021, which is why the altcoin could witness such a parabolic move to the upside. Interestingly, based on the chart, this rally is expected to happen between now and year-end. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,480, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Lingerie Fighting Championships (BOTY), a Las Vegas-based women’s MMA league, announced plans to acquire $230,000 worth of bitcoin within 30 days and up to $2 million over the next six months. The decision to add BTC to its treasury coincides with LFC’s first shows in the UK. LFC43: Sindependence Day 2 is set for July 4 in London and has already sold out. LFC44: Underground Knockouts follows in Cardiff on July 6. The firm did not provide any explanation for its bitcoin adoption in its press release. However, CEO Shaun Donnelly told CoinDesk that LFC believed that ""bitcoin has lots of potential to grow to levels never seen before and we wanted to get in while we still can."" ""While we aren’t able to purchase a large amount I looked at it like real estate — even if it’s only a small starter home it’s better to be in the market than outside wishing you had gotten in when you could have,"" he added. A number of bitcoin treasury firms have elected to scale back their prior businesses in order to identify completely as a BTC company and focus on raising funds in order to buy bitcoin. Lingerie Fighting Championships, meanwhile, could be taking the Tesla approach, simply converting some of its cash holdings into BTC.

2025-06-26T18:50:45,"Coinbase launches regulated alternative to offshore crypto perpetuals","Offshore perpetuals come with counterparty risk, custody concerns, and regulatory uncertainty. Coinbase’s new U.S.-based alternative offers leverage without the baggage, bringing a potential game-changer for cautious but yield-hungry traders. In an a nnouncement on June 26, crypto exchange Coinbase revealed plans to launch U.S. Perpetual-Style Futures on its derivatives platform—marking one of the first regulated attempts to replicate the functionality of offshore perpetual contracts. Slated for a July 21 rollout, the products will feature nano-sized Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) futures with an unusually long five-year expiration, coupled with a funding rate mechanism to maintain alignment with spot prices. Unlike traditional quarterly futures, these contracts will trade 24/7, accrue funding hourly, and settle twice daily. The structure is designed to appeal to both retail and institutional traders seeking perpetual-like exposure without the legal gray areas of offshore venues. You might also like: Judge rejects SEC, Ripple motion on XRP sales and $125m penalty A regulated answer to an offshore dominated market Coinbase’s move is a strategic play to capture a market that has, until now, existed largely in regulatory limbo. Perpetual futures dominate crypto trading globally, accounting for nearly 93% of all crypto derivatives volume, according to Cornell research. Yet U.S. traders have been locked out of this liquidity, forced to either accept clunky, expiration-bound contracts or take their business to offshore exchanges like Bybit and Binance, where regulatory oversight is minimal and counterparty risk remains high. With its new five-year expiring contracts, Coinbase is attempting to repackage the perpetual model in a way that fits within U.S. legal parameters. Unlike traditional futures, which reset quarterly and often drift from spot prices, Coinbase’s contracts apply hourly funding payments to tether positions closely to market rates. Traders pay or receive funding every 12 hours based on long or short positioning, a system borrowed from offshore perpetuals but streamlined for U.S. compliance. The nano sizing (0.01 BTC and 0.10 ETH) lowers the barrier to entry, appealing to retail traders who might otherwise avoid futures entirely. Critically, the five-year expiration is a nod to long-term holders. Most crypto derivatives require rollovers every few months, creating friction for multi-year strategies. By minimizing expiration pressure, Coinbase is betting that traders will prefer holding these contracts over juggling quarterly expiries or risking exposure on offshore platforms. If successful, Coinbase’s initiative could pressure rivals to launch similar hybrid instruments, reshaping the U.S. crypto derivatives landscape.

In May, a scammer called the victim, 68, pretending to represent her bank and claiming that her cards had been compromised, per a press release from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The scammer said a courier would come to collect her old cards and sent a driver from a rideshare company to pick them up. An hour later, the same scammer told the woman that all of her financial accounts had been compromised and sent a second rideshare “courier” to pick up all of her cards. The scammer also obtained the victim’s PINs over the phone and used the stolen cards and her personal info to drain CA$60,000 ($43,687) from her account. Police have tracked down one of the rideshare drivers, who is cooperating with the investigation, but they have been unable to locate the second driver. RCMP investigators say the victim’s cards were driven to the parking lot of a Home Depot, where they were picked up by a man wearing a face covering. The RCMP says it will continue to investigate the crime but notes that the chances of recovering stolen funds are low. Similar “bank courier” scams occurred in New York state earlier this year.

2025-06-26T18:31:41,"Blockchain-Powered Pokies: How Crypto Payments are Changing Online Slot Play","Online pokies and casino gaming are becoming more and more popular. Thanks to technology, online slot enthusiasts can easily access and enjoy classic and modern pokies with real payouts in a safe environment. So let's take a look at how blockchain and crypto payments in particular, are changing slot play in online pokies. From faster transactions to probably fair gaming, blockchain is reshaping the online slots experience. There are a number of benefits that come with blockchain-powered platforms, including greater security, transparency most importantly, excitement. The evolution of online slots in the age of blockchain Online slots have come a long way since their digital debut in the late 1990s. What started out as a basic, browser-based game with simple graphics and fruit symbols has evolved into immersive experiences. Slot games now feature rich visuals and themes, interactive bonus rounds and progressive jackpots. The integration of blockchain technology marks the next major shift in the industry. The use of decentralised networks and crypto tokens has meant that game developers and casinos are now able to offer players features that were previously impossible. This includes direct crypto wagering, tokenised rewards and smart contract-driven payouts. Blockchain is not just a payment method. It's technology that is completely changing the infrastructure of online gaming platforms, enabling great autonomy and fairness in each and every spin. Enhancing player trust One of the main advantages of using blockchain technology in online casinos is the enhanced trust it offers. Most traditional slot games operate on random number generators (RNGs), but players have historically had to take the casino's word that games are fair. Whereas blockchain has introduced provably fair gaming. This is where the fairness of each spin can be independently verified by players through publicly accessible cryptographic proofs. This level of transparency helps to build confidence among users, knowing they are playing on a platform where manipulation is virtually impossible. This is crucial in the digital world where digital identity is so important and there are so many risks out there. Every spin's outcome is recorded on the blockchain, which has helped to make disputes easier to resolve and also ensures the overall integrity of the game. Faster and safer payments Speed and security have become critical to any online gambling experience. Traditional payment methods like bank transfers or credit cards will often come with delays, fees and in some regions, restrictions on gambling transactions. Whereas blockchain-based casinos allow players to deposit and withdraw using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , Ethereum and stablecoins, which all typically come with near-instant processing times. Cryptocurrency payments are direct; they are peer-to-peer transactions. There are no third parties or intermediaries involved, which means payments tend to be quicker, come with lower fees and come with a reduced risk of fraud or chargebacks. Blockchain payments also come with more privacy, which is perfect for players who are seeking discretion when enjoying online slots. A new gaming ecosystem Beyond payments and fairness, blockchain is driving a new wave of community-driven innovation in the online pokies space. Decentralised casinos and gaming platforms often involve players directly in the decision-making through governance tokens, allowing them to vote on game features, platform updates or promotional campaigns. By participating, a platform can strengthen player loyalty and create an ecosystem where users feel genuinely invested. Plus, collaborations between blockchain developers and game studios are giving rise to unique pokies concepts, from NFT slot themes to cross-game jackpots that link multiple titles across platforms. The growing appeal of classic and modern pokies with real payouts Whether you prefer the nostalgic charm of fruit machines or the thrill of cutting-edge video slots, blockchain-powered platforms cater to a wide audience. They offer everything from simple three-reel games to sophisticated slots with advanced features. Many blockchain platforms incorporate native tokens or loyalty programs too. This has helped to further enhance the value players recieve. These innovations not only help to increase engagement, but also provide new opportunities to win and cash out real rewards securely. So what's next for blockchain integration in online slots The future of blockchain in online slots is full of exciting possibilities. We can expect to see greater adoption of smart contracts, enabling fully automated payouts and bonus triggers. Cross-platform tokens might allow players to transfer balances seamlessly between different casinos or games. Additionally, innovations like NFT-based game assets or community-owned slots could also create more personalised and interactive gaming experiences. Blockchain is completely transforming online slots in a way that benefits both players and operators. From provably fair gaming and faster crypto payments to the emergence of community-driven platforms, the technology is creating a safer, more transparent and engaging experience. As the industry continues to evolve, players can look forward to even greater innovation and opportunity. So whether you're a casual spinner or an experienced slot enthusiast, the future of blockchain-powered pokies promises exciting possibilities on every reel.

2025-06-26T18:30:05,"The Trump Effect: How His Bitcoin (BTC) Treasury Plan Impacts its Race Against Ethereum (ETH)","Donald Trump's approach to managing Bitcoin reserves has sent ripples through the crypto world. This strategic move could shape Bitcoin's standing in its ongoing competition with Ethereum . As the dynamics shift, it raises the question: which cryptocurrency is poised for growth? The article delves into the potential impacts and explores what this means for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin Price Dynamics: Mixed Signals and Clear Price Zones Bitcoin recorded a 1.52% dip over the last month paired with a modest weekly gain of nearly 2.77%, while a robust rise of 14.41% over the past six months marked its extended performance. Price action revealed a period of cautious progress as short-term retracements gave way to an overall upward trend. Oscillator readings have presented mixed signals with softened momentum alongside moderate RSI readings, reflecting a balancing act between upward liquidity and profit-taking pressures. Historical trends indicate Bitcoin has experienced periods of consolidation that allow the market to digest prior highs while paving the way for upcoming bullish rallies. Present trading sees Bitcoin stabilizing between roughly $94,832 and $113,326.8, with significant technical levels anchored at nearest support of $84,880.08 and immediate resistance of $121,869.42. A secondary support around $66,385.41 and resistance at about $140,364.09 further demarcate the battle zones between buyers and sellers. Bulls show promise as indicated by a momentum indicator reading close to 985.37, yet the negative awesome oscillator value near -1,037.44 hints at underlying selling pressure. RSI sits at a balanced 57.36, and mixed technical recommendations necessitate careful trade planning. Trading ideas include seeking long entries near support with measured stops just below the next level, while resistance areas should be watched for potential profit-taking before a sustained move can be confirmed. Ethereum's Recent Downturn and Key Price Levels for Action Ethereum faced a moderate drop of about -3.23% over the past month and a sharper decline of -25.51% in the last six months. Price adjustments have pushed the current range between $1923.57 and $2961.91. This period has seen noticeable loss pressure with overall bearish movements impacting investor sentiment. Monthly and half-year changes indicate that price correction remains the prevailing trend, reflecting market forces that have favored sellers and resulted in significant downtrends that warrant caution among traders. Current prices hover within a tight band, setting the nearest resistance at $3395.40 and the closest support at $1318.72, with a second resistance level at $4433.74 and a deep support around $280.38. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator at -163.45 and Momentum Indicator at -63.69 reflect a market leaning towards bearish pressure, while the Relative Strength Index at 50.11 shows no clear momentum for buyers or sellers. Trading strategies could involve shorting if upward moves stall near resistance while preparing for potential reversals at support levels, advocating for cautious tactics within these ranges amid uncertainties. Conclusion BTC 's potential treasury plan could boost its position. This move may attract more institutional interest. Such backing could drive BTC's value and mainstream acceptance higher. While ETH focuses on improving its ecosystem, BTC may gain a lead in investor confidence. This evolving dynamic will shape the future standings of both cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-26T18:27:52,"Blockchain Smashes the Casino Cage: Your Crypto Keys to a Fairer UK Gamble","Forget clunky old systems. Blockchain is crashing into online gambling, providing UK players with top-notch security, super-fast transactions, and verifiable fairness. This article gives you the real deal. Want to stop relying on blind luck and faceless algorithms when placing an online wager? Blockchain technology is taking over the UK iGaming industry, and it's a bloody time. No doubt, the UK Gambling Commission is on the case, but this tech tango between crypto and entertainment is forging a radically transparent future for your bets. Blockchain Storms the Gaming Arena The magic of blockchain lies in its brutal honesty. Every transaction, every game result is etched onto a decentralized, shared ledger. It's a public record that no one can tamper with - not the casino, not a hacker, nor anyone. And that ends the old dynamic where you cross your fingers and hope the house plays straight. Probable fair systems can change the game for casinos. Verify a roulette spin: With cryptography, platforms give you a hash before you play so you can check the math and be sure the outcome is random. Speed is another advantage - blockchain removes banking middlemen, so deposits can be instant and withdrawals can take minutes. That means lower fees too. All players worldwide can join, but players must register to access licensed casino content in the UK . Smart contracts make payouts and rewards automatic, reducing human errors and delays. Plus, using crypto means your banking details are secret. Licensing: The Rulebook Rewritten for Crypto Mixing volatile crypto with online gambling? Regulators were bound to sit up. The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) isn’t asleep at the wheel. They haven’t outlawed crypto, but licensed operators using it face a regulatory gauntlet. Online security’s come a long way – from flimsy padlocks (SSL) to fortress walls (TLS and 2FA). Blockchain slams on another deadbolt: an immutable transaction history that’s near-impossible to forge. For UK sites flirting with crypto, the UKGC demands ironclad Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) drills. This means grilling players about their crypto’s origin story and deploying hardcore Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, especially for hefty bets. Crucially, your Bitcoin or Ether doesn’t stay crypto for long on UKGC platforms. They swiftly convert it into pounds sterling within your account. This shields your stake from crypto’s infamous rollercoaster rides while you play. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also keeps crypto businesses on a tight leash, demanding registration and rigorous risk controls. It’s a high-wire act: fostering innovation without letting the cowboys in. Why This Tech Tango Wins for UK Players So, what’s actually in it for you, placing bets from Birmingham or Brighton? This isn’t just tech hype; the perks bite hard. Privacy gets a serious shot in the arm. Crypto transactions cloak your real-world financial identity better than traditional methods. Security? Blockchain’s cryptographic muscle makes transactions virtually unhackable. Every quid wagered or won leaves an indelible, verifiable trail – fraud’s nightmare. Speed offers an instant adrenaline rush, with crypto payouts hitting your digital wallet immediately after a win, avoiding lengthy withdrawals. Fees are often minimal, bypassing traditional bank charges. Sticking to UKGC-licensed sites is essential for safety, but some platforms enhance access to global games and offer exclusive bonuses for crypto users. The standout feature? Provable Fairness, giving you the ability to verify that the game is fair. It's a powerful shift in trust. UK Platforms Dipping Toes (and Tokens) in Crypto Hunting for a shouting, full-throttle blockchain casino licensed by the UKGC right now? Keep your shirt on. The regulatory heat means big players prioritise compliance over crowdfunding revolutions. But look closer: a growing crew now quietly accept crypto payments alongside cards and e-wallets. Their UKGC mandate? Prove they can handle crypto’s risks: bulletproof AML/KYC, instant conversion to GBP, and meticulous fund tracking. Pioneers of tokenised economies and DAO-governed casinos often operate in less regulated spaces, unlike the UK, which, despite its caution, could foster responsible innovation. Operators focusing on crypto security, speed, and fairness are poised to lead the next wave. For inspiration, look at ""EVE Frontier,"" a sci-fi MMO with deep Ethereum integration, where players own NFTs like spaceships and trade ERC-20 tokens in a player-run market. This concept suggests a future where gambling platforms could adopt similar decentralised technologies, allowing for player-owned experiences and DAO casinos with token holder votes on the house edge. Crypto Gambling's Next Hand: What’s the Deal? The crypto gamble in the UK is just the first spin. Watch regulators like the UKGC and FCA refine their playbook as the tech evolves . But blockchain’s core strengths of transparency, blistering speed, ironclad security, and giving players real agency align shockingly well with responsible gambling aims. Will provably fair mechanics become the baseline demand, even on fiat sites? You’d bet on it. Fully decentralised platforms, running entirely on-chain via unbreakable smart contracts? They’re the dream, but UK regulatory mountains loom large. Tokenised rewards programs, where your play earns crypto assets you can trade or stake? That’s got legs. And what about those quantum randomness beacons – spooky science magic guaranteeing cosmic-level unpredictability? Could they become the ultimate fairness seal?

2025-06-26T18:22:05,"Cloudbet expands crypto crash game portfolio with Galaxsys","Willemstad, Curaçao – June 26, 2025 – Cloudbet has added the full suite of Galaxsys titles to its crash and instant-win lineup, reinforcing its position as a crypto-first casino built for speed, volatility, and direct-crypto play. The rollout includes 42 games across crash, slots, table games, bingo, and arcade-style formats — all playable in over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), USDT, and USDC. Galaxsys is known for fast-cycle gameplay and transparent mechanics — a natural match for Cloudbet’s high-frequency bettors. Crash leaders like Crash, Crasher, Tower Rush, and Rocketon feature rising multipliers, instant resolution, and peak volatility, with potential payouts reaching up to x700,000. In March, Tower Rush was named “Best Crash Game 2025” at SiGMA Africa — its third industry award after receiving the “Best New Game 2025” accolade at the AIBC Eurasia Awards. “These titles reflect our commitment to quality-first curation,” said Cloudbet’s casino product manager. “They align with how crypto players engage — high-speed formats, scalable risk, and real-money outcomes without delay. Galaxsys understands that rhythm, and the games slot naturally into our most active segments.” Crash games have become a cornerstone of crypto gambling, favored for their rapid pace, minimal friction, and high-volatility structure that mirrors the crypto market itself. The core mechanic — riding a rising multiplier and cashing out before the crash — delivers instant resolution and real-money tension in under ten seconds. That simplicity, combined with scalable risk and always-on access, makes crash an ideal fit for the habits of crypto-native bettors. Cloudbet , which launched in 2013, was one of the first crypto casinos to support crash games at scale. Today, instant-win staples like Aviator by Spribe — which alone accounts for more than 33% of daily activity in the site’s instant-win segment — continue to dominate player engagement. Alongside Aviator, games like Mines, Dice, and Plinko, longstanding Spribetitles in Cloudbet’s lineup, each capture between 8% and 12% of daily activity. The Galaxsysintegration adds depth to the category without overlap or filler content. The Galaxsys drop also includes top-ranking slots like Olympian Legends and Funny Faces, along with table game staples Blackjack, RouletteX, and HiLo. Instant-win fans get fresh options too, with arcade-style picks like Maestro, Magic Dice, CoinFlip, and Ninja Crash. All Galaxsys games are now live. Players can browse, demo, or play — no KYC required. $3,000 Cloudbet x Galaxsys tournament now live To celebrate the launch, Cloudbet is running a $3,000 Galaxsys Tournament. Players earn points by betting on any Galaxsys title, with the top 40 finishers winning instant cash prizes — up to $750 — credited directly via the Rewards Calendar. The tournament complements recent site upgrades, including new multiplier profiles, community tipping tools, and enhanced tournament pages — all built for streamers and fast-cycle format fans. About Cloudbet Founded in 2013, Cloudbet is the world’s longest-running crypto casino and sportsbook. Players worldwide have placed millions of bets using over 40 cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-26T18:15:32,"Ex-Blackstone Exec, Tether Co-Founder to Launch $1B Crypto Reserve SPAC","A Bloomberg report has revealed that former Blackstone Inc. executive Chinh Chu and Reeve Collins, co-founder of stablecoin giant Tether, are teaming up to raise $1 billion for a listed crypto vehicle that aims to build a portfolio of digital assets. The capital is being raised through M3 Brigade Acquisition V Corp, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) backed by the two. A Multi-Token Approach Anonymous sources cited in the report said that the vehicle would hold a diversified mix of tokens, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL). They also revealed that the fundraising effort is ongoing, meaning that the details, including the $1 billion target, may change. Cantor Fitzgerald LP is among the parties advising on the deal. Furthermore, Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce in U.S. President Donald Trump’s first administration, has reportedly been tapped to serve as vice chair alongside Binance board chairman Gabriel Abed. The venture will also have ex-Hut 8 Mining head Jaime Leverton as CEO in an acting capacity. Chu and Collins’ multi-token approach is markedly different from that taken by the likes of Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. The former has bought over 592,000 BTC, currently valued at more than $60 billion. The latter now holds 12,345 BTC worth over $1.33 billion and recently passed Tesla to become the seventh-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Meanwhile, others like SharpLink Gaming have taken an Ether-focused approach. The Minneapolis-based company owns 188,478 ETH worth about $457 million and is staking 100% of it to support the Ethereum network. This strategy followed a $425 million private placement led by Consensys and the appointment of Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman. Tether Co-Founder Buys $6.47M SPAC In May 2025, Collins acquired a controlling stake in M3-Brigade for $6.47 million. The deal included 7.19 million Class B shares and 5.04 million private placement warrants, with plans to purchase an additional 3.29 million from Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. Following the transaction, Collins was named CEO, with Chinh coming in as the SPAC’s new president. The crypto entrepreneur, who has also just joined the advisory board of Canadian-listed digital asset ETF company Fineqia, was instrumental in founding Tether, NFT platform BLOCKv, and Smart Media Technologies. He is currently chairman of STBL.com (formerly Pi), a yield-bearing stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum and Solana. This decentralized platform enables yield retention from tokenized RWAs such as U.S. Treasuries and money market funds. Meanwhile, Chu was Blackstone’s longest-serving dealmaker before leaving in 2015. While at the firm, he sponsored several SPACs, including deals for Getty Images and Utz Brands.

2025-06-26T18:05:24,"Crypto Trader Unveils Major Level Ethereum Must Break Above To Trigger Rally, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin","A closely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) has to break through one resistance level to ignite a bull rally. In a new thread, crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 549,100 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum needs to reclaim the area around $2,500 as support before ETH can mount an explosive move to the upside. “After holding the orange circled area for about six full weeks, Ethereum ended up following through on the blue circled scenario. Still, this orange box is the macro range low ($2,200), and price needs to effectively reclaim around $2,500 to rally across the range.” Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst also says that until Ethereum closes above $2,500 on the daily chart, ETH will likely hold $2,200 as support as it trades sideways. “For the time being, Ethereum is treating the ~$2,500 level as resistance after it previously held for almost six weeks. But Ethereum just needs a daily close above ~$2,500 to start the reclaim process. Until then, ETH will meander between $2,200-$2,500.” ETH is trading for $2,425 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is showing bullishness on the daily timeframe, having smashed through a downtrend line for the second time in June. “Bitcoin has broken two two-week downtrends over the past month.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,302 at time of writing, flat on the day.

2025-06-26T18:00:56,"Analyst to XRP Holders: This XRP Trendline Is Everything Right Now","XRP is once again in the spotlight as traders zero in on a critical trendline that could define its next major move. According to respected crypto analyst Casitrades, this key support line is “everything right now,” and the market’s reaction to it may signal whether XRP is ready to ignite its next leg upward. A Precise Bounce from Key Support XRP recently tapped the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.145—a zone that also marks the apex of its recent consolidation structure. This convergence of technical levels makes $2.145 a vital area to hold in the short term. So far, the price has responded positively, bouncing cleanly off this support, which suggests strength and renewed bullish momentum. Casitrades described this level as “the most critical on the chart, short-term,” warning that a drop below it would indicate weakness . However, XRP is currently holding above it with confidence. “This is the kind of price action you want to see if XRP is serious about continuing this new trend to the upside,” Casitrades wrote. This Trendline Is Everything Right Now! I’ve been tracking this trendline support as the key level to hold and we just got a clean reaction off it. This correction already reached the .382 retracement at $2.145, which also happens to be the apex of consolidation… that’s… pic.twitter.com/bA79dP1c99 — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 25, 2025 The current structure, where price remains above the consolidation range while showing impulsive upward moves, is often a strong sign of trend continuation. Resistance at $2.25: The Next Test As XRP stabilizes above support, attention now turns to the $2.25 resistance level. According to Casitrades, this is the next major hurdle. A breakout above $2.25 would be a bullish confirmation and could open the door to a move toward $2.69—the next Fibonacci retracement target. “Price is now trying to push back toward the $2.25 resistance. That’s the next big test,” Casitrades noted. “If we can flip that level, we’ll likely open the path toward the $2.69 retrace test—and from there, the breakout potential increases dramatically.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A move beyond $2.69 could trigger an even stronger rally, potentially signaling the ignition of a powerful wave 3, typically the most explosive phase in Elliott Wave theory. Momentum Building Across the Market XRP’s price action is unfolding as the broader altcoin market shows signs of revival. With Bitcoin consolidating, many traders are shifting focus to high-potential assets like XRP. Market indicators such as RSI and Stochastic RSI are also aligning in favor of the bulls, hinting at growing upward momentum. Volume is beginning to increase as XRP approaches resistance, suggesting rising interest and accumulation. Meanwhile, the price continues to respect key support levels, reinforcing the bullish structure. For now, all eyes are on whether XRP can clear $2.25 and confirm a breakout. But one thing is clear: as Casitrades rightly said, “This trendline is everything.” How XRP behaves around it could determine the direction of the next major move.

2025-06-26T17:55:52,"XRP 3 Hammers and 3 Rockets, Here’s What’s Next?","Market analyst EGRAG Crypto has projected when the XRP uptrend will resume after identifying what he calls hammers and rockets on the daily chart. His analysis comes on the back of XRP's consolidation phase, which began after a drop from the $3.4 top in mid-January. Specifically, after XRP collapsed from the $3.4 peak , it immediately relinquished the $3 mark and has since consolidated around $2 over the past five months.XRP Sees Hammers and Rockets Within Descending ChannelWhile the broader market takes a similar path, Bitcoin (BTC) has been witnessing new all-time highs . Now, EGRAG believes XRP is on the verge of breaking out of this consolidation phase, calling attention to a descending channel that has prevailed over the daily chart since November 2024.Interestingly, EGRAG's chart shows that XRP's upswings and declines since November have led to what he calls ""3 hammers"" and ""3 rockets."" Specifically, a hammer refers to the resistance presented by the bears when XRP attempts to break above the channel. Meanwhile, a rocket is the recovery push after XRP retests support at the channel's lower trendline.Notably, each hammer (or roadblock) has eventually resulted in a price correction, while each rocket (recovery effort) has led to a push toward a breakout. XRP Descending Channel | EGRAG Crypto For context, XRP saw three rockets at $1.95 on Dec. 20, 2024, at $1.76 on Feb. 3, 2025, and then at $1.61 on April 7, 2025.However, the three hammers came in at $3.4 on Jan. 16, 2025, at $3.02 on March 2, 2025, and then most recently at $2.65 on May 12, 2025.EGRAG Predicts When XRP Bull Run Will ResumeFollowing the three iterations of each pattern, EGRAG asked for audience opinions on whether XRP would break out or go lower. In his view, the next direction from here could be upward. According to him, XRP could break out from this channel or consolidation structure by mid-June, with the uptrend persisting until August to September 2025.However, his projection came up days before the Israel-Iran war began, which has since skewed the direction of the market. As a result of the conflict, this timeline could be delayed. Meanwhile, EGRAG provided several immediate targets around the breakout from the descending channel. Specifically, XRP would need to breach the $2.6 resistance to break above the channel. From the current price of $2.16, XRP must rise 20.3% to reach this price mark.XRP Breakout TargetsFollowing a breakout from the channel, XRP's next immediate target could be the $3 psychological level, which it has failed to reclaim since March. Beyond this, the next target would be the yearly peak of $3.4. A break above this mark could open the door for greater price heights.While EGRAG failed to present his ultimate targets for when the bull run resumes, he had in previous instances suggested that XRP could reach the $20 range this cycle. Most recently, he predicted that XRP's top for this cycle could be $24. Meanwhile, last month, he predicted a possible XRP rally to $27.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/26/xrp-3-hammers-and-3-rockets-heres-whats-next/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-3-hammers-and-3-rockets-heres-whats-next,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T17:50:16,"Coinbase launches Bitcoin-rewarding credit cards and futures trading, July 21","Coinbase is rolling out a new Bitcoin-backed credit card and launching two US-based crypto futures contracts on July 21, aimed at deepening the exchange’s footprint in both consumer spending and derivatives trading. But unlike cashback cards from traditional banks, this product reportedly gives users crypto, and unlike global futures markets, this product follows US rules. The new credit card, expected to drop this fall, will let users earn up to 4% back in BTC every time they swipe. But there’s a gate: you’ll need to subscribe to Coinbase’s premium trading service to even apply. Rewards go directly into your Coinbase account, not through third-party processors. This setup is designed to appeal to those already in the ecosystem, but not everyone’s on board. New card offers Bitcoin rewards, but comes with strings The idea of crypto rewards isn’t original. Exchanges like Gemini and Crypto.com already offer similar cards. But what makes this one different is the underlying asset, Bitcoin, and how volatile that can get. With cashback, what you earn is steady. With crypto, your 4% could spike or tank depending on what the market does. So you’re low-key investing, whether you like it or not. That risk comes on top of standard credit card hazards: high interest, debt buildup, and personal data exposure. Coinbase says its platform has never lost any customer funds to wallet breaches, and that card rewards are deposited into Coinbase wallets, not external providers. Gemini confirmed that rewards go into a Gemini wallet with full platform-level security. Some long-timers in the crypto space aren’t feeling it though. Graham Friedman, who leads crypto venture deals at Republic, isn’t sold. “I got into bitcoin in 2012 and a lot of it was about privacy, libertarianism, etc. And credit cards, by nature, swap your private information across a variety of companies,” Graham said . He added that for someone like him, who travels for work, airline cards with seat upgrades and miles are a better fit. “I can just go buy my own investment assets.” Still, for others, the idea of stacking BTC through normal purchases feels like an easy win. Buying coffee, booking flights, paying bills, etc., all become part of a long-term crypto strategy. That’s the appeal Coinbase is apparently banking on. Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading go live July 21 On the derivatives side, Coinbase announced the launch of two US-based perpetual-style futures contracts through its Coinbase Derivatives Exchange. These will go live on July 21 and include a nano Bitcoin contract at 0.01 BTC and a nano Ether contract at 0.10 ETH. These aren’t just any contracts—they’re designed to function like global perpetual futures but under US regulatory oversight. Futures like this have already taken over international crypto markets. In some cases, they account for over 90% of total crypto trading volume. But until now, Americans have had to go offshore to trade them. That workaround adds extra baggage—custody concerns, regulation issues, counterparty risk. Coinbase says this new product removes all that friction by offering a legal, domestic alternative with the same trading perks. The contracts are built with five-year expirations and will trade 24/7. They include a funding rate mechanism that keeps the futures prices synced with the spot market. Funding builds up every hour, then settles twice per day. At each settlement point, the funding collected is either credited or debited to the trader’s account based on their position. The goal, Coinbase says, is to offer the feel of spot trading while still giving access to leverage, capital-efficient trading, and regulated clearing. The contracts are small, so traders can size their positions with more precision. No need to overexpose just to get in the game. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-26T17:36:48,"What is a Crypto Exchange? A Beginner’s Guide to Trading Platforms","Cryptocurrencies have rapidly gained popularity over the past decade, evolving from a niche concept to a global phenomenon. As digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum become increasingly mainstream, more people are looking to participate in this exciting market. At the heart of this participation are crypto exchanges—platforms that serve as gateways for buying, selling, and trading digital currencies. Whether you’re interested in investing, trading, or simply exploring the world of crypto, understanding these exchanges is crucial. This guide is designed to help beginners navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges, providing a clear and straightforward explanation of what they are, how they work, and what features to look for when choosing the right platform. By the end of this guide, you’ll have the foundational knowledge needed to confidently engage with the cryptocurrency market. What is a Crypto Exchange? A crypto exchange is an online platform that facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. These exchanges act as intermediaries, matching buyers with sellers and enabling transactions in various digital currencies. Unlike traditional financial exchanges, which deal with stocks, bonds, or commodities, crypto exchanges exclusively handle digital assets. They offer users the ability to convert fiat currency (like USD or EUR) into cryptocurrency and vice versa, as well as trade one cryptocurrency for another. This makes them essential tools for anyone looking to participate in the cryptocurrency market. Types of Crypto Exchanges Crypto exchanges come in various forms, each offering unique features and catering to different user needs. Understanding the types of crypto exchanges is essential for choosing the right platform for your trading or investment goals. Centralized Exchanges (CEX) Centralized exchanges (CEX) are the most common type of crypto exchange, operated by a central authority or company. These platforms, such as Binance and Coinbase, act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, providing a user-friendly interface and robust security features. Users trust the exchange to manage their funds, which often includes fiat-to-crypto conversions and advanced trading tools. While CEX platforms are known for their ease of use and high liquidity, they come with drawbacks such as potential security risks due to centralization and the need to comply with regulatory requirements, which may limit privacy. Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) In contrast, decentralized exchanges (DEX) operate without a central authority, relying on blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peecr transactions . Platforms like Uniswap and PancakeSwap allow users to trade directly from their wallets, ensuring greater privacy and control over their assets. DEX platforms eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing the risk of hacks and censorship. However, they often lack the liquidity and user-friendliness of centralized exchanges, making them more challenging for beginners to navigate. Hybrid Exchanges Bridging the gap between CEX and DEX platforms, hybrid exchanges combine the benefits of both. These exchanges offer the security and decentralization of DEX platforms while maintaining the liquidity and user experience of CEX platforms. By integrating the strengths of both types, hybrid exchanges provide a balanced approach, catering to users seeking a secure yet accessible trading environment. Understanding these types of exchanges helps you choose the one that aligns best with your needs and trading preferences. How Crypto Exchanges Work Understanding how crypto exchanges operate is crucial for effectively navigating the platform and making informed decisions. Account Registration To start using a crypto exchange, the first step is account registration. This typically involves providing personal information, creating login credentials, and setting up security features like two-factor authentication (2FA). Most exchanges require compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations to prevent fraud and ensure legal compliance, meaning users must verify their identity before trading. Deposits and Withdrawals Once registered, users can deposit funds into their exchange account. This can be done using fiat currency or transferring cryptocurrency from an external crypto wallet. Understanding wallet addresses is key—these are unique identifiers used to send and receive crypto securely. When withdrawing funds, it’s important to double-check these addresses to avoid errors. Additionally, enabling security features, such as 2FA, is essential to safeguard your assets. Trading on a Crypto Exchange With funds in your account, you can start trading. Crypto exchanges offer various types of trading, including: spot trading; margin trading; futures. Spot trading involves buying or selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery, while margin trading allows users to trade with borrowed funds, increasing potential profits but also risks. Futures trading involves contracts to buy or sell assets at a future date. Understanding trading pairs—like BTC and ETH—and how to execute different orders, such as market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders, is crucial for managing your trades effectively. Key Features to Look for in a Crypto Exchange Choosing the right crypto exchange involves evaluating several key features that can significantly impact your trading experience. Security Measures Security is paramount when selecting a crypto exchange. Essential features include two-factor authentication (2FA), cold storage for storing assets offline, and encryption to protect sensitive data. These measures help safeguard your funds and personal information from potential threats. User Interface and Experience A user-friendly interface is crucial, especially for beginners. A well-designed platform should be intuitive, easy to navigate, and provide clear access to trading tools and account management features. This ensures a smooth and efficient trading experience. Fees and Charges Understanding the fee structure of an exchange is vital. This includes trading fees, withdrawal fees, and deposit fees. Fees can vary widely between exchanges, so it’s important to compare them to find the most cost-effective option for your needs. Liquidity Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. High liquidity on an exchange means quicker transactions and more stable prices, which is essential for active traders. Customer Support Reliable customer support can make a significant difference, particularly in resolving issues quickly. Look for exchanges that offer responsive and helpful support through multiple channels, such as live chat, email, or phone. Supported Cryptocurrencies Before choosing an exchange, check the list of supported cryptocurrencies to ensure it offers the assets you want to trade. Additionally, consider emerging new crypto exchanges that may provide unique or niche cryptocurrencies not available on more established platforms. Pros and Cons of Using Crypto Exchanges Using crypto exchanges offers numerous benefits, but it also comes with potential risks. Here’s a breakdown of the main advantages and disadvantages: Advantages Accessibility and Convenience: Crypto exchanges provide a user-friendly platform for trading digital assets, making it easy for users to buy, sell, and manage their cryptocurrencies from anywhere. Wide Range of Cryptocurrencies and Trading Options: Exchanges offer access to a diverse selection of cryptocurrencies and various trading pairs, catering to different investment strategies and preferences. Potential for Profit: Engaging in crypto trading can offer significant profit opportunities, especially with price fluctuations and market trends. AI-Powered Cryptocurrencies: Advanced AI-powered cryptocurrencies can enhance trading strategies by utilizing predictive analytics and automated decision-making, offering more sophisticated trading opportunities. Disadvantages Security Risks: Centralized exchanges are susceptible to security breaches and hacks, which can lead to significant financial losses and compromised personal information. High Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, which can result in substantial financial losses due to sudden price swings. Regulatory Concerns: Regulatory issues can impact exchanges and users, including potential legal implications and compliance requirements that vary by jurisdiction. How to Choose the Right Crypto Exchange for You Assessing Your Trading Needs Before selecting an exchange, consider your investment goals. Determine whether you’re interested in long-term investment strategies or more active trading. Your objectives will influence which exchange features are most important to you. Researching Exchange Reputation Thoroughly investigate the reputation of potential exchanges. Read user reviews and consider industry recognition. Pay attention to factors such as security history, customer support quality, and overall user satisfaction. A well-regarded exchange is crucial for a positive trading experience. Testing the Platform Once you’ve narrowed down your options, test the exchange with a small investment. This allows you to evaluate the platform’s functionality, user interface, and trading process without significant financial risk. Use this opportunity to ensure the exchange meets your needs before committing larger sums. Conclusion Crypto exchanges are essential platforms for anyone venturing into the world of digital assets. By understanding the types of exchanges, their features, and the pros and cons of using them, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your trading goals and risk tolerance. As you begin your cryptocurrency journey, remember to prioritize security, research thoroughly, and start small. The crypto market offers exciting opportunities but comes with risks. Approach it with knowledge and caution, and stay informed about new developments like AI-powered cryptocurrencies. Choosing the right exchange is a crucial step in your crypto journey. With the right platform and a clear strategy, you’ll be well-equipped to navigate this dynamic and potentially rewarding financial landscape.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/what-is-a-crypto-exchange-a-beginners-guide-to-trading-platforms/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Crypto News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T17:32:07,"Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Footsteps in India, Home to 1.5 Billion People – Here’s Everything We Know","Pradeep Bhandari, the national spokesperson of India’s ruling party, has called for the launch of a Bitcoin reserve pilot program, arguing that the country needs to make a strategic move towards Bitcoin. According to Bhandari, the US's establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and Bhutan's national mining initiatives present a significant window of opportunity for India. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, launched under the administration of US President Donald Trump in January 2025, brought digital assets to the global economic agenda. The reserve, which reached over $20 billion as of June 2025, shows that Bitcoin is increasingly positioned as a store of value. Within the scope of the reserve, the US evaluates the approximately 200,000 BTC seized as a buffer against inflation. At the Crypto Summit held at the White House last month, it was announced that Bitcoin purchases would continue with budget-friendly methods to expand this reserve. Three states have already enacted laws allowing Bitcoin purchases with public funds. These developments reveal that Bitcoin has begun to be evaluated as a financial resistance tool.

Bhutan, which has been mining Bitcoin with hydroelectric resources since 2021, has accumulated a reserve of over $1 billion as of May 2025. This reserve helps the country finance public services and contributes to its sustainable development goals. India is far ahead of Bhutan in terms of renewable energy capacity and has the potential to implement a similar mining model at scale, but regulatory infrastructure and institutional readiness remain a challenge. India is currently among the countries that tax cryptocurrencies but do not regulate them clearly. India, which led the crypto working group established under the leadership of the IMF during its 2023 G20 presidency, has played an important role in the formation of global standards, but is cautious about domestic regulations. The classification of Bitcoin as a capital asset by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) further strengthens the need for a clear legal framework in India. Regulations will both boost investor confidence and pave the way for institutional adoption. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-26T17:30:52,"Bitcoin Treasury Capital Unveils Bold $7M BTC Purchase for Long-Term Strategy","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Capital Unveils Bold $7M BTC Purchase for Long-Term Strategy The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news that further solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset for corporate balance sheets. In a significant move, Swedish-listed firm Bitcoin Treasury Capital has announced a substantial purchase, signaling a growing trend of institutional players embracing the digital gold. Bitcoin Treasury Capital: A Bold New Era of Corporate Strategy Unveiled In an exciting development shared via their official X account, Bitcoin Treasury Capital has officially embarked on what they term a “long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy.” This strategic initiative kicked off with the acquisition of 66 Bitcoin (BTC). The total value of this BTC purchase stands at approximately $7 million USD, or 66 million Swedish kronor (SEK), with an average price per coin around $105,270. This initial investment marks a clear commitment from the Swedish firm to integrate digital assets into its core financial planning, setting a precedent for others in the European market. What exactly does a “long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy” entail? It typically involves a company holding Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, similar to how traditional companies might hold cash, gold, or bonds. The rationale often includes: Inflation Hedge: Protecting capital against the eroding effects of fiat currency inflation. Potential for Appreciation: Believing in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential for significant returns. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to the corporate balance sheet to reduce overall portfolio risk. Why This BTC Purchase Matters for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The decision by Bitcoin Treasury Capital is more than just a single transaction; it’s a powerful statement in the ongoing narrative of institutional Bitcoin adoption . For years, Bitcoin was primarily seen as a retail investment or a speculative asset. However, the landscape has dramatically shifted. Major corporations, investment funds, and even sovereign nations are now exploring or actively engaging with Bitcoin. This growing trend underscores a maturing market and increasing confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. Consider the impact of other companies that have adopted similar strategies: MicroStrategy: Perhaps the most vocal advocate, MicroStrategy has amassed a significant amount of Bitcoin, turning its corporate strategy into a de facto Bitcoin holding company. Their commitment has often influenced market sentiment. Tesla: While their holdings have fluctuated, Tesla’s initial purchase brought immense mainstream attention to corporate Bitcoin holdings. These examples illustrate that holding Bitcoin is no longer a fringe idea but a legitimate consideration for forward-thinking companies. The move by Bitcoin Treasury Capital adds another reputable name to this growing list, particularly from the European financial sector. Navigating the Bitcoin Strategy Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities While the prospects of a robust Bitcoin strategy are appealing, companies embarking on this journey must also contend with various challenges. The volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market is often cited as a primary concern. Bitcoin’s price can experience significant swings, which can impact a company’s financial statements and investor perception. Other challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential risks related to compliance and future policy changes. Security Concerns: Safeguarding large sums of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks or theft. This often involves partnering with specialized custodians. Accounting and Reporting: Integrating Bitcoin into traditional accounting frameworks can be complex, requiring careful consideration of how to value and report these digital assets. Despite these hurdles, the opportunities presented by a well-executed Bitcoin strategy are compelling. Companies that strategically allocate capital to Bitcoin may position themselves for substantial long-term growth, tap into new investor bases, and demonstrate innovation in their treasury management practices. The potential for Bitcoin to act as a hedge against global economic instability or as a store of value continues to attract corporate interest. What Does This Mean for Your Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? The strategic move by Bitcoin Treasury Capital offers valuable insights for other corporations contemplating or expanding their corporate Bitcoin holdings . It highlights the importance of a clear, long-term vision rather than short-term speculation. Before making such a significant investment, companies should conduct thorough due diligence, which includes: Risk Assessment: Understanding and mitigating the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency volatility and security. Custodial Solutions: Exploring reputable third-party custodians that offer institutional-grade security for digital assets. Legal and Tax Implications: Consulting with legal and tax experts to navigate the complex regulatory environment in their respective jurisdictions. Stakeholder Communication: Clearly articulating the rationale and strategy to investors, employees, and the public to ensure transparency and build confidence. This strategic step by a Swedish-listed firm serves as a powerful example of how traditional businesses are adapting to the digital asset revolution. It underscores a growing conviction that Bitcoin is not just a passing trend but a fundamental shift in how value is stored and managed globally. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Bitcoin Treasury Capital ‘s decisive $7 million investment in Bitcoin marks a significant milestone, not just for the company itself, but for the broader acceptance of digital assets within corporate finance. This bold move signals a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. As more institutions follow suit, the landscape of global treasury management is set to evolve, with Bitcoin increasingly taking center stage. This development reinforces the idea that strategic corporate Bitcoin holdings are becoming an essential component of a forward-thinking financial strategy.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin’s path to $150k in 2025 could ignite a 20x rally in altcoins under $10, fueled by halving hype and institutional flow. Table of Contents Why $150,000 Bitcoin is no longer a fantasy Altcoin surge: Why coins under $10 could 20x Little Pepe: Memecoin with real Infrastructure Render: Infrastructure for AI and metaverse growth Injective Protocol: Scalable DeFi layer-1 Sui: High-speed layer-1 with object-oriented architecture VeChain: Enterprise blockchain for supply chain and RWAs Conclusion: The time for strategic exposure is now Bitcoin’s potential surge to $150,000 in 2025 could spark significant gains in low-priced altcoins under $10, driven by rising investor sentiment, small market caps, and untapped narratives, particularly following the 2024 halving and growing institutional interest. Below, we explore why a six-figure BTC is plausible and highlight eight altcoins under $10 that could potentially return 20x or more in such a scenario. Why $150,000 Bitcoin is no longer a fantasy There are a few things that support the bullish thesis: Post-Halving Supply Shock: The 2024 Bitcoin halving cut new supply by half. Because of tightening supply dynamics, this has led to a 12–18-month rally in the past. Spot ETFs and Institutional Capital: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has given institutions more exposure than ever before. Companies like BlackRock and Fidelity are making it easy to invest in BTC, and a significant amount of money is still flowing into the market. Global Macro Trends: As central banks move toward looser monetary policy, risk-on assets like BTC are again appealing. This situation sets the stage for Bitcoin to aim for $150,000, potentially marking the start of one of the best altcoin seasons ever. You might also like: This memecoin priced under $0.0015 can surpass ADA’s market cap Altcoin surge: Why coins under $10 could 20x In bull markets, low-cost altcoins have three main advantages: Coins under $10 with smaller market caps need less capital to surge, making them attractive and psychologically appealing to retail investors. Strong Narratives: Tokens linked to popular areas, such as AI, gaming, DeFi, or Layer-2 solutions, can perform better when the market turns bullish. Let’s explore eight tokens under $10 that could deliver 20x returns if Bitcoin (BTC) reaches $150,000. Little Pepe: Memecoin with real Infrastructure Little Pepe, currently priced at $0.0012 in Stage 3 of its presale, is one of the market’s most technically ambitious memecoins today. Unlike traditional memecoins that rely solely on community hype, LILPEPE is backed by real infrastructure — its own Layer 2 blockchain, designed exclusively for memecoin launches. With ultra-low fees, sniper bot resistance, zero-tax trading, and lightning-fast transactions, the project delivers both meme culture and high performance. Led by anonymous developers with a track record of success in top memecoin cycles, LILPEPE is gaining serious traction. As of now, 1,664,536,298 tokens have been sold out of the 2.25 billion allocated for Stage 3, representing 73.98% progress. The team has already raised $1,822,444 out of a $2,525,000 target. The price will soon rise to $0.0013 in the next stage, ahead of the final presale price of $0.0028. In addition to its technical edge, LILPEPE is running a $777,000 giveaway campaign, where 10 lucky winners will each receive $77,000 worth of tokens. The token is confirmed for listings on two major centralized exchanges at launch, with hints of a future debut on the world’s largest exchange. Although the final listing price is yet to be disclosed, analysts speculate an initial range between $0.0035 and $0.0055. Based on the current presale price, a return of 20x or more is plausible if LILPEPE reaches its $1 billion market cap target, highlighting the asymmetric upside potential for early adopters. Render: Infrastructure for AI and metaverse growth Render is trading at approximately $2.87 and sits at the crossroads of several explosive sectors, including artificial intelligence, virtual production, and the metaverse. RNDR’s decentralized rendering network connects creators to idle GPU resources, solving a major bottleneck in digital content creation. As AI and web3 content generation scale, Render’s unique offering could gain serious traction. A 20x surge would place RNDR around $57, reflecting the explosive growth in GPU demand. Injective Protocol: Scalable DeFi layer-1 Injective (INJ) currently trades at $9.88 and has positioned itself as a powerhouse for building high-performance DeFi applications, especially derivatives. Its Layer-1 architecture features fast finality, interoperates with other chains, and enables trading without gas fees. INJ could grow rapidly as decentralized finance evolves with new applications and more institutions adopt it. A 20x price move would bring it to nearly $200, in line with previous DeFi breakouts from smaller valuations. Sui: High-speed layer-1 with object-oriented architecture Sui, priced at $2.51, is a relatively new entrant quickly gaining attention due to its unique object-based storage and programming model. Built using the Move language, initially developed by Facebook’s Libra team, SUI enables parallel transaction execution for massive scalability. It’s attracting developers who are building advanced dApps in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Should its ecosystem continue expanding and Bitcoin catalyze another L1 narrative, SUI reaching $50 is well within the realm of possibility. VeChain: Enterprise blockchain for supply chain and RWAs VeChain is priced at a modest $0.019 but offers strong fundamentals with an enterprise-first approach. VET’s blockchain is being utilized for logistics, anti-counterfeiting, and carbon tracking across various industries. As the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) becomes a major trend in the crypto world, VeChain’s partnerships with companies like Walmart China and BMW may provide the credibility and utility needed for a breakout. A 20x rally would bring VET close to $0.40, which is still a reasonable price, considering its historical price. Conclusion: The time for strategic exposure is now It’s now more possible than ever for Bitcoin to reach $150,000 because of lower supply, growing institutional demand, and better overall economic conditions. If this happens, altcoins that cost less than $10 could see huge gains. A mix of infrastructure tokens, such as Injective and Render, as well as speculative plays like Little Pepe and Dogecoin, could provide the most exposure to various sectors. XRP and ADA provide regulatory and academic strength, respectively, while SUI and VeChain highlight novel and enterprise-level use cases.

According to a June 26 article titled “US Bitcoin Reserve signals a shift: An opening for India,” BJP national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari called for India to consider launching a Bitcoin reserve pilot. “Three US states have now passed legislation authorising the deployment of public funds to purchase and hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset, with more expected to follow. These measures reflect a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential to bolster fiscal resilience and serve as a hedge in uncertain economic conditions,” Bhandri wrote. He argued that creating a national Bitcoin reserve would align India with emerging global trends and also strengthen its economic resilience. In his article, Bhandari drew attention to Bitcoin’s properties as a decentralized asset with fixed supply, high liquidity, and transparency, and even called it “digital gold” while stressing that it could act as a hedge in uncertain economic environments. “The IMF’s recent classification of Bitcoin as a capital asset further sharpens the need for direction. Clear regulation could bring both transparency and the required oversight to this emerging asset class—enabling responsible innovation while protecting a rising investor class,” he noted. Further, Bhandari pointed to Bhutan’s Bitcoin strategy, which uses hydropower to mine and accumulate digital assets. Since 2021, Bhutan has built a reserve exceeding $1 billion, which now supports public services and long-term sustainability goals. Drawing a parallel, he noted that India’s expanding renewable energy infrastructure positions it well to pursue a similar sovereign Bitcoin strategy aligned with its national interests. According to him, these initiatives would not be a “reckless pivot” but rather a “calculated step” toward embracing the legitimacy of digital assets. Regulatory clarity is key Bhandari also touched upon India’s heavily taxed, yet unregulated crypto market. Despite lacking a formal regulatory framework, cryptocurrency trading in India is taxed under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act at a flat 30%, along with a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on all transactions above ₹10,000. Meanwhile, a long-promised policy discussion paper, initially expected after India’s G20 presidency, has faced repeated delays. Officials say it’s being “recalibrated” in light of global shifts, but no timeline has been set. Bhandari criticised this one-sided approach, calling for regulatory clarity that he believes is essential to “unlock” India’s full potential in the digital asset space. He recalled that during India’s G20 presidency in 2023, the government played a key role in coordinating a crypto-focused working group with the International Monetary Fund. Yet, while India awaits a broader consensus, Bhandari warned that others are not standing still. “While [India’s] recommendations will take their due course, we are seeing other jurisdictions, including Russia, China, and Brazil from the BRICS, and other G20 nations led by the US, race ahead—not pausing for consensus.” Bhandari concluded by urging policymakers to act decisively, arguing that delay could cost India both strategic and economic ground. “India stands at a pivotal juncture. A measured Bitcoin strategy—perhaps a reserve pilot—could strengthen economic resilience and project modernity,” Bhandari wrote, adding that India should consider this as a “unique opportunity to lead.” The post India's ruling party spokesperson urges pilot for national Bitcoin reserve appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/26/indias-ruling-party-spokesperson-urges-pilot-for-national-bitcoin-reserve/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","Crypto|Crypto regulation|India|USA",cryptocompare

The analyst, Master Ananda, sees a possible case scenario where the asset drops below the $100,000 price mark. In a post shared on Tradingview, the analyst asserts that the rising bearish sentiments will only be validated if the asset breaks below the $100,000 support level. He explained that the bear trend would have fully kicked in at this point, and Bitcoin could continue in a downward trend. The analyst sees the asset going down to $88,888 and potentially trading at $82,500 if the bears remain in control. An excerpt of his post reads; “Bitcoin being bearish is only true if the $100,000 support level breaks. If it breaks expect the market to dive down, deep and fast and reach around $82,500 or $88,888. But this is only if the support breaks.” On the flip side, the analyst explains that Bitcoin may continue on an upward trajectory and possibly attain a higher price level if support holds. Should selling pressure soar, “the flush is likely to be super fast and strong, which means that you will still get higher prices in the coming weeks,” he added. This means that the long-term outlook is still bullish, although the bears could take control for a brief period, according to the analyst. He observed that the bearish pressure has resulted in the liquidation of long positions, but maintains optimism about Bitcoin’s ability to bounce back. “It will be nice to see how it all develops, but it shouldn’t take more than two weeks. We are likely in the clear in a matter of days (2-3 days). Do not be afraid if the market shakes, Bitcoin is going up; Crypto will grow, regardless of the short-term.” He concluded.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/analyst-sees-bitcoin-crashing-to-80000-during-this-period/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

According to Adler, it is a striking pattern for long-term investors (LTH) to increase their positions before every major rise in Bitcoin. Adler stated that this situation was first observed at $ 28,000 levels. He stated that with the increase in the LTH rate compared to short-term investors (STH), Bitcoin rose to $ 60,000 after an accumulation period of approximately 1-2 months.

2025-06-26T16:50:19,"Semler Scientific: Unlocking a New Era of Bitcoin Purchases","BitcoinWorld Semler Scientific: Unlocking a New Era of Bitcoin Purchases The world of corporate finance is abuzz with news that Semler Scientific, a company primarily known for its medical technology, is now trading at a significant premium relative to its substantial Bitcoin holdings . This development marks a pivotal moment, signaling a potential resumption of aggressive BTC purchases and underscoring the growing confidence in their unique corporate Bitcoin strategy . What’s Driving Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin Premium? For the first time in three weeks, Semler Scientific ‘s stock has surged, trading at a premium to the value of its Bitcoin reserves. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a strong indicator of investor confidence. According to CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten, the company’s multiple net asset value (mNAV) currently stands at an impressive 1.149. To put it simply, Semler’s market capitalization of $550 million now significantly exceeds its $477.8 million in Bitcoin holdings. But what exactly does ‘trading at a premium’ mean in this context? It means that investors are willing to pay more for Semler Scientific’s stock than the sum of its underlying assets, particularly its Bitcoin. This suggests that the market sees value beyond just the raw Bitcoin held on the balance sheet. Investors might be factoring in: Management’s Strategic Acumen: Belief in Semler’s leadership to effectively manage and grow their Bitcoin treasury. Future Bitcoin Appreciation: Anticipation that Bitcoin itself will continue to appreciate, thereby increasing the value of Semler’s holdings. Ease of Access: For some investors, buying Semler stock is an easier way to gain exposure to Bitcoin compared to direct cryptocurrency purchases. Innovation Premium: Acknowledgment of Semler’s bold move to embrace Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, setting a precedent in the medical technology sector. This shift from previously trading at a discount to now commanding a premium highlights a significant positive sentiment change around Semler’s financial strategy. The Strategic Accumulation of Bitcoin Holdings: A Growing Trend? Bitcoin holdings by public companies are becoming an increasingly significant trend, and Semler Scientific is at the forefront of this movement. While MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, companies like Semler are demonstrating that this isn’t just a niche strategy for tech giants. Semler’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset and a strategic investment reflects a broader shift in how companies view their balance sheets. Why are more companies looking to accumulate Bitcoin? Inflation Hedge: In an era of rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a digital gold, offering a hedge against currency debasement. Store of Value: Its decentralized nature and finite supply make it an attractive long-term store of value. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury assets beyond traditional fiat currencies and bonds. Innovation and Investor Appeal: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a forward-thinking approach, potentially attracting a new class of investors interested in digital assets. Semler’s current holding of 4,449 BTC, valued at $477.8 million, places it among the top publicly traded companies by Bitcoin reserves. This substantial holding isn’t just a static asset; it’s a dynamic part of their financial planning, constantly evaluated against market conditions and strategic goals. Decoding the Premium Trading Phenomenon: Why is it a Game-Changer? The fact that Semler Scientific is now experiencing premium trading relative to its Bitcoin assets is a profound development. Historically, companies that held significant amounts of volatile assets like Bitcoin sometimes traded at a discount, as investors priced in the perceived risk. The current premium signifies a fundamental shift in market perception. This premium suggests that investors are not just tolerating Semler’s Bitcoin strategy; they are actively rewarding it. It implies that the market believes Semler’s management can: Generate Value: Effectively leverage their Bitcoin holdings to create more value for shareholders than simply the sum of the parts. Mitigate Risk: Navigate the volatility of the crypto market more skillfully than the average investor might on their own. Execute Future Strategy: Successfully achieve their stated goals, such as reaching their ambitious 10,000 BTC target. This premium serves as a powerful validation of Semler’s pioneering approach, potentially encouraging other companies to consider similar strategies. It moves Bitcoin from being a speculative asset on a company’s books to a core, value-generating component of its financial identity. Will Semler Resume Aggressive BTC Purchases to Hit its Target? The million-dollar question on everyone’s mind is: will Semler Scientific resume aggressive BTC purchases ? The signs certainly point in that direction. Semler has publicly stated its ambitious goal of reaching 10,000 BTC by the end of the year. With current holdings at 4,449 BTC, they are still significantly short of this target, needing to acquire an additional 5,551 BTC. The company’s market cap now exceeding its Bitcoin holdings is a critical trigger. When a company’s stock trades at a discount to its Bitcoin assets, it might be hesitant to buy more, as it essentially means buying Bitcoin at a higher price than the market values its existing holdings. However, trading at a premium reverses this dynamic. It suggests that every dollar invested in Bitcoin by Semler is now perceived by the market as adding more than a dollar of value to the company’s stock. This positive feedback loop creates a strong incentive for Semler to continue its acquisition strategy. Renewed large-scale purchases by a publicly traded company could have several implications: Market Impact: Significant purchases could provide upward price pressure on Bitcoin, especially if done in substantial blocks. Investor Confidence: It would reinforce Semler’s commitment to its Bitcoin strategy, potentially attracting more investors. Precedent Setting: Further validates Bitcoin as a viable corporate treasury asset for companies outside the tech sector. The path to 10,000 BTC will be closely watched by both traditional finance and crypto enthusiasts alike. Crafting a Resilient Corporate Bitcoin Strategy: Lessons from Semler Corporate Bitcoin strategy is no longer a fringe concept; it’s a sophisticated financial decision being adopted by an increasing number of forward-thinking companies. Semler Scientific’s journey offers valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of integrating Bitcoin into a company’s treasury. Their success in achieving a premium valuation underscores the potential rewards for a well-executed strategy. Benefits of a Strong Corporate Bitcoin Strategy: Capital Appreciation Potential: Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests significant long-term growth potential. Inflation Hedging: A robust defense against the eroding purchasing power of fiat currencies. Diversification of Assets: Reduces reliance on traditional financial instruments and their associated risks. Enhanced Investor Appeal: Attracts a new demographic of investors keen on digital asset exposure. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations require robust risk management protocols. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies can present uncertainties. Accounting and Reporting: Complexities in how Bitcoin holdings are valued and reported on financial statements. Security: Safeguarding significant digital assets requires specialized cybersecurity measures. Semler’s experience suggests that transparency, clear communication of strategy, and consistent execution are key to gaining investor trust and achieving positive market reception for such a bold move. Their commitment to a specific Bitcoin target demonstrates a long-term vision rather than short-term speculation. What This Means for You, The Investor For investors, Semler Scientific’s current position offers a unique perspective. If you’re interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency, companies like Semler provide an indirect route. Their stock performance becomes intertwined with Bitcoin’s, offering a leveraged play on the digital asset’s future. It’s an opportunity to invest in a company that has strategically positioned itself at the intersection of traditional business and the burgeoning digital economy. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in a company like Semler involves both the risks associated with its core business (medical technology) and the volatility of Bitcoin. Due diligence is always paramount. This development also serves as a strong signal for the broader market: institutional adoption of Bitcoin is not just continuing; it’s maturing and gaining significant validation from investors. A Bold Future for Corporate Treasury Semler Scientific’s journey into substantial Bitcoin holdings and its current premium trading status marks a significant milestone in the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance. Their ambitious target of 10,000 BTC by year-end, coupled with the current market dynamics, strongly suggests that we could soon see a fresh wave of BTC purchases from the company. This isn’t just about Semler; it’s a testament to the evolving perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate, value-adding asset for corporate treasuries. As more companies observe Semler’s success, we may well witness a broader paradigm shift in how businesses manage their capital in the digital age.

2025-06-26T16:45:11,"Bitwise files amended S-1s for its spot Dogecoin ETF and Aptos ETFs","Bitwise Asset Management has filed an amended S-1 registration statement for its proposed spot Dogecoin and Aptos exchange-traded funds with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The updated filings were submitted on Thursday, exactly two weeks after the regulator postponed its review of the Dogecoin ETF. According to Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the revised filings are a positive development. “ Good signs as it indicates SEC engagement, and tracks with other spot approvals ,” Balchunas wrote on X. Bitwise had originally filed for the Dogecoin ETF in January and followed with the Aptos ETF application in March. The San Francisco-based asset manager already has other crypto ETF offerings like the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and several other applications pending, including one for an XRP-focused fund. Bitwise DOGE and Aptos ETF filings amended Bitwise’s initial DOGE S-1 filing showed that it was requesting the registration of its ETF under the Securities Act of 1933, also known as the ’33 Act. This differs from earlier applications by firms Rex Shares and Osprey Funds, which used the Investment Company Act of 1940 framework. The ’40 Act has more profound investor protections, including stricter governance requirements, but the ’33 Act is used for commodity-based and physically-backed ETFs. The approach may give Bitwise flexibility in structuring these funds, although it also subjects them to a different regulatory lens. Meanwhile, Bitwise’s Aptos ETF, if approved, would become the first US-based fund focused solely on APT, the native token of the Aptos blockchain. The firm registered a Delaware trust for the Aptos ETF on February 28 and filed the corresponding S-1 with the SEC on March 5. The fund does not propose a staking mechanism, even though Aptos is a proof-of-stake blockchain. The firm will also need to submit a 19b-4 form to trigger the SEC’s official review window. Once the SEC acknowledges the filing, a 240-day countdown begins for the agency to issue a final decision. ‘In-kind’ creation is an addition to the Dogecoin ETF filing One update in Bitwise’s amended Dogecoin ETF filing is the inclusion of in-kind creations and redemptions. This could allow authorized participants to deliver or receive Dogecoin directly rather than converting to or from cash. The initial January filing lacked this provision. In-kind transactions are favored for reducing slippage and improving tax efficiency, and their inclusion is seen as a regulatory necessity for future spot crypto ETFs. Coinbase Custody will serve as the custodian for the Dogecoin ETF as well. However, the SEC has yet to approve the fund , having extended its review period on June 12 to assess concerns over market risks and investor protection. The Dogecoin ETF was initially filed on March 3 and opened to public comment shortly after. On Wednesday, asset manager IDX filed for a hybrid ETF offering exposure to both gold and Bitcoin. The proposed fund will not hold physical assets but will instead invest through a mix of futures, options, swaps, and other exchange-traded products. Per the SEC’s prospectus , the fund will operate via a Cayman Islands subsidiary and comply with US tax laws on a 1.25x leveraged exposure.
