2025-06-26T08:56:47,"New Document: XRP Supply Shock Will Happen Before Bitcoin","Researcher SMQKE recently posted a tweet asserting that XRP is on track to experience a supply shock before Bitcoin. The statement draws directly from a report by WisdomTree, which analyzes the differing supply dynamics between the two cryptocurrencies. According to the report, Bitcoin is expected to reach its maximum supply of 21 million units around the year 2140, while XRP is projected to reach its full circulating supply within the next few years. The tweet emphasized this contrast, highlighting XRP’s shorter issuance timeline as a potential catalyst for a supply shock. SMQKE shared WisdomTree’s data to substantiate the claim, and the tweet included a snapshot from the report, which stated that XRP will soon hit its maximum supply, after which deflationary pressure from burned transaction fees will become the primary factor influencing its supply trajectory. THERE WILL BE A SUPPLY SHOCK FOR XRP BEFORE BITCOIN “Bitcoin should reach its max supply of 21 million units in approximately 2140, and XRP should reach its max supply IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.” This is documented below. pic.twitter.com/tLK4zELzU4 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 23, 2025 Different Supply Models for XRP and Bitcoin The WisdomTree article explained that XRP transaction fees are systematically burned, contributing to a steady decrease in the overall supply over time. Since its inception, about 12 million XRP units have already been burned. In addition, XRP’s release from Ripple-managed escrow accounts is a structured process that will conclude once the 55 billion initially escrowed tokens are fully distributed. This predictable release is intended to provide transparency and consistency in supply. Once the scheduled releases are complete, new XRP issuance will effectively cease, and any future reduction in circulating supply will stem solely from transaction-related burns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions Highlight Key Variables SMQKE’s tweet prompted remarks from other users on X. One user, Tell, noted that the onset of a supply shock would depend on several key factors, including actual adoption levels, investor sentiment, and Ripple’s management of its remaining escrow. Tell argued that a true shock in supply would only materialize if Ripple tightens distribution while demand increases. In such a case, constrained availability could exert upward pressure on the price. Another user, PhantomPatriot, commented on the extended timeframe associated with Bitcoin’s supply cap, expressing frustration over the 2140 projection. The user added that they hoped XRP would realize its supply-related milestones in a much shorter period, implicitly aligning with SMQKE’s view that XRP’s supply trajectory is more immediately relevant to market dynamics. XRP’s Scarcity-Driven Outlook The WisdomTree report emphasized that XRP has a low correlation with Bitcoin and Ether, which may enhance its value in a diversified portfolio. It also identified XRP and Bitcoin as scarce assets but with fundamentally different issuance schedules. While Bitcoin follows a fixed halving cycle leading to eventual maximum supply over more than a century, XRP’s path to max supply is accelerated by design and transaction economics. Once XRP reaches its cap in the coming years, the total number of tokens in circulation is expected to decline gradually, given the continued burning of small amounts per transaction. If user adoption increases or remains steady, and no new supply is introduced, this could lead to a reduction in available tokens, potentially contributing to price appreciation through scarcity effects. SMQKE’s tweet highlights a documented forecast that XRP will experience a significant shift in its supply model well before Bitcoin . This shift, combined with deflationary mechanisms, could position XRP for a market reaction tied to scarcity.

Plaintiff Michael Zidell, who filed the complaint on June 24, is seeking compensatory damages and legal costs. Zidell alleges the bank failed to detect and act on suspicious wire transfers linked to the scam, which led to substantial financial loss. Zidell claims he was targeted in a fraudulent investment scheme commonly known as “pig butchering,” in which scammers form fake online relationships with victims to lure them into fraudulent investments. Zidell was allegedly contacted in January 2023 on Facebook by a woman identifying herself as Carolyn Parker, who claimed to be a business owner in California. Their communication continued over video and text on the WeChat app, eventually developing into what Zidell perceived to be a romantic relationship. By February 2023, Parker encouraged Zidell to invest in non-fungible tokens through a platform called OpenrarityPro.com. She claimed to have earned millions and presented what appeared to be account statements as proof. You might also like: From ‘I love you’ to ‘you’re broke’: AMLBot reveals the dark side of crypto romance scams Zidell then began transferring funds to various bank accounts provided through the website, allegedly as part of the NFT investment. Zidell made a total of 43 transfers across multiple banks, with twelve of those transactions, amounting to nearly $4 million, sent to accounts held at Citibank under the name Guju Inc. According to the filing, the first wire transfer to Guju Inc. alone exceeded the entity’s stated annual revenue and contradicted its account opening documents, which projected monthly wire transfers below $250,000. The suit alleges that Citibank failed to act on numerous red flags, including large, round-sum transfers inconsistent with the account holder’s declared business activity. Per the plaintiff, the bank disregarded its obligations under federal Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering laws by failing to investigate Guju Inc.’s activity despite clear indicators of suspicious behavior. Pig butchering scams have become a major concern for both federal authorities and crypto industry participants. In its 2024 Internet Crime Report, the FBI revealed that pig butchering scams were among the most damaging crypto-related crimes, which led to $5.8 billion in investment fraud losses reported last year. Older Americans were the most affected, with victims aged 60 and above losing $2.8 billion to crypto scams alone.

2025-06-26T08:42:57,"Crypto Regulations in Japan 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in Japan 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After years of unregulated crypto use, Japan became the first economy to formally recognize Bitcoin as a legal payment method through the Payment Services Act (PSA) 2017. As of 2025, Japan has developed one of the most comprehensive and proactive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency. Currently, Japan is actively working on classifying crypto assets as financial instruments, bringing them under stricter financial regulations by 2026. Crypto Regulations in Japan March 2025- Proposal for Reformation in Crypto Brokerage and Stabecoin Laws Japanese Cabinet Minister approved a proposal to reform the laws, allowing cryptocurrency companies to operate as an ‘intermediary business.’ The new bill provides flexibility to stablecoin issuers to back their tokens with various types of assets. Crypto brokerage will no longer be subject to financial regulations or anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Timeline of Major Crypto Regulations in Japan Date Law/ Regulation Key Provisions December 20, 2024 Crypto Tax Reformation Shifting from a progressive rate of 55% to a flat 20% tax June 1, 2023 Crypto Travel Rule Mandatory sender/ receiver info for crypto transfer May 1, 2020 PSA &FIEA Amendments New AML, cybersecurity, and security token regulation June 7, 2019 AML/ Custody Rules Stricter KYC, record keeping, and annual compliance report April 1, 2017 PSA Enforcement Regulating crypto with the Financial Services Agency (FSA) registration 2016 PSA and Fund Settlement Law Amendment Cryptocurrency is recognized as legal tender What is the Japanese Government’s Stance on Cryptocurrency in 2025? Currently, the government is proactively developing its regulatory framework to enhance security and facilitate the crypto market. Key focuses are: Japan’s Finance Minister, Katsunobu Kato, announced that Japan will review crypto tax by the end of June 2025; possibilities of a new tax regime indicated. The Democratic Party’s Web3 Project Team has put forward a proposal for crypto classification under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act ( FIEA ). The government aims to increase the cashless economy to 40% by 2025 with blockchain development . Japan aims to become a crypto leader with a focus on legal registration of crypto exchanges and platforms, market integrity, investor protection, and anti-money laundering. Crypto Tax in Japan 2025 Is crypto taxed in Japan? Yes, cryptocurrency is taxed as ‘miscellaneous income’ with a progressive income tax rate. There is no capital gains tax enacted yet in Japan. What falls under miscellaneous income? Selling crypto for fiat currency Exchange crypto for crypto Buying goods and services with crypto Gifting and payment in crypto Earning staking rewards from liquidity pools Receiving coins from forks Mining, Airdrops, DeFi, and Referral bonus On March 6, Japan proposed a crypto tax cut from a progressive rate of up to 55% to a flat 20% on crypto tax gains. However, the bill has not been passed yet to implement the tax reduction. FSA is expected to review this reclassification; if approved, it will likely take effect from 2026. Tax type Tax rate Note Income tax 5% to 45% Depends on the individual’s total income Additional inhabitant tax 10% Resulting in 15% to 55% tax rate Capital gains tax (CGT) Not specified yet Crypto as a financial product Reclassification of CGT 20% for stock profits Not enacted yet Crypt License in Japan Under the Payment Services Act (PSA), the Financial Services Agency (FSA) is the key body regulating mandatory crypto licenses. How to get a crypto license in Japan? Crypto exchanges and platforms are required to register with the FSA to provide crypto asset exchange services (CAES). Crypto companies need to establish a local entity, typically a Kabushiki Kaisha, a joint stock company. A minimum capital of over 10 million yen is required; other fees depend on the license and business model. A physical office in Japan is mandatory with a Japanese bank account. Experts are required to follow strict AM and CFT regulations. Crypto Adoption in Japan Penetration Rate: Japan has experienced a positive increase in crypto adoption rate, with current penetration projected to be 14.70% in 2025 and is expected to reach even higher, up to 15.26% by 2026. The number of crypto users in Japan is expected to increase up to 18.69 million by 2026. Crypto Revenue: Current revenue in the crypto market is expected to reach US$2.0 billion in 2025, with an anticipated growth rate of 3.44% resulting in a total amount of US$2.0 billion by 2026. Crypto Holdings: It is not publicly known whether the Japanese government holds any crypto assets; rather focuses on increasing the adoption rate with a modern regulatory framework. Conclusion In Japan, the government’s crypto holdings is not publicly known; however, public companies like Metaplanet are known to be one of the biggest crypto holders in Japan. The country has several new proposals in hand that are waiting for review and will likely take effect from 2026. As of 2025, Japan’s regulatory framework has reflected positive results with solid earnings and enhanced protection measures for investors.

2025-06-26T08:38:21,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Whale Just Snapped Up $422M ETH — Big News Coming?","The Ethereum price has risen to $2,491 this morning, with the altcoin continuing to repair the damage that followed US airstrikes against targets in Iran over the weekend. However, ETH remains down by 4% in a week and by 13% in the past fortnight, as the conflict in the Middle East – and the ongoing uncertainty over tariffs – continues to weigh down altcoin prices. But the recent actions of a whale – who has accumulated $422 million in ETH in the past three weeks – suggest that the coin’s fortunes may be about to change. It could therefore be in a prime position to make a sustained recovery very soon, and given its rock-solid fundamentals, the long-term Ethereum price prediction continues to look bullish. Ethereum Price Prediction: Whale Just Snapped Up $422M ETH — Big News Coming? Posting on X, investor Ted Pillows noted that one particular whale or institution purchased $8.91 million in Ethereum via Galaxy Digital yesterday, making for a total of $422 million amassed in less than a month. This whale/institution bought another $8,910,000 $ETH . They bought $422,000,000 $ETH in the past 3 weeks. pic.twitter.com/0gVlAcYpGW — Ted (@TedPillows) June 24, 2025 As weak as the Ethereum price has been in recent weeks and months, this is highly bullish news for ETH, suggesting that the smart money believes it will do very well in the medium- and long-term. In fact, as we’ve noted before, institutions have been buying lots of Ethereum, with this week’s CoinShares Digital Asset Funds Flow report showing that digital funds added $123 million in ETH to their coffers in the seven days to June 23. It’s possible that institutions are piling into Ethereum right now because of how oversold and undervalued the coin remains, given that it’s still 50% down from its ATH of $4,800 (set in November 2021). And because Ethereum remains the biggest layer-one network in the ecosystem (with a TVL of $61.7 billion ), it certainly seems credible to claim that it will rebound strongly soon. Looking at its chart today, we see that ETH is beginning to bounce from a weak position, with its RSI (purple) almost reaching 50 today. Source: TradingView Its moving average convergence divergence (blue, orange) has also bottomed out in recent days, another sign that we may be at the beginning of a growth period. This is certainly what the whales accumulating Ethereum currently believe, although whether they’re anticipating some big news is another question. It may simply be that Ethereum will continue expanding and evolving as a layer-one blockchain, with recent and upcoming upgrades making it more efficient as a platform. Based on this, we can expect to see the Ethereum price reach $3,000 by the end of July, and $3,500 by September. Deflationary Meme Coin Bitcoin Bull Raises $7.3 Million in Presale: Next 100x Token? For those traders wanting to look beyond major tokens such as Ethereum, there are numerous newer coins in the market that have been showing lots of potential recently. One of the most interesting of these is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL), a deflationary meme token that has now raised over $7.3 million in its soon-to-be-ending presale. 10 Days left. Clock's ticking. pic.twitter.com/pS1VGwCWJP — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 20, 2025 Its presale now has only 5 days left to run, with investors rushing to buy some BTCBULL early, before it lists on exchanges and potentially rallies. What’s exciting about Bitcoin Bull is that its deflationary tokenomics are linked to the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC). That is, with a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, it will host token burns whenever BTC adds another $25,000 to its price for the first time, starting from $125,000. It will also conduct airdrops of Bitcoin itself when BTC adds another $50,000, beginning from $150,000. This could make BTCBULL a hugely lucrative coin to hold, with the Ethereum-based token also open to staking. While its sale is very close to ending, investors can join it now by going to the Bitcoin Bull website and connecting a compatible wallet. It’s selling at its final presale price of $0.00258, although its growth suggests that it could rise well beyond this level once it goes on exchanges.

2025-06-26T08:35:30,"Bitcoin's hashrate recovers by 30% in one day","The Bitcoin network showed an anomalous move in the past weeks, as the hashrate slowed down to a six-month low. In the past day, mining capacity expanded suddenly, adding over 30% as miners came back online. The Bitcoin network hashrate is back near its all-time high, at over 1000 EH/s. Just a day ago, the network saw an outflow of mining capacity, with the total hashrate sinking to around 660 EH/s, a level not seen since the summer of 2024. Bitcoin mining recovered within a day, suggesting the recent outflow of hashrate may be due to a temporary facility shutdown. | Source: CoinWarz The recent drop in hashrate was also relatively steep, coinciding with the US strikes against Iran and subsequent retaliation. This led some commenters to believe part of the hashrate went offline as a result of preventive measures for regional data centers. The BTC hashrate recovery coincided with a price rally, driven by a mix of spot demand and risky derivative trading. BTC briefly returned above $108,000, later stepping back to the $107,000 range. According to available data, Iran is an active BTC miner, but only holds around 4% of the network’s hashrate at the peak. Currently, Iran has 0.12% of the network capacity, while the US remains the leader with over 37% of mining, often led by corporations and dedicated data centers. Hashrate driven down by heatwave? One of the explanations for the recent drop in mining capacity was a heatwave , specifically hitting parts of the USA. This led to the temporary shutdown of data centers due to the cost and complexity of cooling. Texas data centers, which are most affected by the heatwave, are already powerful and influential enough. The mining seasonality is already visible during previous cycles. Currently, the sharp hashrate drop in the short term may be linked to the creation of even larger mining facilities. BTC mining may also depend on hydroelectric power in different regions, where availability is slowing down during the summer season. Bitcoin mining is also often used to balance energy grids or excess production, leading to seemingly abrupt shutdowns. Not all of the mining capacity is immediately reported, and the hashrate levels may vary depending on data inclusion. As of June 2025, 13 countries lead the mining race. The profile of mining has switched to actively managed facilities, rented mining and big data centers, leading to more coordination in deciding to shut down capacity. Mining becomes easier after the June slowdown In June, the Bitcoin network difficulty already went down from its peak, making mining 9% easier. This gave a relief to miners, who are producing blocks at the highest price. Currently, the price to produce 1 BTC is estimated at around $98,000, giving miners a potential profit at the current price. The next difficulty adjustment is expected on June 29. The next difficulty, based on the slower mining for the last two weeks, may go down another 7.9% . Miners will also attempt to affect difficulty, as some pools have a habit of shutting down if their personal production costs become unfavorable.

This is the agency’s first enforcement action under the state’s 2023 Digital Financial Assets Law. The settlement also includes $51,700 in restitution to a senior citizen who fell victim to fraud. Similar incidents prompted global concern. In Australia, police uncovered widespread abuse of crypto ATMs in romance scams, with one widow losing close to $282,000. Authorities found many supposed criminals were actually victims being manipulated. Meanwhile, Spokane, Washington became the first city in the state to ban crypto ATMs entirely due to rising fraud, particularly in low-income areas. Regulators across the globe are now cracking down on cryptocurrency ATMs. Coinme Agrees to Pay $300K Fine Seattle-based cryptocurrency ATM operator Coinme agreed to pay a $300,000 penalty to California regulators for violating state laws governing digital financial assets. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) stated that Coinme breached transaction limits by allowing crypto ATM users to exceed the state’s $1,000 per-day cap per customer. The company also failed to include mandatory disclosures on receipts provided at its kiosks, which are located in grocery and convenience stores throughout California. This enforcement is the DFPI’s first action under the Digital Financial Assets Law , which came into effect in 2023. The legislation was designed to address consumer protection concerns related to crypto kiosks, especially as scams involving these machines have become increasingly common. As part of the consent order, Coinme will also pay $51,700 in restitution to an elderly customer who said they were scammed. Coinme crypto ATM DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni explained that the penalty serves as a warning to other digital asset operators that the state is very serious about enforcing compliance to protect consumers. The rise in crypto ATM-related scams has become a growing concern for regulators, as criminals often trick victims into purchasing digital assets at kiosks and sending them directly to fraudsters' wallets. The FBI reported close to 11,000 complaints related to these kinds of scams in 2024 alone, totaling over $246 million in losses. This was a 31% increase from the previous year, and seniors over 60 made up the majority of victims. Crypto ATM complaints for 2024 (Source: FBI ) Similar concerns are emerging globally. In Australia, federal police recently reached out to over 90 people as part of a crackdown on the misuse of crypto ATMs, including those affected by ”pig butchering” scams. In Texas, a sheriff physically dismantled a crypto ATM after a local family reportedly lost $25,000 in a scam. Crypto ATM Scam Targets Elderly in Australia After the Australian federal police contacted people as part of its ongoing crackdown on the criminal use of cryptocurrency ATMs, one case stood out. A 77-year-old widow lost 433,000 Australian dollars, or approximately $281,947, in an elaborate online dating scam. According to Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, the woman was misled for over two years by a man posing as a Belgian national, who encouraged her to invest in Bitcoin using forged investment returns. The victim was completely unaware of the deception until police arrived at her door. She eventually became proficient at operating Bitcoin ATMs, and spent months transferring her entire life savings. Media release from AUSTRAC The scammer guided her through the process step by step, starting with cash withdrawals from traditional ATMs and feeding the funds into crypto kiosks. At one point, she carried as much as 20,000 Australian dollars in cash to complete a single transaction. She described the process as taking “half a day’s work” and recounted the emotional toll of confessing the loss of her life savings to her daughter. Another woman in her 70s also fell victim to a fake investment firm and lost over 200,000 Australian dollars. Police actions under the crackdown focused on the highest-risk users of crypto ATMs. Of the 21 people that were singled out for investigation, many turned out to be victims rather than perpetrators. This shed some light on the growing trend of ordinary citizens being exploited through promises of love, job offers, or high-return investments. Only one person has been charged so far with property laundering, while four others received formal cautions for allegedly using crypto to purchase drugs or acting as intermediaries for criminals. Some suspected mules were also revealed to be victims, who were unknowingly helping cybercriminals or attempting to recover their own stolen money. (Source: CoinATMRadar ) In response to the rising number of these incidents, AUSTRAC introduced new rules and transaction limits for crypto ATM operators on June 3 to help mitigate scams. The agency made crypto regulation a top priority for 2025. AFP Commander Graeme Marshall stressed that people should be wary of anyone promising quick profits or creating a sense of urgency, particularly if contact is made online and the person has never been met in real life. He warned the public not to make any payments via cryptocurrency if instructed by a supposed business or government agency. According to Australia’s national cybercrime reporting system, ReportCyber , there were 150 reports of scams involving crypto ATMs from January of 2024 to January of 2025, which resulted in more than 3.1 million Australian dollars in losses. Spokane Bans Crypto ATMs Spokane, Washington became the first city in the state to ban cryptocurrency ATMs . This happened after a unanimous vote by the City Council in response to the rise in scams targeting local residents. The ordinance was proposed by Council member Paul Dillon , and it aims to protect vulnerable people from fraud involving virtual currency kiosks, which he described as a favored tool of scammers. The new measure prohibits the installation of future crypto ATMs and mandates the removal of existing machines, many of which are located in low-income neighborhoods and high-traffic locations like grocery and convenience stores. Ordinance to ban crypto ATMs (Source: Spokane City Council ) The ordinance referred to a concerning increase in scam activity linked to these kiosks, and pointed out that victims often lose thousands of dollars. Within 60 days, crypto ATM operators are required to remove their machines or face civil penalties and potential revocation of business licenses. The City Council also plans to monitor and report on the effectiveness of the ban by tracking changes in reported crimes involving crypto kiosks. Local law enforcement supported the move, with police detective Tim Schwering sharing cases where funds deposited into these ATMs ended up in foreign jurisdictions like China, North Korea, and Russia. Schwering explained that scammers often impersonate law enforcement or tax officials to coerce victims into converting their money into crypto to avoid fictitious legal consequences. Once the money is transferred into cryptocurrency, it becomes nearly impossible to recover.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9713/coinme-fined-300-k-for-breaking-california-crypto-atm-rules,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-26T08:09:00,"Why Analysts Are Confident This New Crypto Will Hit $3 Before Cardano (ADA)","One dollar is widely regarded as a landmark price for new crypto tokens. But experts are expecting Remittix (RTX), a trailblazing token that falls into this category of coins, to hit a whopping $3 – way before crypto bigwig Cardano (ADA) does. This article reveals the reasons fueling this extremely bullish sentiment. Why are analysts bullish about Remittix? By creating a peer-to-peer electronic payment network, Bitcoin revolutionized how we perceive and transfer value. Remittix builds on this transformative technology by eliminating more middlemen and delivering a useful solution for end users. It empowers its users to make crypto-fiat transactions without FX charges. To be more specific, Remittix’s PayFi protocol allows anyone to send crypto, right from their wallets, to recipients who get fiat in their traditional bank accounts. It mimics Ripple’s cross-border efficiency but appeals to both retail and institutional users. This makes it potentially a top crypto coin, even though it is yet to hit the limelight. The rationale behind RTX hitting $3 is simple. If Ripple could rally as strongly as it did even though it had legal troubles and doesn’t appeal to retail users, how much more would Remittix perform? It has no issues with the government and appeals to a broader audience. Even more, it is still in its infancy, unknown to many but is steadily growing in stature and value. Remittix has appreciated by over 500% already, with its presale fetching more than $15.8 million from investors. The token is currently priced around $0.0811, which is a sweet spot for anyone looking to make serious profits. Cardano keeps on struggling Cardano is one of the OG crypto projects. It is almost as old as Bitcoin and has methodically developed its network to be the sprawling ecosystem that it currently is. But despite its elevated status, Cardano price has underperformed and has hardly fetched investors tangible gains. This is in spite of the accelerated rollout of the Leios upgrade , a foundational overhaul of Cardano’s Ouroboros consensus protocol that is designed to boost transaction throughput to “tens of thousands per second. Source: CoinMarketCap Cardano is down by over 20% on the monthly scene, with ADA trading below $0.6. The coin continues to fluctuate below the $1 mark, and remains stubbornly range-bound, frustrating holders looking to make robust profits in 2025. Cardano price prediction: Can ADA break $3 ceiling? Cardano’s inability to climb above the $3 threshold has become a defining feature of its disappointing history. Since peaking at $3.10 in Q4 2021, ADA has consistently failed to revisit or surpass this psychological barrier. This is despite multiple crypto market bull runs and market-wide rallies and it casts a long shadow over its future price trajectories. Source: TradingView Presently, the Cardano price is testing a multi-touch demand zone marked by strong historical reactions. The 50/200 MA convergence suggests long-term resistance around $1 remains intact. However, the Stochastic RSI shows oversold conditions, hinting at a potential short-term reversal. If Cardano price moves above $0.67 and approaches $0.8, there’s a chance ADA could breach $1. However, the possibility of a $3 ADA remains as slim as ever. Don’t miss out on Remittix Remittix is well-positioned to hit $3 before ADA breaks this price ceiling. It’s got a really strong momentum, packs a revolutionary potential, and remains extremely affordable for the average investor. Smart money is flowing towards Remittix, and it’s only a matter of time before others get wind of it. That is why the best time to get in on the action is now– before the coin hits exchanges and goes viral.

2025-06-26T08:04:06,"Exploring the Ripple Effects of Bitcoin's Record Highs on Altcoin Markets","The Ascension of Bitcoin and Its Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs is more than just a milestone for investors—it’s a harbinger for broader market shifts. Currently positioned around $107,900 , and with prospects to reach or even exceed $120,000 soon, Bitcoin’s performance is a key indicator of market sentiment and potential liquidity influx into the altcoin markets. The recent breakthrough not only enhances Bitcoin's stature but also serves to attract fresh capital, creating a fertile ground for altcoins to flourish. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ""altcoin season,"" a phase when smaller cap coins might see exponential growth. The market’s dynamics hint at an upcoming altcoin season, much anticipated by the trading community. Characteristics of an Impending Altcoin Surge Following Bitcoin’s lead, the entire crypto market often gets a speculative boost. As seen currently, a new all-time high has been set by Bitcoin, which historically signals a shift of focus to altcoins. Investors typically start to diversify their investments to leverage potential higher returns from altcoins, which are deemed to have a higher growth potential in shorter time frames. Detailed market analyses indicate that key metrics such as the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio and total crypto market cap growth are favorable. Increased trading volumes and a general buzz around altcoins further validate this shift. This transition often coincides with Bitcoin consolidating its gains, paving the way for the much-discussed altcoin season.

2025-06-26T08:03:28,"Bitcoin's ATH Breakout & The Coming Altcoin Season: How to Spot 100x Presale Opportunities","Bitcoin New ATH Within Reach The cryptocurrency market is in a state of exhilaration as Bitcoin (BTC) continues its relentless march towards new historical peaks. Currently trading robustly around $107,900 , Bitcoin stands on the cusp of, or has recently breached, its all-time high (ATH) at $111,970 last May 22, 2025. Bitcoin is expected to reach new ATH at $120,000 before June ends. This formidable performance is not just a triumph for Bitcoin holders but is widely regarded as the ultimate catalyst for the eagerly anticipated ""altcoin season""—a period where alternative cryptocurrencies are poised for explosive, often 100x, gains. Investors are keenly observing these dynamics, seeking to strategically position themselves for the next wave of exponential growth in the digital asset landscape. Bitcoin's Historic Rise: Paving the Way for Market Expansion Bitcoin's recent price action has cemented its role as the undisputed leader of the crypto market. Its ability to reclaim and test ATH levels signifies immense market strength and renewed institutional confidence. The achievement of a Bitcoin all-time high draws significant global attention, pulling new capital into the ecosystem and bolstering overall market sentiment. Analysts are already making bold predictions, with some technical indicators pointing towards a swift ascent to $110,000, and potentially even $120,000 following a confirmed breakout from key resistance ranges. More ambitious forecasts suggest targets reaching $135,000-$140,000, or even $150,000 by late August, and significantly higher by year-end. This upward trajectory for Bitcoin is crucial; it establishes a stable foundation and historically precedes a rotation of funds into altcoins as investors seek higher percentage gains. On his viral tweet , Crypto Influencer, Crypto Beast, is expecting surge to other tokens aside from Bitcoin. Decoding the Dynamics of an Altcoin Surge Altcoin Market Cap: $1,291,255,594,413 The concept of an ""altcoin season"" is well-established in crypto cycles. It typically occurs after Bitcoin has experienced a significant rally, consolidating its gains or moving sideways. This period often sees Bitcoin dominance—its market share relative to the total crypto market —begin to decline, as savvy investors reallocate profits from Bitcoin into more volatile, yet high-potential, altcoins. Key indicators signaling the onset of an altcoin season include a rising Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (BTC) ratio, a surge in the overall altcoin market capitalization, increased trading volumes across various altcoins, and a general shift in market sentiment towards higher risk appetite. While current data may show Bitcoin dominance remaining high or the Altcoin Season Index still low, historical patterns suggest these periods of Bitcoin's strength often precede a significant altcoin run in the latter half of the year, driven by factors like increasing stablecoin liquidity and an overall bullish macro environment. Leading the Memecoins: A High-Potential Alternative for 100x Gains While bitcoin all time high achievements dominate headlines, savvy investors are increasingly looking towards innovative presale projects with the potential for truly explosive returns. FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out as a prime example, offering a compelling alternative for those seeking 100x gains that are simply no longer feasible for established cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin, currently up 2% in the past 24 hours, retook some ground on the back of the news that Donald Trump had ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider crypto-based federal housing loans. If successful, the move could mark one of the final stages of crypto’s adoption growth; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mack hold over $7T in combined assets.

2025-06-26T07:53:18,"FactCheck: Is Jack Dorsey Satoshi Nakamoto?","The post FactCheck: Is Jack Dorsey Satoshi Nakamoto? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A viral theory circulating online claims that Jack Dorsey — the former CEO of Twitter and founder of Block (formerly Square) — might be the creator of Bitcoin , Satoshi Nakamoto.The theory, brought back into the spotlight by crypto trader James Wynn , is full of odd coincidences and symbols that make some people believe Jack Dorsey could be the hidden creator of Bitcoin. Claim Jack Dorsey is Satoshi Nakamoto Verdict False Fact-Check by Coinpedia Our research found no credible or verifiable evidence to support this claim. The theory is built on coincidences and online speculation, not facts. Who Made This Claim? The theory recently went viral after crypto trader James Wynn posted a thread suggesting Dorsey could be Satoshi. Matthew Sigel (former Head of Digital Asset Research at VanEck) and Seán Murray also hinted at similar ideas in the past. Coinpedia’s Key Findings and Counter-Evidence 1. Coincidental Timelines and Symbolism Are Not Proof The viral post highlights Dorsey’s 2003 bio mentioning crypto, pseudonyms, and “4 AM hack” sessions, which are said to match timestamps in Bitcoin’s code. However, Coinpedia points out these are circumstantial and not unique to Dorsey. The supposed sailor’s saying in the original Bitcoin code is cited as a nod to Dorsey’s sailing background, but this is speculative and not a direct link. 2. No Concrete Technical or Blockchain Evidence Claims about a Bitcoin address labeled “jD2m” being tied to Dorsey’s San Francisco location are unsubstantiated. There is no verifiable blockchain or cryptographic evidence connecting Dorsey to Satoshi’s wallets or code commits. Coinpedia notes that while Dorsey is a vocal Bitcoin supporter and has worn Satoshi-themed shirts, advocacy does not equate to authorship. 3. Public Behavior and Communication Style Differ Dorsey’s communication style and public persona are well-documented and differ significantly from Satoshi’s writing style in emails and forum posts . Dorsey has publicly supported Bitcoin projects and spoken openly about his involvement, while Satoshi remained anonymous and distanced from all publicity. 4. Time Constraints and Professional Commitments Coinpedia and other researchers highlight that Dorsey was deeply involved in running Twitter (now x) and later Square during the years Satoshi was most active. The enormous time and technical commitment required to create and launch Bitcoin would have been nearly impossible to conceal alongside Dorsey’s public roles. 5. No Cryptographic Proof or Wallet Movement There is no evidence that Dorsey controls any of Satoshi’s original Bitcoin wallets . The early coins attributed to Satoshi have never been moved, and no one has demonstrated the ability to sign a message with Satoshi’s private keys. 6. Community and Expert Skepticism Coinpedia references skepticism from leading crypto researchers, such as Jameson Lopp and BitMEX Research, who argue that the theory relies on unreliable patterns and speculative links, not on hard facts. BitMEX Research, for example, challenges claims about the “Patoshi pattern” and the ability to pinpoint Satoshi’s mining activity or identity based on block timing and forum sign-up dates. Summary Table: Coinpedia’s Evidence Against the Theory Claim Made by Theory Coinpedia’s Counter-Evidence Dorsey’s bio and habits match Satoshi Coincidental, not unique; many cypherpunks had similar interests. “jD2m” address links Dorsey to Satoshi No verifiable blockchain evidence; speculative at best. Satoshi’s actions align with Dorsey’s timeline Dorsey’s public commitments at Twitter/Square make this implausible. Symbolic gestures (shirts, books) Advocacy ≠ authorship; no direct proof. Satoshi’s communication style is like Dorsey’s Writing styles are significantly different. No denial from Dorsey Dorsey has denied being Satoshi in interviews; playful answers are not proof . No cryptographic evidence No access to Satoshi’s wallets or ability to sign messages Conclusion Coinpedia’s research, along with input from blockchain experts, finds no concrete or technical evidence linking Jack Dorsey to Satoshi Nakamoto. The claims are based on coincidences, symbolism, and speculative connections that do not withstand scrutiny. Without cryptographic proof or blockchain evidence, the theory remains just that—a viral internet rumor, not fact.

2025-06-26T07:50:40,"Metaplanet Buys More Bitcoin: Stash Hits 12,345 BTC After $133M Purchase","Tokyo-listed investment firm, Metaplanet, has expanded its Bitcoin holdings with a new purchase of 1,234 BTC worth $133 million. The acquisition pushed its total holdings to 12,345 BTC, secured at an average price of $98,303 per coin. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy With this latest addition , Metaplanet has now surpassed Tesla, which holds 11,509 BTC, to become the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, as it continued with its aggressive accumulation strategy. Announcing the latest milestone, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich tweeted , “1, 2, 3, 4, 5… liftoff. We just climbed past Tesla on the BTC leaderboard. Bolder. Faster. Harder. Elon Musk – meet you on Mars.” The move comes shortly after the firm raised ¥74.9 billion (approximately $515 million), a significant funding round aimed primarily at expanding its Bitcoin treasury. The capital raise was facilitated through the exercise of 540,000 stock-acquisition rights by Metaplanet’s primary backer, EVO Fund, which resulted in the issuance of 54 million new shares. This represents nearly a third of the company’s 20th warrant series, with a significant number of rights still unconverted. The purchase also aligns with Metaplanet’s broader goal to acquire 1% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million coins. This ambition would place it among the most committed corporate adopters of the world’s leading asset. Metaplanet’s $5.4B “555 Million Plan” Earlier this year, the company unveiled its “555 Million Plan,” wherein it proposed the issuance of 555 million new shares to raise roughly $5.4 billion for future bitcoin purchases. That plan represents a 92% dilution of existing shares and is part of a larger roadmap to amass 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Looking further ahead, Metaplanet has outlined targets of reaching 100,000 BTC by 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. This scale of accumulation is matched only by the business intelligence company Strategy, which is currently the top corporate holder with over 592,300 BTC. Data from BitcoinTreasuries revealed that Marathon Digital Holdings stands second in line with 49,179 BTC, followed by Riot Platforms with 19,225 BTC, and CleanSpark with 12,502 BTC, respectively.

Here’s How Crypto Is Entering the Real Estate Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance, many investors wonder how useful their crypto is in daily life. In a big development, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency took a bold step by allowing cryptocurrencies to be counted as assets in mortgage applications. Crypto Now Counts for Home Loans! This new rule means crypto holdings can now help people qualify for loans. It’s a positive move for crypto users and a sign that digital assets are becoming a regular part of the financial system. From rising prices to new rules that recognize digital assets, XRP is stepping out of the trading charts. How much XRP would you need to purchase a home in the United States? Let us explore the details as ChatGPT reveals the answer. As of now, XRP is trading around $2.19. The median price for a typical home in the U.S. is approximately $420,000, though this can vary by state, city, and property type. If one were to pay the full cost of the home using XRP, one would need about 192,000 XRP. This is calculated by dividing the home price of $420,000 by the XRP price at $2.19. This amount would cover a typical home purchase in an average market without a mortgage or loan. How Much XRP for a Down Payment? A 20% down payment on a median-priced home would require approximately 38,400 XRP at the current market rate. In high-value real estate markets such as San Francisco or New York City, where property prices often exceed $1 million, the total XRP required for a full purchase could cross 450,000. These figures clearly show how the number of tokens required rise with the property’s value. Also, XRP’s price is highly volatile, so the number of tokens needed may shift over time. At the current price of $2.19, purchasing a median-priced home in the U.S. would take approximately 190,000 to 200,000 XRP. A Larger Shift Globally This shift is part of a larger trend. Japan’s Open House Group now accepts XRP for real estate purchases. Buyers can use XRP to purchase properties in cities like Tokyo and Osaka. The company, already supporting Bitcoin and Ethereum, recently expanded its crypto payment options to include XRP, SOL, and DOGE. Dubai is also using XRP Ledger to Tokenize Real Estate. These moves reflect a growing global trend of using XRP for real-world payments.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/chatgpt-predicts-192000-xrp-for-a-home-heres-how-crypto-is-entering-the-real-estate-market/,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

The world’s second-largest crypto started a fresh upward move above the $2,320 level on Thursday, per CoinMarketCap data . ETH is now showing bullish signs and might aim for a move above the $2,550 zone. In a separate announcement , Bit Digital noted that it will be selling shares to use the net proceeds for Ethereum purchase. It announced an underwritten public offering of its ordinary shares with B. Riley Securities acting as the book-running manager. Stocks Experience 8% Plunge The company’s stock initially fell 3.7% at close on Wednesday, and was further down another 4.3% in after-hours trading, per Yahoo Finance data . The pivot to ETH staking news stirred investor concerns, suggesting uncertainty despite strategic developments in its ETH operations. The New York-based firm’s stock has a $488 million market cap.

2025-06-26T07:30:00,"Altcoin Winter May Drag On As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Signals It Could Defy Trend","Amid rising military tensions, the crypto market has gone into altcoin winter, which is marked by a period of low growth. According to analysts, the current altcoin winter may continue for a while due to various factors. One of these reasons is that most of the market continues to ignore altcoins, with focus primarily on Bitcoin (BTC). The data shows that while most of the market dipped following the US strikes on Iran, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered quite well, and is now above $103,000, after briefly falling below $100,000. Another reason has been the flood of meme coins into the crypto space. For instance, the pump.fun meme coin platform has created over 6 million meme coins, which has left many newbies confused about which meme coin to purchase. Amid these market conditions, investors are looking into tokens at the bargain-basement pricing, which have real utility and massive upside. One of the main candidates that meets all these conditions is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . So far, the presale for MUTM tokens is doing well and promises to be one of the biggest gainers of 2025 when it goes live. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where it has raised over $11.2 million so far from around 12,450 buyers. At the current price of $0.03, it represents a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. This trend will continue until the final listing price of $0.06. As such, buyers in phase 5 are getting their tokens at a generous 50% discount. Not wanting to miss out on massive gains, investors have bought 50% of the tokens, barely a week after they launched. Another factor pushing the presale forward is the positive forecasts by analysts. According to the analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could go up by 4,500% once they go live. Based on this forecast, a $1,800 investment in the presale at the current price could grow to $81,000. On any scale, that is a massive return that is getting rarer to find in the crypto market. Best of all, the value of MUTM tokens is expected to continue growing, thanks to the design of the protocol. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to offer stable, long-term returns for its holders. One of the ways in which the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team plans to support the long-term value of MUTM tokens is via a buyback and distribution program. In this program, they will purchase MUTM tokens off the open market, which will be distributed to stakers on the platform. These purchases will support the long-term growth of the tokens, helping to attract even more buyers. As a result, it will create a sustainable process of upward growth. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. As lenders on the protocol, they deposit funds, which they can use to earn an annual percentage yield (APY). The yield rate in a pool is determined by the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises, it pushes up the interest rate, which causes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it incentivizes new lenders to join in to benefit from the higher yields. The result is a cycle of liquidity growth and growing user participation that ensures the long-term stability of the ecosystem. Additionally, the design ensures that the protocol achieves optimal capital efficiency. To put it into perspective, if a lender were to deposit $5,000 worth of AVAX in a pool, and the utilization rises, that could push the yield to 20%. An APY of 20% means that the owner would receive $1,000 worth of AVAX on their deposit. That is a convenient means to earn passive income with the least amount of effort possible. To protect lenders on the protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) requires that all loans be overcollateralized. It ensures that all borrowers deposit collateral that is worth more than the value of their deposit. That ensures that if there is rapid price movement that lowers the value of the collateral, liquidators have a buffer in which they can step in and purchase the collateral at a discount. As a result, the protocol is stabilized, while lenders get their full amount back. Conclusion The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is what happens when ingenuity meets determination. By creating real-world utility, it ensures that the value of MUTM tokens will continue to grow over time. The current 50% discount on the tokens in the ongoing presale presents a lucrative opportunity to secure massive gains amid turmoil in the rest of the market. Do not miss this gem of a token that could deliver 45x gains.

The rally has now entered a critical red supply zone between $108,000 and $110,000, where historical rejections have often triggered consolidation phases. Price is pausing just below this resistance, and several indicators hint at an imminent inflection. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) From a multi-timeframe perspective, Bitcoin price action has flipped bullish after a breakout from the descending channel seen on the daily and 4-hour charts. The current rally originated from a liquidity sweep near $98,000, forming a bullish order block and reclaiming the broken structure. BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Price is now testing the same region that caused the last rejection near $108,000. The 1D chart shows this area aligning with the upper trendline projection, where BTC reversed in early June.

The final requirement? Profitability. Thanks to a recent accounting rule change, Bitcoin could be the catalyst that gets them there. With 592,345 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at over $63.7 billion, MicroStrategy is on track to post one of its most profitable quarters—but only if Bitcoin stays above $95,240 by June 30. What’s Holding MicroStrategy Back? To qualify for the S&P 500, a company must meet these criteria: Be based in the U.S. Have a large market capitalization Maintain adequate share float and trading volume Post positive earnings over the past four quarters MicroStrategy satisfies the first three. However, under previous accounting rules, it had to record unrealized Bitcoin losses—even without selling. These losses kept its earnings negative. According to a post by Bitcoin advocate Alex on X , this was the main obstacle preventing S&P 500 inclusion. Why June 30 Is a Pivotal Date A new accounting rule now allows companies to include fair-value gains from Bitcoin in quarterly earnings. This means if Bitcoin remains above $95,240, MicroStrategy’s profits for Q2 could turn sharply positive—meeting the final S&P 500 requirement. Analyst Jeff Walton points out that such a price level would erase previous losses and unlock S&P eligibility. Current BTC price: $107,753 Q2 performance: +29.2% Probability of Bitcoin holding above $95,240: 91% What Happens If MicroStrategy Is Added? If MicroStrategy joins the S&P 500, every major index fund will be required to include MSTR in their holdings. This creates indirect exposure to Bitcoin across the entire U.S. index ecosystem. Alex notes this could bring a new level of mainstream legitimacy and adoption for Bitcoin. Why Bitcoin Investors Should Watch This Closely MicroStrategy’s potential S&P 500 inclusion could: Accelerate institutional interest in Bitcoin Increase demand for BTC-backed stocks Further cement Bitcoin’s place in traditional finance As June 30 approaches, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s price. If it holds above the $95,240 threshold, MicroStrategy may finally enter the S&P 500, bringing Bitcoin with it.

While Bitcoin continues to lead the way, altcoins are setting up for some interesting moves too. Bitcoin at Key Resistance: Breakout or Pullback? As of now, Bitcoin is testing an important resistance zone between $109,000 and $111,000. While the fundamentals like stock market stability, a steady volatility index, and a growing Coinbase Bitcoin premium are looking positive, analysts are divided on whether Bitcoin can break above this level in the short term. While there’s strong bullish momentum right now, the volume isn’t quite high enough for a confirmed breakout. If Bitcoin gets rejected at this resistance, it could see a pullback before any new highs. Ethereum and XRP: Lagging Behind, But Watching Bitcoin Ethereum (ETH) and XRP haven’t kept up with Bitcoin’s recent surge. Ethereum especially looks weak, still stuck below its key resistance level and struggling to attract volume. XRP, too, is heavily dependent on Bitcoin’s moves and may need a pullback before any serious rally. Altcoins: Calm Before the Storm? Altcoins in general have stabilized but remain at risky levels. A short-term pullback in altcoins is likely before a possible bounce and more sustained upside. The open interest in altcoins remains high, keeping things volatile, but if Bitcoin can hold its ground, altcoins might follow suit soon. However, crypto trader JRNY Crypto is positive about what’s coming next. According to him, Bitcoin reaching $125,000 could kick off a mini altcoin season. If it crosses $150,000, a bigger rally might follow, and if Bitcoin pushes above $180,000, the market could enter a massive, parabolic altcoin season.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/125k-bitcoin-could-launch-mini-altcoin-season-is-xrp-ready-to-run/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP","News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Multi-year support being found at the one-year moving average, and not too far extended from that average.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Lastly, he says Bitcoin’s recent sideways price action, including a temporary dip into the $90,000 level, is likely due to geopolitical concerns. “BTC continued consolidation.

In just three trading days, aggregate inflows for US spot BTC funds totalled $1.48 billion, according to Farside Investors. Additionally, there has not been an outflow day since June 6, almost three weeks ago. Its “absolutely ridiculous,” said ETF Store President Nate Geraci, who observed almost $4 billion in new capital and the total aggregate inflow approaching $50 billion since the products launched 18 months ago. ETFs On Fire BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has been hoovering up the most with a more than 9,400 BTC purchased this week alone. The fund has seen an aggregate inflow of almost $52 billion since it launched, with Wednesday seeing a further $340 million in inflows, according to Farside Investors. Its closest competitor is Fidelity, which saw $115 million in inflows on June 25 and has a total aggregate inflow of $11.7 billion. The other nine products are small fry in comparison. In related news, ETF issuers Invesco and Galaxy filed for a Solana ETF on Wednesday, bringing the total to nine issuers that have filed for Solana funds, reported Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. Meanwhile, Canary Capital filed a 19b-4 form with CBOE for a PENGU ETF that will cover the tokens and Pudgy Penguins NFTs. NEW: @InvescoUS (and @galaxyhq ) just filed for a Solana ETF.

Bitcoin Dominance Surges Bitcoin prices have gained almost 10% since their sub-six-figure dip earlier this week. The asset has tapped $108,100 twice in the past 24 hours but fell back to $107,800 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session. The latest move has resulted in Bitcoin dominance returning to a four-year high of 65.7% this week as Ethereum and the altcoins have remained stagnant . Traditionally, Bitcoin dominance takes 1-2 months to rally from a successful retest of 64% support up to 71%. However, this cycle has shown extended timeframes – for example, a retest that took 2 months in 2019 stretched to 4 months in the current cycle, said analyst ‘Rekt Crypto.’ He added that many traders are hoping for a quick rally to 70% to get the dominance move over with quickly. “But the concern is just that too many people are deeply wishing for a swift rise in Bitcoin Dominance right now, and the market rarely gives people exactly what they want.” The post $1.5 Billion Flows Into BTC ETFs This Week as Bitcoin Double Taps $108K appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/1-5-billion-flows-into-btc-etfs-this-week-as-bitcoin-double-taps-108k/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin ETF",cryptocompare

2025-06-26T06:34:26,"SEC's Hester Peirce claimed in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs are ""definitely coming""","U.S. SEC’s Hester Peirce dropped a hint about the possibility of in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs, saying they were definitely on the horizon. Nasdaq submitted a Form 19b-4 on behalf of BlackRock in January, requesting the U.S. SEC to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin ETFs, a shift from the current cash-based system. Republican U.S. SEC Commissioner Peirce explained that in-kind creations and redemptions would allow ETF issuers to deliver and redeem fund shares using crypto assets directly, rather than cash, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. She suggested that in-kind redemptions would allow investors to withdraw Bitcoin from an ETF to a private (self-custody) wallet. In December of 2023, the U.S. SEC met with all spot Bitcoin ETF issuers and asked them to remove any reference to “in-kind” redemptions from their filings and include “cash creates” only. However, Peirce hinted in December 2024 that in-kind redemptions may be coming to Bitcoin spot ETFs in 2025. Currently, most spot crypto ETFs operate using cash-based creation and redemption processes, which limit efficiency for traditional crypto participants. Peirce says she is not making any promises BREAKING: US SEC COMMISSIONER PIERCE SAYS IN-KIND US #BITCOIN ETFS ARE COMING ETFs DELIVERING REAL BTC. MASSIVE 🚀 pic.twitter.com/2XNlw5qvh7 — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) June 25, 2025 During a Bitcoin Policy Institute panel discussion, Commissioner Peirce confirmed that Form 19b-4 submissions were currently under review, acknowledging a high level of interest in the “in-kind” mechanism. However, she pointed out that although the industry was looking forward to this new model, she was not making any promises. In January, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart argued that the in-kind creations and redemptions mechanism would increase trading efficiency for funds. BlackRock previously presented a plan for a “Revised In-Kind” model that could give the asset manager more flexibility should investors want to redeem their shares for the underlying asset. Vivian Fang, a Finance professor at Indiana University, said asset managers were familiar with the “in-kind” redemption model, adding that retail investors who wanted to redeem their shares would get their share of Bitcoin from BlackRock in return, which could then be turned into cash via a broker-dealer. “You want your one egg back, I’ll give you your one egg back, I don’t have to immediately care about how much that egg is selling for now, it can be $5, it could be $10, but I’m holding one egg for you and you’re getting one egg back when you want it.” -Vivian Fang, Finance Professor at Indiana University However, Fang explained that investors could still get cash back when redeeming their shares, no matter the model. She said the only difference was that the Bitcoin (or egg) had to be sold to raise that cash in the cash model. U.S. SEC seeks comments on in-kind creations and redemptions The U.S. SEC mandated a “cash redemption” model when the initial wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs received approval in January 2024. However, the agency announced in February this year that it sought comments on the proposal to allow in-kind redemptions. In May, the U.S. SEC launched proceedings to assess Nasdaq’s proposed rule change allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Nasdaq filed the proposed rule change on January 24, 2025, and it was published in the Federal Register on February 12, triggering an initial review period. On March 11, the SEC extended its decision deadline to May 13. The May 13 order formally instituted proceedings under Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The U.S. SEC solicited public comments to evaluate whether these changes aligned with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. In January, Cboe and VanEck also filed for in-kind creations and redemptions for their spot Bitcoin ETFs. In April, a BlackRock delegation led by the Head of Regulatory Affairs, Benjamin Tecmire, met with the U.S. SEC’s Crypto Task Force to iron out matters regarding the potential of allowing future in-kind redemptions and creations for crypto ETFs. However, Fang claimed that there was no difference between the cash model and the revised in-kind model from the investor’s point of view. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-26T06:25:54,"Bitcoin's Bull Case Strengthens as Dollar Index Slides, Nvidia Hits Record High Amid Recession Cues","Bitcoin's BTC price has rebounded nearly 10% from weekend lows, with key developments in traditional markets supporting the case for continued gains ahead. The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major fiat currencies, dropped to 97.27 early Thursday, the lowest level since February 2022, according to data source TradingView. The decline follows growing calls for a July Fed rate cut and disappointing data on housing and consumer confidence. The weakening of the dollar, a global reserve currency, tends to ease financial conditions, galvanizing increased risk-taking in financial markets. ""DXY [is] now at the lowest level since March 2022. Very bullish implications for global money supply growth and bitcoin,"" Andre Dragosch, director, head of research - Europe at Bitwise, said on X. BTC and NVDA correlation Meanwhile, shares in Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things AI and emerging technologies, rose 4%.33% Wednesday, hitting a record high of $154.30. Both NVDA and BTC bottomed out in late 2022 and have been in an uptrend ever since. As of the time of writing, the 90-day correlation coefficient between NVDA and BTC was 0.80, indicating a strong positive relationship between the two assets. NVDA's record high came a day after the Nasdaq futures formed a bullish golden cross, signaling a continued risk-on rally. Bonds teasing recession The yield on the U.S. two-year note, which is more sensitive to interest rate expectations, dropped to 3.76% early today, the lowest since May 2. The yield has declined by 24 basis points this month. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has declined by 16 basis points to 4.27%. As such, the spread between the 10- and two-year yields has widened in a move known as the steepening of the yield curve. Historically, recessions have begun with the two-year yield falling alongside a steepening of the yield curve, as noted by wealth advisor Kurt S. Altrichter on X. ""We’re not there yet, but we’re dancing on the edge. The 10Y-2Y spread is bull-steepening. If the 2Y breaks lower, it signals the Fed has lost control. That’s your cue. Watch it closely,"" Altrichter said . Consumer expectations signal an impending recession Consumer confidence dropped last month to a reading of 93, registering a 5.4-point decline from May, with Republican party respondents leading the decline, according to data released by the Conference Board on Tuesday. More importantly, the expectations index, which represents the short-term outlook, slipped to 69, well below the 80 threshold that typically signals an impending recession. Traders price in Fed rate cuts These developments, coupled with the oil price slide and the talk of a July rate cut by some Fed officials, have likely prompted traders to price in an early rate cut by the Fed. According to the CME's FedWatch tool. According to Bloomberg , interest rate swaps are now pricing around four basis points of easing into the July Fed meeting, up from near zero a week ago. Furthermore, traders anticipate a combined 60 basis points of easing over the remaining four meetings this year, up from 45 basis points a week ago.

2025-06-26T06:22:19,"U.S. agency directs mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider crypto assets","Crypto holdings could soon count toward U.S. mortgages under a new directive by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In a directive issued by FHFA director William J. Pulte on June 25, the agency instructed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals for including cryptocurrency holdings in single-family mortgage risk assessments. Previously, digital assets have not been included in mortgage lenders’ risk models unless they are converted to fiat. This policy marks a major shift in the way borrower reserves may be assessed, possibly enabling crypto assets to be considered when approving loans without first being converted into U.S. dollars. Before implementation, each institution must submit board-approved proposals. Only holdings that can be verified on regulated U.S. exchanges will be taken into consideration. After significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump’s vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, today I ordered the Great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage. SO ORDERED pic.twitter.com/Tg9ReJQXC3 — Pulte (@pulte) June 25, 2025 The directive called for extra protections to ensure sound underwriting practices and take market volatility into account. Critics have pointed out that the measure does not include self-custodied assets, which might prevent crypto-native users who value decentralization from participating. You might also like: Trump-backed World Liberty Financial plans USD1 stablecoin audit and new app launch Concerns have also been raised about Pulte’s family’s cryptocurrency ties. As of January 2025, his spouse reportedly owned between $500,000 and $1 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ). Although there are no accusations of misconduct, the timing has sparked questions about potential conflicts of interest. This is not the first time crypto has been accepted as legitimate collateral in U.S. financial systems. In June, JPMorgan Chase began accepting spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, as loan collateral. Despite not being directly related to cryptocurrency, the exposure represents a big change in policy for a major traditional bank. Federally chartered cryptocurrency bank Anchorage Digital also offers crypto-backed loans through its collaboration with Arch Lending, accepting Solana, Ethereum ( ETH ), and Bitcoin as collateral. At the same time, BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, is now accepted as collateral for institutional trading on exchanges like Deribit and Crypto.com. These developments show that traditional finance is becoming more comfortable using digital assets as collateral. With the adoption of the FHFA’s crypto directive, crypto-backed mortgages may become a standard in U.S. housing finance, giving holders of digital assets access to greater financial inclusion.

2025-06-26T06:02:15,"Ninth Solana ETF filing lands as Invesco and Galaxy submit S-1","Invesco and Galaxy have become the ninth issuer to file for a spot Solana ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to a June 26 filing , Invesco and Galaxy’s proposed fund will offer direct exposure to Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Following the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the proposed Solana fund would hold the asset directly under a commodity trust structure. The fund would trade under the ticker symbol “QSOL” on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with Coinbase Custody set to act as custodian for the underlying Solana assets. The ETF may also stake a portion of its SOL holdings to earn additional token rewards, which would be treated as income to the trust. Wednesday’s submission is a Form S-1 registration statement, which informs the commission of the intent to launch a new security. However, before the ETF can be listed, Invesco and Galaxy must also file a Form 19b-4, which proposes a rule change and initiates the formal review process. The SEC will then determine whether the product meets regulatory standards under the Securities Exchange Act. You might also like: Invesco and Galaxy register Solana ETF trust in Delaware Invesco and Galaxy registered the “Invesco Galaxy Solana Trust” in Delaware earlier this month, kickstarting its regulatory process. Other applicants that have filed for Solana ETFs, including VanEck, Bitwise, Grayscale, and Fidelity, are already awaiting SEC review as momentum builds around altcoin ETFs. So far, the SEC has delayed decisions on several Solana ETF applications and has since requested updates from issuers, but has not ruled out eventual approval. The final decision deadline on many of these filings falls in October. However, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have speculated the SEC may act on Solana ETF applications as early as July, with a 90% likelihood of approval. As of now, altcoin ETFs remain unapproved in the United States, with current spot approvals limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the existence of CME-listed Solana futures and growing institutional interest in the asset have strengthened the case for a spot product.

2025-06-26T06:00:05,"Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’","On-chain data shows new investors have been coming into Chainlink (LINK) as the MVRV Ratio signals a potential long-term opportunity for the asset. Chainlink Has Seen Its Total Holder Count Reach A New High In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Total Amount of Holders metric for Chainlink. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses on the LINK network that are carrying some non-zero balance. Related Reading: Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the value of the metric has changed during the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Total Amount of Holders observed an inflection point earlier this year and has since been climbing up at a notable rate. This suggests that new non-empty wallets are popping up on the network. This kind of trend can arise due to a number of reasons. Fresh investors coming into the space or old ones who sold before making a return naturally contribute to an increase in the indicator. Another factor could be existing users creating new wallets to distribute their holdings or for privacy purposes. In general, all of these could be assumed to be occurring simultaneously to a degree whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. As such, the recent uptrend in the metric could indicate that some net adoption (that is, the influx of new investors) has steadily been taking place for Chainlink. Over the past month, 7,903 new non-zero balance addresses have joined the chain, bringing the Total Amount of Holders to a fresh all-time high (ATH) of 769,380. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data of another indicator: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. This metric basically compares how the value held by the BTC investors (the market cap) compares against the value put in by them (the realized cap). In other words, the indicator tells us about the profit-loss balance of the holders. Here, the version of the MVRV Ratio that’s relevant is the 365-day version, capturing the situation of the investors who bought their coins within the past year. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound From the graph, it’s visible that the 1-year MVRV Ratio of Chainlink is currently sitting at a negative 17.3%, an indication that these traders are, on average, holding a loss of 17.3%. Generally, however, investors being underwater isn’t actually a bad thing for the cryptocurrency. This is because holders in profit are the ones more likely to participate in selling. As such, Santiment notes that the trend in the 365-day MVRV Ratio could suggest the asset’s “long-term investing timeframe is in an opportunity zone.” LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading around $13.15, up more than 2% in the last seven days.

2025-06-26T05:54:33,"Online Bank SoFi Brings Back Crypto Trading, Eyes Cross-Border Blockchain Payments","SoFi Technologies is making a return to the cryptocurrency space, less than a year after stepping away due to regulatory hurdles. Key Takeaways: SoFi has reentered the crypto market with trading, remittances, and future DeFi tools. The platform plans to offer stablecoins, staking, and asset-backed borrowing to users. Regulatory shifts in the U.S. have opened the path for SoFi’s renewed crypto strategy. The US-based online banking platform announced Wednesday that it is reintroducing crypto trading and launching blockchain-based international remittances as part of a broader expansion into digital assets. SoFi users will soon be able to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies through their accounts, with future plans to offer stablecoin products, crypto-backed loans, and staking features. SoFi Plans Asset-Backed Borrowing and Expanded Payment Options The company said it aims to create a more comprehensive digital finance experience by expanding payment options and introducing asset-backed borrowing. CEO Anthony Noto said SoFi is “very excited” to leverage blockchain technology across its operations. The planned remittance service will convert fiat to crypto, transmit funds over blockchain rails, and reconvert them into local fiat on the receiving end. “This is just day one,” Noto said, hinting at long-term plans involving crypto, blockchain, and artificial intelligence to improve financial accessibility and cost-efficiency. SoFi’s crypto reboot coincides with projections of rapid industry growth, with the fintech blockchain market expected to reach $49 billion by 2030, up from $3.4 billion in 2024, according to Insider. The firm’s Galileo platform will support third-party crypto infrastructure, including wallets and custody services, positioning SoFi as a serious contender in the expanding digital finance ecosystem. Very excited about the innovation we can drive via blockchain and crypto across our businesses. @Sofi ‘s planned new international payments (frequently called remittances) will convert fiat to crypto, transmit via blockchain, and convert to local fiat. It's only day 1 of the type… https://t.co/KIIyXMEHJo — Anthony Noto (@anthonynoto) June 25, 2025 SoFi exited the crypto space in late 2023 after securing its bank charter, agreeing to the withdrawal under tighter regulatory conditions. However, recent shifts in Washington, such as advancing stablecoin legislation and the Federal Reserve’s rollback of “reputational risk” assessments, have opened the door for traditional banks to work more closely with crypto firms. Shares of SoFi Technologies (SOFI) have climbed roughly 12% over the past week, reflecting renewed investor interest in its pivot back to crypto-enabled services. Venture Capital Backing For Crypto Payment Services on the Rise Earlier this year, crypto payment firm RedotPay closed a $40 million Series A funding round , led by Lightspeed with key investments from HSG, Galaxy Ventures, and other prominent investors including DST Global Partners, Accel, and Vertex Ventures. RedotPay’s funding round came shortly after crypto payments firm Mesh raised $82 million in a Series B funding round to expand its blockchain-based settlement network globally. The round was led by Paradigm, with participation from ConsenSys, QuantumLight, Yolo Investments, Evolution VC, Hike Ventures, Opportuna, and AltaIR Capital. Notably, most of the investment was settled using PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin, highlighting the growing role of stablecoins in financial transactions. Venture capital firms are increasingly backing projects focused on stablecoin services and financial infrastructure. The sector’s potential was further underscored by payments giant Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion last year, signaling strong institutional interest in blockchain-based financial solutions.
