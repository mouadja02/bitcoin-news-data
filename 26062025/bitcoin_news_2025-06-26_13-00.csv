2025-06-26T10:37:50,"Building Trust With U.S. Regulators Is Essential For Advancing Crypto Adoption","After being considered the Wild Wild West for years, crypto adoption in the United States is quickly gaining traction. Most notably, institutions are flooding into the crypto space due to the rise of tokenized treasuries and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization . The current market capitalization of tokenized US treasuries stands at a whopping $7.4 billion . A number of US states are also looking at implementing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) . This would allow states to hold Bitcoin ( BTC ) as part of their investment strategy. Both Texas and New Hampshire have recently signed a bill to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets . Congratulations to those who worked really hard on educating #txlege @TXGOPCaucus and all the stakeholders required to get this bill across the finish line Big shoutout to @lee_bratcher @TXblockchain_ for launching what I like to call 'The 2nd Reserve in Texas' tbt… https://t.co/yDdHWop1rj — ₿IGRYANPARK (@BigRyanPark) June 24, 2025 Moreover, the regulatory landscape in the US is finally becoming crypto-friendly. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently clarified that protocol staking is not a securities transaction under US law when performed under certain conditions. Policies implemented under the Trump administration have further accelerated the institutionalization of cryptocurrencies. The repeal of The Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 has enabled traditional financial institutions to offer custodial services for digital assets. Citibank is actively exploring adding crypto custody, while JPMorgan Chase plans to offer crypto investments to its clients through a third-party custodian. Crypto Companies Work With Regulators Although the crypto sector continues to make strides, industry experts believe that none of this would be possible without working with policymakers and regulators. Margaret Rosenfeld, chief legal officer at Everstake, told Cryptonews that working with US regulators has become essential for cryptocurrency companies. “Effective crypto regulation depends on more than legal theory, as it requires a deep understanding of the underlying technology,” Rosenfeld said. “Without that technical fluency, there’s a risk of applying legacy financial frameworks to decentralized systems in ways that don’t fit and ultimately hinder innovation.” Rosenfeld explained that the decentralized staking provider, Everstake, helped to educate the SEC on staking. She noted that this influenced the SEC’s decision to clarify that protocol staking is not a security. “At Everstake, we didn’t just send lawyers into the SEC – we brought engineers and operators to the table. We explained the technical structure of staking, validator responsibilities, and how non-custodial delegation works. That kind of technical fluency is critical for good policy. Without it, regulators are left applying legacy frameworks to new infrastructure in ways that can miss the mark,” Rosenfeld commented. Rosenfeld noted that providing both legal and technical insight can help regulators gain a clearer understanding of what they are evaluating. “Soon after our meeting, the SEC issued guidance acknowledging for the first time that some staking models – like those we operate – fall outside the scope of securities regulation. It was a meaningful step forward and a real example of how collaborative, technically informed engagement can shape better policy,” she said. Blockchain Advocacy Groups Educate Policymakers Blockchain advocacy groups also work closely with US policymakers to ensure that legislation is passed to push forward with crypto adoption in the country. Most recently, the Texas Blockchain Council helped push for the passing of the Texas SBR. Lee Bratcher, founder and president of the Texas Blockchain Council, told Cryptonews that the Texas Blockchain Council worked with legislative champions, policy advisors, and industry stakeholders to ensure that Senate Bill 21 (SB21) was not only technically sound, but also politically feasible. “The groundwork we’ve laid over the past few years helped pave the way for this breakthrough,” Bratcher said. “Our success was rooted in years of building trust with lawmakers, demystifying Bitcoin, and linking it to core values like fiscal conservatism, sovereignty, and energy innovation.” Texas Governor ⁦ @GregAbbott_TX ⁩ just signed the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill! The future of finance is digital and the future of capital formation is in Texas!! pic.twitter.com/jhgLxKTLTK — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) June 22, 2025 Bratcher further remarked that US states should not only tailor their messaging to local political and economic contexts, but also to core ideas. In this case, Bratcher pointed out that the Texas Blockchain Council educated policymakers on how Bitcoin can serve as a modern reserve asset, which he believes is gaining bipartisan traction. “Given the bi-partisan support for this bill, Texas Governor Abbott determined that it would go into effect immediately rather than the typically September 1st effective date,” Bratcher said. Texas Senator Charles Schwertner also partnered with the Texas Blockchain Council to pass SB21. Chairman Schwertner told Cryptonews that Texas is currently the only state with a direct $10 million appropriation for acquiring Bitcoin. He added that working with the Texas Blockchain Council enabled him to learn how a SBR allows Texas to diversify its investment approach . The Texas Blockchain Council further anticipates that the Texas Comptroller’s Office and the Texas Treasury Safekeeping and Trust Company will begin developing a prudent Bitcoin acquisition and custody strategy. Major US Crypto Exchange Builds Trust With Lawmakers To Boost Crypto Adoption US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also regularly dedicates time to educate policymakers. In February the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase , ending a contentious years-long legal battle. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has since submitted a number of documents and requests to drive mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency in the US. For example, the Coinbase website shows that on May 30 the exchange submitted a request to urge the US Treasury to exclude unrealized crypto gains and losses from the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT). CAMT imposes a 15% minimum tax on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of large corporations for taxable years. In addition to focusing on US policies, Coinbase recently secured a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. This enables the exchange to offer crypto products across European Union countries and will likely result in further influence on EU crypto regulations. Challenges To Consider Before Crypto Adoption While it’s notable that crypto companies and advocacy groups are helping shape US regulations, a number of challenges remain. For instance, Rosenfeld pointed out that one of the biggest challenges is the technical complexity of blockchain infrastructure. “When regulators lack technical fluency in how protocols work, it’s easy for overly broad or misapplied rules to take hold – sometimes unintentionally stifling innovation,” she said. In order to overcome this, Rosenfeld believes that crypto entities need more dialogue that includes not just lawyers and lobbyists, but also engineers and protocol builders. “Regulators are now willing to listen when industry participants take the time to explain the underlying mechanics. That’s the path forward: collaboration built on mutual education and transparency,” she stated.

2025-06-26T10:36:08,"Nasdaq-Listed Company Completely Abandons Bitcoin – Will Sell All BTC and Purchase This Altcoin","Cryptocurrency mining and staking company Bit Digital has announced that it will make a strategic transformation decision and switch to a structure focused solely on Ethereum staking and treasury management. The company will phase out its Bitcoin mining operations and direct the proceeds into Ethereum (ETH) investments. Bit Digital, which began accumulating and staking ETH in 2022, says it currently operates one of the world’s largest enterprise-scale Ethereum staking infrastructures. The company also offers validator infrastructure services, institutional-grade custody and yield solutions, and protocol governance consulting.

The company plans to convert all of its BTC holdings to ETH over time. This transformation is particularly notable at a time when Ethereum-focused treasury strategies are few in number. The SharpLink initiative, previously announced by Consensys founder Joe Lubin, took a similar approach.

Table of Contents From ‘high-frequency trading’ to ‘stable holding’ Why are more and more users choosing APT Miner? The market is moving, but traders don’t have to follow the trend The strong rise of Bitcoin has once again ignited the enthusiasm of the entire crypto market.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out.

Early in the month, LINK began recovering from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a key neckline at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has struggled to sustain its position near this neckline, pulling back toward the support level of the rounded bottom by the third week of June. This rounded bottom support also aligns with the LINK crypto’s multi-year support zone near $11. The LINK price is rising in the week of June 4th and is near a key hurdle near $13.3. If flipped successfully, then it will aim to retest the pattern’s neckline at $18 in June or July. The continuation of this price advance in the long term would require a break and a daily close above the $18 neckline. As this could indicate a potential upward move, with LINK odds to increase for a retest of the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4, an area supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. Should LINK break past the $24 mark, forecasts for late 2025 suggest the token could climb as high as $32.

2025-06-26T10:29:33,"Metaplanet tops Tesla in Bitcoin holdings","Japan-based Metaplanet has officially surpassed Tesla in corporate Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, marking a major milestone in its ambitious journey to become a dominant force in institutional crypto investment. The Tokyo-listed company, once known for hotel management, has fully pivoted into a Bitcoin-first strategy, outpacing legacy players and pushing itself into the global spotlight. On June 26, Metaplanet announced a record-breaking purchase of 1,234 BTC, valued at approximately $132.7 million, which increased its total holdings to 12,345 BTC.

The latest purchase has changed the game The average purchase price for the 1,234 BTC was about 15.6 million Japanese yen, or roughly $107,557 per coin, aligning with recent market prices and reinforcing Metaplanet’s aggressive buying strategy. Following this move, the firm’s cumulative Bitcoin (BTC) investment now totals around $1.2 billion, with its holdings valued at over $1.33 billion, leaving the company with an unrealised profit of $110 million. Notably, the latest purchase marked Metaplanet’s fourth BTC acquisition in June alone and was its largest since it adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy in April 2024. CEO Simon Gerovich confirmed the move via social media, calling it a strategic leap that edges the firm closer to top-tier Bitcoin holders such as CleanSpark and Galaxy Digital. With just a modest addition of 1,000 BTC, Metaplanet could leap into the fifth position globally, surpassing both CleanSpark and Galaxy Digital. Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin goals Metaplanet’s recent acquisition follows the announcement of a ¥74.9 billion equity offering, led by institutional partner EVO FUND, a deal that represents the largest single-day capital raise for Bitcoin purchases by a public company.

The plan includes key milestones: 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 100,000 BTC by 2026, eventually targeting 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. To support this, the company recently approved a $5 billion capital injection into its US subsidiary, Metaplanet Treasury Corp., signalling its intent to scale internationally. Metaplanet shares rise as Bitcoin yield surges Despite some market hesitation, Metaplanet’s stock has shown remarkable performance, rallying 322% year-to-date and over 350% since its pivot to a Bitcoin-focused strategy. However, following the announcement of its latest BTC purchase, shares dipped 5% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, closing at 1,509 yen and extending a week-long slide. Analysts believe the temporary pullback is a response to short-term dilution fears, even as the firm’s long-term outlook remains bullish due to its rising Bitcoin yield. Quarter-to-date, Metaplanet has recorded a BTC yield of 112.2%, and year-to-date returns have soared to 315%, signalling robust performance from its crypto treasury. Across the globe, firms like Nakamoto Holdings, Parataxis, and K33 are increasing BTC exposure, and Metaplanet is emerging as the leader among this new wave of Bitcoin treasuries. By overtaking Tesla and approaching top players like Riot Platforms, the firm is solidifying its reputation as “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” with a clearly defined roadmap to becoming one of the world’s most influential Bitcoin holders.

2025-06-26T10:28:18,"Prediction Market Kalshi Achieves Unicorn Status with $185 Raised at its $2B Evaluation, as BTC Bull Token Predicts a $250K Bitcoin","Prediction market platform Kalshy has officially become a unicorn, raising $185 million in a Series C round that values the company at $2 billion. The funding round was led by top crypto VC firm Paradigm, marking a major milestone for Kalshy as it continues to redefine how people bet on real-world events. CEO Tarek Mansour took to X to announce the good news, stating that: ‘People choose to work at Kalshi not because of the money we’ve raised, but because of our ambition: build the most important financial market on the planet.’ — Tarek Mansour, X post This milestone comes just over six months after Kalshy was valued at $785 million in December 2024, following a $50 million private equity raise, according to PitchBook . Kalshi’s outstanding evaluation shows a growing interest in prediction markets, which links to the ongoing developments in the crypto adoption sphere. Kalshi’s ZeroHash Web3 Integration Also Behind the Mastercard-ChainLink Partnership ZeroHash , a notable crypto and stablecoin infrastructure provider, was also named after integrating with Kalshi to allow for crypto transactions and digital asset deposits. The same ZeroHash is linked to the mammoth partnership between Mastercard and ChainLink , which would allow 3B+ customers to execute on-chain transactions to purchase cryptocoins. This translates to seamless fiat-to-crypto transactions, which also links to the recent developments in the banking system, with the announcement of JPMD, marking the partnership between JPMorgan and Coinbase . JPMorgan Deposit Token (JPMD) marks a milestone in the evolution of the financial system, as it allows consumers to transact directly with the blockchain, through Coinbase’s BASE, which would render the already inefficient COBOL programming language entirely obsolete. But what does this all mean? It means that the financial system is gradually shifting towards blockchain technology, primarily for its effectiveness, but also for its growth potential and the signs are clear, as Kalshi’s case isn’t unique. Polymarket also expects over $200M at its $1B evaluation, in a round led by billionaire Peter Thiel, which would grant it unicorn status, as well. This shows that prediction markets are on the rise, which explains why new crypto projects like BTC Bull Token, predicting a $250K $BTC, have such a good community perception. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) Predicts a $250K Bitcoin, the Next Realistic Milestone Before its $1M Price Point BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is Bitcoin’s most excited cheerleader and one of the best presales of 2025, with over $7.4M raised so far. The project rests on the idea that Bitcoin will reach a $250K price point soon and that a $1M milestone is not unrealistic either. Based on this idea, BTC Bull Token aims to rally the Bitcoin community and attract new investors by linking its token’s chart path to that of Bitcoin. In other words, when $BTC grows, $BTCBULL grows with it. This is possible thanks to several things, like the airdrop system, with the project offering you $BTC airdrops every time Bitcoin reaches predetermined price points ($150K and $200K). To qualify for the airdrop, you need to keep your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet , though, so make sure you create your account before everything else. Best Wallet is free to use and a great tool for beginners. An even larger $BTCBULL airdrop awaits when Bitcoin reaches $250K, offering plenty of incentives for you to join the hype train. And speaking of incentives and predictions, $BTCBULL promises to make it big post-launch. Based on the project’s performance and scope, our analysts predict a price point for $BTCBULL of $0.006467 by the end of 2025. It may not seem like a large number, but it would make for a growth of 150%, based on today’s presale price of $0.00258. By 2030, and with widespread adoption and community support, $BTCBULL could reach $0.0497, provided Bitcoin lives up to the expectations as well. This translates into an ROI of 1,826% if you invest today. If you want to check the BTC Bull Token, go to the presale page, buy your $BTCBULL today , and join the 1.9B-strong staking pool to enjoy the 55% dynamic APY rate. Will Bitcoin Live Up to the Predictions? Very few things are certain when it comes to the crypto market, but Bitcoin has a knack for exceeding even the most optimistic predictions and expectations. So, it’s not unrealistic to expect a $250K Bitcoin by the end of 2025; unlikely, but not impossible. And when that happens, projects like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will also reap the benefits, as part of the bull crowd. Don’t forget, this isn’t financial advice.

2025-06-26T10:25:05,"Coinbase: The Time To Be Really Greedy Has Passed (Rating Downgrade)","Summary Q1 financials show solid revenue growth and a promising services trajectory, especially as stablecoins gain traction. Profitability is closely tied to Bitcoin's performance; rising BTC prices directly benefit the business. Valuation metrics like P/S and P/E suggest fair value to overvaluation while technicals are overbought. While strong opportunities remain, the stock is now a hold; it will be a buy if it drops 20%+. Introduction Coinbase Global Inc. ( COIN ) is a stock that I have been covering very frequently since I've started contributing to Seeking Alpha in March 2025. Here is the link to my previous two coverages which I suggest reading first. On April 10, I rated COIN a Strong Buy, in what was an article of great conviction. My main thesis was (and still remains) that they would severely underperform in Q1 2025 (which they did) but excel in remaining 2025 quarters, especially further towards year-end, aligning with cryptocurrency price cycles. On May 12, I reiterated my bullishness but downgraded to buy, as a result of higher valuations and weaker technicals. The returns after these two pieces stand at 111%, respective 73%. Data by YCharts Today, I will revisit Coinbase and outline my case for why I think it has become a Hold. Spoiler alert: In addition to having already reached my price target of $330, this is due to a much higher valuation and less favorable technicals again. Developments We remember Q1 2025 financials , which saw revenues of $2B and net income of $66M. Adjusted EBITDA was $930M and just slightly down YoY. Services continue to make up a larger share of COIN's revenues as QoQ, this share grew from 28% to 36%. The growth trajectory of services is truly significant for Coinbase as it both diversifies their revenue streams and makes them more predictable, a feature Coinbase has clearly lacked before (but I would argue they still do). Overall, analysts on Seeking Alpha seem to get super excited about the service revenue growth and rate Coinbase a Buy mostly based on them. Personally, I believe that service revenue growth will not stick at current rates in a crypto bear market whatsoever and might actually slightly decline (which would still be good as it offers a buffer of predictable revenue). Further, projected rate cuts would also be detrimental to the stablecoin part of their business, earning revenue from interest. The recently passed GENIUS bill does limit my stance somewhat, as it brings clear regulatory approval to stablecoins like USDC - of which Coinbase is a key stakeholder. Coinbase earns 100% of interest income from USDC held on their platform and 50% of all other interest income. With many companies now focusing on stablecoins, USDC seems like a good choice and should see further adoption, benefiting Coinbase. For now, Coinbase is only lavishly profitable when Bitcoin prices rise, and they can report high net income due to a combination of higher transaction revenues and holdings gains. Cycle theory suggests Bitcoin price gains may come to an end in early 2026. COIN will have to prove that they can withstand such a period. At the same time, they are valued at high multiples (I will get to them in a second) which makes them much more susceptible to multiple compression, a scenario likely to occur in a crypto bear market, or an intensified global trade war , or an actual global war . These are key risks to every stock, which I get, but trading at extended valuations does make Coinbase more sensitive for such scenarios. When it comes to this year, I do see a breakout of recent Bitcoin ATHs, with a price target of $150k. I derived this price target from working through the Bitwise Bitcoin Investment Thesis paper, published in Spring 2024, which I suggest readers to go through as well. The Bitcoin halving reduces the supply which necessitates the price to move up in order to create an equilibrium. Their model saw $103k as a price target for year-end 2024. This was super close to the $108k reached mid-December and even slightly conservative. For late 2025, they estimate $172k, making my price target achievable. Valuation At a 13.5X P/S ratio, COIN's valuation has shot up drastically. Their P/E ratio of 65X also looks very stretched. For me, these levels are still not extended too much as I expect Coinbase to grow their revenues and most importantly profits significantly into year-end 2025, which will make these levels drop substantially. Still, they are much higher than in both my previous coverages, which increases the risk associated with investing in Coinbase. Data by YCharts Personally, I also find it useful to check COIN's valuation compared to Bitcoin as they are very closely correlated. In my last analysis, Coinbase was trading below Bitcoin on the one-year chart, but now it shot above it again, which might be an indication that most of the short-term appreciation has been achieved already. Data by YCharts On the weekly COIN chart, the high green bar in the MACD cannot be missed. Also, price just skyrocketed through the upper ends of the Bollinger Bands, which has led to pullbacks every single time for the last two years. TradingView Monthly RSI is at a key resistance as well, sitting at 64. These were the same levels this bull market has seen twice, shortly before going into correction mode. TradingView Daily RSI as well as distance from the 200-day MA both look very stretched. Historically, these have also led to pullbacks. TradingView $4.5B of net income in 2025 (or on a TTM basis after Q3 2024) could be doable when crypto bull markets continue. The market has to be unaware of a cyclical top that is being built up. In that case, Coinbase could be trading at a 25X P/E ratio, which would bring the market cap to $112.5B, a gain of 29% from today. So why am I not rating the stock a Buy when it could return almost 30% in 6 months? Well, first, this is an optimistic scenario and second, the perceived risk has gone up a lot. As of my previous coverage, there have been much better risk/reward opportunities to buy Coinbase. But due to the upside potential it is still a Hold with the chance to become a Buy again, if an expected pullback of 20+% manifests. This would increase investors' margin of safety, as one can use more conservative assumptions at those prices for the same upside potential (say just $4B in net income at a 22.5X P/E = 25% implied upside potential after a 20% drop in price) Conclusion Strong opportunities do remain for Coinbase, particularly amid crypto bull market continuation and now stablecoin adoption. However, valuation has expanded substantially, which I anticipated but do not want to keep betting on at these levels. Technical indicators also suggest the stock could use a short-term breather. To be clear, I am not calling for a crash or suggesting Coinbase is necessarily a bad investment. I simply prefer a cheaper price to maintain a healthy uptrend and reenter after having sold 20% of my position on this spike. I may have been slightly too conservative on COIN, but that is not an issue given I still hold shares bought at attractive entry points. All in all, while it is not the worst buy today, it's also not the best anymore. Hold . A 20+% pullback might change my opinion which I would give an update to (either in the comments or in the form of a new article given there are enough updates until then.)",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797394-coinbase-the-time-to-be-really-greedy-has-passed-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","COIN",cryptocompare

2025-06-26T10:20:27,"Crypto ETF: Unlocking the Future – SEC Commissioner Hints at Physical Redemptions","BitcoinWorld Crypto ETF: Unlocking the Future – SEC Commissioner Hints at Physical Redemptions The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and few topics generate as much buzz as the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. For years, the crypto community has yearned for more seamless and efficient ways to interact with digital assets through regulated financial products. A recent statement from a prominent figure at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reignited hope, suggesting a pivotal shift on the horizon. Imagine a future where your Crypto ETF could offer more than just cash settlements – a future where physical redemptions become a reality. This seemingly small technical detail could unlock significant benefits for investors and the broader market. Why Are Physical Redemptions a Game-Changer for Crypto ETFs? For many, the term ‘physical redemptions’ might sound like financial jargon, but its implications for cryptocurrency ETFs are profound. Currently, most approved Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the U.S. operate on a ‘cash-create/redeem’ model. This means that when an authorized participant (AP) wants to redeem ETF shares, they receive cash equivalent to the underlying asset’s value, not the asset itself (Bitcoin, in this case). This process often requires the AP to sell Bitcoin on the open market to fulfill the cash redemption, potentially adding selling pressure. Physical redemptions , on the other hand, would allow ETF holders (or their authorized participants) to directly receive the underlying cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) when they redeem their ETF shares. This ‘in-kind’ transfer offers several key advantages: Reduced Market Impact: By eliminating the need for APs to sell crypto on the open market during redemptions, this mechanism can significantly reduce potential selling pressure, leading to a more stable and efficient market. Improved Price Discovery: Direct transfer of assets can lead to more accurate pricing and less arbitrage opportunity between the ETF and the underlying spot market. Operational Efficiency: It can streamline the redemption process, potentially reducing costs and complexities associated with cash settlements. True Asset Ownership Proxy: For investors who want exposure to the underlying asset without directly holding it, physical redemption offers a closer proxy to actual ownership, enhancing the appeal of the ETF. This is why the prospect of physical redemptions for a Crypto ETF is such a significant topic of discussion among industry experts and investors alike. The Vision of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce : A Beacon of Hope? The recent spark of optimism comes directly from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce , affectionately known in the crypto community as ‘Crypto Mom’ for her consistently forward-thinking stance on digital assets. During a panel discussion hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute , Commissioner Peirce expressed her belief that the SEC will, at some point, allow physical issuances and redemptions for cryptocurrency ETFs. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a statement from a high-ranking official who also heads the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force, indicating a potential shift in regulatory philosophy. Commissioner Peirce has long been an advocate for regulatory clarity and innovation in the crypto space. Her consistent calls for a more pragmatic approach to digital asset regulation have often contrasted with the SEC’s more cautious, enforcement-first stance. Her vision for crypto regulation includes: Embracing Innovation: She believes regulation should not stifle technological advancements but rather provide clear guidelines for them to flourish responsibly. Protecting Investors Prudently: While acknowledging the need for investor protection, she advocates for a balanced approach that doesn’t over-regulate emerging technologies out of existence. Fair and Consistent Application: Peirce has often highlighted the need for consistent application of securities laws to digital assets, rather than creating an entirely new, potentially stifling, framework. Her statement at the Bitcoin Policy Institute panel underscores her continued commitment to these principles and offers a glimpse into a future where the SEC might adopt a more accommodating stance towards advanced crypto financial products. What Challenges Stand in the Way of Physical Redemptions ? While the prospect is exciting, the path to physical redemptions is not without its hurdles. The SEC’s historical reluctance stems from several concerns, primarily related to investor protection and market integrity: Custody and Security: Transferring actual cryptocurrency in and out of an ETF raises complex questions about secure custody, hot and cold storage, and the potential for hacks or loss during transfer. Ensuring institutional-grade security for physical redemptions is paramount. Regulatory Compliance: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations become more intricate when dealing with direct crypto transfers. The SEC would need to be convinced that robust mechanisms are in place to prevent illicit activities. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators have historically worried about the potential for market manipulation in unregulated crypto markets. While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs suggests some comfort, physical redemptions might introduce new vectors for concern. Operational Complexity: The technical infrastructure required for seamless and secure physical transfers at scale is significant. This involves sophisticated blockchain integration, secure wallets, and robust reconciliation processes. Overcoming these challenges will require close collaboration between the crypto industry, traditional financial institutions, and regulatory bodies. The evolution of custody solutions and regulatory frameworks will be key. The Bitcoin Policy Institute and the Broader Dialogue Commissioner Peirce’s remarks were made at a panel discussion hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute , an organization dedicated to educating policymakers and the public about Bitcoin and its potential. Such forums are crucial for fostering dialogue between innovators, policymakers, and academics. They provide a platform for nuanced discussions about the future of digital assets, helping to bridge the gap between the fast-paced crypto world and the often-slower pace of regulatory development. The very existence of such institutes and the willingness of high-ranking officials like Commissioner Peirce to engage with them signals a growing maturity in the crypto ecosystem. It moves the conversation beyond mere speculation to a more structured and policy-oriented debate about how digital assets can be integrated safely and efficiently into the broader financial system. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Future of Crypto? For the average investor, the allowance of physical redemptions for a Crypto ETF could signify increased confidence from regulators, potentially leading to a broader array of sophisticated crypto-backed financial products. It could also: Attract More Institutional Capital: Institutions often seek the most efficient and robust mechanisms for managing assets. Physical redemptions could make crypto ETFs even more appealing to large-scale investors. Enhance Market Liquidity: A more efficient redemption process can contribute to overall market liquidity and stability. Pave the Way for Other Crypto ETFs: If physical redemptions are approved for Bitcoin ETFs, it could set a precedent for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, expanding the investment landscape. While Commissioner Peirce’s statement is not a guarantee of immediate change, it is a powerful indicator of the direction of thought within parts of the SEC. It suggests that the agency is not static and that, eventually, the benefits of certain crypto innovations may outweigh the perceived risks in the eyes of regulators. Conclusion: A Glimpse into a More Mature Crypto Market The journey of cryptocurrency from niche technology to mainstream financial asset has been long and often fraught with regulatory uncertainty. However, the recent approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the U.S. and now the insightful comments from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce about the eventual allowance of physical redemptions mark significant milestones. Her vision, articulated at the Bitcoin Policy Institute panel, points towards a future where the financial infrastructure surrounding digital assets becomes more robust, efficient, and aligned with traditional market practices. While the timeline remains uncertain, the prospect of physical redemptions for Crypto ETF products represents a crucial step towards a more mature, integrated, and accessible crypto market for investors worldwide. It’s a future where the ‘physical’ transfer of digital assets could truly redefine how we interact with cryptocurrency investments.

Invesco Ltd and Galaxy Digital LP combined forces to offer another Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). They filed the appropriate paperwork with the SEC and joined at least 12 other potential spot and future ETFs on the SEC to rule on their status. The competition for the leading $SOL ETF takes place at the most visible end of the crypto ecosystem. Far lower down, there’s a different race on, with Snorter poised to corner the market in the fast-paced world of Solana meme coins on Telegram. It’s two ends of the same spectrum and speaks to the growing strength and versatility of the Solana ecosystem. Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF Ready to List Why the race for a Solana ETF? Partly because of the tremendous success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs: $IBIT: iShares Bitcoin Trust, $70.6B Assets Under Management (AUM) $FBTC: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, $20.4B AUM $GBTC: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, $19.6B AUM $ETHA: iShares Ethereum Trust, $3.9B AUM $ETHE: Grayscale Ethereum Trust, $2.8B AUM It’s no surprise that more players are ready to enter the game, particularly as the realms of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) move ever-closer together. Only $BTC and $ETH currently have single-asset crypto ETFs, but the pile of pending filings includes everything from $XRP to $SOL to the first-ever NFT ETF, with Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU). And with single-asset crypto ETFs rolling along, institutions aren’t waiting around for the SEC. They’ve already started to move towards multi-asset ETFs. Converting Existing Funds to Multi-Asset ETFs One of the holdups so far has been that the SEC lacks a clear set of rules around crypto ETFs, even after the $BTC and $ETH approvals went ahead. The question now is, will the SEC hold approvals until they draw up new rules? Or will they approve first and develop the rule set as they go? There is some time pressure at work here. Grayscale wants to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) to an ETF, and the deadline for that is July 2. That fund already holds a number of crypto assets, including $XRP, $SOL, and $ADA. If the conversion is approved, look for others to follow. Investment managers from Bitwise to Hasdex have plans to convert other funds to multi-asset ETFs that include cryptos. The funds sit at the top of the financial and investment world, and every one that gets approved boosts Solana’s long-term outlook just slightly. But much, much farther down, there’s another reason to be excited for Solana. The frenetic, fast-paced world of Solana meme coin trading just got a tool that could bring much-needed clarity and make finding those 10x or 100x opportunities much easier. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – One Bot to Rule Them All for Meme Coin Trading on Telegram What do you need to find and trade memes on Telegram? You need: Lightning-fast transactions and swaps Automated sniping, to get in and out at the right time Protection from rug pulls, honeypots, and front-running trades Thankfully, traders now have Snorter Bot , the meme coin-styled trading bot designed specifically for trading low-cap Solana memes on Telegram. The $SNORT token powers the bot, providing for rapid trade execution and the lowest fees possible. The project’s presale has already raised nearly $1.3M in a few weeks, indicating broad support.

No more avoiding Telegram tokens; traders can dive in with confidence with Snorter. Visit the Snorter website to learn more . Solana ETFs Mark the Next Stage of Crypto Adoption As plans proceed, even the rate of ETF filings indicates just how fast crypto adoption is moving.

2025-06-26T10:08:17,"Bitcoin Miners Just Saw Their Worst Payday in Over a Year – Here’s Why","The post Bitcoin Miners Just Saw Their Worst Payday in Over a Year – Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News June has been brutal for Bitcoin miners. New on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that miner revenue has dropped to just $34 million a day, the lowest since April. It’s the weakest miners have seen in more than a year – and one of the worst stretches since July 2022. “Bitcoin miners just saw their worst payday in a year,” CryptoQuant said in a post on X . For an industry that runs on thin margins and constant pressure, that’s a big red flag. What’s Behind the Crash? Two key factors are behind this sharp drop in miner income. First, Bitcoin’s transaction fees have fallen by 50%, cutting into what miners earn on top of block rewards. Second, Bitcoin’s price itself has dropped around 15%, which directly impacts miner revenue. When both fees and price take a hit, miners feel it fast. That’s exactly what we’re seeing now and it’s pushing profits close to their lowest point in two years. Margins are tight, rewards are down, and the pressure is building. If this continues, some miners may be forced to scale down or shut off rigs until things improve. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Whales Aren’t Moving the Same Way While miners are struggling, Bitcoin’s biggest holders, the whales, are showing mixed signals. According to Glassnode, there’s no clear pattern among whale wallets right now. Smaller whales, those holding 1 to 10 BTC, are redistributing their coins, possibly locking in profits or shifting strategies. But larger wallets holding 10 to 100 BTC are accumulating instead. That contrast is important. Bigger whales buying usually signals confidence and that might explain why Bitcoin is trying to break above $108,000, a level it’s been testing recently. Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score supports this, rising from 0.25 to 0.57 – showing a noticeable uptick in accumulation by these mid-sized whale wallets. As $BTC attempts to reclaim $108K, the Accumulation Trend Score shows no unified cohort behavior. 1–10 #BTC wallets continue distributing, while 10–100 $BTC are net accumulators. Others show mixed signals, though the overall score has rebounded from 0.25 to 0.57 pic.twitter.com/qAivkvziK3 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 26, 2025 So, Where Does This Leave the Market? Right now, the market’s split. Miners are under pressure, but whales are stepping in. If Bitcoin can hold above $108K, it could ease some of the stress on miners and validate the recent accumulation. But if the price drops further, things could get worse before they get better. Either way, this is a moment to watch closely. The choices miners and whales make now could set the tone for what’s next in this cycle.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-miners-just-saw-their-worst-payday-in-over-a-year-heres-why/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

During his speech at Permissionless on June 25, a crypto conference in New York , Folkman declared that World Liberty Financial native token, WLFI, has garnered increasing interest among publicly-listed companies. He credited Michael Saylor’s Strategy as the trailblazer that led many corporations that previously never touched crypto to consider holding digital assets in their balance sheet and as part of their corporate reserves. As opposed to only holding fiat, more companies across the globe have been accumulating Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other major tokens as a hedge against inflation. Folkman claimed that companies are also eyeing World Liberty Financial’s token as a potential addition to their corporate reserves. “There has been a lot of interest from several public vehicles who want to use WLFI to be held in their treasuries as well,” said Folkman as quoted by Bloomberg.

2025-06-26T10:06:39,"Bitcoin Illiquid Supply Climbs to Over 14M BTC, Reflects Strong HODL Trend","Bitcoin’s BTC illiquid supply has surged to 14.37 million BTC, jumping from 13.9 million BTC at the start of 2025, according to Glassnode data. With bitcoin’s current circulating supply standing at approximately 19.8 million, this means over 72 percent of all mined BTC is now classified as illiquid. Illiquid supply refers to the portion of BTC held by entities with minimal spending behavior, such as long-term investors and cold wallet holders. These coins are effectively taken out of the market, reducing the amount available for trading. As more investors opt to store bitcoin rather than trade it, the liquid portion of the supply shrinks, tightening market availability. This trend is significant because a growing illiquid supply often reflects increasing investor confidence and long-term conviction. It also creates the potential for a supply-side shock, where rising demand meets limited available supply, historically associated with bullish price movements. The continued rise in bitcoin illiquidity supports the narrative of bitcoin as a store of value. If this trajectory holds, it could place upward pressure on price, particularly in the context of heightened market interest and diminishing miner issuance. This underscores liquidity analysis as a key indicator for market sentiment and future price action.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/26/bitcoin-illiquid-supply-climbs-to-over-14m-btc-reflects-strong-hodl-trend,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Glassnode|News",cryptocompare

The U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHHA) has issued a new directive that allows Americans to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to qualify for a mortgage, without converting their crypto into dollars. This step could bring digital assets into the heart of the $20 trillion U.S. mortgage market, signaling a big moment for crypto’s role in everyday finance. Good news for the 55 million Americans who own crypto. @NatCryptoAssoc https://t.co/zUG8hWP1wk — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 25, 2025 Bitcoin Just Got Closer to the American Dream Under Director Bill Pulte, the FHFA has instructed mortgage titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to integrate cryptocurrency payments into mortgage eligibility assessments. This directive positions Bitcoin as a credible form of collateral in mainstream finance, a sentiment echoed by MicroStrategy cofounder Michael Saylor, who called it a “defining moment” for institutional adoption. “Future generations will remember this as the moment Bitcoin entered the American dream,” Saylor declared in a recent X post . Analyst Eric Coleman stated that this action might allow younger Americans, who are frequently excluded from the housing market will now secure their first mortgages through crypto assets. New Hope for First-Time Homebuyers Analyst Eric Coleman said the change could help younger Americans, especially those struggling to break into the housing market, use their crypto holdings to qualify for home loans. Treating Bitcoin as a reserve asset within the U.S. housing system may finally give digital-native investors a path toward owning property, something that’s long been out of reach for many. But Not Everyone’s Celebrating Despite the excitement, some experts are urging caution. Crypto remains a volatile asset class, and critics warn this move could carry risks similar to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Others in the Bitcoin community have raised concerns around self-custody. To qualify for a mortgage, crypto assets may need to be held on centralized platforms like Coinbase. This raises questions about privacy, ownership, and the trade-offs between regulation and decentralization. Ripple and the Bigger Picture As Ripple and other blockchain companies push for more crypto-friendly regulations, the FHFA directive marks a clear step forward. It blends traditional housing finance with digital innovation in a way that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Is this the moment crypto truly goes mainstream?

2025-06-26T10:03:50,"Ripple Doesn’t Control XRP? John Deaton Says It’s Decentralized","The post Ripple Doesn’t Control XRP? John Deaton Says It’s Decentralized appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the United States moves forward with clearer cryptocurrency regulations , one of the most debated topics — Is XRP centralized? — is finally finding resolution. Many critics have long argued that Ripple’s control over a large portion of XRP supply makes it centralized. But recent legal outcomes and technical facts prove otherwise. Why People Think XRP Is Centralized The confusion largely stems from Ripple holding around 40% of the total XRP supply. This has led many to believe Ripple controls the network. But this is a misunderstanding of how XRP works. On June 26, prominent crypto attorney John E. Deaton addressed this on X (formerly Twitter), stating: “75K XRP holders from 143 countries around the globe is pretty darn decentralized to me. People often conflate the token of the network with the network itself.” He clarified that owning a large number of tokens doesn’t equal controlling the protocol. Ripple’s Legal Win Clarifies XRP’s Status The debate around XRP’s centralization intensified due to the SEC lawsuit that began in 2020, accusing Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security. After nearly five years of legal proceedings, the case officially concluded on May 8, 2025 , with Ripple winning a favorable outcome and paying only a reduced penalty. Importantly, the court confirmed that XRP is not a security when traded in secondary markets, reinforcing its status as a decentralized digital asset. This decision provided legal clarity and boosted investor confidence. Why XRP Is Technically Decentralized Beyond legal clarity and community ownership, several technical aspects of the XRP Ledger support its decentralized nature: 1. Independent Validators The XRP Ledger runs on a consensus model with over 150 independent validators . Ripple controls only one validator , meaning it cannot force changes or manipulate the network. 2. No Centralized Mining XRP doesn’t use proof-of-work like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This avoids control by mining pools and ensures equal participation from validators. 3. 80% Consensus Required for Changes Any update to the XRP Ledger must gain 80% validator approval for two consecutive weeks. This strict requirement makes unilateral control by Ripple impossible. [post_titles_links postid=”475091″] Ripple CEO: Utility Over Ideology Even Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple , recently argued that decentralization shouldn’t be the only benchmark. He emphasized that what matters is the utility, transparency, and security of the network — not just ideology. While Ripple does hold a significant amount of XRP, it has no control over the XRP Ledger’s rules or validation process. That power lies with a diverse and global community. Final Thought The long-standing debate over XRP’s centralization is finally settling, thanks to facts, legal clarity, and growing global participation. With 75,000 XRP holders across 143 countries, over 150 validators, and a network that demands consensus for change, XRP is proving itself to be a decentralized asset at its core.Ripple may be the face of XRP, but it is not the hand behind the curtain.

2025-06-26T10:00:40,"Major whale dumps $2.49M worth of $TRUMP tokens","As Trump’s Truth Social is angling to launch a shiny new Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, one major $TRUMP whale is quietly sneaking out the back door. A wallet tagged as “Kewh32” placed a major limit order to offload 275,672 $TRUMP tokens worth $2.49 million. OFFICIAL TRUMP price is already down by 30% over the last 30 days. All this quiet offloading is unfolding just as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) officially went to bat for Trump’s proposed Truth Social ETF. It was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to greenlight a new rule allowing it to list. If approved, the ETF would launch within 90 days and mark a huge leap in Trump’s push into crypto finance. Trump meme whale dumps millions According to the data shared by Lookonchain, the whale who dumped $2.49 million worth of TRUMP tokens had already sold 100k TRUMPs (approx. worth $1 million) just 15 days ago. It still holds over 369,000 TRUMP, worth another $3.3 million. The whale is peeling off positions like it’s pre-election tax season. This gets even worse for the token as around the same time, the Trump Meme Team pulled liquidity. They removed 4.4 million USDC and 347,438 TRUMP tokens (approx. worth $3.12 million). Then comes the next move, they bridged the USDC to Ethereum and dropped $TRUMP into a fresh new wallet. It is being considered as a little wallet cleaning, but maybe it is a stealthy exit. The #Trump Meme Team removed 4.4M $USDC and 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) in liquidity 6 hours ago. They then bridged 4.4M $USDC to #Ethereum and transferred 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) to a new wallet. https://t.co/ORSLE6vJiA https://t.co/SYyNae1nio pic.twitter.com/okTk1u0Ow9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 26, 2025 TRUMP price is on a decline lately, it is down by almost 40% in the last 60 days, while it dropped marginally over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, TRUMP is still up by 645% on the year to date (YTD) basis, trading at an average price of $9 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume stood at $268 million. Its partner token, Official Melania Meme, has also witnessed a heavy dump since the launch. MELANIA price is now down by 98% from its all time high of $13.73. It is trading at an average price of $0.213 at press time. Trump plans $2.5B Bitcoin bet via Truth Social As the crypto market recovers, Trump Media has already proposed both a combined Bitcoin-and-Ethereum ETF and a standalone Bitcoin ETF. It has even teased a $2.5 billion fundraise to make Truth Social one of the largest Bitcoin holders on the planet. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs are still soaking up billions, and Trump’s play could turn DJT into a meme stock and a crypto giant in one MAGA-powered shot. But here’s the kicker, DJT is 52% owned by a Trump trust. This suggests that if these ETFs go live and if that meme coin liquidity mysteriously returns, Donald Trump could end up riding a Bitcoin-fueled redemption arc that’s equal parts ETF and meme magic. The global digital assets market surged marginally on Thursday, holding the $3.31 trillion cap. Bitcoin price rallied to hit $108k from below the $100k mark over the last 7 days.

2025-06-26T10:00:28,"XRP Bulls On Alert—’This Trendline Is Everything,’ Says Analyst","XRP spent the past forty-eight hours coiling into a textbook inflection zone, and the 15-minute chart published by independent analyst Casi makes it hard to miss where the battle lines now stand. Price is hovering at $2.18, clinging to a steeply rising trendline that has underpinned every impulsive thrust since the local swing low near the 0.618 retracement at $1.9824 on 23 June. That trendline intersects a horizontal shelf of former resistance-turned-support at the 1.618 extension measured from the same base move, labelled on the chart at $2.186. The confluence forms the geometric “apex of consolidation” Casi has been highlighting on X. XRP Price At Breaking Point “This trendline is everything right now,” Casi wrote. “We just got a clean reaction off it. This correction already reached the .382 retracement at $2.145, which also happens to be the apex of consolidation… that’s the most critical level on the chart, short-term.” The most recent corrective pullback already tagged the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the advance, exactly at $2.145, before bulls forced a reaction. As long as candles continue to close above that retracement—effectively the floor of the micro-range—Casi argues that the underlying market structure remains constructive. A decisive break beneath $2.145, by contrast, would represent both a loss of the diagonal trendline and a surrender of the consolidation base, signalling short-term weakness and, in his words, “opening the door to a deeper flush.” Related Reading: XRP Pullback Nearly Complete—Next Stop: $8 To $12, Says Analyst Overhead, XRP must still reckon with layered resistance. The first ceiling sits at $2.20, but the level called out as “the next big test” is the thicker pink band at $2.25. That mark capped price repeatedly during yesterday’s U.S. session and coincides with a prior 1.272 extension of the late-May corrective leg. “If we can flip that level, we’ll likely open the path toward the $2.69 retrace test,” Casi noted, “and from there, the breakout potential increases dramatically!” If price can reclaim $2.25 on expanding volume and then retest it as support, the chart leaves an unobstructed lane toward the 2.618 extension at $2.296—effectively $2.30—and, by projection, the $2.69 Fibonacci target that would complete the measured-move roadmap Casi is tracking. Related Reading: XRP To $30 Beyond 2026? Analyst Reveals Key BTC Ratio To Watch Momentum, however, is not yet offering a clean green light. The lower pane shows a 14-period RSI capped by its own descending trendline that has compressed every rally since 24 June. With the oscillator printing 46.24 (signal) versus 43.59 (base line) at the time of the screenshot, the gauge is climbing but still mid-range. A marginal higher high in price paired with a lower high in RSI would etch a textbook bearish divergence—an outcome Casi told one follower he is “expecting to set up” if XRP pierces $2.25 before consolidating anew. “I think this next high will form a bearish div,” he added. “The RSI is telling me it’s about to set that up.” In short, the token is balanced on a knife-edge: the bull case hinges on the integrity of the $2.145–$2.186 support complex and a breakout through $2.25, while the bear case rests on trendline failure and an RSI divergence confirming upside exhaustion. With liquidity thinning into the weekend, the resolution of this narrow consolidation could shape the next wave—whether that proves to be the ignition of a larger third impulse or the start of a deeper corrective detour. As Casi put it, “This is the kind of price action you want to see if XRP is serious about continuing this new trend to the upside.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.19.

2025-06-26T10:00:05,"Bitcoin (BTC) Holds at $104K After UK Jobs Drop — Micro Cap DeFi Token at $0.03 Gears for 20× Relist Move","After a disappointing UK labor report raised new concerns about the pace of economic recovery, global markets have shifted into observation mode. Central banks are signaling a temporary pause as policymakers assess long-term inflation risks against weaker job growth. Bitcoin (BTC) has remained steady near $104,000, indicating a broader appetite for digital assets as macro turbulence grows. But while BTC holds the spotlight, a lesser-known DeFi token priced at just $0.03 is building momentum for a much larger breakout. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol currently in presale, is capturing growing attention from early-stage investors preparing for a shift in liquidity flows. With over $11.2 million raised so far and more than 12,450 unique holders already participating, this micro-cap project is entering a pivotal phase. The presale’s fifth round is already 50% sold out—and once it concludes, the price will climb, eliminating the current discounted entry. For those searching for the next 20× play, the window is open now—but not for long. A Presale Blueprint Geared for Massive Post-Launch Multiples What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its structured approach to both capital raising and utility buildout. Unlike speculative tokens that push out flashy promises, Mutuum has laid out a development timeline grounded in progressive technical delivery, including Layer-2 scalability, overcollateralized borrowing, and dual lending formats. Each presale phase has been carefully designed to scale both investment inflow and token price, starting at $0.01 and culminating at $0.06 by the final round. Those entering at today’s $0.03 level stand to gain a minimum 2x at listing price alone—excluding the compounding upside once the platform goes live and capital utilization takes off. Based on comparable DeFi growth paths, a 20x return is well within reach. The protocol has also undergone an extensive smart contract audit by CertiK, achieving a 75.56 Skynet Score and an 95.00 token scan rating—metrics that demonstrate serious attention to infrastructure quality. Meanwhile, investor trust continues to build as community milestones are achieved: a growing online presence, over 10K followers on social channels, and a $100,000 giveaway targeting long-term believers, where ten users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t waiting for macro conditions to improve—it’s positioning itself as the protocol of choice for yield hunters looking for full autonomy. Deposits are made through smart contracts that issue mtTokens, which reflect not just your principal but also real-time earnings. These mtTokens can be sold, staked, or even reused as collateral for other DeFi positions—allowing users to remain active while earning passive income. Built for Real Yield in a Slow Market With stablecoin transfers exceeding $717 billion in Q2 2025, it’s clear that investors are already repositioning into decentralized environments in search of predictable income. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a decentralized stablecoin that stays anchored to $1, minted only when users borrow against solid collateral like ETH. When loans are repaid or liquidated, the stablecoin is burned to regulate supply. This system works alongside a governance-driven interest model that adjusts borrowing costs to help maintain price stability. When demand is too high and price rises above $1, borrowing rates will drop. When it falls below peg, rates will be increased—supported by built-in arbitrage opportunities that keep equilibrium in place. Users will also be able to participate in Mutuum’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools, where they’ll earn adaptive yield from real-time borrowing activity. As demand increases, so does the interest paid to depositors. Unlike staking programs that rely on inflation, this yield is fully backed by borrower fees. For more active participants, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will unlock custom lending terms, allowing customized rates on popular tokens like BTC, ETH, or even smaller-cap coins that centralized platforms ignore. The passive dividend mechanism will further strengthen demand for the MUTM token itself. A portion of protocol revenue will be used to buy MUTM on the open market, which is then redistributed to stakers in designated contracts. This buyback structure adds persistent upward pressure to the token’s value while rewarding long-term contributors. All of this will be backed by Layer-2 technology for faster, cheaper transactions, and governed entirely on-chain. Once the current presale ends, the platform will move toward beta testing, with the listing of the MUTM token and the activation of mtToken claiming set to align with that launch window. Early holders will not just have price advantage—they’ll enter with an ownership stake in the protocol’s growth.

Binance continues to dominate among crypto exchanges, especially when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC) trading. However, a report by CoinGecko, published on June 25, suggests that smaller exchanges can compete with Binance in the altcoin market. Specifically, Bitget (BGB) exchange leads in the key mid-spread band for altcoins, which is where most real trading occurs. CoinGecko’s report shows that Binance remains unchallenged in terms of Bitcoin liquidity.

Still, beyond the mid-range, Bitget’s liquidity tapers off. ETH daily liquidity on major centralized exchanges on April 15 | Source: CoinGecko The situation is similar for XRP, where Bitget retains dominance in the 0.3% trading range, after which it quickly declines. Bitget also leads in SOL liquidity, controlling 32% of the share at the 0.6% liquidity range. According to CEO Gracy Chen, Bitget has been working actively to partner with institutional liquidity providers. “Today, institutions drive 80% of our spot volume, futures activity from professional firms has doubled, and 80% of top quant funds trade on Bitget. Liquidity is infrastructure — and we’re building it where the market needs it most,” Gracy Chen, Bitget CEO. Finally, the CoinGecko report notes that liquidity is healthy across all major exchanges, particularly in realistic trading ranges. This indicates a healthy state of the crypto market as it continues to mature and attract more institutional players.

2025-06-26T09:51:04,"PEPE Slides 5% as Hype Fades Despite Elon Musk's April Nod","Pepe (PEPE) PEPE, one of the most prominent meme coins, is struggling to hold investor interest, falling 4.7% over the past 24 hours to $0.000009499, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. As for the broader memecoin sector, the CoinDesk Memecoin Index is down 3.87% in the past 24-hour period. The token's sharp decline marks a continuation of its recent downtrend, which has been marked by intense volatility and heavy intraday selling. Once a retail darling with viral momentum and even a brief nod from Elon Musk back on April 9, PEPE has since slipped in market influence as attention shifts back to Bitcoin. Musk had briefly adopted a PEPE-themed profile picture that day, a move that sent waves through the meme coin space. Still, the hype has largely faded. This downturn is part of a broader shift across crypto markets, where Bitcoin’s dominance has now climbed above 65%, a level not seen in over two years. The trend suggests growing investor preference for BTC over smaller altcoins, especially during periods of uncertainty and declining risk appetite. That shift is being felt acutely by high-beta assets like PEPE. Despite brief price rebounds, PEPE remains under pressure, facing resistance near $0.00001013. Its failure to sustain rallies reflects broader rotation away from meme coins, and its future performance may hinge on whether market sentiment returns to riskier assets or stays anchored in large-cap names. Technical Analysis Highlights PEPE-USD traded within a 16.1% range, falling from $0.00001017 to $0.00000940 between 25 June 09:00 and 26 June 08:00 UTC. Strong resistance formed at $0.00001013 during heavy selling between 25 June 14:00 and 16:00 UTC. A short-term support zone developed at $0.00000946–$0.00000950, where price bounced repeatedly on moderate volume throughout late 25 June and early 26 June. During the final 60 minutes of the analysis window, from 26 June 07:07 to 08:06 UTC, price moved from $0.00000959 to $0.00000955. A spike of 91.9 trillion units at 07:17 UTC on 26 June coincided with a brief 3.1% rally. Prices slipped 0.9% in the final minutes before close, reflecting short-term profit-taking.

2025-06-26T09:44:58,"Newly Uncovered Document Shockingly Claims Ripple Existed In 2004, Years Before Bitcoin","Ripple’s backstory just got a little twist. A newly surfaced document suggests that Ripple was conceived as far back as 2004 — years before Bitcoin was introduced. Ripple Predates Bitcoin? The document, shared by XRP community figure SMOQE, entails a 2014 email exchange between prominent industry insiders, notably tech journalist Reutzel Bailey. Bailey suggested that Ripple’s origin dates back to 2004, four years before Satoshi Nakamoto put out the Bitcoin Whitepaper in 2008, sparking questions about the true origins of the digital finance revolution. 2014 E-mails confirm: “Ripple is older than Bitcoin.” pic.twitter.com/9c8cOF4065 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 24, 2025 According to Bailey, Ryan Fugger first conceived the idea behind Ripple in 2004, creating a platform called RipplePay. This platform sought to facilitate peer-to-peer value transfer without relying on legacy banking rails. Chris Larsen, now Ripple’s Executive Chairman, later advanced the project. Bailey claims that Larsen took advantage of the growing hype around Bitcoin to steer Ripple in a cryptocurrency direction, despite the project’s original focus not being on a public crypto. In the email exchange, Jeffrey Cliff rubbished claims that Ripple was launched as a “copycat math-based currency” riding Bitcoin’s popularity. He stressed that “Ripple predates Bitcoin.” XRP Ledger Emerges In 2012 The timelines imply that Ripple’s concept emerged in 2004, while its cross-border payments cryptocurrency XRP was introduced in 2012, four years after Bitcoin’s public debut. This means that while Ripple might be technically older than Bitcoin, BTC is still the world’s first cryptocurrency, launched by Satoshi four years before XRP. Developers Jed McCaleb , Arthur Britto , and David Schwartz started creating the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in 2011. They aimed to create a more efficient system than Bitcoin, addressing its limitations, particularly its reliance on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. McCaleb convinced Fugger to transform RipplePay into a crypto network, leading to the creation of NewCoin in 2012, which was later renamed OpenCoin and then simply Ripple. The XRPL creators allocated 80 billion XRP to Ripple, with McCaleb personally receiving 9.5 billion XRP. After he departed from Ripple to create Stellar, McCaleb agreed to liquidate his XRP holdings gradually, with the last stash sold in 2022.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/newly-uncovered-document-shockingly-claims-ripple-existed-in-2004-years-before-bitcoin/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED|WALLET|XRP","Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T09:41:37,"Pi Network Faces Volatility Ahead of Pi2Day; Is a Bigger Move Incoming?","The post Pi Network Faces Volatility Ahead of Pi2Day; Is a Bigger Move Incoming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi (PI), currently trading around $0.58, is navigating a volatile stretch, down nearly 8% intraday after a 12% surge earlier this week. The technical chart shows resistance around $0.66, while on-chain fundamentals remain mixed. With the July token unlock looming and the highly anticipated Pi2Day event approaching on June 28, traders are weighing short-term volatility against long-term potential. If the core team delivers on key promises—such as mainnet expansion, AI integration, and smoother KYC—PI could reclaim bullish momentum in the coming weeks. What Just Happened with Pi’s Price? Lately, Pi Network’s price experienced a sudden spike earlier this week, marking local highs at $0.66. This was when market sentiment turned bullish as global tensions eased, triggering a smooth rebound in the Bitcoin price. On the other hand, the excitement around the Pi2Day also intensified, which is looked at as the network’s mid-year milestone event that could deliver updates on AI features, KYC tools, and broader ecosystem upgrades. Many traders who bought the dip under $0.55 saw the rally as a chance to lock in quick gains. Meanwhile, the experienced investors were cautious of the upcoming token unlock in July, where 274 million Pi could enter circulation. That could potentially flood the market—unless there’s a strong demand boost from Pi2Day announcements or growing dApp adoption on the open mainnet. Pi Price Forecast: Cautious Optimism Ever since the launch, the PI has been facing immense upward pressure. Although the bulls tried hard to push the prices higher, they soon experienced immense exhaustion. As a result, the price plunged as the selling pressure surged. The token is undergoing a similar price action now, which suggests the price may encounter a 15% pullback to reach the support if it fails to defend $0.5. The recent rejection from the resistance suggests the buyers are not completely in control, as the volume remains below the average levels. Besides, the volume has been plunging since its inception, which remains the main concern at the moment, indicating a drop in the investor’s confidence and interest. On the other hand, CMF plunges before surpassing the previous highs, and the Ichimoku cloud diverges before undergoing a bullish crossover. The chart patterns and the technical indicators suggest the continuation of a descending trend, which may reach $0.5 in a short while. If the bulls manage to trigger a rebound, a breakout from the wedge could follow; otherwise, a drop to the support at $0.47 is imminent. Pi2Day could be a game changer or a missed opportunity.

2025-06-26T09:41:20,"Bitcoin's Podium-Ready 'Bull Flag' Hints at Price Boom to $140K","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin's BTC price chart is showing a well-formed ""bull flag,"" suggesting a potential breakout to new lifetime highs consistent with some traders' expectations for a price rally to $140,000 and higher. BTC surged to a record high of nearly $111,900 from around $74,700 over the course of the six and a half weeks ended May 22, and has since traded in a mildly descending range, forming the bull flag, according to charting platform TradingView. The flag is identified by trendlines connecting the highs hit on May 22 and June 9 and the lows reached on June 5 and June 22. Meanwhile, the pole is represented by the initial surge. A move above $109,000 is needed to confirm the bull breakout, which would open the door for a rally to $146,000. The level is calculated by adding the length of the pole —the initial surge — to the breakout point, using a method technical analysts call a measured move. A bull flag pattern represents counter-trend, low-volume consolidation within a narrow range, preceded by a sharp increase. The consolidation tends to be smaller in magnitude and duration than the preceding rally, helping to relieve short-term overbought conditions and recharge the bulls' engines for the next leg higher. ""Flag formations occur over a short period — usually a few days to few weeks,"" Charles D. Kirkpatrick wrote in his book, Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians. ""Volume usually declines throughout the formation of the flag."" ""[However], it is important to be cautious to make sure that a complete formation has occurred and to wait for the breakout,"" Kirkpatrick noted. Flags are continuation patterns, and so the consolidation is expected to resolve in the direction of the preceding uptrend. Still, failures can occur in two ways. First, prices can dive out of the flag, marking a bearish reversal. Second, a bullish breakout can fail, which calls for continuous monitoring of the price action. That said, failure rates are low, according to Kirkpatrick. ""Because these patterns have low failure rates, few pullbacks or throwbacks, short time periods, and steep trends preceding and following their occurrences, they are very good trading patterns,"" Kirkpatrick noted.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/26/bitcoin-s-podium-ready-bull-flag-hints-at-price-boom-to-usd140k,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Technical Analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T09:30:00,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Attracts Global Attention As Bitcoin Investments Surge in Japan","Amid weakness in the Japanese Yen and sluggish growth in domestic investments, firms like ANAP and Metapalent in Japan have been stocking up on Bitcoin. The Japanese economy is going through a period of persistent low interest rates and limited investment opportunities. As a result, BTC treasury holdings in Japan now exceed $85 billion. Favorable laws in Japan are making this shift possible, turning Japan into a global leader when it comes to corporate crypto holdings. Amid the growing adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) in Japan, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has recently begun to attract global attention. It is especially so amongst whales in Asia and other regions of the world, who feel that gains from Bitcoin (BTC) may be limited. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its focus on utility, has become an attractive option for them. Noticing this trend, analysts have upped their forecasts for MUTM tokens, and they now forecast gains of 33x or higher when the tokens go live. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the fifth phase of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. So far, over $11.2 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,450 unique buyers. A major reason for this high participation rate is that tokens in the current phase are going for a huge 50% discount to the planned listing price of $0.06. Driven by the massive opportunity for growth, investors have bought 50% of the tokens in phase 5, less than a month after they launched. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. That will also reduce the guaranteed ROI based on the listing price from 100% to 71.43%. No one wants to miss this massive opportunity, and investors are taking every exit opportunity to pour capital into the presale. With analysts forecasting gains of 33x when the tokens go live, a $1,400 investment in the presale right now could grow to over $46,000. This represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make life-changing gains in the crypto market. Do not be left out. Best of all, since there is no upper limit on how much you can invest in the presale, this could represent an opportunity to secure your retirement from the crypto investment world. A major driver of the presale is the fact that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is CertiK audited. With a Token Scan Score of 95 on CertiK, this has boosted trust in the project, leading to the current pace of the presale. The presale momentum is expected to carry on after launch, driven by the massive utility of the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders on the platform, they can deposit their assets into the protocol for a chance to earn an annual percentage yield (APY). The rate at which they earn interest in the protocol’s pools is based on the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises, it increases the interest rate, which causes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it attracts more lenders who deposit liquidity into the pools to enjoy the rising yields. Consequently, the entire process leads to higher liquidity in the pools, which stabilizes the ecosystem in the long term. Additionally, it ensures optimal capital efficiency, giving lenders and borrowers the best possible market rates. For lenders, this massive opportunity for passive income will prove quite attractive. For instance, a user can deposit $10,000 worth of BNB in a pool. Since BNB is in high demand, it could push the APY in that pool up to 15% as borrowers take loans. For the lenders, that could mean that they earn $1,500 worth of BNB a year on their deposit. Best of all, they do not need to actively trade, which can be stressful, for both newbie and experienced traders. Another benefit of Mutuum Finance is that it will ensure users of the protocol have a means to easily track their earnings in the protocol via mtTokens. These tokens will represent the value of the original deposit plus any interest accrued. For instance, when they make a deposit of BNB in a pool, lenders will receive mtBNB tokens in return. The mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, which means they can be traded on secondary exchanges where the standard is accepted. Additionally, the team will encourage the creation of pools on DEXs, which pair with mtTokens. That will provide lenders with avenues to trade on the open market, even as they continue to make passive income in the protocol. Conclusion With a massive discount in the ongoing presale, coupled with the perfect design of the protocol, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale presents a rare opportunity for massive gains in the crypto sector. Do not let this massive opportunity for returns of 33x or higher slip through your fingers.

2025-06-26T09:28:09,"SEC Gets Green Light for Bitcoin Feature That It Never Wanted Before! SEC Member Explains!","As is known, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. While approving them, it pressured them to include only cash refunds and rejected the in-kind refund option in spot ETF applications. However, BlackRock has applied for in-kind repayments for its ISHARES Bitcoin ET at the beginning of 2025. At this point, companies including BlackRock have been asking the SEC for months to allow in-kind investments and repurchases specifically for Bitcoin ETFs. At this point, if tax-advantaged refunds in kind are accepted, it will be positive for the cryptocurrency market. Because these features can be made without selling cryptocurrencies, they reduce the selling pressure in the market. While this development is eagerly awaited, SEC Republican member Hester Peirce said that the in-kind refunds that the SEC has been delaying on Bitcoin ETFs are imminent. Speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, Hester Peirce said that in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto ETFs are on the horizon and will definitely come. Peirce said that the SEC's stance on Bitcoin ETFs is inadequate, noting that in-kind investment and refund application files are currently under review by the SEC. “The SEC really mismanaged the spot Bitcoin ETF. Additionally, the same investment and redemption applications for the spot Bitcoin ETF are going through the review process before the SEC. So I think that will definitely be approved at some point. It's a guess, but we're seeing a lot of interest in these features.” The SEC under US President Donald Trump has adopted a friendlier approach to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies compared to the SEC under Joe Biden. Since the Trump administration, ETF applications have not been limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with many top firms filing with the SEC for altcoins ranging from XRP to Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE). While the market expects altcoin ETFs to be approved in 2025, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas say the SEC has a 90% or higher probability of approving most altcoin ETF applications. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-26T09:15:56,"‘Nightmare’ – Bank of America Sues Customers After Prematurely Discharging Loan: Report","The Bank of America reportedly made a mistake with a customer’s loan and ended up suing her because of it. Diane Jaques, a 75-year-old homeowner in Concord, Massachusetts, was sued by the Bank of America after the financial institution accidentally discharged her loan prematurely, reports local Boston public news outlet WBUR. “It’s ridiculous. It’s their mistake… I’ve never missed a payment. I get the bill every month and I pay it.” According to the lawsuit, she and her husband originally took out a $200,000 home equity line of credit from FleetBoston Financial, which later merged with Bank of America. Her husband has since died. After the merger, Bank of America says it took steps to clean up FleetBoston’s paperwork on some 16,000 mortgages. However, in the process, Bank of America erroneously discharged Jaques’ mortgage, among others. To correct the error, the bank asked Jaques to sign certain documents. Jaques says the process became such a hassle, including having to get papers notarized by a notary public, that she gave up on it, only to later learn Bank of America was now suing her over the matter. Jacques, a semi-retired insurance agent, says, “How can this even be allowed? It’s very shocking. It’s the last thing I need.” In the end, Bank of America dropped the lawsuit this month after Jaques signed the necessary documents. Says Jaques, “I am done with Bank of America. This has been a nightmare.” Bill Halldin, a Bank of America spokesperson, says that the bank contacted customers for permission to refile the mortgage paperwork to fix the loans mistakenly discharged. If homeowners didn’t respond or did not complete the process, the bank sued. Jaques is one of more than 100 homeowners in Massachusetts who were sued over the loan issue. Says Halldin, “Filing the lawsuits was the only way to ask the court to correct the record if homeowners didn’t voluntarily agree to the correction.” According to Halldin, the bank will cover the cost of correcting the records with local registries as well as public notary services. However, the bank does not plan to reimburse attorney’s fees incurred by homeowners who hire a lawyer to handle the lawsuit.

The premium, measured by the multiple net asset value (mNAV) , is 1.149, the first time it's been above parity since June 5. The metric compares the company’s market cap, currently $550 million, to the value of its bitcoin holdings, $477.8 million. It has become a popular way of gauging whether a company is trading at a premium or discount to its bitcoin assets. The move matters because, historically, Semler has added to its bitcoin position only when it's been able to buy more BTC without issuing new shares at a discount, thereby avoiding a reduction in existing shareholders’ ownership value. It hasn't bought any since June 3 and its current holding of 4,449 BTC leaves it well short of its year-end target of at least 10,000 coins. Still, the mNav level suggests investors are valuing the 15th-largest bitcoin treasury company only slightly above its bitcoin holdings. That's not enough to fully account for the value of its operating business, implying they may be pricing in the bitcoin upside while discounting or overlooking the contribution of Semler's health care and biotech activities.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/26/semler-scientific-trades-at-premium-to-bitcoin-holdings-for-first-time-in-three-weeks,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Eric Semler|Semler scientific|Digital Asset Treasury|News",cryptocompare

The rebound reflects a broader shift toward risk-on sentiment, supported by improving macro signals and renewed optimism across the crypto market. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said this week that rate adjustments remain on the table, contingent on progress in trade talks and signs of easing inflation—remarks interpreted by markets as a signal of a potential policy pivot by late 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $108,008 , up 1.3% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) was holding at $2,490, posting a 1.8% gain. Meanwhile, strong momentum is also building around early-stage projects, particularly Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale has continued to attract investor interest, supported by its positioning as a meme-centric Layer 2 solution on the Bitcoin network. Major regulatory win for crypto The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) on Wednesday directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to begin considering cryptocurrency holdings as part of single-family mortgage loan risk assessments, a shift that could allow crypto investors to use their digital assets to qualify for home loans. FHFA Director William Pulte announced the move in a social media post, stating that he had instructed the housing finance giants to “prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for mortgage,” aligning with President Donald Trump’s broader push to position the United States as “the crypto capital of the world.” Pulte @pulte · Follow After significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump’s vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, today I ordered the Great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage.SO ORDERED 12:14 am · 26 Jun 2025 7.7K Reply Copy link Read 624 replies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been under US government conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis, back more than half of all US home mortgages. Their risk assessment frameworks currently rely on traditional financial assets, and incorporating crypto could mark a notable departure from established underwriting practices. President Trump has made cryptocurrency policy a key part of his administration’s economic agenda, courting the sector during his campaign and appointing regulators perceived as industry-friendly. He has also hosted crypto executives at the White House in recent months, signaling growing institutional support for digital assets. Shift in environment to help Bitcoin Pepe Increasing regulatory clarity in the United States is expected to enhance visibility across the altcoin and meme coin sectors, potentially shifting investor sentiment in favour of projects that offer tangible utility. As regulatory oversight expands, market focus may begin to move away from purely speculative plays toward initiatives that combine cultural resonance with meaningful technical foundations. Bitcoin Pepe is aligning itself with this evolving narrative. In contrast to meme tokens that rely solely on hype, the project merges infrastructure development with viral appeal. Positioned as a Layer 2 solution, Bitcoin Pepe seeks to combine Bitcoin’s base-layer security with the scalability typically associated with platforms like Solana—an approach that differentiates it from much of the meme coin space. This infrastructure-first strategy appears to be gaining traction among investors. The presale has already raised over $15.6 million. Confirmed exchange listings on MEXC and BitMart have added momentum, with another listing announcement expected on June 30, further increasing interest as the presale approaches its final stage.

2025-06-26T08:56:47,"New Document: XRP Supply Shock Will Happen Before Bitcoin","Researcher SMQKE recently posted a tweet asserting that XRP is on track to experience a supply shock before Bitcoin. The statement draws directly from a report by WisdomTree, which analyzes the differing supply dynamics between the two cryptocurrencies. According to the report, Bitcoin is expected to reach its maximum supply of 21 million units around the year 2140, while XRP is projected to reach its full circulating supply within the next few years. The tweet emphasized this contrast, highlighting XRP’s shorter issuance timeline as a potential catalyst for a supply shock. SMQKE shared WisdomTree’s data to substantiate the claim, and the tweet included a snapshot from the report, which stated that XRP will soon hit its maximum supply, after which deflationary pressure from burned transaction fees will become the primary factor influencing its supply trajectory. THERE WILL BE A SUPPLY SHOCK FOR XRP BEFORE BITCOIN “Bitcoin should reach its max supply of 21 million units in approximately 2140, and XRP should reach its max supply IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.” This is documented below. pic.twitter.com/tLK4zELzU4 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 23, 2025 Different Supply Models for XRP and Bitcoin The WisdomTree article explained that XRP transaction fees are systematically burned, contributing to a steady decrease in the overall supply over time. Since its inception, about 12 million XRP units have already been burned. In addition, XRP’s release from Ripple-managed escrow accounts is a structured process that will conclude once the 55 billion initially escrowed tokens are fully distributed. This predictable release is intended to provide transparency and consistency in supply. Once the scheduled releases are complete, new XRP issuance will effectively cease, and any future reduction in circulating supply will stem solely from transaction-related burns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions Highlight Key Variables SMQKE’s tweet prompted remarks from other users on X. One user, Tell, noted that the onset of a supply shock would depend on several key factors, including actual adoption levels, investor sentiment, and Ripple’s management of its remaining escrow. Tell argued that a true shock in supply would only materialize if Ripple tightens distribution while demand increases. In such a case, constrained availability could exert upward pressure on the price. Another user, PhantomPatriot, commented on the extended timeframe associated with Bitcoin’s supply cap, expressing frustration over the 2140 projection. The user added that they hoped XRP would realize its supply-related milestones in a much shorter period, implicitly aligning with SMQKE’s view that XRP’s supply trajectory is more immediately relevant to market dynamics. XRP’s Scarcity-Driven Outlook The WisdomTree report emphasized that XRP has a low correlation with Bitcoin and Ether, which may enhance its value in a diversified portfolio. It also identified XRP and Bitcoin as scarce assets but with fundamentally different issuance schedules. While Bitcoin follows a fixed halving cycle leading to eventual maximum supply over more than a century, XRP’s path to max supply is accelerated by design and transaction economics. Once XRP reaches its cap in the coming years, the total number of tokens in circulation is expected to decline gradually, given the continued burning of small amounts per transaction. If user adoption increases or remains steady, and no new supply is introduced, this could lead to a reduction in available tokens, potentially contributing to price appreciation through scarcity effects. SMQKE’s tweet highlights a documented forecast that XRP will experience a significant shift in its supply model well before Bitcoin . This shift, combined with deflationary mechanisms, could position XRP for a market reaction tied to scarcity.

2025-06-26T08:53:28,"Best crypto to buy now as Metaplanet buys 1,234 BTC","Bitcoin (BTC) is back above $108,000, marking a full recovery from last week’s drop to the six-figure mark amid heightened tensions in the Middle East. The rebound comes as macro signals shift to a more risk-on tone and bullish sentiment returns to the crypto market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week that rate adjustments remain a possibility, dependent on progress in trade negotiations and signs of easing inflation, remarks interpreted by markets as signalling a potential policy pivot by late 2025 . At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading above $108,008, up 1.3% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) held at $2,490 with a 1.8% gain. Other major tokens, including Solana (SOL) at $145.54, Dogecoin (DOGE) at $0.1652, XRP at $2.1926, and BNB Chain’s BNB at $646.97, posted gains of less than 1%, but may follow BTC and ETH higher if momentum continues. Strong momentum has also been seen in the early-stage project Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale has seen continued interest from investors. Metaplanet buys more BTC Metaplanet, a Tokyo-listed investment firm, has purchased an additional 1,234 Bitcoin for approximately $132.7 million, according to a Thursday disclosure. The acquisition comes just a day after the company announced it had raised $515 million to expand its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The latest purchase, made at an average price of about $107,557 per Bitcoin, brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to 12,345 BTC , valued at roughly $1.3 billion at current market prices. With this move, Metaplanet is poised to become the seventh-largest publicly listed corporate holder of Bitcoin, surpassing Tesla’s 11,509 BTC, based on data from bitcointreasuries.net. The acquisition follows Metaplanet’s announcement on Wednesday of a 74.9 billion yen ($515 million) capital raise via stock issuance. The funding is part of the firm’s broader “555 million plan,” which aims to secure ownership of 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale remains strong As Bitcoin continues its strong rebound and moves closer to a potential new all-time high, institutional adoption remains a key driver of positive market sentiment. At the same time, investors are shifting toward higher-beta segments of the crypto market, with meme coins once again drawing fresh capital inflows. Among the standouts is Bitcoin Pepe, which differentiates itself by combining meme appeal with a Layer 2 infrastructure framework. Unlike conventional meme tokens that rely purely on social momentum, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as the first meme-centric Layer 2 solution built on the Bitcoin network. The project aims to provide scalability and transaction speed comparable to networks like Solana, while maintaining the security of Bitcoin’s base layer. Its ongoing presale has raised over $15.6 million, with the BPEP token priced at $0.0437. A price increase is anticipated once funding surpasses the $17.07 million mark. According to the team, BPEP is set to be listed on BitMart and MEXC, with an additional listing announcement scheduled for June 30. The upcoming developments continue to drive investor interest as the presale nears completion.

2025-06-26T08:46:34,"Crypto scam victim sues Citibank over $20m lost in romance scam","A lawsuit filed in New York has accused Citibank of negligence after one of the bank’s customers lost $20 million to a crypto romance scam. Plaintiff Michael Zidell, who filed the complaint on June 24, is seeking compensatory damages and legal costs. Zidell alleges the bank failed to detect and act on suspicious wire transfers linked to the scam, which led to substantial financial loss. Zidell claims he was targeted in a fraudulent investment scheme commonly known as “pig butchering,” in which scammers form fake online relationships with victims to lure them into fraudulent investments. Zidell was allegedly contacted in January 2023 on Facebook by a woman identifying herself as Carolyn Parker, who claimed to be a business owner in California. Their communication continued over video and text on the WeChat app, eventually developing into what Zidell perceived to be a romantic relationship. By February 2023, Parker encouraged Zidell to invest in non-fungible tokens through a platform called OpenrarityPro.com. She claimed to have earned millions and presented what appeared to be account statements as proof. You might also like: From ‘I love you’ to ‘you’re broke’: AMLBot reveals the dark side of crypto romance scams Zidell then began transferring funds to various bank accounts provided through the website, allegedly as part of the NFT investment. Zidell made a total of 43 transfers across multiple banks, with twelve of those transactions, amounting to nearly $4 million, sent to accounts held at Citibank under the name Guju Inc. According to the filing, the first wire transfer to Guju Inc. alone exceeded the entity’s stated annual revenue and contradicted its account opening documents, which projected monthly wire transfers below $250,000. The suit alleges that Citibank failed to act on numerous red flags, including large, round-sum transfers inconsistent with the account holder’s declared business activity. Per the plaintiff, the bank disregarded its obligations under federal Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering laws by failing to investigate Guju Inc.’s activity despite clear indicators of suspicious behavior. Pig butchering scams have become a major concern for both federal authorities and crypto industry participants. In its 2024 Internet Crime Report, the FBI revealed that pig butchering scams were among the most damaging crypto-related crimes, which led to $5.8 billion in investment fraud losses reported last year. Older Americans were the most affected, with victims aged 60 and above losing $2.8 billion to crypto scams alone.
