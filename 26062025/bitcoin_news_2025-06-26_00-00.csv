2025-06-25T21:30:21,"Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Become Ethereum and Bitcoin Traders’ Next Big Bet? Analysts Eye Kaspa","As the 2025 crypto market cycle intensifies, traders are looking beyond the established players for the next wave of momentum. While Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to serve as anchors of institutional and retail portfolios, many investors are seeking fresh opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a powerful early-stage contender, and Kaspa is gaining analyst attention as a high-conviction technical play. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Presale of the Year MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of 2025’s standout launches, securing over $10 million in presale funding and selling out multiple rounds swiftly. With a capped supply of 170 billion tokens, verified by a full HashEx audit and a no-VC model, it’s built on a foundation of transparency and scarcity. This structure has drawn attention from both institutions and retail traders seeking exposure to earlier-phase innovation. Backed by community ownership, staking incentives, and a disciplined rollout strategy, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned by analysts as a breakout asset with long-term viability . Ethereum: Still a Powerhouse, But Traders Want More Ethereum remains at the center of smart contract development and institutional blockchain strategies. However, as the platform matures and growth becomes more incremental, investors are increasingly allocating toward assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer a different growth curve—without abandoning Ethereum’s long-term value. Bitcoin: The Anchor, But Limited Explosive Upside Bitcoin continues to dominate as the store-of-value leader, maintaining a position above $105,000. Still, for those seeking dynamic growth opportunities, Bitcoin’s current pace has prompted many to rotate capital into newer projects that mirror its early innovation-driven momentum—such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Kaspa: The Technical Standout on Analysts’ Radar Kaspa is gaining traction for its technical strengths, including the GHOSTDAG protocol and increasing utility from its Layer-2 ecosystem. With rising trading volume, wallet activity, and ongoing infrastructure development, analysts view Kaspa as a strong addition to the 2025 growth watchlist. Conclusion As Ethereum and Bitcoin traders seek new avenues for growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-upside early-stage contender with solid fundamentals. At the same time, Kaspa’s innovation and expanding use cases make it another asset to watch. Together, they represent a new generation of momentum-driven investments gaining traction in 2025.

2025-06-25T21:29:07,"Analyst Says the Bull is Strong in Bitcoin, Explains What to Expect Next – Will There Be a New ATH?","Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr., in his analysis of the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market, stated that the current bull cycle is on solid foundations and the market is becoming more mature. Adler Jr. stated that since the bull cycle that started in November 2022, Bitcoin has experienced only two deep corrections: He said that after these pullbacks exceeding 30% in August 2024 and April 2025, prices quickly recovered and reached new highs. The pullbacks in all other periods remained in the 10-20% range, functioning as a classic “shake-out” and did not disrupt the uptrend. Adler Jr. stated that the weekly simple moving average (SMA)-based decline is currently only at -7%, while the current pullback is limited to -4.7%, indicating a calm consolidation process in the $100-106,000 range. Related News: GameStop, One of the Most Talked-About Companies in the US, Makes Another Move to Purchase a Massive Amount of Bitcoin Adler Jr. stated that the “deep correction-accumulation-new rise” cycle that repeats itself in the market is also evident in this bull market and that the retracements are gradually narrowing and this is a strong signal of market maturity. He said that unless there is a serious negative news flow, the strong support at $96,000 will continue to drive the bull trend and new all-time highs (ATH) can be seen. Another important data that Adler Jr. drew attention to was the BTC flows on centralized exchanges (CEX). The daily average total flow (input + output) volume decreased to 40,000 BTC, reaching the lowest level in the last 10 years. This indicates that investors tend to withdraw their BTC from exchanges and hold them for the long term, indicating a potential liquidity shortage in the market. The weekly net flow remains negative at –4,300 BTC, indicating that the amount of coins deposited is lagging behind the amount withdrawn. However, the 30-day average inflow/outflow is comparable to the end of 2023 and the beginning of the bull market. Adler Jr. noted that this data shows that demand for Bitcoin is still strong. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-25T21:23:35,"Bit Digital Exits BTC Mining to Focus Solely on ETH Staking Strategy","Bit Digital (BTBT) is changing course to become a dedicated ether ETH staking and treasury operation, the company said Wednesday. The New York-based firm will exit the bitcoin BTC mining business entirely, repurposing its assets and capital into its growing ETH strategy. The company began building its ether position and Ethereum staking infrastructure in 2022. As of March 31, Bit Digital held 24,434.2 ETH, valued at $44.6 million, and 417.6 BTC worth $34.5 million. It plans to convert the remaining bitcoin into ether over time. To fund the transition, Bit Digital has started a process to sell or wind down its bitcoin mining operations. Net proceeds from the divestiture will be reinvested in ether. No specific timeline was given for the sale or conversion of assets. The announcement marks a significant pivot for a company once rooted in bitcoin mining, especially considering the incredible run BTC has been on compared to ETH. The ETH/BTC ratio is down 75% since December 2021. However, the move isn't a big surprise given how tough the mining industry has become since last year's halving cut the BTC rewards for miners to half, squeezing profit margins, despite rally in bitcoin prices. The firm has also announced that it will be selling shares to fund the purchase of more ether, and that its high-performance computing (HPC) subsidiary, WhiteFiber, has submitted a draft registration letter with the Securities and Exchange Commission with regards to going public.

2025-06-25T21:15:08,"Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission approves Guotai Junan Securities to offer virtual-asset trading services","Guotai Junan Securities (Hong Kong), a subsidiary of Guotai Junan International, has reportedly secured approval to offer virtual-asset trading services, making it officially the first Chinese mainland brokerage in Hong Kong to do so. The mainland China brokerage firm upgraded its Type 1 license for dealing in securities to include virtual-asset trading, allowing access to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The ease of the approval suggests more will follow in the future According to the company’s statement on Wednesday, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission granted the approval on Tuesday, after which the firm’s Type 1 license for dealing in securities was upgraded to provide virtual-asset dealing services under an omnibus account arrangement with SFC-licensed platforms. Now that it has been upgraded, the brokerage’s clientele will be able to access trading in major digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins like USDT . When the news broke, investors reacted by driving Guotai Junan International’s shares up by nearly 200%. The stock closed at HK$3.7 (47 US cents) on Wednesday. Hua Chuang Securities also revealed that the SFC approval was granted sooner than expected, and has predicted that in the future, when more mainland brokerages with international branches try to upgrade their Type 1 licenses, things will move at a similar pace. The firm expects more leading brokerages, especially those with a strong client base, to consider expanding their respective businesses to cover digital assets. Not only is it the right time, it is the right place to do so. Hong Kong is widely acknowledged for its favorable conditions, which make Hua Chuang Securities confident in the potential of the city to continue improving its virtual-asset ecosystem. The sentiment was echoed in a report from Futu Securities, which noted that stablecoins have the potential to influence the upscaling of Chinese brokerages’ international operations, as current regulations prevent them from conducting virtual asset-related business on the mainland. Futu believes stablecoin development could redefine the role of brokerages, promote asset securitization, and act as hubs for cross-border clearings in the future, instead of simply as trading intermediaries. This would help enhance these firms’ valuations, it said. Terence Chong Tai-leung, executive director of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), also agrees and has said the proliferation of virtual asset trading services in Hong Kong — whether they are backed by mainland, local, or foreign funds — will benefit the city’s finance and fintech space. Favorable regulations are attracting crypto players to Hong Kong Businesses in Hong Kong are increasingly getting curious about investing in crypto, and it’s all thanks to the city’s favorable regulations. The regulations are reportedly nudging players previously watching from the sidelines to join in the fun, and several have answered the call. Among the recent crop of investors to take an interest in digital address is the money manager, known as VMS Group. The multifamily office with just under $4 billion in assets under management reportedly plans to allocate up to $10 million to strategies run by decentralized-finance hedge fund Re7 Capital, according to its managing partner, Elton Cheung. The decision is part of the firm’s recent moves to diversify into more liquid investments, an attempt to upgrade from focusing only on private equity and other longer-duration strategies, the playbook it has stuck with since it was founded two decades ago. Those investments performed well, but such assets have become less liquid as more companies opt to stay private for longer, making it more difficult to exit.

2025-06-25T21:05:05,"Urgent: Iran Nuclear Claims Spark Global Stability Concerns, What It Means for Crypto Markets","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Iran Nuclear Claims Spark Global Stability Concerns, What It Means for Crypto Markets In the fast-paced world of digital assets, understanding global events is paramount. Recent claims from Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, amplified by @solidintel_x on X, suggest that US airstrikes have caused significant damage to Iran Nuclear facilities. This startling development sends immediate ripples through international relations and, inevitably, prompts questions about its potential Crypto Market Impact . For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, such geopolitical tremors often translate into market volatility, making it crucial to grasp the broader implications. What’s Happening with Iran Nuclear Facilities? The core of the recent news revolves around Iran’s assertion of damage to its nuclear infrastructure. According to the spokesperson, these facilities, which are central to Iran’s controversial nuclear program, have sustained substantial harm from recent US Airstrikes . While the specific nature and extent of the damage remain unverified by independent sources, the claim itself carries significant weight, given the long history of tension surrounding Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The Claim: Iran’s Foreign Ministry states US airstrikes heavily damaged nuclear sites. The Source: The claim was initially reported via @solidintel_x on X, citing an Iranian spokesperson. Verification Challenges: Independent confirmation of such claims is often difficult due to restricted access and the nature of military operations. Historical Context: Iran’s nuclear program has been a flashpoint for decades, leading to international sanctions and ongoing diplomatic efforts. Understanding this context is vital, as it frames the potential responses from international actors and financial markets alike. The immediate concern is escalation, but the ripple effects extend far beyond the immediate region. How Do US Airstrikes and Geopolitics Intersect with Crypto? The relationship between geopolitical events, such as alleged US Airstrikes , and the cryptocurrency market might not be immediately obvious to everyone. However, history has shown a clear pattern: uncertainty breeds volatility, and in times of crisis, investors often seek perceived safe havens or, conversely, divest from riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have at times been touted as a digital gold, a hedge against traditional financial instability and geopolitical unrest. When news of significant international incidents breaks, here’s how it can affect the crypto landscape: Increased Volatility: Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can lead to rapid price swings across major cryptocurrencies and altcoins. Investors might panic sell or, conversely, ‘buy the dip.’ Flight to Safety Narrative: Bitcoin’s role as a potential safe haven asset often gets tested during such times. If traditional markets (stocks, fiat currencies) show weakness, some investors might flock to Bitcoin, seeing its decentralized nature as a protective shield against state-controlled financial systems. Correlation with Traditional Markets: While crypto strives for independence, it often remains correlated with broader market sentiment. A downturn in global stocks due to heightened Geopolitical Tensions can pull crypto prices down with it. Sanctions and Digital Assets: In scenarios involving international sanctions, cryptocurrencies can become a tool for circumventing traditional financial systems, though this carries significant regulatory risks and is often a topic of intense debate. This dynamic interplay highlights why staying informed about global affairs is not just for political analysts but for every savvy crypto investor. Navigating Heightened Geopolitical Tensions : What’s the Impact? The alleged damage to Iran’s nuclear sites, if confirmed, marks a significant escalation in Geopolitical Tensions . Such developments have far-reaching implications, extending beyond the immediate conflict zone to affect global energy markets, diplomatic relations, and, critically, investor confidence worldwide. The core challenge for investors is discerning short-term noise from long-term trends. Potential Broader Impacts: Area of Impact Description Potential Consequence Oil Markets Iran is a major oil producer; regional instability can disrupt supply. Spike in oil prices, impacting global economies and inflation. Diplomacy Further complicates nuclear negotiations and international relations. Increased isolation for Iran, heightened risk of proxy conflicts. Security Raises concerns about regional stability and potential for wider conflict. Increased military readiness, impact on trade routes. Financial Markets Investors become risk-averse, moving away from volatile assets. Stock market dips, bond market shifts, potential for currency fluctuations. For the crypto space, this means that even if Bitcoin holds its ground initially, broader economic downturns driven by energy shocks or reduced investor confidence can still exert downward pressure on the entire market. The interconnectedness of global finance means few assets truly operate in a vacuum. Understanding the Broader Global Stability Equation The incident in Iran underscores how delicate Global Stability truly is. Every major geopolitical event has the potential to trigger a cascade of reactions across borders and markets. For the crypto world, this means that while decentralization offers a promise of independence, the market is still deeply intertwined with human psychology and global economic conditions. A perceived threat to stability can lead to widespread risk aversion, affecting even the most resilient digital assets. Consider these aspects of global stability and their crypto relevance: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts can disrupt trade, leading to inflation and economic slowdowns, which in turn affect discretionary spending and investment in assets like crypto. Currency Devaluations: In countries facing severe economic stress or sanctions, local populations might turn to cryptocurrencies as a way to preserve wealth, leading to localized surges in adoption. Regulatory Responses: Governments might react to global instability by increasing scrutiny on crypto, potentially leading to new regulations or restrictions. Investor Sentiment: Fear about the future of the global economy can lead to a general withdrawal from speculative assets, regardless of their individual merits. Therefore, tracking major geopolitical flashpoints isn’t just about current affairs; it’s about anticipating shifts in the global economic landscape that will inevitably touch the crypto market. Analyzing the Crypto Market Impact : What Comes Next? The immediate Crypto Market Impact of the Iran nuclear claims and alleged US airstrikes is likely to be characterized by uncertainty. Investors should brace for potential volatility and consider their risk exposure. While Bitcoin often sees a surge in ‘safe haven’ narratives during such times, its correlation with traditional markets has also been evident, meaning a broader economic downturn could still pull it lower. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders: Stay Informed, Not Panicked: Differentiate between verified news and speculation. Rely on reputable sources and avoid making impulsive decisions based on unconfirmed reports. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance. Do you have a diversified portfolio? Consider if your current holdings align with your comfort level during periods of high uncertainty. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For long-term investors, continuing a dollar-cost averaging strategy can help mitigate the effects of volatility, allowing you to buy at different price points over time. Consider Stablecoins: If you’re highly risk-averse during turbulent times, temporarily moving a portion of your portfolio into stablecoins can offer a refuge from market swings, though they carry their own set of risks. Focus on Fundamentals: Volatility often shakes out weaker projects. Focus on cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Ultimately, the crypto market’s response will be a complex interplay of investor sentiment, macro-economic factors, and the specific developments in the geopolitical arena. Being prepared and informed is your best defense. A Compelling Summary: Navigating the New Geopolitical Crypto Landscape The claims regarding significant damage to Iran Nuclear facilities from alleged US Airstrikes introduce a fresh layer of complexity to an already intricate global landscape. These heightened Geopolitical Tensions are not isolated events; they send reverberations across all financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Understanding the potential for widespread Crypto Market Impact is crucial for investors aiming to navigate these turbulent waters. While the immediate future may bring increased volatility and uncertainty, this situation also highlights the evolving role of digital assets in an interconnected world. Whether Bitcoin truly acts as a reliable safe haven or simply follows broader economic trends remains a subject of ongoing debate, but its unique characteristics make it a focal point during times of crisis. As the world grapples with maintaining Global Stability , staying informed, exercising caution, and applying sound investment principles will be paramount for anyone participating in the crypto space. The coming days and weeks will be critical in determining the true extent of the damage, both to the facilities and to the delicate balance of international relations, and consequently, its lasting effect on our digital financial future.

2025-06-25T21:00:40,"Chainlink Reclaims Key Structure – Quiet Accumulation Could Fuel $25–$30 Surge","Chainlink (LINK) is up 21% from its Sunday lows, gaining momentum in an otherwise uncertain macro and geopolitical environment. While global tensions continue to spark volatility across markets, Chainlink has stood out for its resilience, supported by a series of strong partnerships and growing on-chain fundamentals. The recent price action signals a potential shift in trend, but analysts warn that a confirmed breakout is still needed before bulls can fully take over. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply Top analyst Henry Lord of Alts highlighted that LINK has endured months of persistent downtrend and unusually quiet price behavior. However, recent moves suggest that something is changing beneath the surface. Volume is increasing, volatility is picking up, and LINK is forming a base structure that could mark the end of its accumulation phase. Despite this strength, Chainlink remains technically locked within a consolidation range. A clean breakout above key resistance levels will be critical to trigger the next phase of upward momentum. Until then, traders are cautiously optimistic as LINK teases a larger move. Chainlink Prepares For A Decisive Move Chainlink is currently trading over 25% below its May high, reflecting the broader market impact of rising macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, especially the recent Middle East conflicts. Despite these pressures, LINK has managed to hold within a steady consolidation range, signaling resilience as the crypto market awaits its next decisive move. Maintaining prices above current levels is crucial. A breakdown here could open the door for deeper corrections. However, analyst Henry believes the tides may be turning. According to Henry, Chainlink has endured months of downtrend and silence, but a structural shift is now underway. His analysis highlights that the long-standing downtrend has been broken, and LINK has entered a clear accumulation and consolidation phase. “These zones often come before the loudest moves,” Henry notes. Historically, such phases have preceded explosive rallies, and this time may be no different. If momentum picks up, a breakout toward the $25–$30 range wouldn’t be surprising. Henry also points out that periods of inactivity often mask the actions of smart money—buying quietly before the broader market catches on. While it’s easy to overlook assets during calm phases, that’s often when the groundwork for major moves is laid. For now, Chainlink remains on watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month LINK Price Analysis: Signs of Reversal Emerge Chainlink is showing early signs of a trend reversal after months of consistent decline. As seen in the 12-hour chart, LINK recently rebounded from the $11.50 level and is now trading above $13.20. This recovery follows a steep drop that marked a new local low, but the bounce has pushed the price above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), now acting as short-term support at $13.50. Importantly, LINK is now testing the 100-day SMA (around $14.65), which previously served as resistance in late May and early June. If bulls manage to break and consolidate above this level, the next target lies near the 200-day SMA at $14.16—a confluence zone that may act as a critical decision point for trend continuation or rejection. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support – $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move While the macro structure remains bearish, this short-term accumulation range suggests growing demand, especially as the price begins to form higher lows. A clear break above $14.65 with volume could confirm the breakout and signal the start of a larger move toward the $17–$18 range.

2025-06-25T21:00:40,"Expert Says XRP Is About to Shock Everyone. Here’s why","Much of the crypto market continues to follow institutional movements around Bitcoin, but analyst Levi Rietveld has shifted attention to XRP. In a recent video shared on X, Rietveld described a convergence of market factors that he believes could set the stage for XRP to “shock everyone.” Rietveld’s comments come as some of the largest institutional players continue to make major Bitcoin purchases. MetaPlanet, a prominent Japanese investment firm, recently added another $111 million worth of Bitcoin to its treasury. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to over $1 billion. Rietveld emphasized that the new acquisition alone represents roughly one-tenth of MetaPlanet’s total BTC portfolio, highlighting the scale and urgency behind the move. XRP Is About To Shock EVERYONE! pic.twitter.com/WQmIkODZMj — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) June 24, 2025 MicroStrategy and Sequence Join the Momentum This development followed closely behind another major buy from MicroStrategy, whose founder, Michael Saylor, has remained one of Bitcoin’s most vocal proponents. Michael Saylor has been nicknamed Bitcoin’s Warren Buffett , and Rietveld revealed that the company purchased an additional $26 million in Bitcoin following a $300 million acquisition. While experts have revealed that Saylor would get a significantly higher return by buying XRP , he’s stuck with Bitcoin. At the same time, Sequence Communications Company has announced plans to raise $384 million specifically for launching a Bitcoin treasury strategy, aligning itself with the growing trend of corporate BTC accumulation. Rietveld Sees XRP as the Next Major Move Rietveld believes a “massive tsunami of liquidity” is entering the digital asset space, and while this is currently favoring Bitcoin, it could soon spread to altcoins with strong fundamentals. Among them, XRP is the top contender for the next wave of capital inflows. The digital asset is attractive to institutions . While Rietveld did not provide any technical specifics, the sentiment surrounding XRP is improving, and experts believe a big move is coming. Institutions like SBI have been making major moves for years, and some see SBI as the Microstrategy for XRP . XRP’s advantages over other cryptocurrencies have set it apart, and as institutional attention and capital flows toward altcoins, XRP could benefit the most from this shift. With its distinct use case and growing legal stability, XRP is gaining renewed attention. Whether it delivers on that promise remains uncertain, but according to Rietveld and many other experts, it is a serious contender in the crypto landscape.

2025-06-25T21:00:31,"Bitcoin Bearish Bets Mount: Funding Rates On Binance Slides Into Negative Territory","As Bitcoin gradually recovers from its recent breakdown below the $100,000 mark, it appears to have triggered a fresh wave of bearish activity from investors. Its market dynamics are about to transition as key metrics such as the Funding Rates on the Binance platform have taken a negative turn. Binance Traders Betting Against Bitcoin In a dramatic bounce, Bitcoin has reclaimed the $105,000 price mark and is slowly approaching $106,000. While BTC has recovered, the impressive run has been met with negative sentiment, particularly from investors on Binance , the largest cryptocurrency exchange. Darkfost, a verified author for CryptoQuant, reported that funding rates on the Binance exchange have declined sharply, signaling a shift in trader sentiment. Data from the expert reveals that the rates dropped to the -0.0033 level just as BTC swiftly bounced back since this past weekend. This scenario implies that traders are progressively placing bets on further decline, indicating that bearish pressure is building on Binance. Negative funding rates may signal pessimism, but historically, they have also preceded short squeezes. As the price of Bitcoin navigates increased volatility and shifting momentum, this is a crucial period to observe. According to the on-chain expert, negative financing rates suggest that most open positions are currently short as investors question whether the recent upward move is sustainable. Although this may initially appear to be negative, markets often move against the crowd, particularly when there is an overcrowded short side. Furthermore, Darkfost has drawn attention to past scenarios, particularly in September last year. During the period, the market constantly shifted in the opposite direction whenever Binance’s funding rates fell into negative territory, whether in the short or medium term. However, the sole exception was when new tariff policies were announced, momentarily altering market dynamics. If shorts persistently increase on the Binance platform , Darkfost is confident that these positions could eventually bolster the rally that started earlier this week. Thus far, the expert has offered one key takeaway, stating that it is crucial to understand that the natural tendency of traders leans toward longing the market, which makes this current signal more remarkable. BTC To Surge To A New All-Time High After rallying earlier this week, BTC is currently facing significant resistance at the $106,500 threshold. However, this resistance level could give way soon, as Michael Van De Poppe, a market expert, has predicted a major rally to new all-time highs. According to the expert, Bitcoin is stalling at levels below $106,500 until the next significant surge to new highs occurs. Van De Poppe believes that the anticipated move is only a matter of time, and BTC is likely to reach a new peak in July. Therefore, the expert suggests “buying the dip now is the best strategy.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bearish-bets-mount/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Darkfost|funding rates|Michael Van de Poppe",cryptocompare

Pulte noted in an X post that the decision was based on an intense review and the desire to observe President Donald Trump’s bid to facilitate the mainstream adoption of digital assets in the United States. “FHFA hereby directs each enterprise to prepare a proposal for consideration of cryptocurrency as an asset for reserves in their respective single-family mortgage loan risk assessment, without conversion of said cryptocurrency to U.S. dollar,” the order noted . According to the order, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should only consider crypto assets that are traded and stored in U.S.-regulated centralized exchanges led by Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD). Market Impact of the FHFA Orders on Crypto Assets The FHFA orders on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider crypto assets in their risk assessments for single-family loans has attracted significant attention in the web3 space. According to Michael Saylor, co-founder and chairman at Strategy, the move by FHFA is a defining moment for institutional adoption of Bitcoin.

The fund is expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX exchange, and will reportedly use the Lukka Prime Solana Reference Rate as a benchmark to track Solana’s (SOL) spot price performance. This development could signal a new era for crypto investment products on Wall Street. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart predict that Solana, XRP and Litecoin spot ETFs will have a 95% chance of approval by the end of 2025.

Buterin, who more commonly shares development timelines for the Ethereum blockchain, has clarified his bullish outlook for the network. Responding to assertions made by Lubin, who anticipates that Ethereum will serve a global audience, Buterin insists that the network already has. “Ethereum L1 is the world ledger,” he wrote. The billionaire crypto founder seems to be paying close attention to network development and key milestones achieved recently. One Ethereum supporter observed that $1.25 billion in ETH ETF inflows have been recorded over the past 19 days, marking an increase in institutional interest. Staked ETH tokens have also hit new highs as market players lock 28% of Ether’s token supply. This development comes as multiple Nasdaq-listed firms adopt crypto reserves, further tightening liquidity levels. The price of ETH made a massive price turnaround from the previous year. Although the second most valuable altcoin is still far away from its previously attained all-time high of $4,891, ETH has kicked off a slow but steady recovery since the start of the year. Notably, ETH has emerged as the best-performing cryptocurrency, knocking out leading assets such as Bitcoin and another altcoin to secure a 53% increase in price value over the past 60 days. At the time of this report, ETH is valued at $2,434 per coin. As the Ether supporter further explains before going on to make a case for Ethereum and its native token; “Institutions are noticing. We’ve come together to tell the world why.

The evaluations made reveal that especially large investors, namely “whales”, have once again aggressively switched to the buying side of the market. According to Alphractal’s data, Bitcoin’s 7-day Open Position Delta value has turned positive again. This development shows that whale investors are opening more positions in anticipation of the rise. The “Whale Position Sentiment” indicator used by the company also confirms this trend. Related News: GameStop, One of the Most Talked-About Companies in the US, Makes Another Move to Purchase a Massive Amount of Bitcoin According to CEO Joao Wedson, Bitcoin began to form a new support zone after reaching $ 108,000. Stating that this level indicates a base-forming process called the “last support point” (LPS) in technical analysis, Wedson stated that the $ 113,000 level could be targeted in the short term. He added that short positions could be risky unless the price enters a long-term horizontal consolidation. On the other hand, analysis of miner behavior found that the BTC.com mining pool was the source sending the most BTC to Binance.

2025-06-25T20:38:08,"Why Did Bitcoin and Altcoins Suddenly Rise? Experts Explain Three Reasons","Bitcoin has gained nearly 10% in the past few days as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East eased. The world's largest cryptocurrency surpassed the $108,200 level today, according to Coinbase data, recovering 9.9% from the lows of around $98,400 seen on Sunday, June 22. Analysts have highlighted several factors that have supported this rally, with the most important one being the easing of concerns about conflict in the Middle East. “Bitcoin’s recovery today reflects the easing of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East,” said Thomas Perfumo, Kraken’s global economist. Perfumo noted that Bitcoin, as a macroeconomic asset, has already priced in changes in market risk perception. In addition, the ongoing interest of institutional investors is among the factors supporting the rise. Stating that companies such as MicroStrategy continue to purchase Bitcoin, Perfumo said that newly established funds also reinforce this cycle. He stated that the continuous inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs also create strong momentum when the selling pressure in the market decreases. Related News: BREAKING: Spot ETF Application Filed for Surprise Memecoin Brett Sifling, portfolio manager at Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, attributed Bitcoin’s rise this week to three main reasons. First, the temporary ceasefire between Israel and Iran has facilitated investors’ return to risky assets. Second, the Fed’s signals about possible interest rate cuts and its adoption of a crypto-friendly approach have boosted the market. Third, he said that positive inflows to Bitcoin ETFs for 10 consecutive weeks show that institutional demand is still strong. Dom Kwok, co-founder and COO of education platform EasyA, also said that President Trump’s signal for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran has brought relief to the market. He said that tensions over the weekend briefly dropped Bitcoin below $100,000, but investor confidence has been restored as energy markets have stabilized. Kwok noted that for long-term investors, such rapid declines are often just minor “chart breaks.” “Volatility makes headlines, but it’s important not to forget the bigger picture that drives gains,” he concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as sellers failed to defend resistance channels. This pushed the BTC price toward $108K. Will the BTC price reach $100K?

Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970.

Its scarcity-focused tokenomics, capped 170 billion supply, and full HashEx audit provide a foundation of credibility rarely seen in similar projects. The project’s design blends viral market presence with thoughtful execution—offering staking, transparent governance, and a decentralized community model. This blend of strategic fundamentals and public momentum is drawing interest from both retail traders and larger players seeking high-upside alternatives in a maturing market. Bitcoin: The Foundation, But Limited Upside Bitcoin remains the dominant asset in crypto, trading steadily above $105,000 and serving as a key institutional anchor. Yet its stabilizing growth has prompted a strategic shift, as some traders look to allocate capital into emerging assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer the possibility of capturing momentum akin to Bitcoin’s earlier years. Ethereum: Diversifying for Innovation and Yield Ethereum continues to lead as a platform for decentralized innovation. However, as its growth levels off, many ETH investors are exploring complementary opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s smart contract compatibility and secure structure are making it an attractive candidate. Uniswap, too, continues to command attention for its yield farming mechanisms, governance utility, and strength in decentralized exchange volume. Uniswap: The DeFi Powerhouse As a flagship decentralized trading platform, Uniswap maintains robust daily activity and a strong user base. While its growth has matured compared to earlier phases, its continuous updates and integrations make it a key holding for many Ethereum-aligned investors. At the same time, the rising interest in early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE reflects a desire to pair long-term platforms with faster-moving investments. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a place among early-stage projects with the potential to redefine what high-upside growth looks like in today’s market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational, many traders are now complementing their portfolios with alternatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Uniswap—striking a balance between stability and breakout momentum.

2025-06-25T20:23:51,"GameStop’s Bitcoin push echoes Strategy, but without the cushion","GameStop just secured another $450 million in its debt-fueled sprint toward becoming a Bitcoin-heavy treasury, bringing its total capital raise to $2.7 billion. But unlike Strategy, the company is doing so with a retail business in free fall. According to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, video game retailer GameStop (GME) secured an additional $450 million through the full exercise of a “greenshoe” option tied to its $2.25 billion convertible notes offering earlier this month. The offering brought GameStop’s total capital raise to $2.7 billion, a war chest it says will fund corporate investments, including inquiring Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a treasury reserve asset. You might also like: US Bitcoin ETFs record 11 consecutive days of net inflows despite macro jitters A strategic imitation or reinvention in motion? GameStop’s aggressive pivot to Bitcoin echoes a now-familiar playbook. The company’s recent filings reference an “investment policy” that includes acquiring BTC as a treasury reserve asset. That language mirrors the model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which began stockpiling Bitcoin in 2020 amid macroeconomic uncertainty and balance sheet stagnation. However, the divergence is just as important as the resemblance. Where Strategy was a steady, if unexciting, software firm when it began buying BTC, GameStop is a declining retailer. Strategy’s core revenue has shrunk modestly, down 6.2% year-over-year, but the business remains intact. Its Bitcoin strategy has massively inflated its balance sheet, with information on its website showing total assets have ballooned from $2.4 billion in 2022 to over $43 billion as of Q1 2025. That’s a 591% annual increase. Additionally, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm has more than tripled its stock price, largely untethered from the fundamentals of its core enterprise software revenue. By contrast, GameStop’s fundamentals are deteriorating. Q1 2025 revenue dropped 17%, and the company closed over 400 stores. The collectibles segment and a leaner retail footprint helped produce a $44.8 million net profit in Q1, but the long-term growth trend remains negative. That makes the Bitcoin pivot feel less like vision and more like a gamble. Market reactions remain jittery. GME shares plunged 20% after the initial convertible note announcement in June, barely a month after its first Bitcoin acquisition. Unlike MSTR, which has historically traded at a premium to its BTC holdings, GME has yet to build that investor confidence. The make-or-break factor: Bitcoin’s price Strategy’s success relied on Bitcoin’s bull runs. Its $70,681 average cost basis versus the current $107,798 BTC price means even a significant crash wouldn’t wipe out gains. GameStop, however, entered the race when Bitcoin was trading above $108,000 in May, leaving almost no margin for error. Worse, GameStop’s $1.48 billion in long-term debt, per Q1 filings, demands constant market access. If Bitcoin stagnates or dips, the company could face a liquidity crunch, something Strategy avoided by front-running the 2021 and 2024 rallies.

Momentum is not yet overbought, which leaves some space for movement. The 50-day moving average - previously used as resistance for the February pullback - is now acting as support, strengthening the current technical outlook. By Elior Manier The world’s leading cryptocurrency has demonstrated notable resilience in a week marked by geopolitical tensions and choppy risk sentiment . While traditional risk assets experienced volatile swings—gapping both higher and lower as headlines on the Israel-Iran conflict evolved—Bitcoin held its ground. A key signal of market resilience often comes at moments of maximum fear, when price action resists breaking key levels despite worsening headlines. That was precisely the case for Bitcoin. After peaking at a new all-time high of $112,030 in May, BTC pulled back, retesting the psychological $100,000 level. During the weekend escalation - when the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure - Bitcoin briefly dipped below this threshold, touching $99,000. Yet, despite the prevailing pessimism, sellers failed to hold below the $100,000 mark. This failed breakdown was followed by a decisive rebound, as markets began shifting away from war-driven fear. Bitcoin has since reclaimed the upper end of its recent range, indicating renewed bullish momentum. Let’s dive into the charts—from the weekly to the intraday timeframes—to better understand the current technical setup and what's the market picture for the leading crypto. Bitcoin Weekly Chart – Prior indecision met with a sharp response Bitcoin Weekly Chart, June 25, 2025 – Source: TradingView The previous weekly candles formed long-wicked doji patterns, signaling indecision and hesitation near all-time highs. This week, however, has kicked off on a more constructive note. From a candlestick perspective, a weekly close near the highs—especially with a breakout above the recent range—would confirm renewed bullish momentum . Until then, strength is cautiously maintained. That said, weekly momentum indicators remain in overbought territory, increasing the likelihood of consolidation—an outcome already visible on the lower timeframes. Bitcoin Daily Chart – Bullish sentiment supported by Daily 50-MA Bitcoin Daily Chart, June 25, 2025 – Source: TradingView Bitcoin is printing its third consecutive bullish daily candle, reinforcing the prevailing risk-on sentiment across markets. The 50-day moving average—previously used as resistance for the February pullback—is now acting as support, strengthening the current technical outlook. Meanwhile, RSI momentum remains near neutral but has shown a clear reluctance to drift into oversold territory. This suggests buyers continue to defend the $100,000 level effectively. A deeper correction below this threshold appears unlikely unless a new and unexpected bearish catalyst emerges for the crypto space. Bitcoin 4H Chart – Breaking out of the War Descending Channel Bitcoin 4H Chart, June 25, 2025 – Source: TradingView On this intraday timeframe, we get a better view of the prevailing consolidation that is taking Bitcoin to test its highs. Prices had been forming a descending channel as sentiment started to worsen; however, sellers could not maintain the bearish momentum. A rebound on the daily main support led to a breakout of the channel, with buyers now pushing above the pivot in confluence with the 200-period 4H moving average, which only caught up to the uptrend. Momentum is not yet overbought, which leaves some space for movement. One test for buyer strength will be breaching the 110,000 key mark – a failure to break and hold above this level points to higher chances of maintaining within the 100,000 to 110,000 range. Key levels to hold on your intraday charts: 99,000 to 100,000 Main Support 102,000 to 103,000 intermediate support 106,000 Pivot Zone & 4H MA 200 (immediate support) 112,000 Key ATH Resistance 109,000 to 110,000 Intermediate Resistance 115,000 - 117,000 Potential Resistance (Fibonacci Extension of past move) Safe Trades!

The Federal Reserve says former Bank of Hawaii employee Alohi Kaupu-Grace, 23, stole from customer accounts and falsified the customers’ signatures on cash withdrawal slips and cashier’s check purchase slips. Kaupu-Grace paid $5,200 in partial restitution to the bank and was fired in March. The Hawaii resident consented to an order from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors banning her from working for any of the Fed’s insured depository institutions. The ban will stay in place indefinitely unless the Board of Governors rescinds it, and the order doesn’t prohibit any other Federal or state agency or department from taking action against Kaupu-Grace. In May, Hawaii Island police arrested Kaupu-Grace for allegedly using someone else’s credit card. A victim contacted police after receiving a text from his credit card company about a fraudulent charge made to his account. The police say they tracked the credit card usage back to Kaupu-Grace, who allegedly secured the victim’s confidential information while working at Bank of Hawaii. She was charged with second-degree theft, second-degree identity theft, unauthorized possession of personal confidential information and fraudulent use of a credit card.

2025-06-25T20:00:19,"Why Bitcoin and XRP Investors Are Quickly Rallying Around MAGACOIN FINANCE, Backing Cardano","The cryptocurrency landscape is continually shaped by the pursuit of innovation and asymmetric growth. In 2025 , seasoned Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP investors are rallying behind MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its momentum, structure, and early positioning. Simultaneously, Cardano’s expanding utility and real-world partnerships are keeping it in focus as a balanced investment option for those seeking both performance and stability. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale That’s Captivating Smart Money MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the standout presales of the year, securing over $10 million while selling out multiple rounds in record time. Its 170 billion capped supply , full HashEx audit , and 100% community-owned model are redefining standards for transparency and scarcity. What differentiates it from typical projects is its structured rollout, staking rewards, and lack of VC involvement—qualities increasingly valued by retail and institutional investors alike. This growing wave of adoption is pulling in capital from across major coin ecosystems as the listing window tightens. Bitcoin: Profits Fueling the Next Generation With Bitcoin holding above $105,000 , it remains a foundational store of value. Yet, as upside moderates, BTC whales are rotating profits into earlier-stage assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE , aiming to replicate the kind of returns that once defined Bitcoin itself. This capital rotation is infusing fresh energy into projects that offer structural advantages and emerging traction. XRP: Seeking Clarity and New Opportunities Though XRP continues to lead in global payments, its price movement is weighed down by legal uncertainties and consolidation zones. This has pushed many investors to explore projects offering clearer governance and momentum. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its clean mechanics, decentralized model, and growing wallet activity—providing a compelling option for investors eager to realign their portfolios. Cardano: The Ecosystem Anchor Cardano continues to build on its vision of cross-chain interoperability. With recent announcements by Charles Hoskinson about XRP integrations , airdrops like Glacier , and expanded support via the Lace wallet , Cardano is gaining recognition as a hub for multi-chain activity. Its emphasis on slow, deliberate development appeals to those seeking long-term value—making it a steady counterpart to the rapid acceleration of MAGACOIN FINANCE . Conclusion Bitcoin and XRP investors are aligning with MAGACOIN FINANCE as it gains ground with strong fundamentals, transparent governance, and viral adoption. Meanwhile, Cardano’s ecosystem growth ensures it remains a reliable pillar for stability and future interoperability. Together, these assets represent a forward-looking strategy for navigating 2025’s evolving crypto landscape.

2025-06-25T20:00:00,"Crypto News Today: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Grows Like Wildfire as Bitcoin (BTC) and Top Cryptos Tumble","In the market faced by uncertainty, one altcoin is defying the downtrend, Mutuum Finance (MUTM ). Bitcoin (BTC) has slipped 4.67% amid mounting macro and geopolitical pressure. Major cryptocurrencies have followed suit, entering a sea of red as traders brace for more volatility. Amid the turmoil, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is bucking the trend, its presale token has surged nearly 200% to $0.03, fueled by strong demand, a dual lending DeFi model, and strategic buyback features. The project is priced at $0.03 today in phase 5 of its presale that has sold out over 45%. The project has raised over $11.1 million and brought on board over 12,400 investors in its ongoing presale. Unlike most altcoins caught in the downturn, this new coin continues to attract investors eyeing what crypto to buy now, thanks to its secured presale traction. Bitcoin Slides Below $103K as Market Sentiment Turns Risk-Off At the time of publication, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at around $102,200, decreasing more than 4.67% in the previous 24 hours as traders respond to renewed geopolitical uncertainty and risk-off attitudes in world markets. The newest drawback reported over $460 million wiped, and it is long positions that sustained the majority of liquidations. The technical indicators indicate the BTC is experiencing difficulties in maintaining the support of 103K, and indicators of momentum favor further bearish positions until a bullish volume reversal is observed. Although the general crypto market is also facing this correction, there are some smaller altcoins that found it possible to rise against the stream, including the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that has increased in value during the correction period. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,400 early adopters and more than $11.1 million raised, it’s clear to see this isn’t a flash in the pan wave of sentiment, Mutuum Finance is taking big steps as a key player in the DeFi. Whereas tokens are founded on ephemeral mania for the most part, Mutuum is founded on usability and sustained scalability with sound fundamentals backing it. Phase 5 investors will be rewarded with up to 2x ROI, when the token launch price of $0.06 is hit. Stable, Audited, and Future-Proof: A USD-Pegged Token on Ethereum In its strategic efforts to deepen its DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Unlike highly volatile algorithmic stablecoins, this token is crafted to hold its value even in extreme market fluctuations, earning it a solid store of value and medium of exchange. Security and integrity are central to the project. The Mutuum Finance platform was audited completely by CertiK, one of the most established blockchain security firms. This audit again testifies to the platform’s commitment to transparency, reliability, and long-term sustainability. Early Investors Reward as Community Grows To celebrate the presale action and express gratitude to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten of these winners will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens for being one of the early backers of the project. While the community expands rapidly, the early supporters are being rewarded, not only with the possibility of future upside, but with concrete, real-time rewards. While Bitcoin tumbles below $103K and top altcoins bleed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is breaking away from the pack. Defying the market correction, the project has surged 200% from its starting price, with Phase 5 tokens now selling at $0.03 and already over 45% sold out. More than 12,400 investors have contributed upwards of $11.1 million, betting on MUTM’s strong fundamentals, dual lending innovation, and fully audited infrastructure. Buyers in this stage could see 2x gains at launch, and potentially much more if current momentum holds. The next price jump is near, now is the time to act.

The upcoming remittance service will let users send U.S. dollars and select stablecoins to recipients abroad with ""well-known"" blockchain networks processing the transactions, allowing funds to be sent around the clock, converted into local currencies and deposited quickly into recipients' accounts, according to the press release . The company says this will be significantly cheaper and faster than traditional methods such as wire transfers or bank-based remittances. The firm will also relaunch crypto trading services, letting users buy, sell and hold major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTC and Ethereum's ether ETH later this year. Future services could include staking, borrowing against crypto holdings and providing blockchain tech infrastructure to third-parties through SoFi’s Galileo platform, the firm said. The moves come as CEO Anthony Noto shared plans earlier this year to re-enter the crypto business after the firm suspended digital asset-related services in 2023 in order to obtain banking license under the previous administration's harsher regulatory environment towards crypto. The change is backed by recent guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that allows nationally chartered banks to offer crypto custody and stablecoin-related services.

2025-06-25T19:30:45,"Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align","The Bitcoin price surge above $106,000 this week has reignited bullish sentiment across the market, with analysts suggesting that the stars are aligning for a rally to a new all-time high. From shifting geopolitical tensions to a major regulatory pivot in the United States (US), multiple macroeconomic factors appear to be setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next explosive move. Ceasefire And Rate Cut Buzz Fuel Bitcoin Price Optimism Over the weekend, the Bitcoin price briefly slipped, triggering over $200 million in leveraged long liquidations. However, this dip proved short-lived as the flagship cryptocurrency rebounded swiftly above $100,000 following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a total ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This sudden de-escalation helped ease global market anxiety, pushing Bitcoin past $106,000 and oil prices sharply down from $77 to under $70. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters ‘New Era’ Simultaneously, Optimism is building that the US Federal Reserve (FED) could begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Sharing new data by CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, crypto analyst CW disclosed that the odds of a FED rate cut have increased to 18.6% by July 30 during the scheduled FOMC meeting. The report reveals that 81.4% of market participants believe the FED to keep rates unchanged at their current level. However, FedWatch’s data indicates growing expectations for a rate cut by the September FOMC meeting, with 79% betting on a reduction and only 21.3% anticipating no change. Notably, lower interest rates generally benefit risk assets like Bitcoin by increasing liquidity and boosting investor sentiment. With geopolitical tensions easing and a possibly looser monetary policy on the horizon, Bitcoin could gain further momentum, potentially climbing to $110,000. Supporting this bullish forecast, crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin is gearing up for a rally toward a new ATH of $110,000 following its recent reclaim of the key $103,500 level. Although a retracement to around $102,500 remains possible, Bennett believes that once BTC cleans up support around $103,400, formed during Monday’s expansion, the next move could be parabolic. Regulatory Win Solidify Bitcoin’s Position In TradFi Beyond anticipated rate cuts and ceasefire announcements, the US FED recently made a landmark policy shift that could have profound long-term implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. By removing “reputational risk” as a factor in evaluating crypto firms’ access to bank servicing, the FED is effectively ending a key pillar of Operation Checkpoint 2.0—a campaign that restricted over 30 crypto and fintech companies from traditional financial infrastructure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Deviates From Global M2 Money Supply, Is The Bull Run Over? This recent change clears the way for greater institutional involvement in crypto. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have also followed suit, green-lighting crypto activities for banks and allowing them to participate in the digital assets market without prior approval. Together, these moves mark a regulatory pivot that not only legitimizes the crypto industry but could also accelerate demand and capital inflows into Bitcoin, potentially boosting its already significant valuation.

2025-06-25T19:19:54,"SharpLink Gaming Doubles Down on ETH with $30.6M Buy, Becomes World’s Largest Public Holder","Sports betting company SharpLink Gaming has solidified its position as the world’s largest publicly traded Ethereum holder, acquiring an additional 12,207 ETH for $30.6 million in a five-day buying spree that ended June 20. The Minneapolis-based firm now controls 188,478 ETH , worth approximately $457 million at current prices. This represents one of the audacious corporate crypto strategies since MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation campaign . Today, SharpLink announces that our ETH holdings have further increased to 188,478, which were acquired at an average price of $2,513 per ETH. https://t.co/7kENpBWM41 pic.twitter.com/reFHxplxA9 — SharpLink Gaming (@SharpLinkGaming) June 24, 2025 “ Increasing SharpLink’s ETH holdings underscores our forward-thinking approach to creating long-term value for our stockholders ,” said Joseph Lubin, Chairman of SharpLink’s Board and Ethereum co-founder. Since adopting Ethereum as its primary reserve asset on June 2, the company has generated 120 ETH in staking rewards while achieving 18.97% ETH per share growth, according to the company’s announcement . Strategic Vision Behind the Ethereum Bet SharpLink’s transformation began with a $425 million private placement led by Consensys Software Inc. in May. SharpLink Gaming has landed a $425 million private investment in public equity deal, with blockchain leader @Consensys #Gaming #Ethereum https://t.co/xdHEYt7rB8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 The deal brought Lubin aboard as Chairman, providing institutional credibility and deep Ethereum expertise to guide the company’s treasury strategy. Rather than holding cash or bonds, the company has committed to Ethereum as its primary reserve asset, making it the first Nasdaq-listed company to adopt an ETH-focused treasury model. SharpLink’s approach extends beyond simple price speculation, with the company deploying 100% of its ETH holdings in staking solutions to generate yield while supporting Ethereum’s network security. This dual-purpose strategy allows the firm to earn additional ETH rewards while participating in the network’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, potentially creating a compounding effect as staking rewards are reinvested. The timing appears calculated, coming as Ethereum trades within a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800 after surging 80% from April lows. Industry observers note that SharpLink’s accumulation coincides with growing institutional interest in ETH staking, particularly as more than 35 million ETH tokens have been staked , representing over 28% of the total supply locked in smart contracts. Ethereum staking has reached a new milestone this week, with more than 35 million ETH, over 28.3% of the total supply. #Ethereum #Staking https://t.co/KPGqYuLR5p — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 21, 2025 The company’s aggressive equity-to-crypto conversion model has also created some speculations in the traditional finance circles, particularly given the gaming sector’s historically conservative approach to balance sheet management. Institutional Momentum Builds Across Multiple Fronts Institutional demand for ETH continues to accelerate through traditional channels. In recent weeks, BlackRock and Fidelity poured over $21 million into Ethereum ETFs , while on-chain data shows whale wallets accumulated 871,000 ETH in a single day earlier this month. Ethereum is seeing its most aggressive whale accumulation in seven years, raising speculations about what comes next for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. #Ethereum #Whale https://t.co/R6YYsZtrzW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 17, 2025 We’re beginning to witness a mature approach to the company’s adoption strategy, as it is becoming more selective about the digital assets that align with its specific business models. Recent developments across the crypto space support this thesis, as SharpLink’s strategy is just a mirror of a broader trend of institutional capital flowing into alternative cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. Earlier this week, China’s Nano Labs announced a $500 million convertible note agreement to accumulate up to $1 billion in BNB tokens, targeting 5-10% of the total circulating supply. @NanoLabsLtd has entered into a $500 million convertible note agreement as part of a broader strategy to accumulate BNB worth up to $1 billion. #NanoLabs #BNB https://t.co/mPyfq9HiSQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 Similarly, Nasdaq-listed Classover Holdings has revealed plans to raise $500 million for a Solana-based treasury , with 80% of proceeds allocated to SOL purchases. Even traditional blockchain projects are exploring treasury diversification, with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson proposing a $100 million conversion of ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin . These moves suggest that the era of single-asset treasury strategies may be ending as companies seek to optimize their crypto holdings for specific use cases.

2025-06-25T19:17:15,"Middle East Tensions Ease, Triggering Crypto Rally: BTC, ETH, and These 2 Altcoins Surge","As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East ease, the crypto market is responding with renewed bullish energy. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown early signs of recovery, while Solana and XRP are emerging as top altcoins poised to capitalize on the shift in sentiment. With global uncertainty dialing down, traders are now focused on breakout potential and upcoming resistance levels across key digital assets. This timely analysis is supported by Outset PR —a crypto-native PR agency that transforms market momentum into high-visibility storytelling. When the headlines shift, Outset PR ensures your project’s narrative moves in sync with the market. Ethereum (ETH): Poised for a Strong Recovery After Stabilization Source: tradingview Ethereum (ETH) is finding its footing between $2,000 and $2,500 as broader market sentiment improves. While recent pullbacks have tested short-term support, Ethereum’s fundamentals and developer momentum remain rock solid. A move back above $2,400 could set the stage for a retest of the $3,400 resistance—offering over 40% upside from current levels. With the RSI signaling room for growth and tensions easing globally, ETH may be gearing up for its next leg higher. Bitcoin (BTC): Holding Strong With Eyes on Breakout Above $113K Source: tradingview Bitcoin (BTC) is navigating a consolidation zone between $96,000 and $107,000, building strength for a breakout. With support holding at $92,000 and bullish sentiment returning as geopolitical fears subside, BTC could challenge the $113,000 resistance soon. If cleared, the next target lies near $123,000, offering a potential 10% rally. Despite short-term fluctuations, Bitcoin continues to be the dominant force in the market and remains on solid footing for a continued climb. Solana (SOL): Oversold and Ready for a Sharp Rebound? Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is currently trading between $119 and $152, showing signs of consolidation after recent price pressure. The RSI suggests the asset may be oversold, presenting a prime entry point for bullish traders. With growing developer activity and adoption, a breakout above $171 could pave the way toward $204—a potential 35% surge. Solana remains one of the most promising altcoins for the next market wave, especially if positive momentum returns. XRP: Momentum Building as Bulls Eye $2.95 Target Source: tradingview XRP is showing surprising resilience, holding steady between $1.84 and $2.27 while maintaining key support at $1.66. The RSI near 51 and a slight MACD uptick signal balanced conditions that could soon favor bulls. If XRP crosses the $2.52 resistance, it could accelerate toward $2.95, unlocking more than 20% upside. With legal clarity improving and interest in cross-border payments growing, XRP is positioning itself for a breakout moment.

The bank cited the risk that customers could face debts they would not be able to repay due to the high price volatility of crypto assets behind this decision. In the statement on Barclays' official website, the following statements were used: “As of June 27, 2025, crypto transactions will no longer be possible with Barclaycard. A fall in the price of crypto assets could lead to debts that customers cannot repay.

2025-06-25T18:45:47,"US Senator Adam Schiff Introduces Legislation To Stop President Trump’s ‘Exploitation’ of Digital Assets","US Senator Adam Schiff has introduced a new bill that aims to prevent President Donald Trump and his family members from enriching themselves via crypto. The potential legislation , titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, high-ranking executive branch employees, special government employees and members of Congress from issuing, sponsoring or endorsing digital assets. The ban would last from 180 days prior to an individual’s public services until two years afterward, and it would also extend to officials’ immediate family members. If passed, the bill would also require public officials to include crypto assets in their annual financial disclosures and periodic transaction reports. Schiff (D-California) says in a new press release that Trump’s crypto deals “have raised significant ethical, legal and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of the presidency to enrich himself and his family.” “That’s why I am introducing legislation to prevent the financial exploitation of any digital assets by public officials, including the president and the First Family. We need far greater scrutiny of the president’s financial dealings, and to stop him and any other politician from profiting off of such schemes.” Trump’s recent financial disclosure with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics indicated he pocketed more than $57.3 million worth of income from the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Income from Trump’s controversial memecoin, Official Trump, wasn’t listed on the disclosure because it was released in 2025. Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials. The president hosted the top 220 TRUMP memecoin holders at his private national golf club in Washington, DC last month. The announcement of the event caused the price of the asset to skyrocket .

2025-06-25T18:43:17,"AI predicts Dogecoin price for July 1, 2025","As meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin ( DOGE ) continues to trade in tandem with the broader market, two artificial intelligence (AI) models are projecting that the token is likely to make modest moves on July 1. Their forecasts suggest a price range between $0.158 and $0.185, depending on how the broader market develops. As of press time, DOGE was trading at $0.16, gaining about 0.6% in the past 24 hours. However, the meme coin remains down nearly 1% on the weekly timeline. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Overall, sentiment around the asset is bearish, as confirmed by technical indicators. Dogecoin is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $0.202 and its 200-day SMA of $0.187, signaling continued downside pressure. Additionally, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 40.54, pointing to neutral-to-bearish momentum with room to decline further before reaching oversold conditions. ChatGPT predicts DOGE price Regarding the price outlook, OpenAI’s ChatGPT presented three potential scenarios for Dogecoin on July 1, shaped mainly by Bitcoin’s trajectory, market sentiment, and trading volume. In a bullish scenario, if Bitcoin ( BTC ) breaks through key resistance levels and Dogecoin garners renewed attention on platforms like X, the coin could rise to between $0.175 and $0.185. ChatGPT highlighted DOGE’s sensitivity to influencer buzz and meme-driven hype, noting that a surge in volume could spark a 5–10% rally. In a neutral scenario, Dogecoin is expected to trade within a tighter band of $0.165 to $0.170, assuming Bitcoin remains stable and no major DOGE-related news emerges. In such a case, the token could drift slightly upward in line with recent consolidation trends. On the bearish end, DOGE could fall between $0.158 and $0.162 if Bitcoin pulls back or if DOGE loses technical support around $0.163. Weak sentiment, low trading volume, or regulatory concerns could accelerate a drop below the $0.16 level. DOGE price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts DOGE price Meanwhile, Grok, xAI’s predictive model, issued a single forecast projecting Dogecoin to reach $0.17 by July 1. Based on its current price of $0.16 and DOGE’s historically volatile nature, Grok assumes modest upward momentum driven by community enthusiasm or a general market rebound. However, it also noted the absence of strong fundamental drivers and cautioned that DOGE could oscillate between $0.15 and $0.19, depending on external factors such as social media trends or Bitcoin’s movement.

2025-06-25T18:41:04,"Billionaire Philippe Laffont Hints at Bitcoin Price Doubling, Says De-dollarization and End of US Exceptionalism Coming Into Play","Billionaire investor Philippe Laffont says that he’s been taking more time to think about Bitcoin, and wondering why he didn’t get involved with BTC earlier. In a new interview on CNBC, Laffont, the co-founder of hedge fund Coatue Management, says that when trying to estimate the “net worth” of the entire global economy, he feels that it’s not unreasonable for Bitcoin to represent at least one or two percent of that. Translated into pricing, it would suggest that BTC could double in value at some point in the future, putting the flagship cryptocurrency above the $200,000 mark. Says Laffont, “Every day I do think ‘why do I not own it?’ And I think to be a good investor, it’s not just owning the obvious stock, sometimes you have to change your mind and say ‘well I made a mistake and I’m changing my mind’ and maybe Bitcoin will be like that… I thought of like the market cap of the world [and] the net worth of the world is, I think $450 to $500 trillion, equities are let’s say $120 trillion, gold above and under the ground is $20 trillion. And then Bitcoin is $2 trillion. And I was like okay, well $2 trillion – let’s say it represents half a percent of the net worth of the world, could it go to one of two. Some people say Bitcoin’s going to $100 trillion, I’m like okay that’s maybe a bit of an aggressive estimate but could it double or a period of time? And then we talked about the de-dollarization, the end of US exceptionalism, so those would be of the reasons.” At time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,566.
