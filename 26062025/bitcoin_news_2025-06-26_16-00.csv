2025-06-26T13:55:35,"BTC price outlook: Bitcoin nears bullish breakout with DXY at lowest since 2022","Bitcoin price could be on the cusp of a bullish breakout, potentially reaching its all-time high as a flag pattern forms and the U.S. dollar index crashes. Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $107,115 on Thursday, June 25, up 8.65% from its lowest point this week. A potential catalyst for Bitcoin is the ongoing decline in the U.S. dollar index (DXY), as Donald Trump considers candidates for the next Federal Reserve Chair. The DXY, which measures the dollar’s performance against a basket of currencies, plunged to 96.98—its lowest level since 2022. The index has slumped nearly 12% from its highest level this year, and Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate another 9% crash . This pullback followed Trump’s brokered a truce between Israel and Iran , which ended 12 days of hostilities. It also came after reports indicated Trump is weighing options for replacing Jerome Powell as Fed Chair in 2026, when Powell’s term ends. Leading candidates include Scott Bessent, Kevin Hassett, and Kevin Warsh. You might also like: MSTR stock vs. MSTY stock: Which offers better returns in a Bitcoin bull run? Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell, urging him to cut interest rates. In a statement this week, Powell reiterated the Federal Reserve’s wait-and-see stance. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin echoed that sentiment on Thursday, stating : “There is little upside in heading too quickly in any one direction. Given the strength in today’s economy, we have time to track developments patiently and allow the visibility to improve.” The dollar’s weakness has deepened as investors anticipate that a new Fed Chair could move quickly on interest rate cuts. In a note on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley projected the Fed would implement seven rate cuts in 2026, representing an outlook that could benefit Bitcoin and other risk assets. Bitcoin price technicals signal a breakout is coming BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Bitcoin price has remained above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average, which has provided substantial support since April. Bitcoin has formed a bullish flag pattern, consisting of a vertical line and a descending channel. This channel is part of the handle in a broader cup-and-handle formation. The cup has a depth of about 31%, and projecting the same distance from the upper edge of the handle yields a target price of $143,780. A drop below the 200-day moving average at $94,000 would invalidate the bullish thesis.

2025-06-26T13:40:54,"Spot Ethereum ETFs Surge: $60M Inflows Ignite Market Confidence","BitcoinWorld Spot Ethereum ETFs Surge: $60M Inflows Ignite Market Confidence The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and recent data from the U.S. financial markets has once again captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. On June 25, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed a remarkable total net inflow of $60.16 million. This significant movement signals a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and marks a pivotal moment for the broader digital asset landscape. Understanding the Latest Spot Ethereum ETFs Performance The daily tracking of these new financial products offers crucial insights into market sentiment and investor behavior. According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, the $60.16 million in net inflows on June 25 demonstrates a strong start for these recently launched investment vehicles. While the overall figure is impressive, a closer look reveals a clear leader in this initial phase. Here’s a breakdown of the performance: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund dominated the inflows, attracting a substantial $54.93 million. BlackRock’s strong presence and reputation in traditional finance likely played a significant role in drawing such a large portion of the capital. Bitwise’s ETHW: Following BlackRock, Bitwise’s ETHW secured $5.23 million in inflows, indicating a healthy, albeit smaller, interest from its investor base. Other Spot Ethereum ETFs: Interestingly, the remaining spot Ethereum ETFs reported no changes in their holdings for the day. This suggests that initial institutional capital is highly concentrated in a few key players, particularly those with established track records and brand recognition. This concentrated inflow into a select few ETFs highlights the importance of trust and accessibility for investors entering the crypto space through regulated financial products. What Do These Ethereum Inflows Signify for the Market? The consistent positive Ethereum inflows into these ETFs are more than just numbers; they represent a significant shift in how mainstream finance views and interacts with digital assets. These inflows can be interpreted in several ways, each with profound implications for Ethereum and the wider crypto ecosystem. Increased Institutional Adoption: The primary takeaway is the accelerating pace of institutional adoption. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are now gaining a regulated, familiar pathway to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This reduces operational complexities and regulatory hurdles, making it a more attractive option for traditional investors. Validation of Ethereum’s Value Proposition: Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and its role in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) sectors, is increasingly being recognized as a foundational technology. The inflows suggest that institutional investors are buying into Ethereum’s long-term potential as a programmable blockchain. Potential for Price Impact: While daily inflows might not immediately cause drastic price movements, sustained inflows over weeks and months can create significant buying pressure. As more capital flows into these ETFs, the underlying ETH needs to be purchased to back the shares, potentially driving up the price of Ethereum. This creates a positive feedback loop, attracting even more interest. Market Maturity: The launch and subsequent performance of these ETFs contribute to the overall maturity of the cryptocurrency market. It moves crypto from a niche, speculative asset class to a more legitimate and accessible investment option within traditional financial portfolios. BlackRock ETHA: A Dominant Force in the New ETF Landscape The sheer volume of inflows into BlackRock ETHA is a testament to BlackRock’s immense influence and strategic positioning in the financial world. As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock brings unparalleled trust and reach to any product it launches. Their entry into the crypto ETF space, first with Bitcoin and now with Ethereum, is a game-changer. Why is BlackRock’s ETHA leading the pack? Brand Recognition and Trust: BlackRock is a household name in finance. Investors, particularly institutional ones, are more comfortable allocating capital to a fund managed by a firm with such a long-standing reputation for reliability and expertise. Extensive Distribution Network: BlackRock has a vast network of clients and advisors, making it easier for them to distribute their new ETF products to a wide range of investors, from large pension funds to individual wealth management accounts. Proven Track Record: The success of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has set a precedent. Investors who saw the rapid growth and adoption of IBIT are likely to feel confident in allocating capital to their Ethereum counterpart. Liquidity and Market Depth: A larger fund often attracts more liquidity, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting the market price of the ETF shares. The performance of BlackRock’s ETHA will likely serve as a benchmark for other Ethereum ETFs and could encourage more traditional financial players to explore similar offerings. The Broader Impact of the ETH ETF on Crypto Adoption The introduction and success of an ETH ETF marks a crucial milestone for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. For years, direct investment in crypto was seen as complex, risky, and largely unregulated. ETFs bridge this gap by offering a familiar, regulated, and easily accessible investment vehicle. Benefits for Investors: Simplicity: Investors can gain exposure to Ethereum through their existing brokerage accounts, just like they would with stocks or other ETFs. Security: The custody of the underlying Ethereum is handled by professional, regulated custodians, reducing the risk of hacks or self-custody errors for individual investors. Liquidity: ETF shares are traded on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of trading during market hours. Diversification: For traditional portfolios, adding an ETH ETF provides diversification into a rapidly growing digital asset class. Challenges and Considerations: Fees: ETFs come with management fees, which can eat into returns over time compared to direct ownership. Indirect Ownership: Investors own shares in a fund that holds Ethereum, not the Ethereum itself. This means they cannot use their ETH for staking, DeFi, or other on-chain activities. Market Volatility: While ETFs provide regulated access, they are still exposed to the inherent volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency market. Despite these considerations, the net positive inflows suggest that the benefits currently outweigh the challenges for a significant portion of the investor community. What’s Next for Crypto ETFs and the Digital Asset Market? The success of the U.S. Crypto ETFs , both Bitcoin and now Ethereum, paints a promising picture for the future of digital asset investment. This trend is likely to continue, potentially paving the way for ETFs based on other major cryptocurrencies, provided they meet regulatory requirements and demonstrate sufficient market demand. Future Outlook: Increased Competition: As more funds enter the market, we can expect increased competition, potentially leading to lower fees and more innovative product offerings. Global Adoption: The U.S. market often sets a precedent. The success here could encourage other countries to approve similar crypto ETF products, further legitimizing digital assets on a global scale. Impact on Spot Price: Continued institutional buying through ETFs could provide a stable demand floor for Ethereum, potentially mitigating some of the extreme volatility seen in previous market cycles. Evolution of Investment Products: We might see more complex crypto-linked financial products emerge, such as options or futures on these ETFs, offering even more sophisticated ways for investors to gain exposure or hedge risk. The journey of spot Ethereum ETFs has just begun, but the initial $60.16 million net inflow is a strong indicator of the significant role they are poised to play in the ongoing integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The robust $60.16 million in total net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on June 25, heavily led by BlackRock’s ETHA, marks a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum, validates its long-term potential, and offers a clear pathway for broader investor adoption. While challenges remain, the current trajectory suggests a promising future where digital assets are increasingly accessible and integrated into traditional investment portfolios. This surge of capital is not just a daily statistic; it’s a powerful signal of evolving market confidence and the dawning of a new era for Ethereum investment.

Here Are the Details","US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows for the 12th consecutive trading day, bringing the total capital gain to $3.9 billion. On June 25 alone, $547.7 million inflows were made. Bitcoin ETFs 12-Day Net Inflow Series: Total Inflows Near $4 Billion, BTC Strengthens on Dollar Weakness BlackRock’s IBIT fund was the day’s top ETF with net inflows of $340.3 million. Fidelity’s FBTC fund followed with $115.2 million. Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL funds took in $70.2 million, $12.9 million and $9.1 million, respectively. Other ETFs closed with zero net inflows. IBIT continues to lead the pack by accounting for 86% ($3.3 billion) of the 12-day total net inflows. “12 consecutive days of inflows, $4 billion in fresh capital. The ETF category is approaching $50 billion since January 2024. That’s really incredible,” said Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store. To date, there have been a total of $48.4 billion in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January 2024. Total assets under management in these funds currently stand at approximately $125 billion. Positive Mood Continues for Ethereum ETFs Spot Ethereum ETFs also recorded net inflows of $60.4 million on the same day, with $55.2 million of the inflows also going to BlackRock’s ETHA fund. This is the third consecutive positive day for Ethereum ETFs, with total inflows over the last three days reaching $232.4 million. In total, $4.2 billion has flowed into these funds to date, which were launched in July 2024. Bitcoin is trading at $107,445, up 0.8% in the last 24 hours and 2.9% on the week. After falling to $98,000 on Sunday, BTC tested the $108,000 level again on Thursday morning. Timothy Misir, BRN Research Director, said that the dollar index falling to its lowest level since March 2022 created a strong headwind for crypto assets: “The weakening dollar and the World Bank’s downgrade of its 2025 US growth forecast to 1.4% from 2.3% are sending economic signals in favor of uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin.” Misir also emphasized that government institutions have openly begun accumulating Bitcoin and companies continue to rapidly adopt Bitcoin, expressing that BTC is maturing as an institutional asset class. K33 Research President Vetle Lunde stated in his assessment earlier this week that ETF flows directly affect the BTC price, while treasury companies have a more limited impact. Considering the combination of increasing institutional demand, the weakening dollar and concerns about an economic slowdown, it is thought that Bitcoin's upward momentum may continue in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-26T13:36:21,"Pi Network Price Growth Driven by Real Demand, Says Analyst","The post Pi Network Price Growth Driven by Real Demand, Says Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News PI is making headlines again —up 5% this week and holding strong at an average of $0.60 for the past 3 months. But is it just hype, or is something real driving the momentum? PI Price Action: A Rollercoaster Start Pi Network (PI) launched with a bang on February 20 , starting at just $0.0991. Within six days, the price rocketed by 2,812.41%, setting off a wave of excitement across the crypto community. But the hype didn’t last forever. From February 27 to April 4 , PI crashed by 81.51% . February still ended strong with a 222.5% gain . In March and April, PI declined by 66.5% and 13.9% , respectively. May brought a 6.39% rebound , showing some market recovery. However, June has been rough , with a 17.4% drop so far. Weekly Surge: PI Up 5% Amid Stability Despite the volatile ride, PI has risen 5% in the last 7 days, currently trading at $0.5639 . Most notably, PI has consistently maintained an average price of $0.60 over the past 3 months—a rare feat for new tokens in a bear-biased market. Analyst: “PI’s Growth Is Organic, Not Hype” According to crypto analyst Dr Altcoin, this price consistency isn’t fueled by hype or manipulation. In a recent post on X (Twitter) , he explained: “PI’s price action is being shaped by organic market demand and long-term support—not speculation.” Dr Altcoin believes real investor confidence is behind the token’s price strength. Pi Network’s $100M Ecosystem Fund Is a Game-Changer The analyst highlights a crucial factor supporting this stability— Pi Network Ventures’ $100 million fund , aimed at developing the ecosystem. This fund incentivizes developers to build real-world apps using PI. It drives tangible utility , bringing new users and real use cases to the platform. The focus is on slow, steady, and sustainable growth , not overnight pumps. PI Price Prediction: What’s Next? Dr Altcoin says no major price spike is expected this week unless a big announcement drops. However, he remains bullish on long-term stability, stating that: “PI is unlikely to fall below its all-time low of $0.40.” The coin has tested the $0.40 low only twice—April 5 and June 13—but quickly bounced back. Currently, PI sits 41.47% above its low, signaling strong support. Final Thoughts: Is PI the Dark Horse of 2025? While many still dismiss PI as a hype-driven token, the data and ecosystem funding tell a different story. With real-world utility growing and investor confidence holding steady, PI might just be the most underrated crypto of the year.

Driven by new political interest and a global trend, India’s ruling party, the BJP, signals towards forming a Bitcoin Reserve. National spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari argued that India could benefit from adopting a BTC reserve. BJP Urges to Establish Bitcoin Reserve in India Recently, Pradeep Bhandari, the spokesperson of the BJP, urged that India’s financial policies must evolve to adapt more flexible and innovative framework. This method will aim to bring financial growth and prosperity to the country, according to Bhandari. He stated – “India stands at a pivotal juncture. A measured Bitcoin strategy—perhaps a reserve pilot—could strengthen economic resilience and project modernity. As the US advances and nations like Bhutan adapt, India has a unique opportunity to lead.” Bhandari’s Argument for the Possibility of BTC Reserve in India Bhandari points out several significant points that signal the possibility of a future Bitcoin reserve in India. Renewable Energy Capacity He noted that India has the full capability to mine Bitcoin, following Bhutan’s mining initiative. Bhutan mines Bitcoin, using hydropower, building a reserve exceeding $1billion by Q1 2025. Bhandari suggests that India could follow this framework, as India has even bigger renewable energy potential than Bhutan. US Model Bhandari noted that the US benefited by launching its Bitcoin Reserve and now holds over $20 billion in value. India could benefit from a pilot reserve strategy based on the US model, he proposed.

US Home Loan Regulator May Recognize Crypto Assets US home mortgage purchasers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will consider cryptocurrencies as assets during risk assessments for single-family loans. This is a significant step in the mainstream acceptance of crypto under the Trump administration. William J. Pulte, Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), issued the new directive on Wednesday. The FHFA also regulates both government-sponsored enterprises. The decision means crypto will be considered a reserve asset for borrowers without converting them into US Dollars. The FHFA has been in charge of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since 2008 when both were placed under government conservatorship after the financial crisis. According to Pulte, the decision to include crypto in the mortgage risk assessment came after significant deliberations and studies. It aligns with President Trump’s goal to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have played a crucial role in the US housing market since the subprime mortgage crisis, providing liquidity and stability by purchasing mortgages from lenders, enabling them to issue more loans. Crypto.com Secures Insurance For US Custody Platform Crypto.com has announced that it has secured $120 million in insurance coverage for assets held in the Crypto.com custody trust. According to the official announcement, Aon, a London-based insurance company, arranged the insurance cover. The company worked with underwriters via Lloyd’s of London to assess the platform’s risk management. Crypto.com’s Custody Trust Company offers digital asset custody solutions for institutions based in North America. The insurance plan aims to protect eligible customers from crime and theft. Joe Anzures, president of Crypto.com Custody Trust Company, stated, “We built Crypto.com on a foundation of safety and security. Our insurance policy arranged by Aon for assets within Crypto.com Custody Trust Company is the latest example of our efforts to safeguard our customers and provide a best-in-class offering our clients can be reassured by.” According to sources, the insurance coverage includes the first quarter of 2025. Around $100 million is for physical loss, theft, or damage to customer assets held in cold storage. The remaining $20 million will cover third-party theft and other criminal incidents.

Prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket have gained traction recently, emerging as an alternative to traditional polling. Proponents have argued that prediction markets offer more accuracy by aggregating the collective expectations of all participants. Kalshi’s latest fundraising comes amid reports that its closest competitor, Polymarket, is expected to close a $200 million funding round that values it at $1 billion. Coinbase Stock Rallies To 52-Week High Coinbase (COIN) surged to a 52-week high after Bernstein analysts called the company a “one-stop Amazon” of crypto services. COIN shares gained over 3% in the past 24 hours to reach within touching distance of its record close of $357.39. Bernstein analysts raised their price target from $310 to $510, giving the stock an Outperform rating. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani stated, “Coinbase is the most misunderstood company in our Crypto coverage universe. COIN has also added several fast-growing businesses such as institutional custody, Base blockchain services, and Prime lending desk, emerging as the ‘Amazon of crypto financial services’, offering crypto financial services beyond simple trading.” Coinbase is the only crypto firm in the S&P 500 and dominates US crypto trading. It also operates the largest stablecoin business among all crypto exchanges and is the custodian for the underlying assets of most US spot Bitcoin ETFs. “Coinbase’s market share has been persistent despite new competition. Traditional brokerage competition is several months away from launch, which is an eternity on crypto timelines.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its gains for a fourth consecutive day as it consolidated around $107,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up during the ongoing session, with the price up 0.34%. Analysts believe BTC’s current price action favors a push to $110,000 after it broke through a key resistance level. The price registered an increase of 1.18% Wednesday to reclaim $107,000 and move to $107,393. BTC’s rebound comes amid a dovish stance by the Federal Reserve and the easing of geopolitical tensions, which improved risk sentiment across markets. As a result, BTC reached an intraday high of $108,201 on Wednesday before settling at $107,393, thanks to profit booking at higher levels. Despite the minor drop, sentiment around BTC remains positive. BTC is trading around 3% lower than its all-time high, with analysts expecting continued bullish momentum, which could push the price beyond $110,000. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, stated that markets are showing strength. He also said that open interest suggested a possible squeeze at $110,000 before a reversal. “If a pullback ensues, key levels around $106,000 and $104,000 should offer strong support.” The recent uptick has also seen BTC book year-to-date gains of nearly 15%, making it the top-performing cryptocurrency among the top 5. CoinGlass data shows that BTC short liquidations were in a normal range, with most shorts liquidated on Monday when the price bounced off $110,000. Meanwhile, open interest in BTC futures has climbed to its highest level in over a fortnight, with traders returning to the market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also testified before Congress that the central bank does not intend to rush a rate cut. However, he reiterated that there will be two rate cuts this year. The confirmation comes after the Trump administration decided against raising tariffs on goods from China and other trading partners. BTC started the previous week in positive territory, reaching an intraday high of $108,939 before losing momentum and settling at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Sellers took control on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884 before registering a marginal decline on Thursday and settling at $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.19%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,388. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish on Saturday, falling 1.17% to $102,180, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $100,979. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $98,385 as market sentiment worsened. It recovered from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. Market sentiment flipped to bullish on Monday after President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, BTC rallied over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,442. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 0.66% to cross the 20 and 50-day SMAs, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,138. BTC continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 1.18% to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,393. The current session sees BTC marginally up, as buyers look to push to $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) bulls have seized control after a minor wobble on Wednesday led to a decline of 1.25% to $2,419. Analysts believe the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could reclaim $2,500 if buyers maintain control. However, it must cross $2,550 to confirm a bullish rally. If ETH loses momentum and closes below $2,400, it could decline to $2,200 or lower. Despite Wednesday’s wobble, ETF inflows remained strong. However, ETH is down nearly 2% over the past seven days, indicating traders are skeptical about a push to $3,000. ETH derivatives also suggest reduced demand for leveraged bullish bets. However, ETH’s drop from upper levels has not diminished demand for Ethereum ETFs, which registered inflows of $322 million over the next two weeks. However, CryptoQuant analysts are bullish about ETH, adding that a break above the 50-day EMA could propel the asset to $2,800. If resistance levels are breached, it could push to $4,000. The analysts stated that ETH must consistently close above $2,500 to confirm a breakout. Historical data also shows that ETH has moved sharply after breaking out of similar consolidation goals. Despite a positive outlook, they urged investors to be cautious, highlighting that geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic events could trigger market volatility. ETH started the previous week in the red despite racing to an intraday high of $2,680. It lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $2,544, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 1.31% to $2,511. Despite the selling pressure, ETH recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.57%, but was back in the red on Thursday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $2,522. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as the price fell nearly 5%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and $2,500 to $2,406. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Saturday as ETH fell to an intraday low of $2,215 before settling at $2,296, ultimately registering a drop of 4.56%. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $2,119 on Sunday as market sentiment worsened. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $2,200 and settle at $2,229, registering a drop of almost 3%. Market sentiment flipped to bullish on Monday after President Trump announced an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, ETH soared over 8% to reclaim $2,400 and settle at $2,413. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price registered an increase of 1.51% and settled at $2,450. However, ETH lost momentum on Wednesday and fell 1.25% to $2,419. Bullish sentiment has returned during the ongoing session, with the price up over 3%, trading around $2,496. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) rebounded during the ongoing session, consolidating around $145. The world’s 6th largest cryptocurrency started the week with a strong rally, surging nearly 10% to $144. However, it has struggled to move higher and faces a wall of resistance around $150. However, there is good news for investors as Invesco Galaxy filed for a Solana ETF, meaning the US could get nine Solana ETFs, depending on regulatory approval. Invesco and Galaxy Digital proposed the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, joining bids from VanEck, Bitwise, and Grayscale. “NEW: @InvescoUS and @galaxyhq just filed for a Solana ETF. That makes nine issuers who have filed for a Solana ETF now.” Approval of the ETFs could send SOL beyond $180 and even $200. SOL raced to an intraday high of $158 on Monday (June 16) as buyers attempted to overwhelm sellers. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.52% to $150. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as SOL dropped over 2%, slipping below $150 and settling at $147. The price declined on Wednesday, falling almost 1% to $146. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, SOL recovered on Thursday, rising 0.44% after falling to a low of $143 and settling at $147. SOL was back in bearish territory on Friday, dropping nearly 5% to $140, but not before hitting a low of $135. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish on Saturday as SOL fell over 3% to $135.

2025-06-26T13:10:56,"Dogwifhat slips after golden pocket rejection, this support level now in focus","Dogwifhat remains in a macro downtrend and is currently undergoing a corrective move after a major rejection at the golden pocket. Price is now trading back inside the broader range, with lower support in focus. Over the past week, Dogwifhat ( WIF ) has continued to print a series of lower highs and lower lows, signaling both local and macro weakness. The most recent breakout attempt failed, with price sharply rejecting from a significant resistance cluster. This has led to a return to the range mid, where price is currently consolidating. With volume dropping and momentum fading, a double-bottom formation may be the structure to watch for at the range low. Key technical points Rejection at 0.618 Fibonacci: Golden pocket, VWAP, POC, and value area high all aligned. Macro Downtrend Still Intact: Price continues to post lower highs and lower lows. Key Support at $0.30: Double bottom formation possible if price revisits this level. WIFUSDT (1D) Chart: Source, TradingView The recent rejection on Dogwifhat was anything but random. Price rallied directly into the golden pocket—the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, where it also collided with multiple confluences: the VWAP resistance, the point of control, the value area high, and the range high of the broader consolidation zone. This convergence created a textbook technical resistance, which promptly rejected the move and sent price lower. This breakdown has pushed Dogwifhat back into the range mid, confirming that the breakout lacked the volume and follow-through needed for continuation. The drop in volume reinforces the idea that the market is still consolidating rather than trending, with price stuck in a broader accumulation zone. You might also like: Pepe Dollar could rebirth DeFi on Ethereum for retail investors From a technical perspective, price action remains corrective and could stay this way until it tests the range low near $0.30. This is the level to watch for a potential double-bottom formation, a bullish reversal pattern that occurs when price retests a previous low and holds. If buyers defend this level and price forms a higher low on the retest, it could set the stage for a rally back toward $1.20 and beyond. Until that formation occurs, the market remains in limbo. The lower highs suggest sellers remain in control, and bulls will need to reclaim range levels with strength and volume to shift the narrative. What to expect in the coming price action Dogwifhat is likely to remain trapped within the broader range unless volume steps in decisively. Watch for a revisit of the $0.30 level, where a double bottom may initiate the next bullish wave. Failure to defend this support would invalidate the setup and extend the downtrend.

2025-06-26T13:10:23,"Amazing Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Robust Market Growth","BitcoinWorld Amazing Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Robust Market Growth The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with exciting news as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue their impressive run, signaling a significant shift in the digital asset landscape. On June 25, these innovative investment vehicles collectively witnessed a staggering $547.39 million in total net inflows, extending their winning streak to an remarkable 12 consecutive trading days. This sustained momentum isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful indicator of growing confidence and institutional appetite for Bitcoin. The Phenomenal Surge: Understanding Recent Bitcoin ETF Inflows For weeks, analysts and investors alike have been closely monitoring the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the data from June 25 provides yet another compelling chapter in their success story. The figure of $547.39 million in net inflows highlights a robust demand that continues to absorb Bitcoin supply, potentially laying the groundwork for future price appreciation. This consistent stream of capital flowing into these regulated products underscores a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate and accessible asset class. What exactly does this sustained inflow mean? It suggests that both retail and institutional investors are increasingly comfortable gaining exposure to Bitcoin through traditional investment avenues. Unlike direct Bitcoin purchases, ETFs offer a regulated, familiar, and often more convenient way to invest, eliminating concerns about self-custody, security, and complex exchange interfaces. This ease of access is proving to be a powerful magnet for capital. Who’s Leading the Charge in U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs? While the overall picture is one of strong positive movement, a closer look reveals which specific players are driving these substantial Bitcoin ETF inflows . On June 25, several key players stood out: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded an impressive $339.96 million in net inflows. This dominant performance solidifies IBIT’s position as a top choice for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. Fidelity’s FBTC: Following closely, Fidelity’s FBTC secured $115.19 million in net inflows, demonstrating its strong appeal and consistent performance in the competitive ETF market. ARK Invest’s ARKB: ARK Invest’s ARKB also contributed significantly, bringing in $70.20 million in net inflows, showcasing continued interest from its investor base. Bitwise’s BITB: Adding to the positive trend, Bitwise’s BITB saw $12.90 million in net inflows. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck’s HODL rounded out the top performers with $9.14 million in net inflows. The fact that the remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day further emphasizes the concentrated success of these leading funds, particularly BlackRock IBIT , which continues to capture the lion’s share of new investments. The Impact of BlackRock IBIT’s Dominance: What Does It Mean? The consistent outperformance of BlackRock IBIT is a crucial element in the ongoing success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, brings unparalleled institutional trust, distribution networks, and marketing power to the Bitcoin space. Their robust inflows are not just about volume; they signify a deepening acceptance of Bitcoin within mainstream finance. When a giant like BlackRock commits significant resources and attracts hundreds of millions daily, it sends a powerful signal to other institutional players and conservative investors who might have previously hesitated. IBIT’s success can be attributed to several factors, including its competitive fee structure, BlackRock’s established reputation, and its efficient market-making operations. This strong performance by IBIT, coupled with other major players, creates a positive feedback loop, drawing in more capital and further legitimizing Bitcoin as an investable asset. How Are These Inflows Shaping the Crypto Market? The sustained influx of capital into Bitcoin ETFs has a profound impact on the broader crypto market . Firstly, it provides a consistent buying pressure for Bitcoin itself, which can contribute to price stability and upward momentum. As ETFs acquire more BTC to back their shares, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially leading to price increases if demand continues to outstrip supply. Secondly, these inflows boost overall market sentiment. Positive news regarding institutional adoption and significant capital injections tends to instill confidence among both retail and institutional investors, reducing fear and uncertainty. This positive sentiment can spill over into other cryptocurrencies, as Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the entire digital asset ecosystem. The narrative shifts from speculative investment to a more mature asset class, attracting a wider range of participants. Finally, the success of Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for other cryptocurrency ETFs, such as Ethereum ETFs, further expanding the accessibility and legitimacy of the digital asset space within traditional finance. This incremental integration is vital for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto market. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: A Glimpse into the Future The continuous streak of net inflows is a clear testament to accelerating institutional Bitcoin adoption . Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin through these regulated products. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about diversification, hedging against inflation, and recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value. This trend signifies a maturation of the Bitcoin market. As more institutional capital enters, it can lead to reduced volatility over time, as these entities typically have longer investment horizons and less reactive trading strategies compared to some retail investors. Furthermore, the involvement of major financial players brings increased regulatory scrutiny and infrastructure development, which can further enhance the market’s stability and appeal. The future of Bitcoin, therefore, looks increasingly intertwined with traditional finance. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs is not just a story of impressive numbers; it’s a narrative of integration, validation, and the steady march of digital assets into the mainstream investment world. In conclusion, the remarkable run of 12 consecutive days of net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, highlighted by BlackRock IBIT’s leading performance, marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. This sustained capital injection underscores growing institutional confidence and accessibility, cementing Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate and increasingly sought-after asset. As the lines between traditional finance and digital assets continue to blur, these ETFs are playing a crucial role in shaping a more mature and robust investment landscape for Bitcoin, promising an exciting future for the entire crypto ecosystem.

2025-06-26T13:03:54,"Galaxy Digital raises $175m for stablecoin and DeFi venture fund","Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital has launched a $175 million fund to invest in new crypto startups. Galaxy Digital is expanding its crypto startup venture capital business. According to a June 26 report by Fortune, the company has raised $175 million for its latest venture fund. The fund, which will focus on DeFi and stablecoins, exceeded its original funding target of $150 million. Mike Giampapa, general partner at Galaxy Digital, explained that the firm plans to invest across more companies operating at the intersection of traditional finance and crypto. The primary focus will be on stablecoins and DeFi, which the firm says hold particular promise. “You’re seeing this fundamental shift from more speculative use cases of blockchains to something that’s much more…tangible,” Mike Giampapa, Galaxy Digital.

2025-06-26T13:03:29,"Last Time Bitcoin Did This, the Price Went From $60K to $100K","Bitcoin (BTC) could be primed for a surge to $160,000, according to a key on-chain metric that foreshadowed two other record-breaking rallies. This bullish outlook is emerging even as BTC battles volatility near $108,000, a psychological threshold tested amid geopolitical turbulence and conflicting accumulation patterns. The Accumulation Blueprint In his latest analysis , market watcher Axel Adler Jr. pointed out that Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holder (LTH) to Short-Term Holder (STH) ratio shows a very familiar accumulation pattern. According to him, some of BTC’s most explosive rallies between 2023 and 2025 were preceded by sustained LTH/STH growth. One of the runs, which started when Bitcoin was trading around the $28,000 level, saw the king cryptocurrency go all the way to $60,000. Another LTH/STH ratio uptick provided enough momentum to push BTC from $60,000 to $100,000. Adler has noted the same signal flashing at the $100,000 level: “Today, at the $100K mark, we again see sustained growth in the LTH/STH ratio,” noted the expert. “This accumulation phase could last 4-8 weeks, after which, by analogy with previous cycles, a powerful upward reversal is likely.” Applying a conservative 1.6x multiplier to Bitcoin’s current price, he projects a $160,000 target by the end of August. Giving more credence to the outlook, prominent trader Titan of Crypto identified a bull flag formation on BTC’s daily charts, suggesting a potential breakout to $137,000. He added that the MACD indicator was also on the verge of a bullish crossover, a move often viewed as a trigger for price momentum shifts. Technical and historical indicators also bolster Adler’s thesis. For instance, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart places the crypto asset firmly in the “BUY” zone, a scenario comparable to November 2020, just prior to it setting off on a 450% ROI surge, and May 2017, before the same metric boomed 1,400%. Market Outlook This activity coincides with broader geopolitical and market forces. On June 25, Bitcoin briefly touched $108,000 following remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump on easing tensions in the Middle East. Prices have since cooled slightly, with BTC changing hands at around $107,653 at the time of this writing. While a modest 0.7% gain in the last 24 hours, the price reflects a 1.8% monthly dip. Still, the asset’s nearly 3% uptick in the last seven days puts its performance slightly ahead of the rest of the crypto market, which only managed to go up 1.6% in that period. However, the sideways movement saw BTC underperform versus tech stocks like Nvidia (+9.15%) and Oracle (+32.5%), raising questions about capital rotation.

We want to be the crypto capital of the world, and that includes both innovation on-chain and domestic mining.” He then framed the asset as “a tool of modern statecraft,” arguing that the country that shapes the next monetary architecture will wield influence comparable to the United States’ post-1945 dollar hegemony. “If we’re not actively shaping and influencing what that new construct looks like,” he warned, “we’re going to be at a disadvantage.” His third rationale was geopolitical : bitcoin’s borderless rails, he contended, extend financial inclusion to “the billions who are unbanked or live under wildly irresponsible regimes,” thereby opening fresh markets for US capital and reinforcing the attraction of dollar-denominated assets. Although Witt wore a digital-asset hat on stage, his other job—overseeing the Pentagon’s Office of Strategic Capital—hovered in the background. He reminded the audience that OSC, a vehicle originally seeded with $984 million in lending authority, now stands at five billion dollars and could reach $200 billion if Congress grants equity powers. Witt hinted that some of that war-chest could flow into bitcoin-adjacent energy and compute infrastructure. “We want compute and energy to be domestic, secure, and abundant,” he said, inviting miners and grid-modernisation firms to view OSC as a potential lender of first resort rather than last. “We’re open for business.” Egan steered the conversation toward the practical obstacles of embedding bitcoin in national strategy. Witt acknowledged the legislative gauntlet—“getting a seemingly innocuous bill across the finish line requires horse-trading and compromise”—but argued that industry itself can shorten the path by acting as a “trusted partner and objective resource” rather than simply “selling their own book.” He noted that White House staff working on digital assets is “thin,” making outside research indispensable when drafting statutes or rule-makings that can survive contact with political reality. The deputy also painted a rare picture of the day-to-day inside the Executive Office. The inter-agency report that will formalise the accumulation plan—due to land on the President’s desk in early July—has already absorbed input from the Treasury, the Council of Economic Advisers, the National Security Council and, crucially, OSC’s finance technologists. Witt described the document as “the best policy product we can fashion within the realm of the possible,” language that suggests its drafters believe the plan can proceed without fresh appropriations. While yesterday’s remarks crowned a series of hints by Bo Hines—who has argued since March that Washington should “acquire as much bitcoin as we can responsibly get”—Witt’s position inside the chain of command gives his words a force earlier signalling lacked. In analyst shorthand, Hines implied the desire to accumulate; Witt confirmed the institutional machinery is clicking into gear.

2025-06-26T13:00:09,"What Are Whales Doing in Bitcoin and Ethereum? Long or Short? Santiment Explained!","While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $108,000 today, investors do not believe that this rise is real. At this point, cryptocurrency analysis platform Santiment said that the data also points to a decline expectation in Bitcoin. Santiment analyzed the latest situation in Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). He said that BTC recorded a negative funding rate while Ethereum recorded positive rates. Stating that BTC and ETH are showing opposite trends, Santiment said that short positions in Bitcoin and long positions in Ethereum are increasing. Stating that the recent recovery in Bitcoin has led investors to short positions, Santiment argued that this situation could trigger a short squeeze in Bitcoin and further rise. “Short positions in Bitcoin have increased significantly compared to long positions. If short positions overheat, the probability of a temporary recovery in Bitcoin increases even more. This is called a short squeeze.” Ethereum Rise Depends on Bitcoin! Stating that Ethereum shows the opposite trend compared to Bitcoin, Santiment said that there are currently more long positions in ETH than short positions. However, Santiment stated that this still does not indicate a rise for ETH, arguing that ETH's rise is limited due to its correlation with Bitcoin. At this point, Santiment stated that Ethereum remains correlated with Bitcoin, saying: “While long positions are somewhat dominant on Ethereum, Ethereum's potential for a significant standalone rally without a Bitcoin rally is limited.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-26T13:00:00,"Tether Aims to Dominate Bitcoin Mining While Powering AI Economy with USDT","Tether is doubling down on its strategic expansion beyond stablecoins, with CEO Paolo Ardoino announcing plans for the company to become the largest Bitcoin miner by the end of the year while also predicting a future where trillions of AI agents will use USDT and Bitcoin for machine-to-machine transactions. Ardoino outlined Tether’s investments in mining, artificial intelligence, and self-custodial tools as part of a broader push to position the firm at the heart of an increasingly automated, blockchain-driven digital economy. Tether CEO Says Company Could Become World's Largest Bitcoin Miner by Year-End Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed in a recent podcast episode that the stablecoin giant could emerge as the world’s largest bitcoin miner by the end of 2025. The claim signals the company’s accelerating pivot beyond digital currency issuance into deep infrastructure investment — a strategy Ardoino says is designed not for profit alone, but for the security of the Bitcoin network itself. Tether, known globally for issuing the USDT stablecoin, is operated by a relatively small team of under 200 people. Yet, the company reported a staggering $13 billion in profits during 2024, primarily from its massive holdings in US Treasuries, Bitcoin, and other reserve assets. That war chest has given Tether ample financial firepower to pursue an aggressive expansion strategy. In recent years, Tether has diversified across multiple sectors, ranging from artificial intelligence and telecommunications to data centers and energy infrastructure. But perhaps the most significant and ambitious move has been into the world of bitcoin mining — a sector typically dominated by long-established industrial firms. While the profits of mining companies have drawn many players into the industry, Ardoino made it clear that Tether's ambitions are rooted in strategic alignment, not pure ROI. Tether currently holds more than 100,000 BTC, valued at over $10 billion at current prices. “I think that is clear that if you have $1 million and you have to decide where to put it — either in bitcoin mining or in buying bitcoin directly — you would always make more money buying bitcoin directly,” Ardoino explained. “But in our case, I think given the exposure that we have to bitcoin, it's important to be part of the security of the network.” In Ardoino’s view, bitcoin mining is not just a business but a responsibility — a way to directly protect and support the network on which the company’s core assets depend. “Realistically, by the end of this year, Tether will become the biggest bitcoin miner out there,” he declared. $2 Billion Invested Across Latin America While exact figures for Tether’s current hashrate remain undisclosed, the company’s footprint has grown rapidly. Since 2023, Tether has invested more than $2 billion in energy and mining infrastructure across 15 sites in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. This includes the development of renewable energy projects, construction of substations, and minority stakes in already-operational mining farms. The initial $500 million investment in late 2023 marked the beginning of a long-term strategy. Ardoino indicated that the expansion is ongoing, with additional capital earmarked for future development. The locations Tether has chosen are known for having abundant hydropower and favorable regulatory environments — two critical factors for sustainable mining growth. To put Ardoino’s claim in perspective, the top bitcoin mining firms by current hashrate include Marathon Digital (MARA) at 57.3 EH/s, CleanSpark at 50 EH/s, Iris Energy (IREN) at 38.4 EH/s, Riot Platforms at 33.7 EH/s, and Core Scientific at 19.1 EH/s. Bitcoin’s total network hashrate is currently estimated at 810 EH/s. Surpassing those firms would require Tether to operate or control tens of exahashes per second (EH/s) in computing power. While this target is ambitious, Tether’s substantial capital and rapid infrastructure buildout make the goal not entirely implausible — especially if acquisitions or strategic partnerships are involved. Yet, the lack of transparency regarding Tether’s exact mining hashrate metrics raises some skepticism. Without public disclosures, observers can only estimate the company’s current position within the broader mining ecosystem. An Emerging Energy Giant? Ardoino’s comments also reinforce Tether’s long-term ambition to become more than a stablecoin issuer. By embedding itself into the physical infrastructure layers of society — energy, data, and intelligence — Tether seems to be positioning itself as a backbone for the decentralized digital economy. With a CEO focused on Bitcoin’s longevity, a multi-billion-dollar budget, and an expansive view of technological sovereignty, Tether’s mining play is not just about hashing power. It’s a philosophical statement about decentralization, resilience, and the future of money. Whether the company can truly claim the crown of the world’s largest bitcoin miner by year’s end remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Tether is no longer just a fintech firm. It is rapidly becoming an industrial force in the age of digital infrastructure. Tether’s Paolo Ardoino Sees Trillion-Bot Economy, with USDT and Bitcoin as the Native Money In Ardoino’s view of the not-so-distant future, billions of autonomous software bots will negotiate, pay, and settle with one another every second—without a human in sight. And when they do, the Tether CEO expects two assets to power that machine-to-machine (M2M) economy: USDT and Bitcoin. Ardoino made perhaps his most ambitious prediction yet during the podcast appearance: “We are going to have one trillion AI agents in 15 years, and each one will need a self-custodial wallet.” In such a world, he argued, traditional banks will be ill-equipped—or simply unwilling—to treat autonomous bots as customers. Stablecoins and permissionless crypto networks, by contrast, can provide immediate, always-on settlement rails. AI agents—autonomous pieces of software able to interact with other machines, APIs, and blockchains—are already taking on narrow tasks such as negotiating bandwidth prices, allocating cloud resources, or rebalancing liquidity pools. Their numbers remain tiny today, but Ardoino foresees exponential growth as large-language models mature and on-chain identities become cheaper and faster to spin up. “I don’t think JPMorgan will open a bank account for any AI agent,” he told the podcast host, adding that self-custody is the only workable model for non-human economic actors. “That’s why USDT and Bitcoin make the most sense—they’re the assets traders already use every day, and they’re trust-minimized.” Data backs up Ardoino’s confidence. A US Treasury study last year found that the majority of crypto volume is routed through stablecoin pairs, and more than half of the $243 billion stablecoin float is USDT. On centralized exchanges, USDT remains the deepest quote currency, especially for emerging-market traders who lack access to US dollars. Tether’s edge, Ardoino argued, lies in a blend of liquidity and tooling: Wallet Development Kit (WDK):Launched in November 2024, the open-source WDK lets any developer embed non-custodial wallets in apps—or in AI agents—within minutes. Ubiquity Across Chains:USDT circulates on more than a dozen blockchains , providing instant bridges between high-throughput environments like Solana and security-focused networks like Bitcoin via Omni. Battle-Tested Liquidity Reserves:With a circulating supply above $155 billion, USDT offers order-book depth that few competitors can match. Regulatory Tailwinds—or Headwinds? Ardoino’s prediction lands as US lawmakers debate two headline stablecoin bills: the Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently told lawmakers that clear rules could propel stablecoin capitalization past $2 trillion by 2028. For Tether, regulatory clarity could cement USDT’s role as the de facto lubricant for M2M trade. But stricter reserve-disclosure demands—or outright caps on algorithmic issuance—could also tighten the operating window for all stablecoin issuers. Tether’s push into artificial intelligence began in earnest last year: April 2024 – Tether Data:A research arm focused on open-source AI models, emphasizing transparency and auditability—traits Ardoino says are “non-negotiable in finance-grade software.” May 2024 – Tether AI:Announced as a peer-to-peer network that will “enable an unstoppable mesh of AI agents,” Tether AI aims to provide inference marketplaces where bots can buy and sell compute and data using—naturally—USDT and Bitcoin. The company’s new headquarters in El Salvador gives it a regulatory sandbox and proximity to the geothermal power that now fuels some of its Bitcoin-mining experiments. Reaching Ardoino’s trillion-agent milestone will test the limits of today’s crypto stack: Throughput & FinalityEven the fastest L1s handle only a few thousand transactions per second. Tether’s answer is multi-chain USDT issuance paired with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network for rapid settlement. Key ManagementSelf-custody at machine scale demands robust, automated key-rotation schemes. Tether’s WDK supports hardware-based enclaves and threshold signatures to minimize single points of failure. On-Chain IdentityAI agents will need verifiable credentials to avoid Sybil attacks. Here, Ardoino notes, Soul-Bound Tokens and zero-knowledge proofs may play starring roles.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9716/tether-aims-to-dominate-bitcoin-mining-while-powering-ai-economy-with-usdt,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|USDT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T13:00:00,"$179,000 Or $79,000? Bitcoin Faces Critical Cycle Pivot, Says Analyst","A popular crypto analyst has issued a stark cyclical warning that could define Bitcoin’s trajectory for the rest of the summer. Dr. Cat, known for his integrated use of Ichimoku Cloud analysis, Elliott Wave Theory, and proprietary time-cycle forecasting, posted an intricate scenario on X suggesting Bitcoin now stands at a pivotal inflection point—one that may ultimately determine whether the next major move is to $179,000 or back down to $79,000. Bitcoin Faces Make-or-Break Moment “If we set a daily high between the 25th and 27th of June,” Dr. Cat began, referencing the window derived from his Time Theory model, “and it turns out to be a lower high per the Wave Theory, then a lower low should follow.” The implications, however, go far beyond near-term downside. “If a lower low comes, we invalidate the weekly cycle which implies no bottom before mid-July to mid-August.” According to the forecast timeline, the earliest potential bottom would fall between July 14 and August 17, with a primary target range from July 28 to August 3, incorporating a ±2 week deviation. That timing model dovetails with the chart’s behavior around critical Ichimoku levels. Dr. Cat emphasized that Bitcoin is currently “making a bearish retest of the weekly Tenkan Sen,” adding that yesterday’s attempt to reclaim that level failed: “Price touched Tenkan Sen yesterday but I saw that it would open below it today.” Related Reading: Trump’s Truth Social Officialy Files For Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs With NYSE The Tenkan Sen and Kijun Sen—two key lines in the Ichimoku system—are not just flat; they are structurally unconvincing despite a nominal 10% price advance. “This isn’t a real uptrend,” noted one user, to which Dr. Cat replied: “This is simply a neutral chart trying to flip bullish.” He elaborated that this neutrality means neither bullish nor bearish continuation is guaranteed, but warned that inaction or false optimism at this stage could expose traders to a cascading downside. One of the most significant technical levels lies just beneath current price. “The super key support of 93.2K (weekly Kijun Sen) is relatively close—and too close to hold if the time cycles play out,” Dr. Cat stated. A failure of that level would likely trigger a deeper reversion to the 3-week Kijun Sen, which remains unvisited and is currently positioned near $75K but rising. The entire bearish cascade remains “completely valid and with a very real chance of playing out,” unless Bitcoin manages to break above $110.6K after June 27. Such a move would invalidate both the time and wave-based lower-high structure and neutralize the scenario before it unfolds. But until then, Dr. Cat is urging traders to look beyond surface-level price movements. “Most people look at whether price goes up or down but don’t look at how it does it,” he said. Recalling his accurate bullish stance in April and May—when others were waiting for retracement—and his caution in early June, he emphasized the importance of reading the structure, not just the candles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Repeats Its 2021 Pattern—Analyst Warns Final Crash Still Ahead “The weekly chart was one candle away from a bullish TK cross, which would’ve implied big bullish continuation. But I waited. Then the market dumped,” he reminded followers. “Now it is relatively similar… dramatic reversals happen as close to invalidation as possible so everyone is tested and trapped to the limit.” In summary, Dr. Cat’s outlook remains balanced—but volatile. “I’m not telling you I can read the future,” he said. “I’m telling you that you need to distinguish neutral from bullish charts, which many people can’t—and suffer the consequences.” With time cycles converging and Ichimoku structures flashing indecision, Bitcoin now stands at a binary junction. The next high or low could lock in a multi-week trend, with targets as distant as $179K—or as painful as $79K—hanging in the balance. “This is simply a neutral chart trying to flip bullish. Which can certainly flip bullish pretty soon but until that happens I discuss whether first comes 179K or 79K with pretty much equal probability and I’m warning about an absolutely valid scenario which is on the table unless the chart flips bullish,” Dr. Cat concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $107,356.

2025-06-26T12:58:42,"Best Crypto to Buy Now—Bitcoin’s $110K Push Fueling Layer 2 Mayhem","Bitcoin’s sharp rebound to $107K, driven by ETF inflows and dovish Fed signals, is igniting a wave of layer 2 development. As institutional demand rises, infrastructure projects for Bitcoin are gaining unprecedented traction. Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme coin project to build on Bitcoin as a layer 2, combining Solana-like speed with Bitcoin’s security. It bridges $2T liquidity with the meme economy, positioning itself as a breakout contender. Bitcoin has taken the lead again, with a sharp surge from $98,225 two days ago to $107,200 at press time. It has regained the crucial $107,000 support level, with recent movements reflecting global news around Middle East tension and broader market sentiment . Image Courtesy: TradingView Demand in the crypto market was further boosted by a profit booking in oil prices and dovish speculations around the Fed interest rates. Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman is open to cutting rates at the July policy meeting. Additionally, the CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 20.7% chance of a 25-basis-point cut, up from 12.5% last week. The technical and fundamental catalysts are in place to push Bitcoin to a new all-time high above $110,000. This rally could fuel the next Bitcoin layer 2 Mayhem, accelerating institutional inflows into infrastructure projects. Built directly on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe has become an early leading contender in the layer 2 race. The project addresses Bitcoin’s major limitations, like speed and scalability, that have prevented it from capturing the explosive meme coin market. Bitcoin Pepe solves this with a layer 2 solution that brings lightning-fast speed to Bitcoin's rock-solid foundation. Bitcoin ETFs see the biggest monthly inflow, and the layer 2 mayhem begins The US spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded the largest monthly inflow for June, on the 24th, at $588.6 million, continuing the streak of 11 consecutive net positive days. According to Coinglass data , BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted significant investments of $436.3 million. Image Courtesy: Coinglass Vincent Liu, Kronos Research's chief investment officer , said, “Persistent inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs spotlight the strengthening story of BTC as digital gold. Investors are seeking stability through scarcity.” Growing enthusiasm and investor confidence in Bitcoin and digital assets show that the layer 2 rally is not far away. Projects focusing on solving infrastructure problems are already getting massive traction. The spotlight has shifted to projects focusing on smart solutions that fix Bitcoin’s weaknesses or build on what it already does well. These three projects clearly stand out as the best crypto to buy now before Bitcoin makes its next big move: Bitcoin Pepe: Layer 2 presale hits $15.6m before listing If there’s one project perfectly positioned to capitalize on the upcoming layer 2 madness, it is Bitcoin Pepe . It is the world’s first meme ICO on Bitcoin, building the technical infrastructure of Solana on Bitcoin. The PEP-20 token standard introduced by Bitcoin Pepe brings unlimited asset creation to BTC for the first time ever, while its proprietary layer 2 tech delivers Solana-like speed and scalability. Now, imagine the kind of massive market that could grow from a huge $2 trillion liquidity injection into meme coins. Bitcoin Pepe is building the bridge between Bitcoin's $2 trillion liquidity and the explosive meme market. Now, anyone can create projects on the Bitcoin network without sacrificing high security. With $15.6m raised at $0.0437, BPEP is positioned at the centre of Bitcoin’s institutional demand and the retail-driven meme sector. Smart money is already increasing their exposure after the confirmed BitMart listing and rumors that big CEX players could onboard on the June 30th announcement. Experts call it one of the easiest ways to ride the Bitcoin layer 2 wave set to shake the market this year. Polygon: Leading the layer 2 scaling on Ethereum While Bitcoin Pepe emerges as the best layer 2 project building on Bitcoin for the first time, Polygon is a leading layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The project is designed to make transactions faster and cheaper. It helps reduce network congestion by processing transactions off-chain while staying connected to Ethereum’s security. Its ecosystem supports DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more. Image Courtesy: CoinMarketCap However, since it reached an all-time high in 2024, Polygon has experienced immense selling pressure. Currently trading at $0.182, a surge of 8% in the last two days has reinforced investor confidence after weeks of correction. Analysts attribute this spike to a positive shift in the broader market sentiment. The coin's technical analysis positions it above its multiple crucial moving averages, proving positive momentum for sustained medium-term market growth. Traders who look at the $0.20 resistance level predict that the POL price can reach new highs, backed by its ability to maintain this psychological milestone. Arbitrum: Offering an optimistic rollup solution Arbitrum is a layer 2 scaling solution that uses optimistic rollups to process transactions faster and at lower cost. Unlike Polygon, which uses a sidechain and multiple scaling methods, Arbitrum stays more closely tied to Ethereum’s base layer.

It signaled that the protocol’s value was lagging behind the… pic.twitter.com/3WTTji7cK0 — CryptoJZ (@0xCryptoJZ) June 24, 2025 Why include Arbitrum in a list of the best crypto to buy now? Because Arbitrum is a strong layer 2 player and has excellent narrative alignment. If the premise that Ethereum scaling is key to mass adoption is true, Arbitrum could be one of this cycle's largest gainers. The network acts as the bridge to faster, cheaper Ethereum transactions, and the growing interest in DeFi and layer 2 solutions is another massive boom for the platform. The Layer 2 explosion starts now Investors are cheering Bitcoin’s rebound to $107,000, confirming that a major capital shift is now underway. Major layer 2 projects are about to become a playground for traders, application developers, and degens looking to build on-chain, and Bitcoin layer 2 is the biggest opportunity. Bitcoin Pepe , the first Bitcoin layer 2 solution, fits the mold perfectly. The project addresses infrastructure needs that have become highly valuable as the market expands. And this could be one of 2025’s breakout projects still available for just $0.0437 with another CEX listing announcement coming on June 30th.

2025-06-26T12:50:54,"Flowdesk Secures Pivotal $100 Million Digital Asset Credit Facility","BitcoinWorld Flowdesk Secures Pivotal $100 Million Digital Asset Credit Facility In a significant stride for the digital asset sector, Flowdesk, a prominent digital asset trading and technology firm, has successfully secured a substantial $100 million credit facility. This landmark Flowdesk funding announcement not only underscores growing institutional confidence in the crypto space but also positions Flowdesk for an ambitious phase of global expansion and technological advancement. For anyone closely watching the evolution of finance, this move signals a powerful shift towards more sophisticated and capital-efficient operations within the digital asset ecosystem. What Does This Flowdesk Funding Breakthrough Mean? The news, initially reported via a press release on Business Wire, highlights Flowdesk’s strategic partnership with Two Prime Lending Limited, a notable player in the digital asset lending arena. This substantial credit facility is earmarked to fuel Flowdesk’s global ambitions, enabling them to expand their reach and further develop their cutting-edge, capital-efficient trading infrastructure. This isn’t just about more money; it’s about smart money – empowering Flowdesk to optimize its operations and serve a broader client base. The facility itself is structured as a multiple drawdown term loan, offering Flowdesk the flexibility to access funds as needed, rather than in a single lump sum. This adaptable structure is crucial for a dynamic firm operating in a fast-evolving market like digital assets. Furthermore, the loan carries an initial 365-day term, with an option for extension, subject to lender approval, providing both short-term liquidity and potential long-term stability. The Power of Digital Asset Credit in Today’s Market The ability to secure a significant digital asset credit facility is a testament to Flowdesk’s robust business model and the increasing maturity of the crypto lending market. Unlike traditional loans, digital asset credit often leverages the unique properties of cryptocurrencies, offering new avenues for capital generation and liquidity management. For a firm like Flowdesk, which operates at the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets, such a facility is indispensable for maintaining high levels of liquidity and operational efficiency. Key Benefits of Digital Asset Credit Facilities: Enhanced Liquidity: Provides ready access to capital without liquidating existing digital asset holdings, which can be crucial in volatile markets. Capital Efficiency: Allows firms to leverage their digital assets as collateral, freeing up other capital for investment and operational needs. Operational Flexibility: Structured facilities like term loans with drawdown options offer adaptability to fluctuating market conditions and business demands. Strategic Growth: Enables significant investments in technology, infrastructure, and global expansion, fostering long-term development. This type of credit facility underscores a growing trend where digital assets are no longer just speculative investments but are increasingly recognized as viable collateral and foundational elements for sophisticated financial products. Leveraging Bitcoin: Understanding the Bitcoin-Backed Loan A significant aspect of this credit facility is its collateral: a portion of Flowdesk’s Bitcoin holdings. The decision to back the loan with Bitcoin speaks volumes about the evolving perception of BTC as a legitimate and valuable asset, even in institutional lending contexts. A Bitcoin-backed loan allows firms to unlock liquidity from their crypto assets without selling them, thus avoiding potential tax events or missing out on future price appreciation. While using Bitcoin as collateral comes with its own set of considerations, primarily related to its price volatility, the structuring of such a loan typically involves sophisticated risk management strategies. This can include over-collateralization requirements, dynamic margin calls, and robust monitoring systems to protect both the borrower and the lender from market fluctuations. The fact that Two Prime Lending Limited is comfortable providing a $100 million facility backed by Bitcoin highlights their expertise in managing digital asset risks and their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition.

From making over $6.8 million in one day to losing nearly $10 million within just 3 days, Qwatio’s journey is nothing short of a thriller. $6.8M Profit Turned Into Liquidation According to Lookonchain, it all started when Qwatio made headlines by earning over $6.8 million in a single day. He went all-in on Bitcoin and Ethereum using 50x leverage, right before Trump signed an executive order that shook the crypto market. Right after securing his profits, Qwatio pulled out his margin and allowed 160,000 ETH ($306M) to be liquidated. This caused huge losses for Hyperliquid’s Liquidity Provider (HLP). 3/ He took advantage of Hyperliquid's mechanics to open massive positions with 50x leverage.

Someone used a similar strategy to manipulate the JELLY token, causing another $12 million in losses for HLP. Qwatio himself became a target. A team of whales, led by user “CBB,” started hunting his trades. At one point, Bitcoin spiked 2.5%, but Qwatio defended his trade by quickly adding more margin.

The vehicle, M3-Brigade Acquisition V, plans to rebrand and use the cash to buy a basket of tokens including bitcoin BTC, ether ETH and Solana's sol SOL.

2025-06-26T12:42:23,"Bitcoin Miner Revenues Hit Two-Month Low, Selling Activity Remains Muted: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin miner revenues have fallen to their lowest levels in two months, according to analysts at on-chain and market data CryptoQuant . On June 22, daily earnings dropped to $34 million, a level not seen since April 20, 2025. The downturn is mainly being attributed to reduced transaction fees and a decline in the market price of Bitcoin. The combination of these factors is leading to an environment where miners are experiencing some of the lowest compensation rates recorded in the past year. As reported in CryptoQuant’s weekly analysis, miners are currently “the most underpaid they have been in the last year.” Bitcoin miners just saw their worst payday in a year. Daily revenue slipped to $34 million in June, the lowest since April. Falling fees and Bitcoin’s price drop are crushing margins. pic.twitter.com/TXdN06CU1F — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 26, 2025 Hashrate Falls, But Miner Selling Stays Low Despite the drop in revenue, miners have not responded with increased selling. CryptoQuant reports that Bitcoin outflows from miner wallets have steadily decreased, falling from a peak of 23,000 BTC per day in February to around 6,000 BTC today. This represents a significant reduction in selling activity, especially given the recent price volatility. Notably, the network’s hashrate has experienced a 3.5% drawdown since June 16, marking the largest decline in nearly a year. However, this drop in computational power has not translated into heightened liquidations by miners. In addition, so-called “Satoshi-era” miners have sold only 150 BTC so far in 2025, compared to nearly 10,000 BTC in 2024. Miner Reserves Grow Despite Lower Income CryptoQuant analysts also note that instead of selling, miners are increasing their reserves. Addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have grown their combined holdings from 61,000 BTC on March 31 to 65,000 BTC as of late June. This is the highest level of reserve accumulation by this group of miners since November 2024. The steady accumulation trend suggests that most miners are not facing immediate financial stress, even amid falling revenues. Their continued reserve growth indicates a long-term outlook and confidence in future price recovery, rather than capitulation under current market conditions. Overall, while Bitcoin miner revenues have declined to a two-month low, there is no evidence of widespread selling pressure in response. CryptoQuant’s findings portray a mining sector that, though underpaid by recent standards, remains resilient and strategically focused on long-term accumulation.

2025-06-26T12:40:33,"ARK Invest’s Strategic Shift: Why Cathie Wood Divested Millions in Robinhood Shares","BitcoinWorld ARK Invest’s Strategic Shift: Why Cathie Wood Divested Millions in Robinhood Shares In the dynamic world of finance, where every institutional move sends ripples across markets, a recent decision by ARK Invest has captured significant attention. Led by the visionary Cathie Wood, ARK Investment Management has once again made headlines, this time with a notable divestment from one of the most talked-about retail trading platforms: Robinhood. This move isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a strategic indicator that prompts a deeper look into the evolving landscape of digital trading and institutional investment strategies. The Sale Unpacked: What Exactly Happened with Robinhood Shares? On June 25, 2024, ARK Investment Management, under the leadership of Cathie Wood , executed a significant sale. The firm offloaded 55,949 shares of Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), the popular U.S. trading platform known for both stocks and cryptocurrencies. This transaction amounted to approximately $4.63 million, as reported by Ark Invest Daily on X. While a single sale might seem minor in the grand scheme of a multi-billion dollar fund, it’s the context and the potential implications that make this particular move by ARK Invest noteworthy. Institutional investors like ARK often signal broader trends or shifts in their outlook through such actions. To put this into perspective, let’s consider the nature of Robinhood itself: Dual Platform: Robinhood offers trading for both traditional stocks and a growing number of cryptocurrencies, appealing to a wide demographic of retail investors. Retail Focus: Its user-friendly interface and commission-free trading model have made it a favorite among new and younger investors. Market Volatility: The platform has been at the epicenter of several retail trading phenomena, including meme stock surges and crypto booms, often experiencing significant volatility. Why the Divestment? Decoding Cathie Wood’s Investment Strategy When a prominent fund like ARK Invest makes a move, especially one involving a divestment, analysts and investors alike scramble to understand the underlying reasons. Cathie Wood’s investment strategy is famously centered around disruptive innovation, long-term growth, and identifying companies poised to revolutionize their industries. So, why would ARK choose to sell a significant chunk of its Robinhood shares? Several factors could be at play: Portfolio Rebalancing: ARK Invest actively manages its portfolios, often rebalancing to maintain desired asset allocations or to trim positions that have seen significant gains, allowing capital to be redeployed into other high-conviction ideas. Profit Taking: If Robinhood shares had appreciated significantly since ARK’s initial investment, the sale could simply be a strategic move to lock in profits, especially in a volatile market environment. Changing Outlook on Robinhood’s Growth Trajectory: While Robinhood has been a pioneer, the competitive landscape for brokerage firms and crypto trading platform s is intensifying. ARK might be reassessing Robinhood’s long-term growth potential against emerging competitors or regulatory headwinds. Regulatory Concerns: Robinhood has faced scrutiny from regulators regarding its business practices, payment for order flow, and crypto offerings. Potential future regulations could impact its profitability and operational model. Shifting Focus to Other Disruptors: ARK’s philosophy is to invest in companies at the forefront of innovation. Perhaps new opportunities in other sectors or technologies are presenting more compelling growth prospects, prompting a reallocation of capital. It’s important to remember that ARK’s decisions are often driven by a long-term outlook, not short-term market fluctuations. This divestment might reflect a refined view on where the most significant disruptive potential lies in the coming years. Impact on Robinhood: A Glimpse into HOOD’s Future An institutional sale, particularly from a high-profile investor like ARK Invest, can certainly influence market sentiment towards Robinhood shares . While the $4.63 million sale is a fraction of Robinhood’s market capitalization, the ‘Cathie Wood effect’ can sometimes amplify the perception of such moves. What could this mean for Robinhood? Investor Confidence: A sale by a prominent institutional investor might lead some retail and institutional investors to re-evaluate their own positions in HOOD, potentially leading to increased selling pressure in the short term. Strategic Review: For Robinhood itself, such a move from a respected fund might prompt an internal review of its strategic direction, especially concerning its growth avenues and risk management. Focus on Diversification: Robinhood has been actively working to diversify its revenue streams beyond just trading, including expanding into IRAs, credit cards, and other financial services. This sale could underscore the urgency for Robinhood to prove its long-term viability and expand its offerings. Despite the sale, Robinhood remains a significant player in the retail trading space. Its ability to attract new users and its foray into diverse financial products will be key to its future performance. Robinhood’s Role as a Crypto Trading Platform: Challenges and Opportunities A significant part of Robinhood’s appeal, especially to younger investors, has been its role as an accessible crypto trading platform . It offers a simplified gateway to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, making digital assets more approachable for the mainstream. However, this segment of its business also comes with unique challenges. Key aspects of Robinhood’s crypto operations: Aspect Description Implication Ease of Access Simple interface, low minimums, commission-free trading. Attracts new crypto investors, but may lack advanced features for seasoned traders. Limited Coin Selection Offers a curated list of popular cryptocurrencies. Reduces complexity for beginners, but limits choice for those seeking altcoins. Regulatory Scrutiny Operating in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment for digital assets. Potential for new rules to impact business model, compliance costs. Security & Custody Robinhood holds user crypto, simplifying custody but raising questions for self-custody advocates. Convenient for users, but contrasts with the decentralized ethos of crypto for some. The future success of Robinhood as a crypto platform hinges on its ability to navigate regulatory hurdles, expand its offerings responsibly, and maintain user trust in an increasingly competitive market. Institutional moves like ARK’s sale might also reflect a broader institutional caution towards the volatile and regulatory-uncertain crypto market. Broader Market Implications: What Does This Mean for Retail Investors and Investment Strategy? The sale of Robinhood shares by ARK Invest isn’t an isolated event; it’s a piece of a larger puzzle that reflects current market dynamics and evolving investment strategy among institutional players. For retail investors, such actions offer valuable insights into how large funds are positioning themselves amidst economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and technological shifts. Here are some broader takeaways: Adaptability is Key: ARK’s willingness to adjust its portfolio, even exiting positions in companies it once championed, highlights the importance of adaptability in investment. Markets are constantly changing, and what was a strong conviction yesterday might not be today. Focus on Fundamentals: Beyond the hype, institutional investors ultimately look at a company’s underlying fundamentals, its competitive advantages, and its ability to execute its long-term vision. This sale could suggest a re-evaluation of Robinhood’s fundamental strengths in a maturing market. Diversification Remains Crucial: For retail investors, observing institutional moves reinforces the timeless principle of diversification. Relying too heavily on a single stock or sector, even one favored by a prominent investor, can expose one to undue risk. Monitor Institutional Flow, But Do Your Own Research: While it’s insightful to track what funds like ARK Invest are doing, their investment horizons and risk appetites are often different from individual investors. Always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Volatile Market What can you, as an investor, take away from ARK Invest’s decision to sell Robinhood shares? Review Your Portfolio: Use this as an opportunity to assess your own holdings. Are your investments aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance? Stay Informed on Regulatory Changes: Especially if you’re invested in crypto or fintech platforms, keep an eye on evolving regulations that could impact their business models. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just react to headlines. Try to understand the potential reasons behind institutional moves. Is it profit-taking, a change in fundamental outlook, or a strategic reallocation? Consider Long-Term Trends: Cathie Wood’s focus is on disruptive innovation. While ARK may be adjusting its short-to-medium term positions, the underlying trends of digital finance and decentralized technologies continue to evolve. This move by ARK Invest serves as a reminder that even the most innovative companies are subject to rigorous evaluation by large funds, and their positions can shift as market conditions and competitive landscapes evolve. It’s a testament to the dynamic nature of investing, where continuous assessment and strategic adaptation are paramount.

2025-06-26T12:40:24,"Bitcoin soars towards $110K amid Trump’s potential FED shakeup","Bitcoin (BTC) is slowly rising closer to its all-time high as a mix of political, institutional, and regulatory catalysts converge, giving bulls the momentum they’ve been waiting for. Since hitting a low of $98,974 on June 22, BTC has gained 2.2% to trade at $107,271 at press time according to CoinGecko . At the centre of this rally is former US President Donald Trump’s fresh comments signalling a possible leadership shakeup at the US Federal Reserve (Fed), which has rattled expectations for future monetary policy. Trump’s remarks have stirred market expectations On Wednesday, June 25, Trump publicly suggested that he might replace current Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell if re-elected, sparking immediate reactions across financial markets. Trump’s remarks have added fuel to Bitcoin’s ongoing price momentum, which is also being driven by surging ETF inflows, strong corporate demand, and a broader shift in institutional sentiment. Investors view central bank leadership changes as pivotal, especially when the potential appointee could steer monetary policy in a vastly different direction. Since monetary policy directly affects interest rates, liquidity, and the strength of the US dollar, any uncertainty surrounding it often spills over into risk assets, including Bitcoin. Trump’s posture toward the Federal Reserve, combined with his broader pro-crypto messaging, appears to be reigniting risk-on appetite in digital asset markets. Bitcoin, in particular, thrives during periods of monetary uncertainty, as traders rotate out of fiat-based assets and into decentralised alternatives. Adding to the positive developments, the US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has announced a major policy shift involving crypto. In a landmark move, the FHFA has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare to recognise cryptocurrency as an asset in mortgage applications. Such a move not only signals increased mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin but also suggests that crypto may soon be considered a legitimate form of wealth in the eyes of federal agencies. This policy shift aligns with Trump’s broader crypto-friendly narrative and could potentially unlock more utility for Bitcoin beyond speculative investing. Bitcoin ETF inflows and institutional buying intensify While political headlines are drawing attention, the data behind Bitcoin’s surge tells an equally compelling story. Spot Bitcoin ETFs listed in the United States recorded over $547 million in inflows on Wednesday alone, extending a remarkable 12-day streak of institutional accumulation. Since June 9, net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $1.49 billion, indicating that large investors are steadily increasing their exposure. At the same time, corporate entities are doubling down, with firms like Japan’s Metaplanet and ProCap adding thousands of BTC to their reserves in recent days. Together, this rising tide of demand is creating a favourable supply squeeze scenario, which may explain why Bitcoin is climbing rapidly as it inches toward $110K. Upcoming Bitcoin options expiry fuels price momentum Another crucial factor behind Bitcoin’s rally is the looming June 27 options expiry, which will see contracts worth nearly $15 billion settle on the Deribit exchange. With over 139,000 BTC options set to expire and a put/call ratio of 0.74, the market leans bullish, especially with the max pain point well below current prices. Traders are now betting that the momentum could push Bitcoin past its May high of $111,970, potentially clearing the way for a new record before the weekend. Analysts warn, however, that high options open interest also introduces volatility, particularly if profit-taking or unexpected news disrupts market sentiment. Analysts predict a larger move ahead With all these factors aligning, some analysts believe the current rally is only the beginning. Market analyst Cas Abbè forecasts a 50–80% Bitcoin rally by October, citing similarities to Bitcoin’s breakout in 2020 that preceded a parabolic surge. His prediction is backed by a bullish MACD crossover, fractal patterns, and a confirmed breakout above the neckline of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the weekly chart. If this projection plays out, Bitcoin could rise to a range between $150,000 and $180,000 within the next few months. While the market still faces geopolitical risks and short-term volatility, traders are increasingly aligning with the bullish narrative now gaining strength on multiple fronts. As the dust settles from Trump’s remarks and ETF demand keeps climbing, Bitcoin appears to be on a well-supported path toward reclaiming and possibly surpassing its previous all-time high.

2025-06-26T12:39:10,"MSTR stock vs. MSTY stock: Which offers better returns in a Bitcoin bull run?","The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF has grown into a $4.8 billion fund, driven by its 136% dividend yield and its connection to Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. MSTY’s inflows have increased each month this year, with the net amount reaching $3.9 billion. This trajectory may continue if Bitcoin ( BTC ) breaks out and hits a new all-time high, as Polymarket traders expect. Demand is also rising because Strategy’s core stock does not pay a dividend. Instead, MSTY generates its monthly distributions through a covered call strategy. MSTY ETF inflows | Source: ETF In a covered call approach, the fund invests a portion of its capital in Strategy stock and benefits as the stock rises. It then sells call options on the stock, generating premium income, which it distributes to investors. A call option is a contract that gives the investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specific price within a certain time period. If MSTR stock drops below the strike price, the option becomes worthless since the stock can be bought directly on the market. If the stock rises above the strike price, the call option is exercised. In this case, the fund retains the premium but sacrifices additional upside if the rally continues. If the stock remains flat, the ETF still generates a return through the monthly premium. These scenarios explain why MSTY and other covered call ETFs offer high dividend yields. MSTY has a lower total return than MSTR The 136% dividend yield is highly enticing to many income investors. For instance, a $10,000 investment would yield a gross annual dividend payment of $13,600 if the yield remains constant. However, a closer look reveals that MSTY’s total return has lagged behind MSTR’s. Data shows that MSTY has declined by 18% year to date, while MSTR stock is up 34%. The best measure of an ETF’s performance is the total return, which includes dividends. In this case, MSTR stock has risen 34.20% this year, while MSTY has gained 29%. As shown below, MSTY’s total return over the past 12 months was 107%, compared to MSTR’s 160%. MSTY vs MSTR | Source: SeekingAlpha A similar trend appears across most covered call ETFs. For example, Coinbase stock has advanced 60% in the past 12 months, while the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF (CONY) has risen 24%. Similarly, the $40 billion JEPI ETF consistently lags behind the S&P 500 Index.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/mstr-stock-vs-msty-stock-which-offers-better-returns-in-a-bitcoin-bull-run/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|stocks|Strategy",cryptocompare

This decision came shortly after the company successfully completed a $121 million private offering , making headlines in both the crypto and business worlds. Why XRP? The CEO Explains In a recent interview with Tony Edwards, VivoPower’s CEO Kevin Chin opened up about why the company chose XRP over more popular options like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. Chin shared that his belief in XRP isn’t new. He’s been following and investing in digital assets for years. But what really stood out, according to him, is XRP’s potential in the DeFi ( Decentralized Finance ) space. “I have genuine conviction in XRP and what it can do for markets,” Chin explained. He also said that while Bitcoin treasuries have become common, with over 100 companies holding BTC in their reserves, the market for XRP is still relatively untapped. “We saw a gap in the market,” he added, hinting that VivoPower wanted to be the first mover in this space. “I think there’s more than 100 Bitcoin treasury companies as well. We felt that it was quite crowded already. And there are people doing it very well in the markets already. Similarly, with Solana and ETH, there were already other players,” he said. [post_titles_links postid=”475221″] XRP’s Loyal Following Played a Role Another reason behind the move was XRP’s strong and passionate global community, famously known as the ‘XRP Army.’ Chin admitted that the company has been part of this community and recognizes the influence and dedication of XRP holders worldwide.

In the past few months, @qwatio used four known addresses. Three of the previous ones are inactive, with no new positions. The whale, known as William Parker, or @qwatio, opened two new short positions on BTC and ETH. | Source: Hyperliquid The latest known address is $436K underwater, based on its short positions for BTC and ETH. This time around, the positions had a notional value above $210M, with no clear signs of deliberate counter-trading. The unrealized profit and loss may change, though the trader has shown readiness to keep the positions. On-chain data shows he posted $4.5M USDC collateral to extend his short positions and avoid liquidation. The whale is now considered to be in gambling mode, after six liquidations in the past three days. Hyperliquid becomes top crypto summer venue The stories of high-profile whales added to Hyperliquid’s fame as the go-to chain for derivative trading.

Hyperliquid remains a leader in 24-hour fees, surpassing Ethereum, Solana and other top apps and networks. Based on Artemis data, Hyperliquid generated $2.1M in fees. The perpetual futures DEX also carries $6.8B in 24-hour volumes, with over 500K daily active users. The market shows a mix of organic traffic and activity that aims to tap an eventual second airdrop of HYPE tokens, based on user activity. Since its launch, Hyperliquid has allowed whales to withdraw over $81B, with over $46B in liquidated positions. As of June 2025, Hyperliquid still carried over 60% of decentralized perpetual swaps traffic. The success of the platform inspired other attempts to copy its success. The perps DEX uses more than 64% of all USDC on Arbitrum for its liquidity purposes. The DEX drew in a total of $3.56B USDC, with around $2.91B remaining as available liquidity. HYPE took a step back in June, after peaking above $45. HYPE retains open interest above $1.5B, of which $1.1B is on the Hyperliquid exchange. Currently, short positions make up about 38% of the open interest, on expectations of further correction from peak prices. The native token currently trades around $37 and is closely watched for a rebound, based on recent whale activity. HYPE rallied after the inclusion of high-profile trades, which some consider deliberate attempts to draw attention to Hyperliquid.

2025-06-26T12:15:00,"With June Almost Over, Here Are the Altcoins to Watch Closely in July","June historically marks reliable altcoin bottoms, often followed by strong July rallies. MVRV Z-score remains low, signaling altcoins have room to grow before peak levels. Trump-linked tokens like LINK, ONDO, and AAVE attract attention ahead of policy shifts. With June coming to a close, a historical pattern that has reliably marked the bottom for the altcoin market seems to be playing out again. According to Discover Crypto , an analytic firm analysis, the market has stabilized right on schedule, and now investor attention is shifting toward a potential “summer rally” and the specific altcoins that could lead the way in July. Did June Signal the Market Bottom Again? For the past five years, June has consistently been a key turning point for altcoins. Analysts believe this pattern is not a coincidence but a seasonal trend driven by institutional traders who often sell holdings before the summer, creating better entry points for other investors.

2025-06-26T12:10:46,"Altcoin Season Index Reveals Crucial Shift: Navigating Bitcoin’s Dominance in the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Reveals Crucial Shift: Navigating Bitcoin’s Dominance in the Crypto Market Are you feeling the shift in the cryptocurrency winds? The latest reading from the Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric tracked by CoinMarketCap, indicates a strong move into what’s known as Bitcoin Season . At a modest 18 as of June 26, this index score is a clear signal for investors to re-evaluate their strategies in the dynamic crypto market . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a proprietary metric developed by CoinMarketCap (CMC) to provide a snapshot of the broader cryptocurrency market’s health and sentiment. It serves as a compass, guiding investors through the often-turbulent waters of digital assets. Unlike simple market capitalization comparisons, this index delves deeper, analyzing the relative strength of altcoins against Bitcoin. The methodology behind the Altcoin Season Index is straightforward yet insightful. It meticulously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The core principle is simple: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during the specified 90-day period. This signifies a broad rally across the altcoin spectrum, often driven by speculative interest, technological advancements, or a general ‘risk-on’ sentiment in the crypto market . Bitcoin Season: Conversely, if 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is deemed to be in Bitcoin Season . This suggests that capital is primarily flowing into Bitcoin, or that altcoins are struggling to maintain their value relative to the leading cryptocurrency. The current index reading of 18 clearly places us in this latter category. The index score itself ranges from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a stronger lean towards altcoin dominance and lower numbers signaling Bitcoin’s ascendancy. A score of 18, as reported, is a definitive indicator of Bitcoin’s current reign. Decoding Bitcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominates the Crypto Market The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 18 isn’t just a number; it’s a declaration that we are firmly entrenched in Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for the everyday crypto enthusiast or investor, and why does Bitcoin often take the lead in the broader crypto market ? Bitcoin Season signifies a period where Bitcoin (BTC) not only outperforms most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) but also often dictates the overall market sentiment. During such times, capital tends to flow primarily into BTC, either from fiat currencies or from altcoins, as investors seek relative safety or anticipate Bitcoin-specific rallies. Several factors contribute to the onset and persistence of Bitcoin Season : Flight to Safety: In times of market uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or broader economic downturns, investors often view Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ or a safer haven compared to the more volatile and less established altcoins. Its larger market cap and longer track record make it a more trusted asset. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock events, known as halvings, historically precede significant bull runs. The anticipation leading up to and immediately following a halving often draws immense attention and capital into BTC, temporarily overshadowing altcoin performance. Institutional Interest: With the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors, large capital inflows from these entities tend to concentrate on BTC due to its liquidity and regulatory clarity compared to the vast array of altcoins. Dominance Cycle: The cryptocurrency market often moves in cycles. Periods of Bitcoin accumulation and price appreciation are frequently followed by an ‘altcoin catch-up’ phase. The current Bitcoin Season could be seen as part of this natural market ebb and flow. Market Consolidation: After periods of rapid altcoin growth, the market may consolidate, with capital rotating back into Bitcoin as profits are taken or as investors seek more stable ground before the next speculative wave. Impact on Altcoin Performance: What Investors Need to Know For those holding a diverse portfolio of digital assets, the shift to Bitcoin Season directly impacts altcoin performance . When Bitcoin takes center stage, altcoins typically struggle to keep pace, often seeing their value decrease relative to BTC, even if their fiat value remains somewhat stable or sees minor gains. Key observations regarding altcoin performance during Bitcoin Season include: Underperformance Against BTC: Even if an altcoin sees a modest price increase in USD terms, it’s likely losing value when measured against Bitcoin. This means your portfolio’s Bitcoin weighting naturally increases if you hold both, simply because BTC is outperforming. Reduced Liquidity: Capital tends to consolidate in Bitcoin, leading to thinner trading volumes for many altcoins. This can result in larger price swings on smaller trades and makes it harder to enter or exit positions without significant price impact. Narrative Shift: The market narrative during Bitcoin Season often revolves around Bitcoin’s price movements, adoption, and upcoming events. Altcoin-specific news or developments may get less attention, hindering their individual price action. Psychological Impact: Seeing your altcoin holdings lag behind Bitcoin can be frustrating. It tests investor conviction and often leads to premature selling or ‘altcoin fatigue’. While some strong fundamental altcoins might still show resilience or even modest gains, the broad trend for altcoin performance during this period is one of relative weakness against Bitcoin. Navigating Current Cryptocurrency Trends: Strategies for Success Understanding the prevailing cryptocurrency trends , especially the current Bitcoin Season , is paramount for informed decision-making. Rather than panic, investors can adopt strategic approaches to navigate these market conditions effectively. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Assess your current exposure to Bitcoin versus altcoins. During Bitcoin Season , it might be prudent to increase your BTC weighting, or at least ensure your altcoin positions are in projects with strong fundamentals that you believe will survive and thrive long-term. Focus on Research: This period offers an excellent opportunity to deep-dive into projects. Identify altcoins that have genuine utility, strong development teams, active communities, and clear roadmaps. These are the ones most likely to recover and outperform when altcoin season eventually returns. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider implementing a DCA strategy. Regularly investing a fixed amount into Bitcoin or select altcoins can average out your purchase price over time, reducing the risk of buying at peaks. Risk Management is Key: Set clear stop-loss orders or establish profit-taking targets, especially for more speculative altcoin holdings. Volatility can be extreme, and protecting your capital should be a priority. Patience and Long-Term Vision: Market cycles are a natural part of the crypto landscape. A Bitcoin Season is often followed by an Altcoin Season . Those with a long-term perspective and the patience to hold through quieter periods are often the ones who reap the greatest rewards. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A rising dominance suggests capital is flowing into BTC, while a declining dominance could signal the beginning of a shift back towards altcoins. Challenges and Opportunities in a Bitcoin-Led Market While the current cryptocurrency trends lean heavily towards Bitcoin dominance, this period presents both distinct challenges and unique opportunities for savvy investors. Challenges: Underperforming Altcoins: The primary challenge is the potential for significant underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, leading to ‘opportunity cost’ if your capital is tied up in lagging assets. Increased Volatility: While Bitcoin might be seen as ‘safer,’ the overall crypto market remains highly volatile. Altcoins can experience sharper drops during downturns. Psychological Strain: Watching your portfolio stagnate or decline while Bitcoin soars can be emotionally taxing, leading to impulsive decisions. Opportunities: Accumulation Phase: For long-term investors, Bitcoin Season can be an excellent time to accumulate high-conviction altcoins at discounted prices against Bitcoin. This allows for a stronger position when the tide eventually turns. Learning and Research: With less frenetic price action in altcoins, this period provides an ideal environment to educate yourself, research new projects, and refine your investment thesis without the pressure of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Focus on Fundamentals: The ‘noise’ of speculative altcoin pumps often quiets down, allowing fundamental analysis to come to the forefront. Projects with real utility and strong development continue to build, regardless of the immediate market sentiment. Bitcoin Exposure: If you believe in the cyclical nature of the market, increasing your Bitcoin exposure during Bitcoin Season can position you well for potential future gains as BTC solidifies its position or makes new all-time highs. When Will the Altcoin Season Index Signal a Change? The burning question for many is: when will the Altcoin Season Index signal a return to more favorable conditions for altcoin performance ? While no one can predict the future with certainty, historical patterns and prevailing cryptocurrency trends offer some clues. A shift back towards Altcoin Season typically requires one or a combination of the following catalysts: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Often, after a significant Bitcoin rally, BTC enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows capital to rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Major Altcoin-Specific Developments: Significant upgrades (like Ethereum’s upcoming advancements), successful mainnet launches, or major adoption news for prominent altcoins can trigger individual or sector-wide rallies, pulling the index higher. Broader Market Bull Run: A general ‘risk-on’ sentiment across global financial markets, coupled with increasing institutional and retail interest in crypto, can lift all boats, including altcoins. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: Monitoring the Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) is crucial. A sustained downtrend in BTC.D, particularly when Bitcoin’s price is stable or rising modestly, often precedes or accompanies an Altcoin Season. The Altcoin Season Index serves as a lagging indicator to some extent, confirming trends rather than predicting them. Therefore, continuous monitoring of market sentiment, technological developments, and macro-economic factors is essential to anticipate when the scales might tip back in favor of altcoins. The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 18 is a clear testament to the ongoing Bitcoin Season . This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a crucial piece of information for navigating the complex crypto market . Understanding these cyclical shifts, from Bitcoin Season to eventual Altcoin Season , empowers investors to make more informed decisions regarding their altcoin performance and overall portfolio strategy. By focusing on strong fundamentals, practicing diligent risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can transform periods of Bitcoin dominance into opportunities for strategic accumulation and growth.

Bitcoin is down 2% in the month, and Ethereum is down nearly 3%, while the overall market momentum remains weak. But this period could be setting the stage for a powerful reversal, especially in AI-focused altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is approaching historical peak levels, which is often a sign of an upcoming shift in favor of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index has also hit its lowest in two years, indicating that altcoins may be due for a breakout. If the market starts to turn around, small AI-focused altcoins could rally hard, similar to the surge seen in April during the tariff-related uncertainty. Here are some promising AI tokens to watch for the next altcoin season. GRIFFAIN An AI Agent on Solana, Griffain rose from a $30 million to $130 million market cap in May, delivering a 6x return in a short period. Although it has cooled off since then, if the AI hype returns, it could be a strong contender again. It is currently trading at $0.03956, down 7.2% in the past day. June looks bearish for the token, and it could trade between $ 0.028372 and $ 0.040441. In July, the outlook improves, and prices may rise to an average of $0.0318. TARS AI This is another Solana-based AI agent marketplace that surged from $0.025 to $0.14 in April, which is a 6–7x increase. TARS offers a unified platform where users and businesses can access AI tools and services, helping them smoothly move from Web2 to the Web3 world. With a market cap of over $50 million, the token may see renewed interest if broader sentiment improves. It is currently trading at $0.08612, down over 3% in the past day. RAI (Reploy) This token climbed from $0.24 to $1.50 in May, but its recent inactivity on social platforms has raised concerns. Investors should approach with caution and monitor for project updates. It is currently priced at $0.6183, down 4.6% in the past day. AIOZ Network This token doubled from around $0.22 to $0.50 in May. It is not as volatile as others , but is still showing potential. It is currently trading at $0.3171, down 1.5% in the past day. Its 24-hour trading volume is $10,513,924, representing a 6.40% increase. Render (RNDR) Render is a most established AI coin with a large market cap of around $1.7B. It went from $3.30 to $5 in May, and recently bounced again from $2.60 to $3.25. This is one of the go-to options for retail investors interested in AI and GPUs. It is currently trading at $3.08, down 4.8%. In June 2025, Render is expected to trade around $3.94, with a potential range between $3.07 and $4.35. The outlook remains positive for July, and it could range from $3.81 to $4.13. Creator Bid Since April, the token rose from $0.035 to $0.12. Although it is less volatile than others, it continues to show upward movement. It is currently trading at $0.1195, up 6%. In July, Creator Bid could see its prices ranging between $0.0788 and $0.0864, and an average of around $0.0834. Virtuals Protocol Virtuals is also an AI agent ecosystem that jumped from $0.45 to $2.50 between April and May. The team remains active with ongoing developments and product launches. It is currently trading at $1.45, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours. June may be rough for Virtual Protocol, with prices expected to dip to around $1.21. However, July brings a more optimistic outlook . Many of these coins are still trading close to their recent lows and well below their previous highs, which could present early opportunities. Even though the market is uncertain, the AI trend could regain strong momentum.

2025-06-26T12:02:04,"Bitcoin Price Prediction – If Bitcoin Breaks This Level, Expect a Fast Move to New All-Time Highs","This week, Bitcoin (BTC/USD) surged to $108,182, briefly breaching a key resistance level that now holds the potential to trigger a new wave of bullish momentum. At the moment, BTC is trading around $107,300, the cryptocurrency is up nearly 10% in just three days, driven by a combination of short liquidation, technical breakouts, and easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Traders widely anticipated the move past $108K. The level represented a significant liquidity zone, and its breach forced aggressive short positions to unwind. BTC 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass Data from CoinGlass confirms that this rally absorbed much of the high-leverage short interest built around recent price consolidation, effectively clearing the path for a potential breakout toward higher resistance levels. Popular analysts, such as Matthew Hyland , describe the current environment as “bulls in control,” while others, like the Titan of Crypto, highlight a recent breakout above the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling further upside potential. #BTC past $106.5k $109k next Bulls are in control https://t.co/mp3zBsQwX9 pic.twitter.com/Ibsaupn3YE — Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) June 25, 2025 Technical models now indicate $110,448 and $111,944 as potential upside targets, provided BTC can maintain its traction above $108,251. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Setup Signals Possible Acceleration From a charting perspective, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bullish after BTC recently formed a three-bar bullish pattern, similar to a modified “three white soldiers” setup, indicating strong buyer commitment. However, price action is stalling just below a long-standing descending trendline, suggesting that $108,251 remains a critical inflection point. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Support levels: $106,237 (Fib 0.236), $105,081 (50-EMA), and $103,984 (Fib 0.5) Resistance targets: $110,448 and $111,944 MACD status: Bullish crossover, but histogram momentum flattening Candlestick signal: Spinning top forming under trendline, indicating potential hesitation If BTC closes above $108,251 with high volume, we could see a quick move to $111K. If not, we could see a short-term pullback to $105,000-$103,900. Macro Outlook: Russia is Back in Focus Middle East tensions have eased, but geopolitical risk remains. Market sentiment has shifted back to Eastern Europe as tensions between NATO and Russia escalate. According to QCP Capital, the risk premium on global assets is evolving from a short-term hedge to a long-term assumption. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced a slight bounce, a temporary calm, but macroeconomic uncertainty remains a headwind. For BTC, any increase in global volatility, especially from traditional markets, could bring in safe-haven flows into crypto assets. However, BTC’s structure remains bullish. With on-chain data indicating lower realized profits and technical indicators suggesting a continuation, the path to new all-time highs remains open if $ 108,000 holds. Conclusion: BTC is at a crossroads. A close above $108,251 could signal a quick move to $111K and beyond. If not, we could see a pullback to key support zones. Traders are watching – this level will define the next move.

2025-06-26T11:58:05,"Bitcoin (BTC) Faces Market Crossroads as Net Taker Volume Surges Past $100M","Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market have staged an impressive recovery following an escalation in tensions between Israel and Iran that rattled the markets across the world. As Bitcoin trades above $107K, new data suggest that the leading crypto asset is approaching a critical juncture as on-chain and macroeconomic signals converge. Market Fundamentals Warn of Possible Correction On June 24, Binance’s Net Taker Volume, which happens to be an indicator of buying and selling pressure, exceeded $100 million for the first time since June 9. While this spike may suggest increased bullish momentum, CryptoQuant stated that such surges often stem from aggressive retail participation or the liquidation of over-leveraged short positions rather than sustainable investor demand. At the same time, the total stablecoin net outflows from derivative exchanges have topped $1.25 billion, the largest exodus since mid-May. This trend points to weakening structural support for long positions and reflects a broader withdrawal of capital from risk-on environments. Interestingly, the latest market movement coincided with growing speculation about a shift in US monetary policy. During his semiannual testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted that future commercial and economic conditions could warrant interest rate cuts. The statement is a significant change in tone from the central bank, which indicates a possible pivot toward monetary easing. Further validating this narrative, the US 2-year Treasury yield has entered a clear downtrend, a pattern typically interpreted as the market pricing in future rate cuts. Investors are increasingly seeking safety in short-duration government bonds, which evidences rising caution. Elsewhere in the global currency markets, the Swiss Franc surged past 1.24 against the US dollar for the first time in several years, which, again, depicts an increased demand for traditional safe-haven assets. Together, these indicators suggest a rising risk-off sentiment in financial markets. While the Net Taker Volume spike may fuel short-term volatility, the significant outflow of stablecoins from derivative platforms raises concerns about the ability of Bitcoin’s price to sustain upward momentum. With macro uncertainty intensifying and liquidity thinning, the market could be nearing a near-term correction. Binance Open Interest Spikes; Long-Term Holders Trim Exposure As volatility returns and structural support wanes, Bitcoin’s internal market indicators are flashing additional cautionary signals worth close attention. In fact, data from Binance shows the 24-hour Open Interest (OI) percentage change has exceeded 6% for the third time in two months. Previous surges, observed around May 26 and June 10, were followed by price dips or periods of consolidation. This recurring trend could mean that increased inflows into leveraged positions may precede short-term profit-taking and de-risking by market participants. Additionally, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Realized Cap has sharply declined from over $57 billion to just $3.5 billion. This significant drop indicates that long-term holders are reducing exposure and are likely capitalizing on recent price gains and reacting to evolving macroeconomic conditions. While these developments do not necessarily point to an immediate bearish reversal, CryptoQuant said that it does highlight a rising market sensitivity. As such, the market may be entering a profit-taking phase, where short-term pullbacks or sideways movement are more likely as speculative interest builds and long-term conviction wanes.

2025-06-26T11:56:48,"Crypto Tax Audits Incoming? IRS Letters Signal Start of 1099-DA Enforcement","The post Crypto Tax Audits Incoming? IRS Letters Signal Start of 1099-DA Enforcement appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a new wave of warning letters to crypto investors, signaling a crackdown ahead of the upcoming 1099-DA regulation, which is set to take effect in 2026. This aggressive move has sparked anxiety across the crypto community, especially as many investors face confusion over reporting requirements. Crypto Tax Anxiety Surges After IRS Letters According to David Kemmerer , Co-founder and CEO of CoinLedger, crypto investors across the U.S. have received various types of IRS letters urging them to review and update their crypto tax filings. If left unaddressed, these warnings could lead to serious investigations. “We’re seeing a wave of confusion and fear among everyday crypto investors, many of whom made their best effort to report taxes accurately,” Kemmerer explained. Why Is the IRS Sending Crypto Warning Letters? The IRS is stepping up its visibility into digital asset transactions as the U.S. continues its push for financial transparency in the crypto space. This includes matching reported income with blockchain data, third-party records, and new forms like the 1099-DA. Kemmerer emphasized the urgency of proactive compliance: “With Form 1099-DA on the horizon, this kind of enforcement is only going to accelerate. The IRS has more visibility into crypto than ever before, but without accurate cost basis data, even compliant investors can get mistakenly flagged.” [post_titles_links postid=”475048″] Types of IRS Warning Letters Sent to Crypto Investors Here are the key letters crypto investors are receiving: Letter 6174 : A reminder that investors must report taxable crypto activity and update previous filings. Letter 6173 : A more serious notice demanding a response by a set deadline and requiring investors to file missing tax returns involving crypto. Letter CP2000 : Indicates that the IRS has already calculated underreported income or tax owed. Investors are given 30 days to respond. Form 1099-DA: What’s Coming in 2026? Starting in 2026, all crypto trades conducted in 2025 through digital asset brokers will be reported directly to the IRS using Form 1099-DA. This marks a major shift in how the IRS collects crypto tax data—and it will likely trigger widespread audits and possible criminal investigations for non-compliant taxpayers. Kemmerer warns: “If crypto investors fail to report their taxes accurately, especially after the rollout of 1099-DA, they could receive a CP2000 letter or face severe action.” Final Word: A Crucial Grace Period for Crypto Users The current wave of warning letters serves as a wake-up call for investors. This is a grace period —a final opportunity to get crypto tax filings in order before the IRS enforces stricter penalties. Investors are urged to: Organize transaction history Track cost basis and taxable events File or amend returns proactively Avoiding action now could lead to audit risks , fines, or worse once 1099-DA becomes mandatory.

2025-06-26T11:50:37,"U.S. Dollar Index Plunge: Unprecedented Impact on Crypto Markets","BitcoinWorld U.S. Dollar Index Plunge: Unprecedented Impact on Crypto Markets Are you closely watching the gyrations of the global financial markets, particularly how traditional assets influence the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies? If so, you’re not alone. A significant shift has just occurred that demands your attention: the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has plummeted to 97.48, marking its lowest point since February 2022. This dramatic movement isn’t just a headline for forex traders; it carries profound implications for the burgeoning crypto market, potentially reshaping investment strategies and the future trajectory of digital assets. Let’s dive into what this substantial DXY decline means for your crypto portfolio and the broader financial landscape. Understanding the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): What Just Happened? The U.S. Dollar Index , often simply referred to as the DXY, is a measure of the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of six major world currencies. These currencies include the Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Swedish Krona (SEK), and Swiss Franc (CHF). It’s essentially a barometer for the dollar’s strength or weakness against its major trading partners. Recently, the DXY has been on a noticeable downward trajectory. According to MarketWatch data, it has fallen to 97.48, a level not seen since early 2022. This represents a significant 10.1% year-to-date DXY decline . To put this into perspective, consider these key points: Historical Context: The DXY had reached multi-decade highs in late 2022, driven by aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Its current level signifies a considerable reversal from those peaks. Magnitude of the Drop: A 10.1% year-to-date decline is not a minor fluctuation; it indicates a substantial shift in global investor sentiment towards the U.S. dollar. Key Currency Basket: The Euro holds the largest weight in the DXY basket (57.6%), meaning the dollar’s performance against the Euro heavily influences the index’s movement. This weakening of the dollar has ripple effects across various asset classes, and the cryptocurrency market is no exception. Understanding the drivers behind this dollar weakness is crucial for anticipating its future impact. Why the Dollar Weakness is Making Waves: Key Drivers What’s behind this significant dollar weakness ? Several macroeconomic factors are converging to push the DXY lower. The primary drivers include shifts in monetary policy expectations, evolving inflation outlooks, and changes in global economic growth projections. Is the Fed’s Stance Fueling Further Dollar Weakness? A major catalyst for the recent DXY decline is the changing narrative around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. For much of 2022, the Fed was aggressively raising interest rates to combat soaring inflation, making the dollar more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. However, the market is now increasingly pricing in an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle, with expectations of potential rate cuts in the near future. This shift in sentiment reduces the dollar’s yield advantage over other currencies, diminishing its appeal. Interest Rate Differentials: As other central banks (like the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan) potentially catch up or even surpass the Fed in hawkishness, the interest rate differential narrows, reducing the incentive to hold dollars. Inflation Expectations: While inflation remains elevated, there’s a growing belief that it has peaked and is on a downward trend. This lessens the urgency for the Fed to maintain an ultra-tight monetary policy, further contributing to dollar weakness . Economic Slowdown Concerns: Persistent concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. also weigh on the dollar. A weaker economy might necessitate more accommodative monetary policy, which typically leads to a weaker currency. The interplay of these factors creates a challenging environment for the dollar, directly influencing its standing on the global stage and, by extension, its relationship with risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The Profound Crypto Market Impact: A New Era? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, a weakening dollar often signals a potentially bullish environment. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the U.S. Dollar Index and the performance of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. How Does Dollar Weakness Reshape the Bitcoin Price Narrative? When the dollar weakens, assets priced in dollars, such as commodities and cryptocurrencies, can become more attractive. This is because it takes fewer units of other currencies to buy dollars, making dollar-denominated assets relatively cheaper for international investors. More importantly, a weaker dollar can signify a broader flight from traditional fiat currencies into alternative stores of value. Bitcoin as a Digital Gold: The narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold” or an inflation hedge gains traction during periods of dollar depreciation. As the purchasing power of the dollar diminishes, investors may seek assets with a fixed supply and perceived scarcity, like Bitcoin, to preserve wealth. This can lead to upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Increased Liquidity: A weaker dollar can also lead to more global liquidity, as central banks potentially ease monetary policies. This increased liquidity often flows into riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, boosting overall crypto market impact . Investor Sentiment: The psychological effect of a declining dollar can shift investor sentiment towards assets outside the traditional financial system. This encourages diversification into digital assets, viewing them as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. While the DXY decline doesn’t guarantee an immediate surge in the Bitcoin price or the broader crypto market, it certainly creates a more favorable macroeconomic backdrop. Many analysts are now closely watching how this sustained dollar weakness might catalyze the next phase of growth for digital assets. Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Opportunities While the narrative of a weakening dollar benefiting crypto is compelling, it’s crucial to approach the current market with a balanced perspective. The relationship is not always straightforward, and other factors significantly influence the crypto market impact . What Should Crypto Investors Watch Out For Amidst This DXY Decline? The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the U.S. Dollar Index . Regulatory developments, technological advancements, institutional adoption, and specific project news all play significant roles. For instance, a sudden regulatory crackdown or a major hack could overshadow any positive influence from a weakening dollar. Challenges to Consider: Correlation vs. Causation: While an inverse correlation often exists, it’s not always a direct causal relationship. Other macro factors, such as global economic growth or geopolitical events, can also drive both DXY and crypto movements. Regulatory Headwinds: Increased scrutiny from global regulators could dampen enthusiasm, regardless of the dollar’s performance. Market Liquidity: While a weaker dollar can imply more liquidity, a sudden tightening by other central banks or a global financial shock could still impact crypto negatively. “Risk-On” vs. “Risk-Off” Sentiment: Sometimes, the dollar weakens because investors are taking on more risk globally (risk-on), which can benefit crypto. Other times, it might be due to specific U.S. economic concerns that don’t necessarily translate to immediate crypto gains. Despite these challenges, the current environment presents opportunities. The ongoing DXY decline , combined with increasing institutional interest and technological advancements within the crypto space, could set the stage for significant long-term growth. Investors who understand these dynamics are better positioned to capitalize on potential shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Understanding the intricate relationship between the U.S. Dollar Index and the crypto market can empower you to make more informed investment decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Macroeconomic Indicators: Keep a close eye on the DXY, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve announcements. These traditional financial indicators provide valuable context for anticipating crypto market movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin often leads the charge, consider a diversified crypto portfolio that includes established altcoins and promising new projects. This can help mitigate risk and capture broader market gains. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the volatility, consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of market fluctuations, can be a prudent strategy. This helps average out your purchase price and reduces the impact of short-term swings. Stay Informed on Regulatory News: Regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) can significantly impact crypto prices. Keep abreast of developments in major jurisdictions. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: While short-term DXY movements can create trading opportunities, the long-term success of cryptocurrencies depends on their underlying technology, adoption, and utility. The current period of dollar weakness is not just a fleeting trend; it reflects deeper shifts in global finance. For those invested in or considering the crypto space, this moment offers a unique lens through which to view potential future growth and strategic positioning. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Digital Assets The dramatic drop in the U.S. Dollar Index to its lowest point since February 2022 signals a significant turning point in global finance. This 10.1% year-to-date DXY decline , driven by evolving monetary policies and shifting economic outlooks, directly impacts the perceived value and attractiveness of the dollar. For the cryptocurrency market, this period of sustained dollar weakness presents a compelling narrative, potentially bolstering the case for assets like Bitcoin as alternative stores of value. While the inverse correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin price is not absolute, the current macroeconomic environment certainly offers a more favorable backdrop for digital assets. As we navigate these dynamic shifts, staying informed and adopting a strategic approach will be key to unlocking the opportunities that this unprecedented financial recalibration presents for the future of money.

2025-06-26T11:50:32,"Time Traveler Predicts When to Get $50,000 Profit on 1000 XRP Investment","Dustin Layton, a digital asset analyst known for his involvement in the XRP community through his “Time Traveler” persona, recently shared a highly optimistic projection regarding XRP’s potential price performance in the coming months. He stated that anyone holding 1,000 XRP could expect to earn a minimum profit of $50,000 by the end of 2025. At the token’s current price of approximately $2.19, 1,000 units are valued at $2,190. Layton’s claim implies that each token would need to reach at least $52.20 within the year, representing a 2,300% return on investment. Layton encouraged followers to save his post and revisit it in the future, emphasizing that the predicted profit is for 2025 alone. If you hold 1000 XRP in 2025, you will see $50,000 minimum in profit just this year alone. Bookmark this. — Time Traveler (@Traveler2236) June 24, 2025 Reaction from the Community The reaction to Layton’s prediction was mixed, with many expressing cautious optimism or outright skepticism. Some users, while hopeful, acknowledged that the estimate appears unrealistic. A user named Ellian Betan commented that such forecasts tend to overlook real-world limitations. Others questioned the practical implications of such growth. For instance, one user asked whether Layton would delete his account if XRP failed to reach the projected price. Another user, Tobias, observed that while significant profits might be attainable, the return is determined by the token’s future price, not the cost at which it was acquired. Therefore, whether an investor bought XRP at $0.07 or $2.00, the key factor remains the token’s price performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Capitalization Implications of a $50 XRP If XRP were to exceed $50 per coin, its total market capitalization would surpass $3 trillion. For comparison, this would place XRP above Bitcoin’s current market value, making the target highly ambitious. Despite the boldness of Layton’s claim, he is not the only analyst proposing large price movements for XRP. In March, Elliott Wave analyst XForceGlobal predicted XRP could reach between $20 and $40 either this year or next, based on a 5-wave pattern. Similarly, a market analyst known as Steph suggested that if the global cryptocurrency market grows to $7 trillion and XRP captures a 30% share, the token could climb to $34.20. Other commentators have issued even more aggressive forecasts. Javon Marks, for example, has floated the idea that XRP could approach $99 during this market cycle, though he did not offer a specific timeline. Conservative Estimates Remain Cautious In contrast to these bullish views, some market analysts and platforms have adopted a more cautious stance. Forecasts from Changelly and Telegaon suggest that XRP may not reach the $50 milestone until at least 2035. These projections significantly diverge from Layton’s 2025 outlook, highlighting the divide between short-term optimism and long-term realism. While Layton’s prediction of a $50,000 profit from holding 1,000 XRP has generated considerable attention, it remains a speculative outlook. The wide range of price targets, from $34 to nearly $100, demonstrates the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s future valuation.
