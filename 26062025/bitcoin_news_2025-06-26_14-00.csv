2025-06-26T11:58:05,"Bitcoin (BTC) Faces Market Crossroads as Net Taker Volume Surges Past $100M","Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market have staged an impressive recovery following an escalation in tensions between Israel and Iran that rattled the markets across the world. As Bitcoin trades above $107K, new data suggest that the leading crypto asset is approaching a critical juncture as on-chain and macroeconomic signals converge. Market Fundamentals Warn of Possible Correction On June 24, Binance’s Net Taker Volume, which happens to be an indicator of buying and selling pressure, exceeded $100 million for the first time since June 9. While this spike may suggest increased bullish momentum, CryptoQuant stated that such surges often stem from aggressive retail participation or the liquidation of over-leveraged short positions rather than sustainable investor demand. At the same time, the total stablecoin net outflows from derivative exchanges have topped $1.25 billion, the largest exodus since mid-May. This trend points to weakening structural support for long positions and reflects a broader withdrawal of capital from risk-on environments. Interestingly, the latest market movement coincided with growing speculation about a shift in US monetary policy. During his semiannual testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted that future commercial and economic conditions could warrant interest rate cuts. The statement is a significant change in tone from the central bank, which indicates a possible pivot toward monetary easing. Further validating this narrative, the US 2-year Treasury yield has entered a clear downtrend, a pattern typically interpreted as the market pricing in future rate cuts. Investors are increasingly seeking safety in short-duration government bonds, which evidences rising caution. Elsewhere in the global currency markets, the Swiss Franc surged past 1.24 against the US dollar for the first time in several years, which, again, depicts an increased demand for traditional safe-haven assets. Together, these indicators suggest a rising risk-off sentiment in financial markets. While the Net Taker Volume spike may fuel short-term volatility, the significant outflow of stablecoins from derivative platforms raises concerns about the ability of Bitcoin’s price to sustain upward momentum. With macro uncertainty intensifying and liquidity thinning, the market could be nearing a near-term correction. Binance Open Interest Spikes; Long-Term Holders Trim Exposure As volatility returns and structural support wanes, Bitcoin’s internal market indicators are flashing additional cautionary signals worth close attention. In fact, data from Binance shows the 24-hour Open Interest (OI) percentage change has exceeded 6% for the third time in two months. Previous surges, observed around May 26 and June 10, were followed by price dips or periods of consolidation. This recurring trend could mean that increased inflows into leveraged positions may precede short-term profit-taking and de-risking by market participants. Additionally, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Realized Cap has sharply declined from over $57 billion to just $3.5 billion. This significant drop indicates that long-term holders are reducing exposure and are likely capitalizing on recent price gains and reacting to evolving macroeconomic conditions. While these developments do not necessarily point to an immediate bearish reversal, CryptoQuant said that it does highlight a rising market sensitivity. As such, the market may be entering a profit-taking phase, where short-term pullbacks or sideways movement are more likely as speculative interest builds and long-term conviction wanes.

2025-06-26T11:50:37,"U.S. Dollar Index Plunge: Unprecedented Impact on Crypto Markets","BitcoinWorld U.S. Dollar Index Plunge: Unprecedented Impact on Crypto Markets Are you closely watching the gyrations of the global financial markets, particularly how traditional assets influence the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies? If so, you’re not alone. A significant shift has just occurred that demands your attention: the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has plummeted to 97.48, marking its lowest point since February 2022. This dramatic movement isn’t just a headline for forex traders; it carries profound implications for the burgeoning crypto market, potentially reshaping investment strategies and the future trajectory of digital assets. Let’s dive into what this substantial DXY decline means for your crypto portfolio and the broader financial landscape. Understanding the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): What Just Happened? The U.S. Dollar Index , often simply referred to as the DXY, is a measure of the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of six major world currencies. These currencies include the Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Swedish Krona (SEK), and Swiss Franc (CHF). It’s essentially a barometer for the dollar’s strength or weakness against its major trading partners. Recently, the DXY has been on a noticeable downward trajectory. According to MarketWatch data, it has fallen to 97.48, a level not seen since early 2022. This represents a significant 10.1% year-to-date DXY decline . To put this into perspective, consider these key points: Historical Context: The DXY had reached multi-decade highs in late 2022, driven by aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Its current level signifies a considerable reversal from those peaks. Magnitude of the Drop: A 10.1% year-to-date decline is not a minor fluctuation; it indicates a substantial shift in global investor sentiment towards the U.S. dollar. Key Currency Basket: The Euro holds the largest weight in the DXY basket (57.6%), meaning the dollar’s performance against the Euro heavily influences the index’s movement. This weakening of the dollar has ripple effects across various asset classes, and the cryptocurrency market is no exception. Understanding the drivers behind this dollar weakness is crucial for anticipating its future impact. Why the Dollar Weakness is Making Waves: Key Drivers What’s behind this significant dollar weakness ? Several macroeconomic factors are converging to push the DXY lower. The primary drivers include shifts in monetary policy expectations, evolving inflation outlooks, and changes in global economic growth projections. Is the Fed’s Stance Fueling Further Dollar Weakness? A major catalyst for the recent DXY decline is the changing narrative around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. For much of 2022, the Fed was aggressively raising interest rates to combat soaring inflation, making the dollar more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. However, the market is now increasingly pricing in an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle, with expectations of potential rate cuts in the near future. This shift in sentiment reduces the dollar’s yield advantage over other currencies, diminishing its appeal. Interest Rate Differentials: As other central banks (like the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan) potentially catch up or even surpass the Fed in hawkishness, the interest rate differential narrows, reducing the incentive to hold dollars. Inflation Expectations: While inflation remains elevated, there’s a growing belief that it has peaked and is on a downward trend. This lessens the urgency for the Fed to maintain an ultra-tight monetary policy, further contributing to dollar weakness . Economic Slowdown Concerns: Persistent concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. also weigh on the dollar. A weaker economy might necessitate more accommodative monetary policy, which typically leads to a weaker currency. The interplay of these factors creates a challenging environment for the dollar, directly influencing its standing on the global stage and, by extension, its relationship with risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The Profound Crypto Market Impact: A New Era? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, a weakening dollar often signals a potentially bullish environment. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the U.S. Dollar Index and the performance of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. How Does Dollar Weakness Reshape the Bitcoin Price Narrative? When the dollar weakens, assets priced in dollars, such as commodities and cryptocurrencies, can become more attractive. This is because it takes fewer units of other currencies to buy dollars, making dollar-denominated assets relatively cheaper for international investors. More importantly, a weaker dollar can signify a broader flight from traditional fiat currencies into alternative stores of value. Bitcoin as a Digital Gold: The narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold” or an inflation hedge gains traction during periods of dollar depreciation. As the purchasing power of the dollar diminishes, investors may seek assets with a fixed supply and perceived scarcity, like Bitcoin, to preserve wealth. This can lead to upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Increased Liquidity: A weaker dollar can also lead to more global liquidity, as central banks potentially ease monetary policies. This increased liquidity often flows into riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, boosting overall crypto market impact . Investor Sentiment: The psychological effect of a declining dollar can shift investor sentiment towards assets outside the traditional financial system. This encourages diversification into digital assets, viewing them as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. While the DXY decline doesn’t guarantee an immediate surge in the Bitcoin price or the broader crypto market, it certainly creates a more favorable macroeconomic backdrop. Many analysts are now closely watching how this sustained dollar weakness might catalyze the next phase of growth for digital assets. Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Opportunities While the narrative of a weakening dollar benefiting crypto is compelling, it’s crucial to approach the current market with a balanced perspective. The relationship is not always straightforward, and other factors significantly influence the crypto market impact . What Should Crypto Investors Watch Out For Amidst This DXY Decline? The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the U.S. Dollar Index . Regulatory developments, technological advancements, institutional adoption, and specific project news all play significant roles. For instance, a sudden regulatory crackdown or a major hack could overshadow any positive influence from a weakening dollar. Challenges to Consider: Correlation vs. Causation: While an inverse correlation often exists, it’s not always a direct causal relationship. Other macro factors, such as global economic growth or geopolitical events, can also drive both DXY and crypto movements. Regulatory Headwinds: Increased scrutiny from global regulators could dampen enthusiasm, regardless of the dollar’s performance. Market Liquidity: While a weaker dollar can imply more liquidity, a sudden tightening by other central banks or a global financial shock could still impact crypto negatively. “Risk-On” vs. “Risk-Off” Sentiment: Sometimes, the dollar weakens because investors are taking on more risk globally (risk-on), which can benefit crypto. Other times, it might be due to specific U.S. economic concerns that don’t necessarily translate to immediate crypto gains. Despite these challenges, the current environment presents opportunities. The ongoing DXY decline , combined with increasing institutional interest and technological advancements within the crypto space, could set the stage for significant long-term growth. Investors who understand these dynamics are better positioned to capitalize on potential shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Understanding the intricate relationship between the U.S. Dollar Index and the crypto market can empower you to make more informed investment decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Macroeconomic Indicators: Keep a close eye on the DXY, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve announcements. These traditional financial indicators provide valuable context for anticipating crypto market movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin often leads the charge, consider a diversified crypto portfolio that includes established altcoins and promising new projects. This can help mitigate risk and capture broader market gains. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the volatility, consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of market fluctuations, can be a prudent strategy. This helps average out your purchase price and reduces the impact of short-term swings. Stay Informed on Regulatory News: Regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) can significantly impact crypto prices. Keep abreast of developments in major jurisdictions. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: While short-term DXY movements can create trading opportunities, the long-term success of cryptocurrencies depends on their underlying technology, adoption, and utility. The current period of dollar weakness is not just a fleeting trend; it reflects deeper shifts in global finance. For those invested in or considering the crypto space, this moment offers a unique lens through which to view potential future growth and strategic positioning. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Digital Assets The dramatic drop in the U.S. Dollar Index to its lowest point since February 2022 signals a significant turning point in global finance. This 10.1% year-to-date DXY decline , driven by evolving monetary policies and shifting economic outlooks, directly impacts the perceived value and attractiveness of the dollar. For the cryptocurrency market, this period of sustained dollar weakness presents a compelling narrative, potentially bolstering the case for assets like Bitcoin as alternative stores of value. While the inverse correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin price is not absolute, the current macroeconomic environment certainly offers a more favorable backdrop for digital assets. As we navigate these dynamic shifts, staying informed and adopting a strategic approach will be key to unlocking the opportunities that this unprecedented financial recalibration presents for the future of money.

2025-06-26T11:50:32,"Time Traveler Predicts When to Get $50,000 Profit on 1000 XRP Investment","Dustin Layton, a digital asset analyst known for his involvement in the XRP community through his “Time Traveler” persona, recently shared a highly optimistic projection regarding XRP’s potential price performance in the coming months. He stated that anyone holding 1,000 XRP could expect to earn a minimum profit of $50,000 by the end of 2025. At the token’s current price of approximately $2.19, 1,000 units are valued at $2,190. Layton’s claim implies that each token would need to reach at least $52.20 within the year, representing a 2,300% return on investment. Layton encouraged followers to save his post and revisit it in the future, emphasizing that the predicted profit is for 2025 alone. If you hold 1000 XRP in 2025, you will see $50,000 minimum in profit just this year alone. Bookmark this. — Time Traveler (@Traveler2236) June 24, 2025 Reaction from the Community The reaction to Layton’s prediction was mixed, with many expressing cautious optimism or outright skepticism. Some users, while hopeful, acknowledged that the estimate appears unrealistic. A user named Ellian Betan commented that such forecasts tend to overlook real-world limitations. Others questioned the practical implications of such growth. For instance, one user asked whether Layton would delete his account if XRP failed to reach the projected price. Another user, Tobias, observed that while significant profits might be attainable, the return is determined by the token’s future price, not the cost at which it was acquired. Therefore, whether an investor bought XRP at $0.07 or $2.00, the key factor remains the token’s price performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Capitalization Implications of a $50 XRP If XRP were to exceed $50 per coin, its total market capitalization would surpass $3 trillion. For comparison, this would place XRP above Bitcoin’s current market value, making the target highly ambitious. Despite the boldness of Layton’s claim, he is not the only analyst proposing large price movements for XRP. In March, Elliott Wave analyst XForceGlobal predicted XRP could reach between $20 and $40 either this year or next, based on a 5-wave pattern. Similarly, a market analyst known as Steph suggested that if the global cryptocurrency market grows to $7 trillion and XRP captures a 30% share, the token could climb to $34.20. Other commentators have issued even more aggressive forecasts. Javon Marks, for example, has floated the idea that XRP could approach $99 during this market cycle, though he did not offer a specific timeline. Conservative Estimates Remain Cautious In contrast to these bullish views, some market analysts and platforms have adopted a more cautious stance. Forecasts from Changelly and Telegaon suggest that XRP may not reach the $50 milestone until at least 2035. These projections significantly diverge from Layton’s 2025 outlook, highlighting the divide between short-term optimism and long-term realism. While Layton’s prediction of a $50,000 profit from holding 1,000 XRP has generated considerable attention, it remains a speculative outlook. The wide range of price targets, from $34 to nearly $100, demonstrates the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s future valuation.

Arthur Hayes Reveals ‘Bull Market Checklist’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin could be heading for new all-time highs, at least if Arthur Hayes has it right. The BitMEX co-founder recently shared a bullish take on the market, pointing to key regulatory changes that he believes are setting the stage for a major crypto rally. From stablecoin reforms to broader shifts in global finance, Hayes sees the pieces falling into place for Bitcoin to surge. Bull market checklist: – UST SLR exemption progressing – Genius Act hands US stablecoin mrkt to banks, next essay will explain y +ve – Ignore the reality, Trump, Bibi, and Kahmenei are all pretending the conflict is finished so investors should too $BTC ATHs are coming — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 26, 2025 SLR Exemption Could Spark a Crypto Liquidity Boost Hayes highlights the U.S. Treasury’s Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption as a major factor. If reinstated, this policy would let banks free up more capital, allowing them to hold stablecoins and crypto-related assets with fewer restrictions. That means more liquidity, stronger support from big institutions, and a smoother path for crypto to integrate with the traditional financial system. For Hayes, it’s a clear sign that markets are preparing for a new bull cycle. The Genius Act: Giving Banks Control of Stablecoins Another big piece of the puzzle is the proposed Genius Act. This legislation could shift control of the U.S. stablecoin market to banks—a move Hayes believes is actually a good thing. Rather than slowing innovation, this could bring legitimacy and stability to stablecoins, making them a trusted part of the financial system. That kind of trust, in turn, can lift confidence in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Hayes: Ignore the Drama, Watch the Market Hayes also pointed out how world leaders, like Trump, Netanyahu, and Iran’s Khamenei, are caught up in political and geopolitical tensions. But he urges investors to look past the headlines and focus on market signals instead. He points to a 22% surge in stablecoin market cap this year, now hitting $251 billion. To Hayes, that’s a strong sign that capital is flowing back into crypto and that investors are positioning for a run. Not His First Rodeo Hayes’s view ties into his past commentary, where he’s connected crypto market trends with global economic policy. He’s written before about the impact of central banks, like the Bank of Japan, on risk assets like Bitcoin. Now, as macro conditions shift and regulators appear more open to crypto, Hayes sees all signs pointing to another breakout moment. Bitcoin’s Setup for a New Rally? With policies like the SLR exemption and the Genius Act bringing crypto and traditional finance closer together, Hayes believes Bitcoin is primed for big gains. Stablecoins may be laying the groundwork—but Bitcoin, he argues, is the real beneficiary. If his call plays out, we could be entering a new phase of adoption, with Bitcoin leading the charge toward another all-time high.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/when-will-bitcoin-price-hit-new-ath-arthur-hayes-reveals-bull-market-checklist/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T11:46:51,"Riot Platforms' Diversification Plan May Face Immense Competition","Summary I rate RIOT a hold at $9.09/share, reflecting a balanced outlook amid operational growth and competitive pressures in data center hosting. Riot Platforms’ expansion at Corsicana and the Rhodium acquisition may boost power and hash rate, but legal and market risks can potentially persist. The data center hosting market is highly competitive, with hyperscalers like Oracle dominating the market. Riot’s Bitcoin mining profitability may be pressured by rising power costs and Bitcoin price volatility, limiting near-term upside despite strong Bitcoin treasury holdings. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) is in the process of expanding its Corsicana facility from 400MW to 600MW in capacity with the intention of hosting third-party hyperscalers at its data center site. With the ambition of navigating into a new market opportunity, I believe Riot may face certain hurdles in hosted shared space given the current competitive market environment. Valuing RIOT as an organization, I believe shares should be priced at $9.09/share at 5.41x eFY26 price/sales. I am recommending RIOT shares with a hold rating. Riot Platforms Operations Corporate Reports Riot closed the acquisition of certain assets of Rhodium at the Rockdale Facility in Q1’25. The acquisition included Rhodium’s 125MW of power capacity, as well as its existing operating assets at the facility. The acquisition was valued at $185mm, inclusive of $49mm in Riot common shares. In addition to acquiring the facility, compute capacity, and power capacity, Riot and Rhodium entered into an agreement to conclude all litigation. Prior to the announced acquisition, Rhodium filed a $300mm suit against Riot as a result of Riot’s acquisition of Whinstone and the cancellation of Rhodium’s power supply agreement for 100MW of power. Years prior, in 2023, Riot filed a suit against Rhodium over an alleged $26mm in unpaid fees. Staying on the topic of litigation, investors filed a suit against Rhodium in December 2024, suggesting that Rhodium misled investors by concealing critical information and engaging in self-dealing. The suit also suggests that Rhodium failed to disclose the pending sale of the organization’s operating facilities to Riot, creating conflict over power contracts. Given that Rhodium’s sale was an asset sale as opposed to the company being absorbed by Riot, Riot may be somewhat shielded from the suit. Other legacy suits were filed in Riot’s March 2025 10-Q , bearing no mention of the investor suit. As a result of the acquisition, management is anticipating increased hash rates, reduced operating losses, and gained power capacity for future development. At the end of Q1’25, Riot had 33.7EH/s in capacity, producing a total of 1,530 Bitcoin in the quarter. Riot began purchasing Bitcoin in Q4’24 to bolster its treasury while leveraging its holdings for a collateralized $100mm credit facility through Coinbase . Accordingly, this credit facility will ideally provide Riot with adequate financing to slow the dilution of the float. Riot ended Q1’25 with 19,223 Bitcoin. Using $105k as the base price, Riot’s Bitcoin holdings amount to $2b. TradingView As part of its growth strategy, Riot invested a substantial proportion of its capital outlay for Q1’25 in the development of its 600MW substation expansion at the Corsicana facility in Navarro County, Texas. According to Riot’s website , the facility currently has 400MW in capacity, with the option to expand to 1GW. Using a like-for-like approach, the expansion to 600MW should get the facility to 23.55EH/s in capacity. The data center buildout may also involve sourcing data center tenants, primarily targeting hyperscaler customers. Though data center hosting may be an appealing market for Riot, Riot will be competing with Oracle Corp . ( ORCL ), which develops purpose-built data centers with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as well as engages in a MultiCloud strategy, developing data center sites for hyperscaler customers. The growth factor management mentioned was that the existing GenAI capacity calls for 5GW of capacity with the expectation of growing to 30GW by 2030. Though this may be the case, I suspect a significant proportion of capacity will derive from enterprises rather than consumers, potentially limiting the full, total addressable market to a narrower figure. In addition to this, hyperscalers are investing in developing their data center footprints given the size and scale of compute capacity needed to operate AI models on their infrastructure. Referencing Oracle’s data center developments, OpenAI has partnered with Oracle to develop its first 1.2GW site in Abilene, Texas , and will likely continue working with Oracle for new site developments. What makes Oracle’s data center business stand out above Riot is that Oracle develops modular, autonomously operating data center facilities. Though I have no doubt that Riot will be successful in enticing tenants for its AI/HPC data center site, I believe that the data center hosting business will be fierce, particularly when considering the total cost to operate. The area in which I can see Riot competing is in its engineering and manufacturing business with ESS Metron for critical switchgear. This business could potentially add value to third-party customers in the data center business and may help debottleneck the electrical equipment market. Riot Platforms' Financial Position Corporate Reports One of the biggest costs Riot must address in Bitcoin mining, net of machine depreciation, is the cost of power. In the organization’s FY24 presentation , Riot reported that the cost to mine a single Bitcoin was 96.9% of the value of the coin. Corporate Reports Granted, the price per Bitcoin is substantially higher today when compared to all of FY24; however, power consumption may be a persistent headwind, particularly as electricity prices are set to increase with power demand for growing data centers and industrial footprints. Net of Bitcoin price appreciation, increasing power costs can create significant headwinds for Riot in the coming quarters, particularly as more connected infrastructure is added to the grid. TradingView Looking to eQ2’25, I’m forecasting Riot to generate $152mm in net revenue, with a diluted EPS of -$0.23/share. This is predicated on strong Bitcoin mining growth and sales for the quarter as a result of the high value of Bitcoin quarter-to-date. Risks Related to Riot Platforms Bull Case The price of Bitcoin has created a more appealing operating environment for Riot, potentially leading to the organization delivering positive adjusted EBITDA for eQ2’25. With data center power capacity being widely constrained, the organization may be well-positioned to advantageously take on hosted customers, potentially expanding its brand beyond Bitcoin mining and engineering operations. Bear Case The data center environment is highly competitive, potentially creating certain challenges for Riot to enter the space. The organization has also faced legal challenges relating to contractual power distribution that may deter third-party hyperscaler customers. Bitcoin remains highly volatile and may not sustain its $105k+/- price range, potentially impacting Riot’s revenue stream going forward. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports RIOT currently trades at 1.61x price/BV BTC, assuming a $105k price per Bitcoin. This is relatively comparable to its competitor CleanSpark ( CLSK ), which trades at roughly 1.89x, considering its 12,502 Bitcoin holdings. Despite this factor, investors in RIOT must consider its other operating unit in engineering and its aim to act as a data center host, creating a certain operating complexity when compared to CleanSpark. Valuing RIOT as an organization, I believe shares should be priced at $9.09/share at 5.41x eFY26 price/sales. I am recommending RIOT shares with a hold rating. Corporate Reports Using the model: the valuation table above references my financial forecast in the firm’s “financial position” section and ties it to the stock’s historical trading premiums. The trading premium array is derived through the normal operating cycle, with the blue-sky scenario being the stock’s peak multiple and the gray-sky scenario being the lowest point. The target multiple aims for the midpoint, or the most likely trading range for the company’s stock. The trading multiples from there are set to a probability factor based on the likelihood of the stock trading at that premium based on its historical presence. From there, the trading multiple is tied to the probability factor to derive its relative market cap and relative multiple.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797423-riot-platforms-diversification-plan-may-face-immense-competition?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","CLSK|RIOT",cryptocompare

The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 867,400 followers on the social media platform X that on the higher time frames, the Bitcoin trend is up and the day-to-day fluctuations in price are just “noise.” According to Pentoshi, the demand for Bitcoin is currently outstripping the new supply of Bitcoin and more demand is likely to come in amid potential currency debasement. “There is factually more BTC being bought on any given day than is being mined. Until that trend changes, try to just relax a bit and enjoy the ride. It increasingly looks like more debasing will occur. And BTC is a hedge against debasement.” Pentoshi, however, warns that there’s danger lurking for Bitcoin from the corporations accumulating the crypto king in their balance sheets. The widely followed analyst says some of these companies will “hurt” Bitcoin in a couple of years when they will be potentially forced to liquidate their BTC holdings to pay the debt they will have incurred for purposes of accumulating the flagship digital asset. “I think many will end up being forced sellers eventually. When some of the notes come due.” Bitcoin is trading at $107,875 at time of writing.

2025-06-26T11:42:15,"Nobitex Hack pulls curtains on months of suspicious fund movements","The recent hack on Nobitex, Iran’s largest crypto exchange, dealt a major blow to the country’s crypto industry, draining millions in user funds. But the breach may have revealed more than just security flaws, as troubling on-chain history raises questions over the platform’s operations. According to BeInCrypto, an investigation by blockchain intelligence firm Global Ledger into the June 18 Nobitex hack has found that the platform may have been engaging in stealthy fund movements well before the cyberattack. Per the report, on-chain analysis has revealed a pattern of practices typically linked to money laundering, such as peelchains, one-use wallets, and systematic balance sweeps, deeply embedded in the exchange’s infrastructure. The attack on Nobitex affected multiple chains, resulting in the loss of over $90 million in assets. Shortly after the breach, Nobitex moved 1,801 BTC (worth around $187 million) from exposed wallets to new addresses. While the exchange described this as a protective measure, the investigation shows similar movement patterns had been occurring quietly for months. Hot Wallets, Cold Moves: Nobitex’s shady crypto shuffle Since as far back as October 2024, Nobitex has been using a stealth tactic known as peelchains, a method where funds are gradually split and passed through intermediaries or one-time-use wallets. This technique is used to quietly move large amounts of crypto, while obscuring their trail and making them difficult to trace. On multiple occasions, several hot wallets tied to Nobitex repeatedly passed exactly 30 BTC between addresses, often through one-time-use intermediaries. Funds in these flows were eventually sent to exchange addresses or, in some cases, destinations linked to illicit actors. You might also like: Nobitex hackers leak full source code after $100m crypto heist Additionally, the investigation traced funds moving in and out of a wallet cluster that behaved like a central mixing layer. Many of these wallets had a short lifespan and were used just once before being abandoned, suggesting an intentional scheme to avoid detection. Further evidence shows that Nobitex’s “rescue wallet,” which was supposedly deployed after the hack to safeguard the remaining funds, was found to have been active for months prior, consistently receiving chipped-off funds. The exchange has also continued similar asset movements post-hack and is said to still hold substantial reserves. Global Ledger’s findings now raise questions about Nobitex’s operational transparency, including possible ties to illicit activity such as money laundering. Gonjeshke Darande, the pro-Israel hacker group that claimed responsibility for the attack, previously accused Nobitex of being Iran’s “favorite sanctions violation tool.” The group also cited this as a key reason for targeting the exchange, claiming it as part of a broader retaliation effort tied to the Israel-Iran conflict.

2025-06-26T11:40:43,"Unveiling the Trump-Backed Crypto Project: WLFI Token Sparks Tremendous Corporate Treasury Interest","BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Trump-Backed Crypto Project: WLFI Token Sparks Tremendous Corporate Treasury Interest In the rapidly evolving world of digital finance, a new player is emerging with significant backing that’s turning heads: World Liberty Financial (WLFI). This Trump-backed crypto project is reportedly drawing considerable attention from public companies looking to diversify their treasury holdings with digital assets. The news, first reported by Bloomberg and affirmed by WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman at the prestigious Permissionless conference in New York, signals a potentially groundbreaking shift in how traditional businesses view and utilize cryptocurrencies. What is the Buzz Around This Trump-Backed Crypto Initiative? The concept of a cryptocurrency project explicitly linked to a prominent political family like the Trumps immediately ignites curiosity and debate. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) aims to leverage this unique association to build a robust ecosystem around its native token. According to Zak Folkman, the co-founder, the project is designed to offer a new avenue for financial empowerment and digital asset utilization. The Trump family’s involvement, while not fully detailed in its scope, provides an undeniable spotlight, potentially attracting a demographic not typically immersed in the crypto space, alongside traditional institutional investors. The core proposition of WLFI appears to revolve around providing a stable, reliable digital asset that can serve various financial functions, including acting as a treasury reserve. This ambition places WLFI in a unique position, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy, with a distinct political flavor that sets it apart from other crypto ventures. The project’s narrative suggests a focus on liberty and financial freedom, themes that resonate strongly with its political affiliations. Why are Public Firms Eyeing the WLFI Token for Treasury? The interest from public companies in using the WLFI token as a treasury asset is a significant development. For years, corporate treasuries have primarily relied on traditional assets like cash, short-term government bonds, and money market funds. However, with inflation concerns and the search for higher yields, companies are increasingly exploring alternative assets. Bitcoin, pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, has shown the viability of digital assets for treasury management. The appeal of WLFI for these firms could stem from several factors: Diversification: Adding a crypto asset, particularly one with perceived stability or unique backing, can diversify a company’s treasury portfolio. Inflation Hedge: Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as potential hedges against inflation, preserving purchasing power in a volatile economic climate. Growth Potential: While aiming for stability, the inherent growth potential of a nascent crypto project could offer higher returns than traditional low-yield assets. Strategic Alignment: For some companies, aligning with a project backed by a prominent political figure might offer strategic benefits or appeal to a specific customer base. Zak Folkman’s statements suggest that WLFI is positioning itself as a credible and attractive option for corporate balance sheets, aiming to provide a digital asset that meets the stringent requirements of public companies for liquidity, security, and regulatory compliance. The Michael Saylor Connection: A Blueprint for Corporate Treasury Assets? One of the most intriguing aspects highlighted by Folkman is WLFI’s close relationship with Michael Saylor , the executive chairman of MicroStrategy. Saylor is widely recognized as a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, having famously converted MicroStrategy’s treasury into a significant Bitcoin holding. His strategy has become a de facto blueprint for other public companies considering similar moves. The association with Saylor lends considerable credibility to WLFI’s treasury aspirations. It suggests that the project is not merely dabbling in the idea but is potentially consulting with, or learning from, one of the most experienced figures in the corporate crypto treasury space. Saylor’s insights could help WLFI navigate the complexities of regulatory frameworks, institutional onboarding, and the technical infrastructure required to support large-scale corporate adoption. This connection indicates a serious intent to position WLFI as a viable, institutional-grade asset for companies seeking to optimize their balance sheets in the digital age. For companies considering a digital asset for their treasury, the Saylor endorsement, even if indirect, provides a level of reassurance and a potential roadmap for implementation. It transforms WLFI from just another crypto project into one with a strategic vision for corporate integration. Insights from the Permissionless Conference : What’s Next for WLFI? The Permissionless conference in New York served as a crucial platform for Zak Folkman to share updates on WLFI’s progress and vision. Such industry events are vital for networking, attracting investors, and building community trust. Folkman’s comments at the conference underscore the project’s ambition to become a significant player in the institutional crypto space. While specific details about the tokenomics or technical architecture of WLFI remain somewhat under wraps, the focus on corporate treasury interest suggests a priority on stability, compliance, and scalability. Future developments for WLFI will likely include: Regulatory Engagement: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies will be paramount, especially for attracting public companies. Technological Development: Ensuring the WLFI token and its underlying blockchain infrastructure are robust, secure, and scalable to handle large institutional transactions. Partnerships: Forming strategic alliances with financial institutions, custodians, and other blockchain service providers to facilitate corporate adoption. Transparency: Providing clear communication regarding the project’s roadmap, financial backing, and governance model to build investor confidence. The project’s success will largely depend on its ability to deliver on these fronts and to convince traditional finance players that a politically-backed crypto asset can be a secure and beneficial addition to their balance sheets. Navigating the Landscape of Digital Asset Adoption: Benefits and Challenges The increasing interest in digital assets for corporate treasuries, exemplified by WLFI, highlights a broader trend towards institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. This trend comes with both significant benefits and inherent challenges. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Digital assets can offer 24/7 liquidity, unlike traditional markets. Lower Transaction Costs: Blockchain-based transactions can potentially reduce fees associated with traditional financial transfers. Faster Settlements: Near-instantaneous settlement times compared to traditional banking systems. New Revenue Streams: Opportunities for yield generation through staking, lending, or DeFi protocols. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent global regulations remains a significant hurdle. Volatility: While some tokens aim for stability, the crypto market is inherently volatile, posing risks to treasury values. Security Risks: The threat of hacks, scams, and loss of private keys requires robust security protocols. Accounting and Tax Implications: Complexities in how crypto assets are treated for accounting and tax purposes. Public Perception: The association with a political figure could be a double-edged sword, attracting some while alienating others. For public companies, a meticulous due diligence process is essential before integrating any digital asset into their treasury strategy. This includes assessing the asset’s underlying technology, regulatory compliance, security measures, and the reputation of its backers. A Glimpse into the Future: Actionable Insights for Investors and Corporations The emergence of WLFI and its reported corporate interest provides several actionable insights: Monitor Institutional Trends: The move towards corporate treasury crypto indicates a maturing market. Keep an eye on which types of companies are adopting digital assets and why. Understand Project Backing: For investors, the backing of a project, whether by a political family or a prominent industry figure like Michael Saylor, can significantly influence its trajectory and perceived legitimacy. Assess Regulatory Readiness: Projects that actively engage with regulators and prioritize compliance are more likely to gain institutional trust. Diversify Smartly: For corporations considering crypto treasury, start small, understand the risks, and consult with experts in legal, accounting, and cybersecurity fields. The narrative around WLFI highlights a fascinating intersection of politics, finance, and technology. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, projects with unique value propositions and strong strategic backing will undoubtedly shape the future of corporate finance. Conclusion: A New Era for Corporate Treasury? The reported interest from public firms in the Trump-backed crypto project, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing institutional adoption of digital assets. With the WLFI token seemingly positioning itself as a viable corporate treasury asset , and the strategic alignment with figures like Michael Saylor , the project stands at the forefront of a potential paradigm shift. While challenges remain, particularly around regulation and market volatility, the discussions at the Permissionless conference confirm a growing appetite among traditional businesses to explore cryptocurrencies beyond speculative trading. As WLFI continues its journey, its progress will offer valuable insights into the future of corporate finance and the broader acceptance of digital currencies in mainstream economic activity.

2025-06-26T11:40:31,"Here’s what China’s RSA quantum computer breakthrough could mean for crypto security","A research team in China managed to successfully factor a 22‑bit RSA integer using a quantum computer, signifying a breakthrough in encryption decoding. What could it mean for crypto security? Using a quantum annealer from D‑Wave, a team of researchers at Shanghai University managed to factor a 22‑bit key using a novel method that translates the task into a form the quantum machine can handle, according to a report by Earth.com. RSA, which stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, is a public-key cryptosystem that is commonly used for secure data transmission. Systems that use the encryption system include online bank accounts, web browsers, email providers, messaging services, VPNs, and cloud services. Although 22-bit is still a small number compared to the larger 2,048‑bit keys or even 3072-bit used in real-world encryption, the breakthrough is significant because it proved that quantum computing can reach beyond the previous 19-bit record. By tweaking model parameters, the researchers raised success rates and showed how their approach could scale more bits in the future. This means that in the future, with more computational resources per bit, the unbreakable RSA could be decrypted. As a result, many institutions like NIST and the White House are already rolling out quantum-safe standards and urging agencies and companies to switch to post-quantum cryptography, warning of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. You might also like: Cisco Talos: New North Korean threat ‘PylangGhost’ targets crypto workers through fake job sites Does cryptocurrency use RSA encryption? Though RSA is widely used in many aspects of our digital systems, most modern cryptocurrencies do not use the encryption for signing transactions or wallet security. Instead, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) rely heavily on Elliptic Curve Cryptography or ECC, including Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ECDSA and the later model EdDSA in newer projects. Although this is the case, the crypto space does make use of the encryption model in other areas that are just as crucial to security. For instance, certain crypto exchanges, custody services and payment platforms may still use RSA encryption for SSL/TLS infrastructure. Additionally, some cold storage systems or older crypto projects and old wallets containing sensitive information may still rely on RSA for internal key storage or back-up encryption. The same applies for encrypted data archives and back-ups at crypto custodians or blockchain companies. You might also like: Chinese researchers claim 48-bit encryption cracked with quantum computing Why the RSA quantum breakthrough matters for ECC? Although the experiment applies to RSA, this does not mean that ECC is untouchable. Both RSA and ECC are vulnerable to quantum attacks via Shor’s algorithm. Shor’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently factor large numbers and solve discrete logarithm problems. The algorithm poses a significant threat to the security of many modern cryptographic systems. While this does not directly pose a threat to current more advanced crypto systems, it indicates that quantum progress not just a theoretical concept anymore. The deeper issue is that if quantum hardware can scale factoring algorithms, then the decryption of ECC is not far behind. A powerful enough quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could bypass ECC by forging blockchain transactions, breaking encrypted communication between wallets and nodes, as well as gain access to private keys from public BTC or ETH wallets. In the meantime, crypto projects should stay alert and prevent security breaches by performing audits on vulnerable areas such as TLS certificates, API encryption, VPNs and off-chain key management.

2025-06-26T11:30:37,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 74: Navigating the Market’s Bold Ascent","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 74: Navigating the Market’s Bold Ascent Are you feeling the buzz in the air? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular barometer for market sentiment, has recently climbed to a significant 74, firmly placing the cryptocurrency market in the ‘Greed’ zone. This eight-point jump from the previous day, as of June 26, signals a notable shift in investor psychology. But what does this rising tide of optimism truly mean for your investments, and how should you navigate these increasingly confident waters? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Pulse Check on Market Sentiment At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It’s a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 100, where: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are highly concerned, often leading to selling pressure. 25-49: Fear – Uncertainty and anxiety prevail, but not to extreme levels. 50-74: Greed – A growing sense of optimism and a willingness to buy. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over, often signaling a potential market top as assets become overvalued. Why is this index so crucial? Because emotions often drive investment decisions, especially in volatile markets like crypto. By aggregating various data points, the index attempts to give a more objective view of collective market sentiment , helping investors avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on emotion. What Does a Score of 74 in the ‘Greed’ Zone Imply for the Cryptocurrency Market? A score of 74 is a clear indicator that optimism is running high. Investors are feeling confident, and there’s a strong appetite for buying. While this might sound universally positive, seasoned crypto enthusiasts know that periods of ‘Greed’ can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reflects strong momentum and potential for further price appreciation as more capital flows into the cryptocurrency market . On the other hand, extreme greed can sometimes precede market corrections, as assets become overbought and ripe for profit-taking. Historically, legendary investors like Warren Buffett have advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” This contrarian approach suggests that times of widespread greed might be opportune moments for caution, perhaps even for trimming positions, rather than blindly chasing pumps. It’s about recognizing when the crowd might be getting ahead of itself. Dissecting the Drivers: The Six Pillars of the Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of six distinct factors, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall market sentiment. Understanding these components is key to grasping the index’s movements: 1. Volatility (25% Weighting) What it measures: This component analyzes the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. What it means for sentiment: High volatility often indicates a fearful market (big price drops) or an extremely greedy one (rapid pumps). Stable, lower volatility might suggest calm before a storm or a period of consolidation. 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25% Weighting) What it measures: It looks at the current trading volume and market momentum, comparing them with the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. What it means for sentiment: High buying volumes in a rising market indicate strong positive momentum and increasing greed. Conversely, high selling volumes suggest fear. 3. Social Media (15% Weighting) What it measures: This factor analyzes social media trends, specifically tracking hashtags and mentions related to cryptocurrencies, their volume, and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). What it means for sentiment: A surge in positive social media mentions, particularly on platforms like Twitter (X), often correlates with rising excitement and greed. It’s a direct gauge of the public’s chatter. 4. Surveys (15% Weighting – Currently Paused) What it measures: Historically, this component gathered data from weekly polls, asking thousands of people about their perception of the crypto market. What it means for sentiment: Although currently paused, surveys offer a direct insight into investor confidence. Their reintroduction could provide another valuable layer of sentiment data. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10% Weighting) What it measures: This refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. What it means for sentiment: A rising Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors flock to the perceived safety and stability of Bitcoin during uncertain times. A falling dominance, on the other hand, suggests that investors are moving into altcoins, which typically happens during periods of higher risk appetite and greed (often called ‘altcoin season’). 6. Google Trends (10% Weighting) What it measures: It analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. What it means for sentiment: A sudden increase in search terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” often signals fear, while a surge in general terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “crypto investment” can indicate growing public interest and potential greed. Here’s a quick overview of the index’s components: Factor Weighting Impact on Index (General) Volatility 25% High volatility can indicate fear or extreme greed. Market Momentum/Volume 25% High buying volume = Greed; High selling volume = Fear. Social Media 15% Positive sentiment = Greed; Negative sentiment = Fear. Surveys (Paused) 15% Direct investor opinion. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Rising dominance = Fear; Falling dominance = Greed (altcoin season). Google Trends 10% Search interest for buying = Greed; Panic searches = Fear. The Pivotal Role of Bitcoin in Shaping Market Sentiment It’s no secret that Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency market. Its price movements and overall health significantly influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Given its dominant market capitalization and its status as the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s performance often dictates the general mood of investors. When Bitcoin is rallying, optimism tends to spread across altcoins, pushing the index higher into the ‘Greed’ zone. Conversely, a sharp correction in Bitcoin’s price can quickly send the index plummeting into ‘Fear’ or ‘Extreme Fear’, as investors become risk-averse. This strong correlation highlights why keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s fundamentals and technical analysis, alongside the sentiment index, is crucial for any comprehensive investment strategy . A rising Bitcoin price, coupled with high social media engagement and trading volume, directly contributes to the current ‘Greed’ reading of 74. Crafting Your Investment Strategy in a ‘Greedy’ Market So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashing ‘Greed’, how should you adjust your investment strategy ? Here are some actionable insights: Exercise Caution: While it’s tempting to jump into a rising market, remember that ‘Greed’ often precedes corrections. Consider taking some profits if you’re holding significant gains, especially on assets that have seen parabolic increases. Rebalance Your Portfolio: Use this period to re-evaluate your portfolio. Are you over-allocated to risky assets? Perhaps it’s time to rebalance towards a more diversified mix, or even increase your stablecoin holdings. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): The higher the index, the stronger the FOMO. Don’t let emotional impulses drive your decisions. Stick to your pre-defined investment plan and risk tolerance. Research Thoroughly: Even in a bull market, not all projects are created equal. Use this time to research fundamentally strong projects that still have room to grow, rather than chasing speculative pumps. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your capital. If you’re entering new positions or holding existing ones, setting appropriate stop-loss orders can help mitigate potential losses if the market suddenly reverses. Look for Contrarian Opportunities: While most assets might be overvalued, there could still be gems that haven’t caught the market’s attention yet, or assets that are temporarily undervalued despite the overall optimism. Challenges and Limitations of Relying Solely on Sentiment While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to understand its limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects current sentiment, which is often a reaction to past price movements. It doesn’t predict the future with certainty. Not a Trading Signal: It should not be used as a standalone buy or sell signal. A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, nor does ‘Fear’ guarantee a bounce. Market Manipulation: Large institutional players or ‘whales’ can sometimes influence market sentiment, making the index less reliable for predicting short-term movements. Context is Key: The meaning of a particular score can vary depending on the broader macroeconomic environment, regulatory news, and technological advancements within the crypto space. Conclusion: Navigating the Emotional Rollercoaster with Prudence The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74 is a significant indicator of robust optimism within the cryptocurrency market. It reflects a period where confidence is high, and the appetite for digital assets, particularly Bitcoin , is strong. While this environment presents exciting opportunities, it also calls for heightened awareness and a disciplined investment strategy . By understanding the factors that drive this index and combining its insights with thorough fundamental and technical analysis, investors can make more informed decisions, mitigate risks, and potentially capitalize on the market’s emotional ebb and flow. Remember, true success in crypto often comes from maintaining a clear head when others are losing theirs.

2025-06-26T11:30:22,"Bitcoin Price Set for New All-Time High in Just 42 Days","The post Bitcoin Price Set for New All-Time High in Just 42 Days appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin Price is gaining momentum, now only 4% shy of its all-time high, as a wave of optimism sweeps through the crypto market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. attracted over $547 million in inflows on Wednesday, extending their winning streak to 12 consecutive days, a bullish signal backed by institutional demand. But it’s not just ETF data fueling the rally. Crypto Gets Major Boost from U.S. Housing Policy In a landmark move, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has instructed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to recognize crypto assets when evaluating mortgage eligibility. This unprecedented step toward mainstream crypto adoption is being hailed as a long-term bullish catalyst for the industry. Technical Setup Signals Bitcoin Breakout Technically, Bitcoin is showing a strong V-shaped recovery, with its price hovering near $107,383, a key resistance level. A breakout above this zone could flip the market structure and pave the way to a new all-time high (ATH). According to crypto analyst Ran Neuner, Bitcoin’s next ATH may arrive in just 42 days, driven by a steady upward climb rather than a sudden spike. He emphasizes that the recent global ceasefire has given financial markets the breathing room they needed, and Bitcoin is leading the charge. “The rally won’t be a single big green candle. It’s already happening gradually,” Neuner stated. Jerome Powell’s Testimony Fuels the Bull Case Another bullish driver? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent testimony. Powell noted that the Fed might have already begun rate cuts if not for inflation risks stemming from Trump’s proposed tariffs. Still, Powell confirmed that the Fed is on track for three interest rate cuts this year in July, September, and December. Lower rates often boost risk-on assets like Bitcoin, making this a critical green light for investors. Dollar Weakens, Wall Street Cheers Following Powell’s remarks, the U.S. dollar began to slide, another bullish signal for Bitcoin. Wall Street responded swiftly: the NASDAQ hit a new ATH, and the S&P 500 is on the verge of confirming a golden cross — a highly regarded bullish technical pattern. Interestingly, historical data shows that Bitcoin tends to hit a new ATH around 41 days after the S&P 500 does. That correlation is now catching the eye of analysts who view this as a signal that Bitcoin’s next major breakout is already in motion. Altcoin Season? Not So Fast While Bitcoin looks poised for liftoff, most altcoins may not follow — at least not right away.According to Neuner, the altcoin rally will be selective, favoring tokens backed by institutional interest. A full-blown altcoin season is unlikely unless Wall Street throws its weight behind specific projects. He teases that a curated list of these high-potential altcoins will be revealed soon.

Bitcoin’s rally is fueled by strong institutional demand, evidenced by $547M in U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, and recent U.S. housing policy recognizing crypto for mortgages. How will the new U.S. housing policy affect cryptocurrency adoption? The FHFA’s directive for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to recognize crypto as mortgage assets is a landmark move, expected to significantly boost mainstream crypto adoption and integrate it into traditional finance.

2025-06-26T11:30:00,"As $4 Billion In BTC And ETH Options Expire, Traders Look to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) For Fresh Gains","At the end of last week, over $4.1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options expired, which led to speculations of price swings. Amid this speculation, hostilities in the Middle East escalated, which put further pressure on the crypto market. Most of the value was in Bitcoin contracts, which accounted for $3.5 billion, while Ethereum options were worth around $565 billion. The put-to-call ratio for BTC was 1.0, which suggested a neutral stance; meanwhile, ETH had a ratio of 0.69, which suggests a rise in bullish expectations. Crypto markets remain in a cautious mood amid fears that conflict in the Middle East could escalate, causing global economic problems. Despite the challenges, BTC has recovered to over $100k after briefly falling below the level over the weekend. While all of this is going on, investors are looking for opportunities for growth elsewhere, and one of their best options so far has been the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. Based on the current performance of the presale, MUTM tokens could be one of the biggest gainers of 2025. There are various factors driving the current performance, which include the project’s focus on utility. Additionally, the protocol’s design that ensures continuous growth has been pivotal to helping drive up participation in the presale. Details OF The MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, over $11.2 million worth of tokens have been sold to around 12,450 buyers. In the upcoming phase of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The token price has attracted massive attention from the crypto market, which has led to 50% of the tokens set aside for phase sold less than a month after they went live. One of the main reasons for this fast pace is that tokens in the current phase are going for a 50% discount on the planned listing price of $0.06. Analysts are extremely confident about the future of MUTM tokens, and they forecast the price could go up by 31x when the tokens go live. Based on this massive upside forecast, a $1,700 purchase in the presale now could grow to over $52,000. Coupled with the massive discount available right now, this is one opportunity that you do not want to miss. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Design A major reason for the high interest in MUTM tokens is the design of the protocol. It is built as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their assets in exchange for an annual percentage yield (APY) that is dictated by the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool and take loans, the utilization rate rises, which thus increases the interest rate. The rising interest rate prompts borrowers to repay loans in the pool, which incentivizes more lenders to deposit liquidity in a pool to benefit from the higher yields. Over time, this will boost the total liquidity in the pool, which will ensure a stable ecosystem. At the same time, this design ensures that the protocol achieves optimal capital efficiency on its own. By offering a system where the market forces set the optimal market rates, it could attract more users, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the biggest DeFi ecosystems by user numbers. A good example of how this system works is when a user deposits $10,000 worth of USDT into a pool. If the APY rises to 17% due to high utilization, the depositor stands to make $1,700 a year. That is a massive income that requires no trading expertise or complex trading strategies. On top of that, users of the protocol enjoy massive protection in the form of overcollateralization. That simply means that borrowers must deposit collateral worth more than the value of the loan they plan to take. The overcollateralization level varies based on the exact type of asset they use as collateral. For more volatile assets, more conservative overcollateralization is required due to the possibility of a sudden market movement. The requirement creates a buffer in which liquidators can act to stabilize the ecosystem. When a loan position falls below the liquidation threshold, a liquidation event is triggered, allowing the liquidators to purchase the collateral at a discount. This discount ensures that liquidators have a monetary incentive to act for the benefit of the protocol’s health. It can be increased as needed to incentivize liquidators to act faster to protect the solvency of the ecosystem. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect entry point to position yourself for the upcoming altcoin rally. With a generous 50% discount on the MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale, this is the best opportunity you have to make life-changing returns in the crypto sector.

2025-06-26T11:20:33,"Tether CEO’s Bold Vision: 1 Trillion AI Agents to Revolutionize Crypto Settlements","BitcoinWorld Tether CEO’s Bold Vision: 1 Trillion AI Agents to Revolutionize Crypto Settlements Imagine a world where your refrigerator orders groceries, pays for them, and manages its own maintenance schedule – all autonomously, using cryptocurrency. Or perhaps, self-driving cars negotiating fuel prices and settling payments in real-time. This isn’t science fiction anymore; it’s the audacious future envisioned by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. During a recent appearance on The Block’s Big Brain podcast, Ardoino made a truly groundbreaking projection: within the next 15 years, one trillion AI agents will be leveraging stablecoins like USDT and decentralized assets like Bitcoin to execute seamless financial transactions and crypto settlements . This isn’t just about AI using crypto; it’s about each of these autonomous entities possessing its own digital wallet, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of finance and automation. Unpacking the Tether CEO’s Vision: A Trillion AI Agents in the Crypto Economy Paolo Ardoino, known for his forward-thinking perspective and leadership at the helm of the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, painted a vivid picture of an AI-driven financial ecosystem. His forecast isn’t merely speculative; it stems from the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and the growing utility of blockchain technology. The core of his prediction revolves around the sheer scale: one trillion distinct AI entities, each empowered with financial autonomy through its own crypto wallet. Scale of Adoption: One trillion AI agents is an astronomical number, suggesting a pervasive integration of AI into every facet of commerce and daily life. Financial Autonomy: Each AI agent would possess its own crypto wallet, implying direct control over funds for specific tasks, removing intermediaries and human intervention for routine transactions. Core Currencies: The focus on USDT and Bitcoin highlights their established roles. USDT for efficient, stable value transfer in high-volume micro-transactions, and Bitcoin as a robust, decentralized store of value and ultimate settlement layer. Time Horizon: The 15-year timeline suggests a relatively rapid evolution, pushing the boundaries of current technological development and regulatory frameworks. This vision suggests a paradigm shift from humans managing money to intelligent machines executing economic activity on our behalf, or even independently. The implications for efficiency, global trade, and the very nature of work are profound. How Will AI Agents Drive Crypto Settlements? The concept of AI agents conducting crypto settlements is not just about making payments; it’s about automating complex financial interactions that currently require significant human oversight and traditional banking infrastructure. Consider the following potential applications: Micro-transactions and Automated Services AI agents could facilitate ultra-small, high-frequency transactions for services that are currently impractical or too costly to process via traditional means. Think of an AI negotiating real-time energy prices for a smart home, or paying for fractional access to data sets in a decentralized marketplace. USDT, with its stability and low transaction fees, would be ideal for these scenarios. Supply Chain Optimization Imagine AI agents managing every step of a supply chain, from ordering raw materials and paying suppliers upon delivery verification (using smart contracts), to tracking inventory and settling freight costs. This would bring unprecedented transparency and efficiency, with Bitcoin potentially serving as a reserve asset or a final settlement layer for larger, inter-company transactions. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and AI AI agents could become integral components of DAOs, executing governance decisions, managing treasuries, and even initiating proposals based on predefined parameters. Their crypto wallets would allow them to directly interact with the DAO’s smart contracts and financial resources. Content Creation and Monetization AI agents generating creative content (articles, music, art) could autonomously license their work and receive payments directly into their wallets, managing royalties and distribution without human intermediaries. Here’s a simplified look at how AI agents might interact with crypto: AI Agent Function Crypto Application Primary Crypto Used Smart Home Energy Management Automated utility payments based on real-time usage USDT Supply Chain Logistics Automated payments to suppliers upon delivery verification USDT, Bitcoin Data Marketplace Agent Buying/selling data sets in fractional amounts USDT Autonomous Trading Bot Executing trades and managing portfolio Bitcoin, various altcoins The Pivotal Role of USDT and Bitcoin in AI’s Financial Future Ardoino’s specific mention of USDT and Bitcoin is not arbitrary. These two cryptocurrencies represent fundamental pillars of the digital asset space, each offering distinct advantages crucial for an AI-driven economy. Why USDT for AI Transactions? Tether’s USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. Its stability is paramount for AI agents needing to conduct predictable transactions without worrying about price volatility. Furthermore, USDT’s widespread adoption across numerous blockchains (Ethereum, Tron, Solana, etc.) ensures liquidity and accessibility. For micro-transactions, automated payments, and high-frequency trading, USDT offers: Price Stability: Essential for consistent value transfer, allowing AI agents to budget and execute transactions without the risk of sudden asset devaluation. Speed and Efficiency: Transactions on various blockchains are often faster and cheaper than traditional banking rails, enabling real-time settlements. Programmability: As a token on smart contract platforms, USDT can be integrated into complex automated agreements. Why Bitcoin for AI’s Long-Term Value? While USDT handles the day-to-day transactional needs, Bitcoin serves a different, yet equally critical, role. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, scarcity, and robust security make it a premier store of value. For AI agents, Bitcoin could function as: A Digital Reserve: AI agents or the systems they operate within could hold Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset, similar to how nations hold gold. Ultimate Settlement Layer: For larger, less frequent, or more critical inter-AI or AI-to-human settlements, Bitcoin’s finality and security provide unparalleled assurance. Censorship Resistance: In a world increasingly reliant on AI, the ability to transact without fear of central control or censorship becomes vital, a core tenet of Bitcoin. The combination of a stable transactional currency (USDT) and a secure, decentralized store of value (Bitcoin) creates a robust financial backbone for an AI-powered future. Navigating the Challenges of an AI-Powered Crypto Landscape While Ardoino’s vision is inspiring, the path to a trillion AI agents with crypto wallets is fraught with significant challenges. Addressing these will be crucial for successful implementation: 1. Scalability: Can Blockchains Handle the Load? A trillion AI agents would generate an unimaginable volume of transactions. Current blockchain technologies, even with advancements like layer-2 solutions, face hurdles in processing such a massive throughput without congestion or exorbitant fees. New scaling solutions, sharding, or entirely new blockchain architectures might be necessary. 2. Security: Protecting AI Wallets from Malice Each AI agent having its own wallet presents a massive attack surface. How will these wallets be secured against hacking, malicious AI takeovers, or sophisticated phishing attempts? The integrity and security of the underlying AI systems and their interaction with blockchain protocols will be paramount. 3. Regulation and Governance: Who is Accountable? The legal and ethical implications of autonomous AI agents conducting financial transactions are immense. Who is liable if an AI agent makes a costly error or engages in illicit activities? Establishing clear regulatory frameworks, accountability models, and international cooperation will be essential to prevent chaos and foster trust. 4. Interoperability: Bridging Diverse AI and Blockchain Systems AI agents will likely operate on different platforms and interact with various blockchains. Ensuring seamless communication and transaction capabilities across these diverse ecosystems will require robust interoperability standards and protocols. 5. Ethical Considerations: Control and Autonomy As AI agents gain more financial autonomy, questions about human control, decision-making biases, and the potential for unintended consequences will become critical. Designing ethical AI and ensuring safeguards against runaway financial autonomy will be a societal imperative. Preparing for the Future: Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For individuals, developers, and businesses in the cryptocurrency space, Ardoino’s projection isn’t just a fascinating thought experiment; it’s a call to action. The next 15 years could redefine the digital economy, and being prepared is key. For Developers and Innovators: Focus on building highly scalable, secure, and interoperable blockchain solutions. Research into AI-blockchain integration, autonomous agent programming, and novel consensus mechanisms will be invaluable. For Businesses: Begin exploring how AI can automate existing financial processes using crypto. Consider pilot programs for micro-payments, supply chain tracking, or automated data exchange. Understanding stablecoins like USDT and the foundational role of Bitcoin will be critical. For Regulators and Policymakers: Proactive engagement with AI and blockchain experts is essential. Developing adaptive and forward-looking regulatory frameworks that foster innovation while mitigating risks will be crucial. For Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors: Stay informed about the convergence of AI and blockchain. Understanding the underlying technologies and the potential for new use cases will be vital for navigating the evolving market. The convergence of AI and blockchain is not a distant dream but a rapidly approaching reality. Ardoino’s vision highlights the immense potential for efficiency, automation, and global financial inclusion that this synergy can unlock. Paolo Ardoino’s bold prediction of one trillion AI agents settling trades with USDT and Bitcoin within 15 years paints a truly revolutionary picture of our financial future. This vision, while ambitious, underscores the transformative power of decentralized finance and artificial intelligence. The seamless integration of AI autonomy with the immutable and efficient nature of blockchain promises an era of unprecedented automation and efficiency in global commerce. While challenges related to scalability, security, and regulation remain, the potential benefits for efficiency, transparency, and innovation are immense.

2025-06-26T11:00:56,"Pro-XRP Lawyer Reacts to This Bullish CoinDesk’s XRP Report","XRP is once again making headlines—this time for all the right reasons. In a recent report, CoinDesk highlighted a bullish technical pattern forming on XRP’s chart, one that closely resembles the setup seen in Bitcoin before its massive rally to $100,000. According to the report, XRP has shown remarkable strength, maintaining a tight range between $2.00 and $2.60, despite broader market volatility. Many traders believe this stabilization is a possible sign of an impending major breakout. Reacting to this development, pro-XRP attorney John Deaton took to X to comment on the shift in media sentiment. “Is it me, or has the coverage of XRP significantly changed from 3 years ago?” Deaton wrote, noting what appears to be a growing willingness among major crypto outlets to recognize XRP’s evolving role in the digital asset space. Is it me or has the coverage of XRP significantly changed from 3 years ago? https://t.co/WZt0TmRHeB — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 26, 2025 CoinDesk Signals a Turning Point CoinDesk’s technical analysis draws attention to the current strength in XRP’s price action. While many altcoins have struggled to hold support, XRP has remained firm, resisting downward pressure and flashing signs of accumulation. Analysts believe the current consolidation above $2.00 is a bullish signal, particularly as volume builds and volatility narrows—conditions that often precede sharp upward moves. This setup is being compared to Bitcoin’s price behavior in earlier cycles, particularly before its surge to new all-time highs. According to the report, if momentum continues to build, XRP could soon attempt a breakout above $2.60, potentially targeting the $3.00 to $3.50 range, levels last seen during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. XRP Price Update: Holding Firm at $2.35 As of reporting, XRP is trading at approximately $2.35, showing resilience amid a mixed crypto market. Data from CoinMarketCap and TradingView confirm that XRP has spent the last several weeks in a tight consolidation range, with strong support at $2.00 and resistance near $2.60. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On-chain indicators further support the bullish case. Exchange reserves for XRP, particularly on Binance have declined, suggesting reduced selling pressure. At the same time, large wallet addresses have steadily accumulated, signaling growing confidence from long-term holders and possibly institutions. Deaton’s Insight: A Shift in Media Tone John Deaton’s comment reflects a broader trend: the changing perception of XRP in the crypto community. Once viewed with skepticism, especially during the height of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC—XRP is now gaining renewed attention and respect. Deaton, who played a prominent role defending XRP holders in court, has frequently criticized what he saw as unfair media bias. His latest remark points to a more balanced narrative taking shape. With Ripple expanding globally, launching its RLUSD stablecoin, and pushing major updates to the XRP Ledger, the ecosystem around XRP continues to strengthen. Combined with increasingly bullish technical signals and a notable shift in sentiment, XRP may be entering a pivotal new chapter—one that even the skeptics are beginning to acknowledge.

2025-06-26T11:00:33,"Here’s How BlockDAG’s Fair Launch Model Revives the Bitcoin Spirit in 2025","In a market where early access and private deals often dominate, BlockDAG is doing something different. Its presale model is gaining attention not for added features, but for what it avoids. No VC involvement. No pre-mined coins. No discounts for insiders. For many, it’s the closest the industry has come to a fair launch since Bitcoin. This isn’t just a marketing angle. BlockDAG’s setup, including its infrastructure deployment and community-led approach, presents a very different picture from today’s typical Layer-1 launches. At a time when decentralisation is often more of a buzzword, BlockDAG is taking it seriously. Skipping VC Backing for a Community-Centred Launch Many top Layer-1 networks, like Solana, Aptos, and Avalanche, started with large VC support. While this helped them scale, it also created risks like concentrated supply and central control. These early backers often got steep discounts and influence over decision-making. BlockDAG chose a different route. The team confirmed that no VC money has been accepted. Every BDAG purchase has come from the public sale. No private deals, no early pricing advantages, and no hidden stakeholders. This design avoids the usual friction between early buyers and the broader community, giving the network space to grow with less pressure from early sell-offs. A Presale Without Pre-Mining or Insider Holdings Pre-mining has long been debated in crypto. Ethereum created about 72 million ETH in its early days. Solana’s launch heavily favoured early participants. Newer players like zkSync and Starknet have also drawn criticism for favouring insiders. BlockDAG’s approach looks very different. There was no pre-mine. All BDAG in circulation today comes from the public presale, which includes over 23.3 billion BDAG sold and $323 million raised. This equal footing matters. Those buying now are entering on the same terms as everyone else. No one has a secret head start from a two-year-old private sale. That level of openness is rare in today’s crypto market. User Participation & Infrastructure Before Price Action BlockDAG’s design goes beyond fair distribution. Its governance and network rollout reflect a launch model focused on the community. Here’s what that looks like: 2M+ users are already active on the X1 Miner app, using a Proof-of-Engagement system that makes participation simple and device-free. 18,000+ ASIC miners have been sold, spreading mining power across individuals and businesses. Validator nodes and mining pools will be run by the community before trading begins, helping build true decentralisation. There’s no centralised treasury or hidden team allocation. Instead, BlockDAG is leaning into an open network design, where users shape the protocol from day one. Raising Funds Without Giving Up Control Critics often say fair launches slow progress. But BlockDAG shows that strong community support can deliver results. With $323 million raised (halfway to its $600 million goal), it ranks among the top presales in crypto history, and it did this without institutional funding. And that funding is already working. The testnet is active. A low-code dApp builder is live. Developer grants are being distributed. The roadmap is in motion, and the mainnet is set to go live four weeks before listing. This progress proves that community-first projects can still move fast and scale, without compromising their values. A Return to Fundamentals That Could Redefine Launch Standards Bitcoin is still seen as the model for decentralisation, partly because it launched without early allocations or private deals. Many projects since then have chosen speed and capital over fairness. BlockDAG is going back to basics. It’s building a network that processes transactions like Kaspa, supports smart contracts like Ethereum, and decentralises like Bitcoin. And it’s doing this without the early-stage shortcuts most projects rely on. Whether BDAG reaches $1 or $4 as some predict, the bigger story may be the example it sets. In today’s market, where users demand more transparency, fairness isn’t just ethical; it could be a long-term advantage.

2025-06-26T11:00:25,"AI Copyright Law: Crucial Victory for Meta AI Models in Fair Use Battle","BitcoinWorld AI Copyright Law: Crucial Victory for Meta AI Models in Fair Use Battle In a significant development for the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and intellectual property, a federal judge recently delivered a pivotal ruling in favor of Meta. This decision, concerning the use of copyrighted books for training Meta AI Models , marks a crucial moment for the technology sector, offering a glimpse into how courts are interpreting AI Copyright Law in the digital age. For anyone tracking the intersection of technology, content creation, and legal precedent, this case sets an important tone for future innovation and content protection. Understanding the Fair Use Doctrine in AI Training At the heart of Meta’s recent legal triumph is the concept of ‘fair use.’ A federal judge, Vince Chhabria, granted a summary judgment in favor of Meta in a lawsuit initiated by 13 authors, including Sarah Silverman. The authors alleged that Meta illegally trained its AI models using their copyrighted works. However, Judge Chhabria determined that Meta’s actions in this specific case fell under the Fair Use Doctrine of copyright law, thereby making it legal. This decision aligns with a similar ruling just days prior, where a federal judge sided with Anthropic in a comparable lawsuit. These rulings collectively signal a favorable turn for the tech industry, which has long argued that training AI models on copyrighted materials constitutes fair use. The core argument often revolves around whether the AI’s use of the material is ‘transformative’—meaning it doesn’t merely reproduce the original work but uses it to create something new, like an AI model capable of generating original content. What Does This Mean for Meta AI Models and Beyond? While celebrated by tech giants, these judicial decisions are not without their caveats. Both judges emphasized the limited scope of their rulings. Judge Chhabria explicitly stated that his decision does not universally validate all AI model training on copyrighted works. Instead, he noted that the plaintiffs in the Meta case ‘made the wrong arguments’ and failed to provide sufficient evidence regarding the market effects of Meta’s use. The judge highlighted that in future cases, especially those with better-developed records on the market impact of AI’s use of copyrighted material, plaintiffs might often prevail. This nuance is critical for understanding the ongoing legal battles. For Meta AI Models , this means their specific training methodology for books was deemed fair use, but the door remains open for challenges based on different types of content or stronger evidence of market harm. Navigating AI Training Data and Legal Boundaries A key factor in the fair use determination is whether the copying of copyrighted works harms the market for those authors. In Meta’s case, the plaintiffs ‘presented no meaningful evidence on market dilution at all,’ according to Judge Chhabria. This highlights the importance of demonstrating direct economic harm or market displacement caused by AI training. Without such evidence, establishing a copyright violation becomes significantly more challenging. The outcomes for both Anthropic and Meta involved training AI models on books. However, the legal landscape is far from settled, particularly concerning other forms of AI Training Data . There are numerous active lawsuits targeting technology companies for using different types of copyrighted works: The New York Times vs. OpenAI and Microsoft: This lawsuit concerns the training of AI models on news articles. Disney and Universal vs. Midjourney: These media powerhouses are suing over the training of AI models on films. Judge Chhabria’s decision acknowledges that fair use defenses are highly case-specific, and the strength of these arguments can vary significantly across industries. He noted that ‘markets for certain types of works (like news articles) might be even more vulnerable to indirect competition from AI outputs.’ This suggests that while books might have a higher bar for proving market harm from AI training, other content forms like news articles or films could present stronger cases for copyright holders. The Broader Implications for Tech Industry Lawsuits These recent rulings provide a significant, albeit narrow, victory for the tech industry. They affirm that simply training an AI model on copyrighted content does not automatically constitute infringement, especially if the use is deemed transformative and no clear market harm is demonstrated. This could encourage continued innovation in AI development without the immediate threat of sweeping legal injunctions based solely on data acquisition. However, the judges’ cautionary remarks underscore that these are not blanket permissions. Future Tech Industry Lawsuits will likely focus more intently on the ‘market effects’ criterion of fair use, and the specific nature of the copyrighted material. Companies developing AI must remain vigilant, understanding that the legal precedents are still being forged, and what is fair use for one type of data or model may not be for another.

Boston, MA | July 15 REGISTER NOW The Evolving Landscape of AI Copyright Law The recent court decisions involving Meta and Anthropic represent significant milestones in the ongoing debate over AI Copyright Law . They provide a degree of clarity for tech companies engaging in AI model training, particularly concerning literary works. However, they also serve as a stark reminder that each case will be judged on its specific merits, with the ‘transformative’ nature of the use and the ‘market impact’ being paramount considerations. As AI capabilities expand and integrate deeper into various industries, the legal battles over intellectual property will undoubtedly intensify. These rulings do not provide a definitive answer for all AI training scenarios but rather lay down markers for how future cases might be argued. The balance between fostering AI innovation and protecting creators’ rights remains a complex challenge that courts, policymakers, and the industry will continue to navigate.

2025-06-26T10:37:50,"Building Trust With U.S. Regulators Is Essential For Advancing Crypto Adoption","After being considered the Wild Wild West for years, crypto adoption in the United States is quickly gaining traction. Most notably, institutions are flooding into the crypto space due to the rise of tokenized treasuries and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization . The current market capitalization of tokenized US treasuries stands at a whopping $7.4 billion . A number of US states are also looking at implementing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) . This would allow states to hold Bitcoin ( BTC ) as part of their investment strategy. Both Texas and New Hampshire have recently signed a bill to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets . Congratulations to those who worked really hard on educating #txlege @TXGOPCaucus and all the stakeholders required to get this bill across the finish line Big shoutout to @lee_bratcher @TXblockchain_ for launching what I like to call 'The 2nd Reserve in Texas' tbt… https://t.co/yDdHWop1rj — ₿IGRYANPARK (@BigRyanPark) June 24, 2025 Moreover, the regulatory landscape in the US is finally becoming crypto-friendly. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently clarified that protocol staking is not a securities transaction under US law when performed under certain conditions. Policies implemented under the Trump administration have further accelerated the institutionalization of cryptocurrencies. The repeal of The Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 has enabled traditional financial institutions to offer custodial services for digital assets. Citibank is actively exploring adding crypto custody, while JPMorgan Chase plans to offer crypto investments to its clients through a third-party custodian. Crypto Companies Work With Regulators Although the crypto sector continues to make strides, industry experts believe that none of this would be possible without working with policymakers and regulators. Margaret Rosenfeld, chief legal officer at Everstake, told Cryptonews that working with US regulators has become essential for cryptocurrency companies. “Effective crypto regulation depends on more than legal theory, as it requires a deep understanding of the underlying technology,” Rosenfeld said. “Without that technical fluency, there’s a risk of applying legacy financial frameworks to decentralized systems in ways that don’t fit and ultimately hinder innovation.” Rosenfeld explained that the decentralized staking provider, Everstake, helped to educate the SEC on staking. She noted that this influenced the SEC’s decision to clarify that protocol staking is not a security. “At Everstake, we didn’t just send lawyers into the SEC – we brought engineers and operators to the table. We explained the technical structure of staking, validator responsibilities, and how non-custodial delegation works. That kind of technical fluency is critical for good policy. Without it, regulators are left applying legacy frameworks to new infrastructure in ways that can miss the mark,” Rosenfeld commented. Rosenfeld noted that providing both legal and technical insight can help regulators gain a clearer understanding of what they are evaluating. “Soon after our meeting, the SEC issued guidance acknowledging for the first time that some staking models – like those we operate – fall outside the scope of securities regulation. It was a meaningful step forward and a real example of how collaborative, technically informed engagement can shape better policy,” she said. Blockchain Advocacy Groups Educate Policymakers Blockchain advocacy groups also work closely with US policymakers to ensure that legislation is passed to push forward with crypto adoption in the country. Most recently, the Texas Blockchain Council helped push for the passing of the Texas SBR. Lee Bratcher, founder and president of the Texas Blockchain Council, told Cryptonews that the Texas Blockchain Council worked with legislative champions, policy advisors, and industry stakeholders to ensure that Senate Bill 21 (SB21) was not only technically sound, but also politically feasible. “The groundwork we’ve laid over the past few years helped pave the way for this breakthrough,” Bratcher said. “Our success was rooted in years of building trust with lawmakers, demystifying Bitcoin, and linking it to core values like fiscal conservatism, sovereignty, and energy innovation.” Texas Governor ⁦ @GregAbbott_TX ⁩ just signed the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill! The future of finance is digital and the future of capital formation is in Texas!! pic.twitter.com/jhgLxKTLTK — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) June 22, 2025 Bratcher further remarked that US states should not only tailor their messaging to local political and economic contexts, but also to core ideas. In this case, Bratcher pointed out that the Texas Blockchain Council educated policymakers on how Bitcoin can serve as a modern reserve asset, which he believes is gaining bipartisan traction. “Given the bi-partisan support for this bill, Texas Governor Abbott determined that it would go into effect immediately rather than the typically September 1st effective date,” Bratcher said. Texas Senator Charles Schwertner also partnered with the Texas Blockchain Council to pass SB21. Chairman Schwertner told Cryptonews that Texas is currently the only state with a direct $10 million appropriation for acquiring Bitcoin. He added that working with the Texas Blockchain Council enabled him to learn how a SBR allows Texas to diversify its investment approach . The Texas Blockchain Council further anticipates that the Texas Comptroller’s Office and the Texas Treasury Safekeeping and Trust Company will begin developing a prudent Bitcoin acquisition and custody strategy. Major US Crypto Exchange Builds Trust With Lawmakers To Boost Crypto Adoption US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also regularly dedicates time to educate policymakers. In February the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase , ending a contentious years-long legal battle. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has since submitted a number of documents and requests to drive mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency in the US. For example, the Coinbase website shows that on May 30 the exchange submitted a request to urge the US Treasury to exclude unrealized crypto gains and losses from the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT). CAMT imposes a 15% minimum tax on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of large corporations for taxable years. In addition to focusing on US policies, Coinbase recently secured a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. This enables the exchange to offer crypto products across European Union countries and will likely result in further influence on EU crypto regulations. Challenges To Consider Before Crypto Adoption While it’s notable that crypto companies and advocacy groups are helping shape US regulations, a number of challenges remain. For instance, Rosenfeld pointed out that one of the biggest challenges is the technical complexity of blockchain infrastructure. “When regulators lack technical fluency in how protocols work, it’s easy for overly broad or misapplied rules to take hold – sometimes unintentionally stifling innovation,” she said. In order to overcome this, Rosenfeld believes that crypto entities need more dialogue that includes not just lawyers and lobbyists, but also engineers and protocol builders. “Regulators are now willing to listen when industry participants take the time to explain the underlying mechanics. That’s the path forward: collaboration built on mutual education and transparency,” she stated.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As BTC breaks $105k and altcoins follow, some investors are turning away from high-risk trading in favor of passive income through cloud mining platforms like APT Miner. Table of Contents From ‘high-frequency trading’ to ‘stable holding’ Why are more and more users choosing APT Miner? The market is moving, but traders don’t have to follow the trend The strong rise of Bitcoin has once again ignited the enthusiasm of the entire crypto market. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke through the $105,000 mark, an increase of about 4%. Following closely, there was a collective outbreak of altcoins and meme coins, with Ethereum ( ETH ) rising 8%, Sei soaring 43%, and popular projects such as SUI, LINK, and Solana also delivering double-digit gains. This market recovery led by Bitcoin is rapidly spreading to the wider field of crypto assets. But at the same time, the sharp fluctuations in the market have also made many investors rethink a question: Is frequent chasing of rising and falling prices really suitable for everyone? From ‘high-frequency trading’ to ‘stable holding’ Many investors who once held large positions in mainstream currencies such as XRP and Bitcoin have now chosen another more stable path: cloud mining. They are not giving up the market, but building a more certain passive income system through cloud mining platforms such as APT Miner.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out.

Early in the month, LINK began recovering from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a key neckline at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has struggled to sustain its position near this neckline, pulling back toward the support level of the rounded bottom by the third week of June. This rounded bottom support also aligns with the LINK crypto’s multi-year support zone near $11. The LINK price is rising in the week of June 4th and is near a key hurdle near $13.3. If flipped successfully, then it will aim to retest the pattern’s neckline at $18 in June or July. The continuation of this price advance in the long term would require a break and a daily close above the $18 neckline. As this could indicate a potential upward move, with LINK odds to increase for a retest of the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4, an area supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. Should LINK break past the $24 mark, forecasts for late 2025 suggest the token could climb as high as $32.

2025-06-26T10:29:33,"Metaplanet tops Tesla in Bitcoin holdings","Japan-based Metaplanet has officially surpassed Tesla in corporate Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, marking a major milestone in its ambitious journey to become a dominant force in institutional crypto investment. The Tokyo-listed company, once known for hotel management, has fully pivoted into a Bitcoin-first strategy, outpacing legacy players and pushing itself into the global spotlight. On June 26, Metaplanet announced a record-breaking purchase of 1,234 BTC, valued at approximately $132.7 million, which increased its total holdings to 12,345 BTC. Metaplanet Inc. @Metaplanet_JP · Follow *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,234 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 12,345 BTC* 8:32 am · 26 Jun 2025 1.1K Reply Copy link Read 64 replies This latest acquisition has not only placed Metaplanet ahead of Tesla, which holds 11,509 BTC, but also positioned it as the seventh-largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. The latest purchase has changed the game The average purchase price for the 1,234 BTC was about 15.6 million Japanese yen, or roughly $107,557 per coin, aligning with recent market prices and reinforcing Metaplanet’s aggressive buying strategy. Following this move, the firm’s cumulative Bitcoin (BTC) investment now totals around $1.2 billion, with its holdings valued at over $1.33 billion, leaving the company with an unrealised profit of $110 million. Notably, the latest purchase marked Metaplanet’s fourth BTC acquisition in June alone and was its largest since it adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy in April 2024. CEO Simon Gerovich confirmed the move via social media, calling it a strategic leap that edges the firm closer to top-tier Bitcoin holders such as CleanSpark and Galaxy Digital. With just a modest addition of 1,000 BTC, Metaplanet could leap into the fifth position globally, surpassing both CleanSpark and Galaxy Digital. Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin goals Metaplanet’s recent acquisition follows the announcement of a ¥74.9 billion equity offering, led by institutional partner EVO FUND, a deal that represents the largest single-day capital raise for Bitcoin purchases by a public company.

The plan includes key milestones: 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 100,000 BTC by 2026, eventually targeting 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. To support this, the company recently approved a $5 billion capital injection into its US subsidiary, Metaplanet Treasury Corp., signalling its intent to scale internationally. Metaplanet shares rise as Bitcoin yield surges Despite some market hesitation, Metaplanet’s stock has shown remarkable performance, rallying 322% year-to-date and over 350% since its pivot to a Bitcoin-focused strategy. However, following the announcement of its latest BTC purchase, shares dipped 5% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, closing at 1,509 yen and extending a week-long slide. Analysts believe the temporary pullback is a response to short-term dilution fears, even as the firm’s long-term outlook remains bullish due to its rising Bitcoin yield. Quarter-to-date, Metaplanet has recorded a BTC yield of 112.2%, and year-to-date returns have soared to 315%, signalling robust performance from its crypto treasury. Across the globe, firms like Nakamoto Holdings, Parataxis, and K33 are increasing BTC exposure, and Metaplanet is emerging as the leader among this new wave of Bitcoin treasuries. By overtaking Tesla and approaching top players like Riot Platforms, the firm is solidifying its reputation as “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” with a clearly defined roadmap to becoming one of the world’s most influential Bitcoin holders.

2025-06-26T10:25:05,"Coinbase: The Time To Be Really Greedy Has Passed (Rating Downgrade)","Summary Q1 financials show solid revenue growth and a promising services trajectory, especially as stablecoins gain traction. Profitability is closely tied to Bitcoin's performance; rising BTC prices directly benefit the business. Valuation metrics like P/S and P/E suggest fair value to overvaluation while technicals are overbought. While strong opportunities remain, the stock is now a hold; it will be a buy if it drops 20%+. Introduction Coinbase Global Inc. ( COIN ) is a stock that I have been covering very frequently since I've started contributing to Seeking Alpha in March 2025. Here is the link to my previous two coverages which I suggest reading first. On April 10, I rated COIN a Strong Buy, in what was an article of great conviction. My main thesis was (and still remains) that they would severely underperform in Q1 2025 (which they did) but excel in remaining 2025 quarters, especially further towards year-end, aligning with cryptocurrency price cycles. On May 12, I reiterated my bullishness but downgraded to buy, as a result of higher valuations and weaker technicals. The returns after these two pieces stand at 111%, respective 73%. Data by YCharts Today, I will revisit Coinbase and outline my case for why I think it has become a Hold. Spoiler alert: In addition to having already reached my price target of $330, this is due to a much higher valuation and less favorable technicals again. Developments We remember Q1 2025 financials , which saw revenues of $2B and net income of $66M. Adjusted EBITDA was $930M and just slightly down YoY. Services continue to make up a larger share of COIN's revenues as QoQ, this share grew from 28% to 36%. The growth trajectory of services is truly significant for Coinbase as it both diversifies their revenue streams and makes them more predictable, a feature Coinbase has clearly lacked before (but I would argue they still do). Overall, analysts on Seeking Alpha seem to get super excited about the service revenue growth and rate Coinbase a Buy mostly based on them. Personally, I believe that service revenue growth will not stick at current rates in a crypto bear market whatsoever and might actually slightly decline (which would still be good as it offers a buffer of predictable revenue). Further, projected rate cuts would also be detrimental to the stablecoin part of their business, earning revenue from interest. The recently passed GENIUS bill does limit my stance somewhat, as it brings clear regulatory approval to stablecoins like USDC - of which Coinbase is a key stakeholder. Coinbase earns 100% of interest income from USDC held on their platform and 50% of all other interest income. With many companies now focusing on stablecoins, USDC seems like a good choice and should see further adoption, benefiting Coinbase. For now, Coinbase is only lavishly profitable when Bitcoin prices rise, and they can report high net income due to a combination of higher transaction revenues and holdings gains. Cycle theory suggests Bitcoin price gains may come to an end in early 2026. COIN will have to prove that they can withstand such a period. At the same time, they are valued at high multiples (I will get to them in a second) which makes them much more susceptible to multiple compression, a scenario likely to occur in a crypto bear market, or an intensified global trade war , or an actual global war . These are key risks to every stock, which I get, but trading at extended valuations does make Coinbase more sensitive for such scenarios. When it comes to this year, I do see a breakout of recent Bitcoin ATHs, with a price target of $150k. I derived this price target from working through the Bitwise Bitcoin Investment Thesis paper, published in Spring 2024, which I suggest readers to go through as well. The Bitcoin halving reduces the supply which necessitates the price to move up in order to create an equilibrium. Their model saw $103k as a price target for year-end 2024. This was super close to the $108k reached mid-December and even slightly conservative. For late 2025, they estimate $172k, making my price target achievable. Valuation At a 13.5X P/S ratio, COIN's valuation has shot up drastically. Their P/E ratio of 65X also looks very stretched. For me, these levels are still not extended too much as I expect Coinbase to grow their revenues and most importantly profits significantly into year-end 2025, which will make these levels drop substantially. Still, they are much higher than in both my previous coverages, which increases the risk associated with investing in Coinbase. Data by YCharts Personally, I also find it useful to check COIN's valuation compared to Bitcoin as they are very closely correlated. In my last analysis, Coinbase was trading below Bitcoin on the one-year chart, but now it shot above it again, which might be an indication that most of the short-term appreciation has been achieved already. Data by YCharts On the weekly COIN chart, the high green bar in the MACD cannot be missed. Also, price just skyrocketed through the upper ends of the Bollinger Bands, which has led to pullbacks every single time for the last two years. TradingView Monthly RSI is at a key resistance as well, sitting at 64. These were the same levels this bull market has seen twice, shortly before going into correction mode. TradingView Daily RSI as well as distance from the 200-day MA both look very stretched. Historically, these have also led to pullbacks. TradingView $4.5B of net income in 2025 (or on a TTM basis after Q3 2024) could be doable when crypto bull markets continue. The market has to be unaware of a cyclical top that is being built up. In that case, Coinbase could be trading at a 25X P/E ratio, which would bring the market cap to $112.5B, a gain of 29% from today. So why am I not rating the stock a Buy when it could return almost 30% in 6 months? Well, first, this is an optimistic scenario and second, the perceived risk has gone up a lot. As of my previous coverage, there have been much better risk/reward opportunities to buy Coinbase. But due to the upside potential it is still a Hold with the chance to become a Buy again, if an expected pullback of 20+% manifests. This would increase investors' margin of safety, as one can use more conservative assumptions at those prices for the same upside potential (say just $4B in net income at a 22.5X P/E = 25% implied upside potential after a 20% drop in price) Conclusion Strong opportunities do remain for Coinbase, particularly amid crypto bull market continuation and now stablecoin adoption. However, valuation has expanded substantially, which I anticipated but do not want to keep betting on at these levels. Technical indicators also suggest the stock could use a short-term breather. To be clear, I am not calling for a crash or suggesting Coinbase is necessarily a bad investment. I simply prefer a cheaper price to maintain a healthy uptrend and reenter after having sold 20% of my position on this spike. I may have been slightly too conservative on COIN, but that is not an issue given I still hold shares bought at attractive entry points. All in all, while it is not the worst buy today, it's also not the best anymore. Hold . A 20+% pullback might change my opinion which I would give an update to (either in the comments or in the form of a new article given there are enough updates until then.)",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797394-coinbase-the-time-to-be-really-greedy-has-passed-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","COIN",cryptocompare

2025-06-26T10:20:27,"Crypto ETF: Unlocking the Future – SEC Commissioner Hints at Physical Redemptions","BitcoinWorld Crypto ETF: Unlocking the Future – SEC Commissioner Hints at Physical Redemptions The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and few topics generate as much buzz as the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. For years, the crypto community has yearned for more seamless and efficient ways to interact with digital assets through regulated financial products. A recent statement from a prominent figure at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reignited hope, suggesting a pivotal shift on the horizon. Imagine a future where your Crypto ETF could offer more than just cash settlements – a future where physical redemptions become a reality. This seemingly small technical detail could unlock significant benefits for investors and the broader market. Why Are Physical Redemptions a Game-Changer for Crypto ETFs? For many, the term ‘physical redemptions’ might sound like financial jargon, but its implications for cryptocurrency ETFs are profound. Currently, most approved Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the U.S. operate on a ‘cash-create/redeem’ model. This means that when an authorized participant (AP) wants to redeem ETF shares, they receive cash equivalent to the underlying asset’s value, not the asset itself (Bitcoin, in this case). This process often requires the AP to sell Bitcoin on the open market to fulfill the cash redemption, potentially adding selling pressure. Physical redemptions , on the other hand, would allow ETF holders (or their authorized participants) to directly receive the underlying cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) when they redeem their ETF shares. This ‘in-kind’ transfer offers several key advantages: Reduced Market Impact: By eliminating the need for APs to sell crypto on the open market during redemptions, this mechanism can significantly reduce potential selling pressure, leading to a more stable and efficient market. Improved Price Discovery: Direct transfer of assets can lead to more accurate pricing and less arbitrage opportunity between the ETF and the underlying spot market. Operational Efficiency: It can streamline the redemption process, potentially reducing costs and complexities associated with cash settlements. True Asset Ownership Proxy: For investors who want exposure to the underlying asset without directly holding it, physical redemption offers a closer proxy to actual ownership, enhancing the appeal of the ETF. This is why the prospect of physical redemptions for a Crypto ETF is such a significant topic of discussion among industry experts and investors alike. The Vision of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce : A Beacon of Hope? The recent spark of optimism comes directly from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce , affectionately known in the crypto community as ‘Crypto Mom’ for her consistently forward-thinking stance on digital assets. During a panel discussion hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute , Commissioner Peirce expressed her belief that the SEC will, at some point, allow physical issuances and redemptions for cryptocurrency ETFs. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a statement from a high-ranking official who also heads the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force, indicating a potential shift in regulatory philosophy. Commissioner Peirce has long been an advocate for regulatory clarity and innovation in the crypto space. Her consistent calls for a more pragmatic approach to digital asset regulation have often contrasted with the SEC’s more cautious, enforcement-first stance. Her vision for crypto regulation includes: Embracing Innovation: She believes regulation should not stifle technological advancements but rather provide clear guidelines for them to flourish responsibly. Protecting Investors Prudently: While acknowledging the need for investor protection, she advocates for a balanced approach that doesn’t over-regulate emerging technologies out of existence. Fair and Consistent Application: Peirce has often highlighted the need for consistent application of securities laws to digital assets, rather than creating an entirely new, potentially stifling, framework. Her statement at the Bitcoin Policy Institute panel underscores her continued commitment to these principles and offers a glimpse into a future where the SEC might adopt a more accommodating stance towards advanced crypto financial products. What Challenges Stand in the Way of Physical Redemptions ? While the prospect is exciting, the path to physical redemptions is not without its hurdles. The SEC’s historical reluctance stems from several concerns, primarily related to investor protection and market integrity: Custody and Security: Transferring actual cryptocurrency in and out of an ETF raises complex questions about secure custody, hot and cold storage, and the potential for hacks or loss during transfer. Ensuring institutional-grade security for physical redemptions is paramount. Regulatory Compliance: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations become more intricate when dealing with direct crypto transfers. The SEC would need to be convinced that robust mechanisms are in place to prevent illicit activities. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators have historically worried about the potential for market manipulation in unregulated crypto markets. While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs suggests some comfort, physical redemptions might introduce new vectors for concern. Operational Complexity: The technical infrastructure required for seamless and secure physical transfers at scale is significant. This involves sophisticated blockchain integration, secure wallets, and robust reconciliation processes. Overcoming these challenges will require close collaboration between the crypto industry, traditional financial institutions, and regulatory bodies. The evolution of custody solutions and regulatory frameworks will be key. The Bitcoin Policy Institute and the Broader Dialogue Commissioner Peirce’s remarks were made at a panel discussion hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute , an organization dedicated to educating policymakers and the public about Bitcoin and its potential. Such forums are crucial for fostering dialogue between innovators, policymakers, and academics. They provide a platform for nuanced discussions about the future of digital assets, helping to bridge the gap between the fast-paced crypto world and the often-slower pace of regulatory development. The very existence of such institutes and the willingness of high-ranking officials like Commissioner Peirce to engage with them signals a growing maturity in the crypto ecosystem. It moves the conversation beyond mere speculation to a more structured and policy-oriented debate about how digital assets can be integrated safely and efficiently into the broader financial system. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Future of Crypto? For the average investor, the allowance of physical redemptions for a Crypto ETF could signify increased confidence from regulators, potentially leading to a broader array of sophisticated crypto-backed financial products. It could also: Attract More Institutional Capital: Institutions often seek the most efficient and robust mechanisms for managing assets. Physical redemptions could make crypto ETFs even more appealing to large-scale investors. Enhance Market Liquidity: A more efficient redemption process can contribute to overall market liquidity and stability. Pave the Way for Other Crypto ETFs: If physical redemptions are approved for Bitcoin ETFs, it could set a precedent for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, expanding the investment landscape. While Commissioner Peirce’s statement is not a guarantee of immediate change, it is a powerful indicator of the direction of thought within parts of the SEC. It suggests that the agency is not static and that, eventually, the benefits of certain crypto innovations may outweigh the perceived risks in the eyes of regulators. Conclusion: A Glimpse into a More Mature Crypto Market The journey of cryptocurrency from niche technology to mainstream financial asset has been long and often fraught with regulatory uncertainty. However, the recent approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the U.S. and now the insightful comments from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce about the eventual allowance of physical redemptions mark significant milestones. Her vision, articulated at the Bitcoin Policy Institute panel, points towards a future where the financial infrastructure surrounding digital assets becomes more robust, efficient, and aligned with traditional market practices. While the timeline remains uncertain, the prospect of physical redemptions for Crypto ETF products represents a crucial step towards a more mature, integrated, and accessible crypto market for investors worldwide. It’s a future where the ‘physical’ transfer of digital assets could truly redefine how we interact with cryptocurrency investments.

Invesco Ltd and Galaxy Digital LP combined forces to offer another Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). They filed the appropriate paperwork with the SEC and joined at least 12 other potential spot and future ETFs on the SEC to rule on their status. The competition for the leading $SOL ETF takes place at the most visible end of the crypto ecosystem. Far lower down, there’s a different race on, with Snorter poised to corner the market in the fast-paced world of Solana meme coins on Telegram. It’s two ends of the same spectrum and speaks to the growing strength and versatility of the Solana ecosystem. Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF Ready to List Why the race for a Solana ETF? Partly because of the tremendous success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs: $IBIT: iShares Bitcoin Trust, $70.6B Assets Under Management (AUM) $FBTC: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, $20.4B AUM $GBTC: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, $19.6B AUM $ETHA: iShares Ethereum Trust, $3.9B AUM $ETHE: Grayscale Ethereum Trust, $2.8B AUM It’s no surprise that more players are ready to enter the game, particularly as the realms of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) move ever-closer together. Only $BTC and $ETH currently have single-asset crypto ETFs, but the pile of pending filings includes everything from $XRP to $SOL to the first-ever NFT ETF, with Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU). And with single-asset crypto ETFs rolling along, institutions aren’t waiting around for the SEC. They’ve already started to move towards multi-asset ETFs. Converting Existing Funds to Multi-Asset ETFs One of the holdups so far has been that the SEC lacks a clear set of rules around crypto ETFs, even after the $BTC and $ETH approvals went ahead. The question now is, will the SEC hold approvals until they draw up new rules? Or will they approve first and develop the rule set as they go? There is some time pressure at work here. Grayscale wants to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) to an ETF, and the deadline for that is July 2. That fund already holds a number of crypto assets, including $XRP, $SOL, and $ADA. If the conversion is approved, look for others to follow. Investment managers from Bitwise to Hasdex have plans to convert other funds to multi-asset ETFs that include cryptos. The funds sit at the top of the financial and investment world, and every one that gets approved boosts Solana’s long-term outlook just slightly. But much, much farther down, there’s another reason to be excited for Solana. The frenetic, fast-paced world of Solana meme coin trading just got a tool that could bring much-needed clarity and make finding those 10x or 100x opportunities much easier. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – One Bot to Rule Them All for Meme Coin Trading on Telegram What do you need to find and trade memes on Telegram? You need: Lightning-fast transactions and swaps Automated sniping, to get in and out at the right time Protection from rug pulls, honeypots, and front-running trades Thankfully, traders now have Snorter Bot , the meme coin-styled trading bot designed specifically for trading low-cap Solana memes on Telegram. The $SNORT token powers the bot, providing for rapid trade execution and the lowest fees possible. The project’s presale has already raised nearly $1.3M in a few weeks, indicating broad support. The roadmap includes launching the bot on Solana but expanding to EVM-compatible chains post-launch. In the meantime, the plans feature a token bridge and a built-in Telegram dashboard. No more avoiding Telegram tokens; traders can dive in with confidence with Snorter. Visit the Snorter website to learn more . Solana ETFs Mark the Next Stage of Crypto Adoption As plans proceed, even the rate of ETF filings indicates just how fast crypto adoption is moving. From Wall Street boardrooms to Telegram chats, Solana is becoming increasingly accessible to investors of every stripe. Keep an eye on Snorter, and another on the broader Solana ecosystem. But remember – always do your own research.

2025-06-26T10:08:17,"Bitcoin Miners Just Saw Their Worst Payday in Over a Year – Here’s Why","The post Bitcoin Miners Just Saw Their Worst Payday in Over a Year – Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News June has been brutal for Bitcoin miners. New on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that miner revenue has dropped to just $34 million a day, the lowest since April. It’s the weakest miners have seen in more than a year – and one of the worst stretches since July 2022. “Bitcoin miners just saw their worst payday in a year,” CryptoQuant said in a post on X . For an industry that runs on thin margins and constant pressure, that’s a big red flag. What’s Behind the Crash? Two key factors are behind this sharp drop in miner income. First, Bitcoin’s transaction fees have fallen by 50%, cutting into what miners earn on top of block rewards. Second, Bitcoin’s price itself has dropped around 15%, which directly impacts miner revenue. When both fees and price take a hit, miners feel it fast. That’s exactly what we’re seeing now and it’s pushing profits close to their lowest point in two years. Margins are tight, rewards are down, and the pressure is building. If this continues, some miners may be forced to scale down or shut off rigs until things improve. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Whales Aren’t Moving the Same Way While miners are struggling, Bitcoin’s biggest holders, the whales, are showing mixed signals. According to Glassnode, there’s no clear pattern among whale wallets right now. Smaller whales, those holding 1 to 10 BTC, are redistributing their coins, possibly locking in profits or shifting strategies. But larger wallets holding 10 to 100 BTC are accumulating instead. That contrast is important. Bigger whales buying usually signals confidence and that might explain why Bitcoin is trying to break above $108,000, a level it’s been testing recently. Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score supports this, rising from 0.25 to 0.57 – showing a noticeable uptick in accumulation by these mid-sized whale wallets. As $BTC attempts to reclaim $108K, the Accumulation Trend Score shows no unified cohort behavior. 1–10 #BTC wallets continue distributing, while 10–100 $BTC are net accumulators. Others show mixed signals, though the overall score has rebounded from 0.25 to 0.57 pic.twitter.com/qAivkvziK3 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 26, 2025 So, Where Does This Leave the Market? Right now, the market’s split. Miners are under pressure, but whales are stepping in. If Bitcoin can hold above $108K, it could ease some of the stress on miners and validate the recent accumulation. But if the price drops further, things could get worse before they get better. Either way, this is a moment to watch closely. The choices miners and whales make now could set the tone for what’s next in this cycle.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-miners-just-saw-their-worst-payday-in-over-a-year-heres-why/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T10:08:00,"World Liberty Financial co-founder: More public companies want to hold WLFI as a treasury asset","Trump-backed World Liberty Financial co-founder Zak Folkman stated that the project is seeing a spike in publicly listed companies interested in holding WLFI as a treasury asset. During his speech at Permissionless on June 25, a crypto conference in New York , Folkman declared that World Liberty Financial native token, WLFI, has garnered increasing interest among publicly-listed companies. He credited Michael Saylor’s Strategy as the trailblazer that led many corporations that previously never touched crypto to consider holding digital assets in their balance sheet and as part of their corporate reserves. As opposed to only holding fiat, more companies across the globe have been accumulating Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other major tokens as a hedge against inflation. Folkman claimed that companies are also eyeing World Liberty Financial’s token as a potential addition to their corporate reserves. “There has been a lot of interest from several public vehicles who want to use WLFI to be held in their treasuries as well,” said Folkman as quoted by Bloomberg. You might also like: World Liberty Financial approves proposal to airdrop a fixed amount of USD1 to WLFI holders So far, Strategy has managed to accumulate more than $60 billion in Bitcoin reserves alone. In addition, the company’s market cap has soared more than $100 billion. Other companies such as Japan’s Metaplanet , U.K.’s The Smarter Web Company and Norway’s Green Minerals have announced plans to raise capital to buy more Bitcoin. Aside from Bitcoin, firms are also diversifying their balance sheets by turning to other major tokens such as Solana ( SOL ), Tron ( TRX ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) as alternative treasury assets. For example, SOL Strategies has a Solana-centered strategy and TRON’s recently acquired SRM Entertainment plans to establish a Tron reserve treasury. Most recently, World Liberty Financial announced during Permissionless that it would release its first audit which will provide details on the reserves backing its stablecoin venture, USD1. In addition, the project is also planning to launch a mobile app aimed at retail users.

2025-06-26T10:06:39,"Bitcoin Illiquid Supply Climbs to Over 14M BTC, Reflects Strong HODL Trend","Bitcoin’s BTC illiquid supply has surged to 14.37 million BTC, jumping from 13.9 million BTC at the start of 2025, according to Glassnode data. With bitcoin’s current circulating supply standing at approximately 19.8 million, this means over 72 percent of all mined BTC is now classified as illiquid. Illiquid supply refers to the portion of BTC held by entities with minimal spending behavior, such as long-term investors and cold wallet holders. These coins are effectively taken out of the market, reducing the amount available for trading. As more investors opt to store bitcoin rather than trade it, the liquid portion of the supply shrinks, tightening market availability. This trend is significant because a growing illiquid supply often reflects increasing investor confidence and long-term conviction. It also creates the potential for a supply-side shock, where rising demand meets limited available supply, historically associated with bullish price movements. The continued rise in bitcoin illiquidity supports the narrative of bitcoin as a store of value. If this trajectory holds, it could place upward pressure on price, particularly in the context of heightened market interest and diminishing miner issuance. This underscores liquidity analysis as a key indicator for market sentiment and future price action.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/26/bitcoin-illiquid-supply-climbs-to-over-14m-btc-reflects-strong-hodl-trend,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Glassnode|News",cryptocompare
