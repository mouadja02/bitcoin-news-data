2025-05-27T14:48:16.000Z,"Trump Media Drops $2.5B Bombshell for Record Bitcoin Treasury Bid","Trump Media & Technology Group is raising $2.5 billion to amass one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries ever held by a public company, betting big on crypto through its Truth Social empire. In a private placement offering, the firm said it is entering into subscription agreements with approximately 50 institutional investors, agreeing to issue $1.5 billion in common stock and $1 billion in 0.00% convertible senior secured notes. The deal is expected to close around May 29, 2025, subject to standard conditions. Bitcoin as a Tool of Financial Sovereignty In a statement, Trump Media’s CEO and Chairman Devin Nunes described Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” adding that the firm’s first major acquisition—Bitcoin—represents a foundational shift. “This investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and U.S. firms,” said Nunes. He explained that there are plans to use Bitcoin across the company for subscription payments, tokenization initiatives, and broader fintech development. The company also plans to transform into a holding company by acquiring additional revenue-generating assets that align with its political and economic ideology. Institutional Support and Crypto Infrastructure Partners The $2.5 billion transaction was supported by a consortium of financial institutions and advisers. Yorkville Securities and Clear Street LLC acted as co-lead placement agents, with BTIG, LLC and Cohen & Company Capital Markets participating as co-placement agents. Cantor Fitzgerald served as the financial adviser to the company. Legal counsel was provided by Nelson Mullins for Trump Media and Reed Smith LLP for the placement agents. For crypto custody, Trump Media has enlisted Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital to ensure secure, institutional-grade handling of its forthcoming Bitcoin assets. As of Q1 2025, the company reported $759 million in cash and short-term investments, which will now be bolstered by its digital asset holdings. Trump’s Truth+ Considers Adding Crypto Wallet and Token Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) is weighing the launch of a utility token and a digital wallet as part of an expansion of Truth+. #Trump #Crypto https://t.co/FxxXBA2R1X — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 30, 2025 In April , it emerged that Trump Media is considering launching a utility token and a digital wallet to expand its streaming platform. The potential move was revealed in a letter sent to shareholders by CEO and chairman Devin Nunes ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting. According to Nunes, the proposed utility token would be part of a rewards program and could initially be used to pay for subscriptions to Truth+. President’s Activity Sparks Ethics Concerns Trump has publicly supported the expansion of crypto access and has pledged to make the United States a leading center for digital assets. Recently, he hosted a private dinner for investors in his personal meme coin project at his golf club. The planned capital raise places Trump Media in a position to act not just as a participant in crypto markets but as a large holder of digital assets under the direction of the president’s family. A group of Democratic lawmakers and ethics watchdogs held a press conference recently to denounce what they described as a scheme by President Donald Trump to sell influence through cryptocurrency, specifically his $TRUMP meme coin.

2025-05-27T14:46:44.000Z,"Strategy Is Lagging Behind BTC's Rally, And That's Ok","Summary I've become a strong Bitcoin believer and shifted my portfolio allocation to BTC and correlated assets like MicroStrategy. MSTR's recent underperformance versus Bitcoin is due to relentless ATM equity offerings, compressing its premium to net asset value (mNAV). Despite dilution concerns, MSTR's bold capital raises are a calculated bet on Bitcoin's long-term potential, aiming for massive future accretion. I remain long MSTR, as its strategy positions it as the dominant institutional Bitcoin holder, with unparalleled first-mover advantage. Before We Dive In: A Quick Bitcoin Check-In Before we dive into the core idea, allow me to share a quick update and provide some context for those who haven’t seen my earlier updates. So, a few months ago, I turned into a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) believer — big time. Now, I know this doesn’t resonate with everyone, especially considering that most of my followers are likely more traditional, value-oriented investors. It honestly took some guts to aggressively turn my attention to what many still view as a highly speculative and volatile digital commodity, along with the growing ecosystem of assets tied to it, particularly the recent trend of Bitcoin treasuries that seem to be sprouting up everywhere like weeds. But the truth is, once you put on the Bitcoin glasses, it’s hard to take them off. So while I still hold individual stocks and traditional ETFs, I’ve been gradually increasing the percentage of my portfolio allocated to spot Bitcoin and, to a lesser extent, other assets correlated with it. More specifically, I have been building a position in MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), whose preferreds ( STRK ) and ( STRF ) I’ve also covered on Seeking Alpha here and here , explaining why I believe they could become highly accretive tools for Saylor and Co. I have also taken an interest and built a small position in Semler Scientific ( SMLR ), which has been trading at a discount relative to its BTC holdings. I published an article on this matter in late March, and since then, the stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Paradox: Unpacking Stock Underperformance Amid BTC’s Surge Now, let’s shift gears to the main topic: MSTR’s recent underperformance relative to Bitcoin, particularly during the very days when BTC broke through to new all-time highs. By the way, while MSTR has actually outperformed BTC, gold, and pretty much the rest of the market by a wide margin over the past three months... MSTR's 3-Month Return (strategy.com/charts) ...the underperformance I am referring to is that of the past few days/weeks, which has many bulls in the MSTR community worried that Saylor's indefinite dilution plan might be broken. As you can see, MSTR's returns have decoupled from those of BTC's over the past few weeks. Bitcoin hit new highs, all while MSTR stayed flat. The moment BTC dipped slightly, MSTR sold off even further. That's certainly a concerning sight for bulls, especially since MSTR is supposed to outperform BTC during its runs, given its leveraged nature. BTC/MSTR Returns (Koyfin) I mean, the stock now hovers about $370, a sharp contrast to its $500+ peak in late 2024 when it held just 386,700 BTC, at the time worth about $37 billion at a Bitcoin price of about $94,000. You can see why this underperformance, despite a 47% increase in Bitcoin holdings, has sparked intense debate among investors. The BTC/share may be going up, but at the end of the day, nobody seems to care if this doesn't (immediately) translate to a rising BTC price with it. BTC/MSTR Returns (Koyfin) So what's going on? In short, a compressed multiple to net asset value (mNAV), relentless at-the-market (ATM) equity offerings. Let's look at this a little deeper. With Bitcoin trading at $110,000, the portfolio’s market value is roughly $63.8 billion. Strategy’s market cap, however, sits at $102 billion, with ~280 million diluted shares, translating to 0.002 BTC per share. Compare this to November 2024, when MSTR’s market cap reached $110 billion with fewer shares (260 million) and 386,700 BTC. Back then, the mNAV premium (market cap divided by Bitcoin holdings value) was 2.7x to 3.3x, meaning investors paid $2.70–$3.30 for every $1 of Bitcoin held, per CoinDesk. Today, that premium has tightened to 1.7x–2.0x, signaling a loss of investor enthusiasm despite Bitcoin’s tremendous rally since the U.S. election in November 2024. This multiple compression explains why MSTR’s stock hasn’t mirrored Bitcoin’s ascent. MSTR's Premium to NAV (bitcointreasuries.net/entities/microstrategy) This raises the question, why the mNAV squeeze? Well, first, the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT has led many investors to migrate to these assets for exposure to Bitcoin without Strategy’s operational risks. I have also seen many investors trying to figure out which is going to be the next Bitcoin Treasury success story. Monitoring investors' activity in MSTR-related threads, you can see many selling MSTR to buy more-hyped-up names in the space these days, like Metaplanet ( OTC:MTPLF ), which ended last week up 45% even following Friday's steep sell-off. But more importantly, the ruthless ATM offering is at the heart of this multiple compression. Strategy’s “21/21 Plan,” announced in October 2024, targeted $21 billion in equity raises over three years to buy Bitcoin. Strategy obliterated this target, raising the full $21 billion by Q4 2024. This breakneck pace led to an upsized plan announced along with Q1, which launched a new $21 billion common stock ATM and a $21 billion perpetual preferred stock ATM, effectively doubling the equity component to $42 billion alongside $21 billion in fixed-income securities. Quarter-to-date in Strategy has already raised $2.39 billion , also moving way ahead of schedule. The ATM printer is clearly working overtime. Just look at some of the most recent transactions, which are being funded solely through the ATMs (the majority of which are common MSTR stock). MSTR's Histrorical Purchases (strategy.com/purchases) So you see how, with such a brutal ATM in place hammering the stock down day in and day out, some investors have started to get tired and believe that Saylor is going to keep diluting them forever, and at some point, this whole thing is about to blow up. And to be honest, they are right. I have watched Mr. Saylor talk for dozens of hours in various podcasts and interviews, and I can tell you that he definitely intends to keep the dilution trend strong \""as long as it makes sense.\"" So, then the question is: Does it make sense? Probably, yes. Here's why: The Case for Relentless ATM: Buying Manhattan in 1890 Essentially, despite the short-term stock pain, Strategy’s ATM is a calculated bet on Bitcoin’s long-term potential, rooted in Michael Saylor’s vision of a $13 million BTC by 2045. In his eyes, this is 1890, and you can borrow at 0% to buy Manhattan real estate. How much do you buy? All of it. Strategy’s access to low-cost capital (0% convertible notes and ATM sales at a premium to NAV) mirrors this opportunity. With Bitcoin’s $2.2 trillion market cap at just 0.23% of global wealth, Saylor projects it capturing 2.34% ($21 trillion) at $1 million or 7% ($65 trillion) at $3 million within a decade. At $13 million, Strategy’s 580,225 BTC would be worth $7.5 trillion, dwarfing its $102 billion market cap today (even if the share count surges, as the dilution is, in principle, accretive). The Counterargument To The Relentless ATM Now, I get that MSTR's financial engineering is highly controversial, and the critics have strong arguments. The most prominent argument against MSTR's strategy is that Saylor and Co. are not letting the stock breathe. Many argue that easing ATM sales could let mNAV expand to 3x, 4x+, enabling more Bitcoin per dollar of equity. At a 3x mNAV, $1 billion could buy 9,346 BTC at, say, $107,000, versus 6,667 BTC at 2x—a 40% accretion boost. But then again, given how in every presentation and webcast, management spends tons of time explaining how important the whole theme around accretion is, they must know better than the critics. They likely believe they can sustain the valuation premium, since there is no way they would be willing to destroy the very lever they have created in order to grow BTC per share, and ultimately the business model and hype surrounding the stock. If letting the stock run made more sense, they would likely be doing that. Again, this goes back to buying as much BTC as possible as early as possible. I also view the possibility of Saylor wanting to build a chest large enough to kill the chance of other companies ever catching up to MSTR. With 580,225 BTC, Strategy holds ~2.8% of the 21 million Bitcoin supply. If Bitcoin reaches, say, $1 million, its $585 billion treasury would make it prohibitively expensive for competitors to catch up. Acquiring even 1% of the supply (210,000 BTC) at $1 million would cost $210 billion, a sum few firms could muster, especially as Bitcoin’s price would likely surge during such accumulation due to supply constraints. In a future where Bitcoin becomes a standard for collateral or reserve assets, banks, insurers, and institutions would likely turn to the largest, most credible holder: MSTR. This first-mover advantage essentially positions MSTR as a potential backbone for institutional Bitcoin adoption, akin to a digital vault for global finance. So, you can't really blame MSTR's buying frenzy. So as long as MSTR's financial engineering makes sense on paper (which it does), I plan on staying long.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790139-strategy-is-lagging-behind-btc-rally-and-thats-ok?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK","BTC-USD|STRK|STRF|MSTR",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T14:46:42.000Z,"Is XRP price going to crash again?","Key points: XRP derivatives markets turn bearish amid reducing institutional demand, suggesting further downside for XRP price. XRP’s descending triangle breakout could lead to a decline toward $1.96. XRP ( XRP ) has rebounded by more than 45% since April 7 lows to trade at $2.31 on May 27. But the price remains 31% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns about XRP’s ability to rise higher. Will XRP’s price drop from the current levels in the coming days? XRP derivatives data lean bearish One of the clearest signs that there could be trouble ahead for XRP is the presence of neutral funding rates and decreasing open interest (OI) in its futures markets. Funding rates are periodic payments made between long and short traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep prices aligned with the spot market. When neutral, it indicates a balance between long and short positions, reflecting a lack of strong directional bias among traders. XRP funding rates have hovered around 0% since February, indicating that traders are ambivalent. This could lead to continued price consolidation or sideways movement as the market lacks a clear catalyst for a breakout. XRP perpetual futures funding rates across all exchanges.

Source: Glassnode Historically, assets with declining open interest struggle to maintain upward momentum, as there’s insufficient capital and enthusiasm to drive prices higher. For XRP, this could mean that even minor selling pressure might trigger a cascade of liquidations, especially if leveraged positions are unwound. Without renewed interest from institutional or retail traders, XRP’s price risks sliding back into a downward spiral. Investors de-risk from XRP investment products Institutional demand for XRP investment products appears to be waning, according to data from CoinShares. XRP exchange-traded products (ETPs) posted the largest weekly outflow of $37.2 million, breaking an impressive 80-week inflow streak. This brought month-to-date outflows to $28.6 million.

Source: CoinShares While CoinShares did not highlight any reasons why XRP-related products experienced the largest outflows, other top-cap cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) recorded significant net inflows of $2.9 billion, $326 million and $4.3 million, respectively. This indicates a decreased institutional appetite for XRP investment products, a negative catalyst for the XRP price. Related: XRP price top is in? Network metrics put 385% rally at risk XRP descending triangle hints at 16% price drop The XRP price chart has been forming a descending triangle pattern on its four-hour chart since May 14, characterized by a flat support level and a downward-sloping resistance line. A descending triangle is a chart pattern that forms after a sharp uptrend is seen as a bearish reversal indicator. As a rule, the pattern resolves when the price breaks below the flat support level and falls by as much as the triangle’s maximum height. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls are struggling to keep XRP above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently at $2.18, signaling a lack of strength. If this trend continues, a close below the 200-day SMA at $2.31 could sink the XRP/USDT pair toward the triangle’s support line at $2.28. If this support fails, XRP price could tumble toward the downside target at around $1.96 by the end of May, down 16% from current price levels. XRP’s descending triangle target echoes an earlier analysis that warned of a possible decline to as low as $1.61 if key support levels didn’t hold. Conversely, a clear breakout above the triangle’s resistance line at $2.35 (the 50-day SMA) would invalidate the bearish structure, putting XRP in a good position to rally toward the $3.00 psychological level.

2025-05-27T14:33:46.000Z,"Michael Saylor Explains Why On-Chain Proof-of-Reserves Are a Bad Idea","Michael Saylor, executive chair of Strategy, has warned that on-chain proof-of-reserves may create artificial intelligence-related security attacks. Speaking during a panel on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Saylor said the practice is a “bad idea.” Security Risks and Incomplete Transparency When asked about the growing trend of institutions adopting the transparency measure, Saylor was opposed to it. “It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea,” he argued. The 60-year-old acknowledged that the industry has lessons to learn from the failures of FTX and Mt. Gox. However, he noted that proof-of-reserves is not the correct approach for companies to use. He also highlighted that no enterprise-level security professional would advise revealing all wallet addresses, a practice that is part of the process. He added that if AI were asked to evaluate the long-term risks of publicizing wallet structures, it would generate 50 pages of potential threats. The Bitcoin enthusiast emphasized that while transparency is important, proof-of-reserves only shows what a company owns and does not reflect what it owes, making it an incomplete measure of financial health. He suggested that instead of relying on the mechanism, institutions should focus on more holistic accountability solutions that provide a clearer picture of their financial stability. Would Strategy Adopt Proof-of-Reserves? When Blockware Solutions’ head analyst Mitchell Askew asked Saylor whether Strategy would consider using the verification method, the executive avoided giving a direct response. Proof-of-reserves gained popularity following the collapse of crypto exchanges like FTX and Mt. Gox, which left investors uncertain about whether exchanges had enough assets to cover liabilities. The disclosures are meant to show that institutions hold enough digital assets to back customer deposits. They are also used by entities such as crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds to confirm asset backing. Many crypto exchanges, such as Binance, Kraken, and Bitwise, have adopted them as a way to demonstrate solvency. The interview follows Strategy’s recent announcement that it had acquired an additional 4,020 BTC for nearly $430 million. The company now has 580,250 BTC and has recorded a BTC yield of 16.8% year-to-date in 2025, making it the largest corporate holder of the flagship cryptocurrency. Despite this, Google Finance data shows that the business intelligence firm’s stock closed at $369.51 on May 26, a 7.50% decrease in the last 24 hours.

XRP: Bullish Setup, But Growth Slowing XRP is trading between $2.26 and $2.83, buoyed by institutional interest and recent ETF launches. Analysts see potential for XRP to reach $5–$8 by year-end if market sentiment holds, but short-term upside is limited compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale potential. Regulatory clarity and bullish technicals keep XRP strong, but its growth is expected to be steady rather than parabolic. Avalanche (AVAX): Stable Growth, Modest Upside AVAX is forecast to trade between $19 and $20.54 in May, with projections for steady, moderate gains through 2025. While AVAX offers stability and ecosystem growth, its ROI potential is significantly lower than MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale projections. Avalanche remains a solid investment for risk-averse traders, but not the breakout contender of 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): Record Highs, Limited Short-Term Upside BTC recently smashed past $111,000, setting new all-time highs on strong institutional inflows. Analysts expect BTC to test $115,000–$131,000, but further gains from current levels would represent only a 10–35% upside—far below MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale return potential.

Big Players And Market Moves Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy , bought 4,020 BTC between May 19 and 25, bringing its total to 580,250 BTC. Yet Strategy’s stock dipped over 7% in pre-market trading on May 26. That drop shows Wall Street can shrug off big BTC buys. Meanwhile, Robert Kiyosaki , author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad”, called Bitcoin “real money” and warned that fiat cash might lose its grip on trust. He pointed to Gresham’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law to make his case. Institutional interest is one factor. Another is the rollout of spot Bitcoin ETFs in several markets. These funds let big investors buy Bitcoin without wrestling with private keys. That move has lifted demand even when retail buyers step back. Still, some in the crypto community worry about the silent wallets. No one really knows if Satoshi might ever move those coins. If he did, prices could wobble. A sudden sell-off of even a small slice—say 100,000 BTC—would flood the market. Right now, the mere thought keeps traders on edge. Today’s numbers shine a spotlight on how far Bitcoin has come. From a few cents per coin to more than $110,000, it’s been a wild ride. But the giant stash held by an unknown creator adds a new layer of drama. For now, those coins stay frozen in time. And that mystery, like the price swings, is part of what keeps people talking.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) operate on public blockchains . This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets. A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history. This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world. How does a crypto mixer work? To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins. Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates: Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins. Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds. Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants. Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs. This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis , making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners. Types of cryptocurrency mixers Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers. Centralized mixers Centralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface. However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as: The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds. It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins. The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy. Decentralized mixers Decentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy. Advantages of decentralized mixers include: No central point of failure or custody risk. Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds. Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns. Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court. Real-world cases involving mixers and scams Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities , leading to widespread misuse. Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks , dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement. A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions. Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets. In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group , a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations. Are crypto mixers legal? The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use. Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails. For instance, In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity. In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges. Legal uses vs misuse Using a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal. If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud. Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations. How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles: Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies. Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions. Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user. Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing. Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks. Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Altcoin|Cryptocurrencies",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T14:29:35.000Z,"Billionaire Investor Warns of U.S. Debt Crisis After Trump’s New Bill Passes","The post Billionaire Investor Warns of U.S. Debt Crisis After Trump’s New Bill Passes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The alarm bells are ringing – and they’re getting louder. Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya is sounding off about what he sees as a ticking time bomb for the U.S. economy: a soaring national debt, rising Treasury yields, and the threat of a credit downgrade, all triggered by a controversial new bill that just cleared Congress. On May 22, 2025, the House passed The One, Big, Beautiful Bill , a sweeping measure aiming to reignite economic growth by locking in the 2017 Trump-era tax cuts and launching a series of pro-growth initiatives. But Palihapitiya sees trouble brewing beneath the surface. Debt-Fueled Growth or Financial Disaster? Speaking on the All-In Podcast , Palihapitiya didn’t mince words. He criticized the bill as a rushed, last-minute move that trades long-term stability for short-term political wins. Rather than focusing on fiscal discipline, he says, lawmakers opted for what he calls “debt-financed industrial policy.” “That lack of discipline is going to create a negative set of consequences,” he warned. According to Palihapitiya, the numbers don’t lie. The 10-year Treasury yield is already hovering around 4.5%, and it’s climbing fast. If the trend continues, we could see it surpass 5% by year’s end. Meanwhile, the 30-year yield is on track to break 6.25%, maybe even hit 6.5% – well beyond what most experts consider sustainable for the U.S. economy. The Fallout: Investors Pull Back, Credit Downgrade Risk Grows So what happens if yields keep rising? Palihapitiya says the implications are serious. “You’ll de-lever from the United States, you’ll sell U.S. debt, you’ll own things like gold and Bitcoin,” he explained. “You’ll have ratings organizations that add to this cascade by downgrading the United States.” This is more than just a hypothetical scenario. A wave of deleveraging could trigger a loss of global confidence in U.S. financial stability, especially if top credit rating agencies start issuing downgrades. Investors may flee toward safer, alternative assets – further pressuring the dollar and deepening the debt spiral. Elon Musk Weighs In: Only Explosive Growth Can Save Us Echoing this, Elon Musk recently warned that only exponential GDP growth can avert national bankruptcy, with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) offering only temporary relief. Musk stressed that rampant government spending demands radical productivity gains to save the economy. Time for Action: Can America Avoid Financial Ruin? With Treasury yields surging, investor sentiment shifting, and warnings from some of the sharpest minds in tech and finance, the U.S. finds itself at a critical juncture. Palihapitiya’s warning is a flashing red signal that the balance sheet of the world’s largest economy may be tipping into dangerous territory. Whether lawmakers choose to reverse course or continue down the current path may define the country’s economic future for decades to come. One thing is clear: the clock is ticking.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/billionaire-investor-warns-of-u-s-debt-crisis-after-trumps-new-bill-passes/,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare

The biggest Bitcoin gathering tends to accompany BTC price weakness. BTC price action can and will continue to experience drawdowns of 10-20%, analysis stresses. Bitcoin ( BTC ) circled $110,000 at the May 27 Wall Street open amid concerns over a 30% BTC price crash. BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Bitcoin “market memory” may recall 2024 crash Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD recovering after its latest support retest around $107,000. As large-volume traders took advantage of the volatility , market commentators turned to potential risk factors, these coming from multiple sources. Uncertainty over US trade tariffs and the return of Wall Street after the Memorial Day holiday combined with the ghost of BTC price losses from a year ago. In July 2024, the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville, Tennessee formed the basis for snap downside in early August which took BTC/USD down 30% from $70,000 to $49,000. Now, with the same event getting underway for 2025, some wondered whether the market would experience an unwelcome sense of deja-vu. “The sustained elevation in near-term vols suggests that traders are positioning around headline risk ahead of the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, scheduled for 27 to 29 May. Focus is already building around the event’s speaker line-up, which includes JD Vance, Michael Saylor, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump,” trading firm QCP Capital wrote in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers. “Last July’s Nashville Bitcoin Conference offers a useful analogue. At the time, a keynote by President Trump coincided with a sharp spike in 1-day implied vols above 90, followed by a swift reversal and a nearly 30% decline in BTC within two days. That episode continues to shape market memory.” BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A 30% retracement from current levels would put Bitcoin back at $77,000 — around the area in which it set a multimonth bottom in April. Continuing, crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe reiterated that the drop from $110,000 to the mid-$70,000 range had already happened once before. “Corrections do happen and they'll continue to happen,” he told X followers on May 26, arguing that a correction of up to 20% “shouldn't disappoint you.” As Cointelegraph reported , various sources have suggested that the Bitcoin bull market is in its final innings before a protracted trend reversal.

2025-05-27T14:12:33.000Z,"Leverage Is Heating Up Again Crypto Exchanges - But the Fee Trap Still Catches Most Traders","With markets surging and 50x leverage back on the menu, retail traders are once again piling into high-risk setups on offshore crypto exchanges offering high leverage. But while everyone’s chasing bigger positions, few are stopping to ask: what are the hidden costs? It’s not just the spread anymore. Between overnight fees, taker commissions, and funding rates that shift by the hour, most traders end up paying far more than they think, especially on volatile pairs. As capital flows back into margin products, a silent tax is draining accounts behind the scenes. The platforms don’t highlight it, but the numbers are real. And if you’re not tracking them, your edge is already gone. Why Leverage Trading Is Surging Again Speculation is back — and traders aren’t just buying the dip, they’re borrowing for it. Over the past 20 days, open interest in Bitcoin futures has jumped by 20% , now topping $26 billion across global markets. That’s not idle money, it’s a signal that traders are ramping up margin exposure to chase near-term moves. Bitcoin’s breakout from a falling wedge pattern has reignited bullish momentum, but the real accelerant is leverage. The estimated leverage ratio has climbed nearly 1%, reflecting a wider shift in appetite for risk. This trend isn’t isolated. Liquidity is tightening around key resistance levels, and traders are stacking bets on both sides, hoping to catch a breakout, but sitting inches from liquidation triggers. As Bitcoin has crossed the $100K barrier, the leverage game is officially back on. The Hidden Cost That Most Traders Miss For many retail traders, leverage is a shortcut to bigger positions — but the real cost isn’t always in the loss column. Every time a leveraged position is opened, there are hidden multipliers baked into the transaction: trading fees, overnight interest, and funding rates that quietly erode capital over time. These aren’t hypothetical costs. They compound. What most traders don’t see is easy to highlight by showing how fees can spiral as leverage ratios climb, even when the position is sized modestly. As outlined by Leverage.Trading, which tracks fees across major crypto leverage trading platforms, these costs can spiral quickly with high-margin positions. For example, on a $500 account using 25x leverage, the trading fee alone can spike from $1 to $25, a 2,400% increase, before the trade even moves. Source: fee breakdown via Leverage.Trading What many traders don’t realize is that this fee structure punishes over-leveraging, not just through liquidations, but through slow, cumulative cost drag. That means even when a trade is “profitable,” the net gain may be smaller than expected due to baked-in operational fees. The message? Leverage isn’t free. And figuring out the true cost structure might be the difference between scaling an edge or burning out your capital. From Spot to Futures - Fees Vary More Than You Think It’s easy to assume that a few decimals in trading fees don’t matter—until they do. Spot trading on Binance charges a flat 0.10% for most users, barely dropping unless you're pushing over $20 million in volume. But jump to the futures market, and the dynamic shifts. Suddenly, even modestly active traders can access taker fees as low as 0.045%—half the spot cost. At the highest VIP levels, that gap grows even wider: 0.017% vs. 0.10%. For day traders or anyone using leverage, that’s not a discount. It’s a structural edge. The table below shows just how sharply the fee curve bends. What looks like a small tweak on paper becomes thousands saved—or lost—depending on where you trade. Binance fee tiers spot vs. futures What this means for you. If you're trading with leverage and not checking the fee structure of your platform, you're probably bleeding capital. Let’s say you open 5 trades per day with a 1:25 leverage ratio on a $1,000 account. At a 0.10% fee (typical spot rate), you're paying $125/month in fees. On Binance Futures at 0.045%, that drops to just $56/month, less than half. Over a year? That’s $828 saved, just by choosing the right market. Why Some Traders Don’t Mind Paying More Fees aren’t always the enemy. Power users often trade in milliseconds, not months. For them, paying 0.05% more means accessing deeper liquidity, faster fills, and better outcomes when volatility hits. As one Reddit user put it: “Much more liquid (perpetual futures liquidity is often much better than spot)… really cheap short term, but quite expensive if held too long.”— CrowdGoesWildWoooo, r/CryptoCurrency Others simply prefer tools that keep up with their strategy: Speed > SavingsScalpers and short-term traders will gladly pay higher taker fees to avoid slippage on a fast-moving market. Seconds can make or break a setup. Reliability WinsAfter flash crashes and liquidity gaps, many traders now prioritize exchanges that stay online when volatility hits. “I don’t need the cheapest platform. I need the one that doesn’t freeze,” as one Redditor put it. Infrastructure & ToolingMore expensive platforms often come with better dashboards, charting tools, and automation features — all of which can increase the trader’s edge. Peace of MindAs one user noted: “I’ll probably only use leverage during key moments in the cycle.” For that, they want a platform they trust, not just one that’s cheap. These are real-world trade-offs that numbers alone can’t capture — and they explain why, even in a fee-sensitive niche like crypto, many traders choose to pay more and sleep better. Final Take: Trading Fees Deserve More Attention in 2025 Leverage trading is back in full force, but most traders still aren’t doing the math. While everyone’s fixated on charts, entries, and liquidation points, the slow bleed of fees continues behind the scenes. It’s not just about losses anymore, it’s about how much you don’t make because of what you didn’t see. In 2025, every basis point matters. Whether you're scalping on Binance Futures or riding swing trades offshore, understanding the cost structure of your trades is no longer optional, it's alpha. So before you size up your next position, ask yourself: are you optimizing for the market... or for the platform’s profit margin? Smart traders calculate both.

2025-05-27T14:10:33.000Z,"Memecoins: A Surprising New Gateway to Crypto Adoption","BitcoinWorld Memecoins: A Surprising New Gateway to Crypto Adoption When you think about the entry points into the world of cryptocurrency, what comes to mind? For many, it’s likely the established giants: Bitcoin or Ethereum . These are the names that dominate headlines, the foundational assets of the digital economy. However, recent data is challenging this conventional wisdom, revealing a perhaps surprising trend: memecoins are increasingly serving as the first step for a significant number of crypto investors . Understanding the Shifting Landscape of Crypto Adoption A new report from cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, titled the “Global State of Crypto,” sheds light on the evolving path to crypto adoption . The findings indicate that the journey into digital assets isn’t always starting with the blue chips. Instead, the often-speculative and community-driven world of memecoins is capturing the initial interest of many newcomers. According to the report, which surveyed individuals across various countries, a notable percentage of new users in the United States are making their first crypto purchase in memecoins . Specifically: 31% of U.S. crypto investors surveyed stated they purchased a memecoin before acquiring either Bitcoin or Ethereum . This statistic highlights a significant shift in how new users are entering the market compared to just a few years ago. It suggests that the allure of viral trends, community hype, and the potential for rapid gains associated with memecoins is a powerful initial draw. This trend isn’t confined to just dipping a toe in the water. The report further indicates that engagement often deepens: A remarkable 94% of memecoin holders surveyed also own traditional cryptocurrencies. This high percentage suggests that while memecoins might be the initial spark, they often lead investors to explore and invest in the broader crypto market, including established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum . This data from the Gemini report paints a clear picture: memecoins are not just isolated phenomena; they are acting as a legitimate, albeit unconventional, onboarding ramp for a substantial portion of new crypto investors , ultimately contributing to overall crypto adoption . Why Are Memecoins So Appealing to New Crypto Investors? The rise of memecoins as a primary entry point might seem counterintuitive given their often-volatile and speculative nature. However, several factors contribute to their appeal, particularly for those new to the crypto space: Accessibility and Lower Price Point: Compared to buying a whole Bitcoin or even a significant fraction of Ethereum , memecoins often have extremely low per-coin prices, allowing investors to buy millions or billions of units for a relatively small amount of capital. This psychological effect makes them feel more accessible. Community and Social Hype: Memecoins are heavily driven by online communities, social media trends, and internet culture. This creates a sense of belonging and excitement that traditional finance, and even more serious crypto projects, often lack. New users are drawn in by the fun and viral potential. Potential for Explosive Gains: While highly risky, the stories of early memecoin investors making massive returns are widely publicized. This lottery ticket appeal attracts individuals hoping for life-changing wealth from a small initial investment. Simplicity (at First Glance): For a newcomer, understanding complex blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), or the intricacies of Bitcoin’s halving can be daunting. Buying a memecoin often feels simpler – it’s about buying a token based on hype and community, which is more relatable to familiar concepts like stock market trends or viral phenomena. Media Attention: Memecoins frequently grab mainstream headlines, whether due to price pumps, celebrity endorsements, or humorous origins. This constant visibility keeps them top-of-mind for potential new investors. These factors combine to create an environment where memecoins are not just investment assets but cultural phenomena that lower the barrier to entry for individuals curious about crypto but intimidated by its technical complexity or the high price of Bitcoin and Ethereum . How Do Memecoin Holders Transition to Bitcoin and Ethereum? The Gemini report’s finding that 94% of memecoin holders also own traditional crypto is crucial. It suggests that the initial foray into memecoins serves as an educational and experiential stepping stone. Here’s how that transition likely happens: Platform Familiarity: Buying a memecoin requires setting up a wallet, using an exchange (centralized or decentralized), and understanding basic transaction processes. This demystifies the practical steps of interacting with crypto. Experiencing Volatility: Memecoins are notoriously volatile. Experiencing significant price swings, both up and down, quickly teaches new investors about market dynamics, risk management (or lack thereof), and the emotional rollercoaster of crypto investing. Curiosity and Education: Once involved, even through a memecoin , investors are exposed to the broader crypto ecosystem. They start hearing about Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative, Ethereum’s role in smart contracts and DeFi, and the potential utility of other projects. Seeking Stability or Utility: After experiencing the extreme highs and lows of memecoins , many investors begin looking for assets with more established track records, larger market caps, or tangible use cases. This naturally leads them to explore Bitcoin (often seen as digital gold) and Ethereum (the backbone of Web3). Diversification: As investors allocate more capital or become more serious, they understand the importance of diversification. Adding Bitcoin and Ethereum to a portfolio initially built on memecoins is a common diversification strategy. This transition process underscores the positive role memecoins can play in crypto adoption , acting as a ‘starter pack’ that educates users through direct experience before they move on to more complex or established assets. Benefits and Challenges of Memecoins Driving Adoption While the data suggests memecoins are effective onboarding tools, this trend isn’t without its nuances, presenting both significant benefits and considerable challenges for the crypto ecosystem and new crypto investors . Benefits: Increased Overall Adoption Numbers: By attracting a new demographic, memecoins directly contribute to a larger number of individuals holding and interacting with cryptocurrencies. Broader Reach: They tap into communities and individuals who might not have been initially interested in the technical or financial aspects of Bitcoin or Ethereum . Innovation (of a Kind): The rapid iteration and community-driven nature of memecoins , while often chaotic, can sometimes push boundaries in community building and viral marketing within the crypto space. Liquidity: Increased participation, even in the memecoin market, can potentially add overall liquidity and activity to exchanges and decentralized protocols. Challenges: High Risk and Volatility: The primary challenge is the inherent risk. Many memecoins have little to no underlying value or utility and are prone to dramatic crashes, pump-and-dump schemes, and rug pulls. New investors can lose their capital very quickly. Potential for Negative Experiences: Losing money on a memecoin can sour a new investor’s view of the entire crypto space, potentially hindering their future exploration of more legitimate projects like Bitcoin or Ethereum . Focus on Speculation Over Technology: The emphasis on hype and price action in the memecoin world can distract from the significant technological advancements and real-world applications being built on platforms like Ethereum . Regulatory Scrutiny: The speculative nature and potential for manipulation in the memecoin market attract unwanted attention from regulators, which could lead to stricter rules impacting the broader crypto industry. Misinformation: The hype around memecoins often involves significant misinformation and unrealistic promises, making it hard for new investors to discern credible information. It’s a double-edged sword: memecoins are effective at getting people through the door, but the experience inside can be perilous if not approached with caution and a willingness to learn beyond the initial hype. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Memecoin Gateway Given that memecoins are a reality in the crypto adoption journey, how should potential and existing crypto investors approach this trend? For New Investors Starting with Memecoins: Educate Yourself: Understand WHY you are buying a token. Is it pure speculation, or does it have a community, a vision, or even a tiny bit of utility? Research goes beyond just checking the price chart. Start Small: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. Treat memecoins like high-risk bets, not guaranteed investments. View it as a Learning Experience: Use your memecoin journey to learn how exchanges work, how to secure a wallet, and how market sentiment affects prices. Look Beyond the Hype: Once you’re in, start exploring Bitcoin , Ethereum , and other established projects. Understand their use cases, history, and long-term potential. Don’t let memecoins be the end of your crypto journey. Beware of Scams: Be extremely cautious of projects promising guaranteed returns or pressuring you to invest quickly. Rug pulls are common. For the Crypto Industry and Educators: Acknowledge the Gateway: Instead of dismissing memecoins , recognize their role in onboarding users as highlighted by reports like Gemini’s. Improve Onboarding and Education: Develop user-friendly resources specifically tailored for those entering via memecoins . Explain the risks clearly and guide them towards understanding the broader ecosystem, including the fundamentals of Bitcoin and Ethereum . Promote Responsible Investing: Emphasize diversification, long-term holding strategies, and the importance of utility and technology beyond speculation. Build Intuitive Platforms: Make the transition from speculative assets to more established ones seamless and easy on exchanges and wallets. The Future of Crypto Investors: A More Diverse Path? The findings from the Gemini report suggest that the path to becoming a crypto investor is becoming more diverse and less predictable. While the traditional route starting with Bitcoin or Ethereum remains prevalent, the memecoin gateway is a significant and growing phenomenon. This evolution means that the crypto community needs to adapt. We must welcome newcomers regardless of how they entered, provide them with the tools and knowledge to navigate the risks, and guide them towards understanding the deeper value proposition of decentralized technologies. The fact that most memecoin holders eventually move on to own Bitcoin and Ethereum is a positive sign. It indicates that the initial exposure, driven by hype and community, can evolve into a more serious interest in the fundamental assets powering the crypto revolution. As crypto adoption continues to grow, understanding and leveraging these diverse entry points will be crucial for the industry’s long-term health and expansion.

Bearish Elliott Wave Count Says Wave C Breakdown Ahead According to the Elliott Wave count presented in a technical analysis on TradingView, Cardano (ADA) looks like it is currently wrapping up a B-wave correction that has formed over the past months between April and June 2025. This B wave is part of a larger corrective phase, and while it may appear impulsive on lower timeframes, the Elliott wave theory suggests that it is merely a trap before the final C-wave crash. Related Reading: Cardano Market Structure Says Crash Is Coming, But $0.9 Is Still In The Cards Based on this forecast, the price of Cardano could soon initiate a sharp decline that would bottom out near the $0.42 region, which coincides with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level drawn from the previous impulse. According to this Elliott wave count, this ABC formation is all part of a larger corrective Wave 4 before a bullish Wave 5. Keeping this in mind, the prediction stipulates that ADA should not fall below $0.40, which marks the top of the first major wave in the overall bullish structure. A move lower than that would risk invalidating the broader long-term setup. Is It Time To Exit Cardano? If the technical analysis plays out as predicted, the projected crash to $0.42 would translate to a 50% drop from the current price of Cardano. This will undoubtedly sound bad, especially for short-term holders. However, this bearish wave could also be a hidden opportunity. Related Reading: Cardano Sees 25% OI Jump In 24 Hours As Bulls Eye Reversal Above $1 As shown in the ADA 4H candlestick chart above, the projected Wave C crash to $0.42 would be followed by a bullish impulse Wave 5 that will push it above the $1 mark again. Specifically, the target is a push towards $1.6. Keeping this in mind, if ADA indeed corrects toward $0.42–$0.40, it would provide a good accumulation zone before the next leg up. Although this bearish forecast is well supported by Elliott Wave principles, it is by no means a guaranteed outcome. ADA and other large market-cap cryptocurrencies are currently highly reactive to Bitcoin’s price action. If Bitcoin extends its rally and breaks into new all-time highs again soon, the projected ADA correction may either be muted or entirely invalidated. As such, it would be interesting to see how the ADA price action plays out in the next few days. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.7706, down by 0.2% in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-27T13:45:34.000Z,"Sanctioned Sberbank leads queue to offer liquidity for Russia's crypto market","Majority state-owned banking and financial giant Sberbank will play the role of a market maker for authorized cryptocurrency trading in the Russian Federation. Known for its own projects in the digital assets space, Russia’s largest bank now hopes to see the emergence of a whole “new world” of crypto investment opportunities. Sberbank to act as market maker for Russian crypto platforms The biggest bank in Russia in terms of assets, Sberbank, will become a market maker providing liquidity for regulated platforms that will give qualified Russian investors access to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a high-ranking executive unveiled. Speaking to the business news outlet RBC, the head of Sberbank’s Global Markets Department, Alexander Zozulya, praised the Bank of Russia’s “important step” to announce the development of an experimental legal regime (ELR) for crypto transactions and emphasized: “We expect the emergence of a legal ‘sandbox,’ an analogue of a regulated crypto platform, where super-qualified investors will be allowed to operate directly with cryptocurrencies.” Zozulya’s comments come after the Governor of the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) Elvira Nabiullina admitted earlier this month that direct investments in crypto assets would require regulatory changes and dedicated infrastructure. During her appearance at the “Russian Stock Market—2025” conference in mid-May, Nabiullina also made it clear that such transactions should be carried out exclusively within the ELR framework and available only to “highly qualified” investors. The monetary authority proposed the establishment of the special regime and the “ highly qualified investors ” category in March of this year. The ELR will allow Russian companies to exchange and use cryptocurrencies in foreign trade, bypassing Ukraine war-related restrictions. To be considered sufficiently qualified to put money into crypto, Russians will have to prove investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (approximately $1.25 million) and annual income from the past year of more than 50 million rubles ($625,000), the CBR suggested. Standards for financial institutions are yet to be drafted. Russian investors to have access to crypto ETFs as well Products that provide exposure to cryptocurrencies without direct ownership of the digital assets will also be available to investors in Russia, Alexander Zozulya revealed. These will be similar to the cryptocurrency ETFs (exchange-traded funds) known in the West, he explained. In Russia, these could be structured products, digital financial assets (DFAs) or mutual funds linked to the prices of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or a basket of cryptocurrencies, he elaborated, adding that Sberbank intends to offer such solutions. Zozulya remarked that the government-backed behemoth “is moving in this direction quite quickly,” together with the Bank of Russia. However, amendments to Russia’s Civil and Tax Codes as well as CBR’s own rules are still needed for the launch of a crypto ETF-like product. A list of changes has been prepared already, and Sberbank’s infrastructure is ready, the executive said and promised: “As soon as this is allowed, a ‘new world’ of instruments for investing in cryptocurrency will appear.” Zozulya also unveiled that Russian authorities plan to set up an experimental platform for qualified investors in order to “whiten” direct crypto ownership or, in other words, bring it out of the shadows. Crypto-related operations are yet to be properly regulated in Russia, where only mining has so far been recognized as a legal business activity. The central bank remains a strong opponent to permitting the free circulation of Bitcoin and the like in the country’s economy outside the ELR. In her speech at the stock market forum this month, Elvira Nabiullina acknowledged existing interest in issuing financial instruments, the yield of which is tied to the value of cryptocurrencies, and said the matter had been discussed with the finance ministry in Moscow. Sberbank, rebranded to Sber in 2020, is among the leading Russian banks that have signaled a willingness to take part in Moscow’s crypto experiment , alongside VTB and Alfa-Bank. It is the successor of the Soviet Union’s main retail and savings bank and is currently Russia’s largest universal bank. Sberbank was added to Western sanctions lists after the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Saylor says onchain proof-of-reserves a “bad idea” Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, said on May 26 that institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that poses security risks. “The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew at an event about institutions adopting the measure. “It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.” I asked @saylor if @MicroStrategy has any plans to publish on-chain proof of reserves His answer will SHOCK you “It’s a bad idea.” - Security Risk - Irrelevant without also having Big 4-audited liabilities Check it out 👇 pic.twitter.com/tIxUckgbEp — Mitchell ✝️🇺🇸 (@MitchellHODL) May 27, 2025 Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy, which has the largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings of any public company, would publish a proof-of-reserves. Saylor said the industry learned from the collapses of crypto exchanges FTX and Mt.

The tokens will be tradeable on the newly launched “Prypco Mint” platform, with Zand Digital Bank appointed as the bank for the project’s pilot phase.

2025-05-27T13:40:20.000Z,"Exodus Crypto Card: Unlock Seamless USDT USDC Payments","BitcoinWorld Exodus Crypto Card: Unlock Seamless USDT USDC Payments Are you an Exodus wallet user looking for an easier way to spend your stablecoins? The wait might be over. Exodus Movement (EXOD), a well-known cryptocurrency wallet provider, has taken a significant step in bridging the gap between digital assets and everyday spending. In a move set to excite its extensive user base, Exodus has officially launched a Exodus crypto card in collaboration with Baanx. What is the new Exodus Crypto Card and How Does it Work? The core idea behind the Exodus crypto card is simple yet powerful: enabling Exodus wallet users to spend their cryptocurrency holdings in the real world, anywhere Mastercard is accepted. This eliminates the need to first send crypto to an exchange, convert it to fiat currency, and then withdraw it to a bank account before making a purchase. It streamlines the entire process, offering a level of convenience previously limited for many crypto holders. Here’s a breakdown of how it generally functions: Linking Your Wallet: Users will link their Exodus wallet to the card. Selecting Assets: Initially focusing on stablecoins like USDT and USDC, users can designate which assets they want to use for spending. Point of Sale Conversion: When a purchase is made using the card, the required amount of cryptocurrency (USDT or USDC) is instantly converted into the local fiat currency (like USD, EUR, etc.) at the point of sale. Payment Processed: The fiat transaction is then processed through the Mastercard network, just like a regular debit card payment. This instant conversion is key, allowing users to leverage their digital assets for everyday transactions without the manual steps typically involved. How Does the Crypto Debit Card Bridge the Gap? The introduction of a crypto debit card by a major wallet provider like Exodus is a crucial development for mass adoption. For years, holding cryptocurrency has often felt separate from traditional financial activities. While great for investment or peer-to-peer transfers, using crypto for buying groceries, paying bills, or shopping online has been cumbersome. A crypto debit card directly addresses this friction. It acts as a seamless interface between the decentralized world of crypto and the established infrastructure of traditional payment networks like Mastercard. It empowers users by: Increasing Utility: Your crypto assets become immediately spendable at millions of locations worldwide. Simplifying Transactions: No complex conversions or transfers are needed before spending. Offering Familiarity: Using a debit card is a behavior most people are already comfortable with. This initiative helps to normalize the idea of using digital assets for commerce, moving beyond just investment or speculative use cases. Why Focus on USDT USDC Payments ? Exodus’s initial focus on enabling USDT USDC payments through the card is a strategic choice. USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin) are the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Spending highly volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum for everyday purchases can be risky. The value could drop significantly between the time you intend to spend it and the moment of the transaction, or even within minutes. By focusing on stablecoins, Exodus offers a more predictable spending experience for its users. Benefits of using stablecoins for card payments: Value Stability: Minimizes the risk of your spending power fluctuating dramatically due to market volatility. Predictability: You know roughly how much fiat currency your stablecoins will convert to. Wider Acceptance Potential: As spending ramps up, stablecoins offer a more reliable medium for merchants receiving payments (even if indirectly via conversion). This focus makes the card a practical tool for daily expenses, not just for spending speculative gains. Exploring the Exodus Baanx Partnership The collaboration between Exodus Baanx is foundational to this new offering. Exodus brings its large user base of over six million users and its established, user-friendly wallet technology. Baanx, on the other hand, specializes in providing crypto-friendly financial services infrastructure, including card issuance and processing capabilities, often in partnership with traditional financial institutions like Mastercard. This partnership is a classic example of a crypto-native company leveraging the expertise and regulatory compliance of a fintech provider to access traditional financial rails. Baanx facilitates the complex backend operations required to issue cards, manage conversions, and process transactions through the Mastercard network, allowing Exodus to focus on its core wallet experience and user interface. Key aspects of the partnership: Leveraging Expertise: Exodus focuses on the wallet and user experience, Baanx handles the financial infrastructure and compliance. Accessing Networks: Baanx’s connections enable the card to operate on the global Mastercard network. Scalability: This model allows Exodus to potentially scale the card offering to its vast user base. The synergy between Exodus Baanx is what makes this crypto-to-fiat spending solution possible on a large scale. Making Everyday Crypto Payments a Reality The launch of the Exodus card is a significant step towards making everyday crypto payments a mainstream reality. While other crypto cards exist, the integration directly within the popular Exodus wallet simplifies the process for its existing users. Currently, the card is undergoing beta testing at BTC Vegas, a relevant event for the crypto community. This testing phase allows Exodus and Baanx to gather feedback and refine the user experience before a wider rollout. The plan is to make the card available to Exodus’s six million users later this year, a move that could significantly increase the volume of stablecoin transactions in the real economy. What this means for users: Enhanced Liquidity: Your stablecoins are no longer just sitting in a wallet; they are liquid assets ready to be spent. Convenience: Pay for goods and services online or in physical stores with your crypto holdings. Potential for Global Use: Accepted anywhere Mastercard is, offering flexibility for travelers or online shoppers. This initiative pushes the boundaries of how people interact with their digital assets, making crypto payments feel much more like using traditional money. Considering the Details: Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights While the prospect of spending crypto directly is exciting, potential users should consider several factors: Benefits: Ease of Use: Spend crypto like fiat currency. Global Acceptance: Works anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Direct Integration: Seamlessly linked to your Exodus wallet. Stablecoin Focus: Reduces volatility risk for spending. Challenges & Considerations: Fees: Be aware of potential conversion fees, transaction fees, or card maintenance fees. These can vary and impact the effective cost of using your crypto. Tax Implications: In many jurisdictions, spending cryptocurrency is considered a taxable event (a capital gain or loss). Users need to understand their local tax obligations. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for crypto cards is still evolving and can vary by region. Conversion Rates: While stablecoins aim for stability, minor fluctuations or the specific exchange rate used at the moment of conversion could impact the final fiat amount. Limited Asset Support (Initial): Currently focused on USDT and USDC. Support for other assets may come later, but for now, it’s stablecoin-centric. Actionable Insights for Users: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Exodus regarding the full rollout, terms, and fees. Understand the Fees: Before using the card extensively, make sure you are clear on all associated costs. Know Your Tax Obligations: Consult with a tax professional to understand how spending crypto impacts your taxes. Start Small: If you are new to crypto cards, perhaps try using it for smaller purchases first to get comfortable with the process and monitor transactions. Secure Your Wallet: As the card is linked to your Exodus wallet, ensure your wallet security practices are robust. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Crypto Adoption The launch of the Exodus crypto debit card in partnership with Baanx marks a significant milestone in the journey towards widespread cryptocurrency adoption. By providing a simple, convenient way for millions of Exodus users to spend their stablecoins like USDT and USDC through the ubiquitous Mastercard network, this initiative removes significant barriers to entry for everyday crypto commerce. While currently in beta, the planned rollout to Exodus’s six million users later this year has the potential to dramatically increase the practical utility of stablecoins and make crypto payments a more common sight in the global economy. As with any financial tool involving cryptocurrency, users should proceed with awareness regarding fees, taxes, and security, but the fundamental promise of seamless spending offered by the Exodus crypto card is a powerful step forward for the entire ecosystem.

The Nasdaq Composite also gained, rising about 1.3% as stocks began the holiday-shortened week on a winning note. The potential for a U.S.-EU deal will add to agreements between the United States and China and the U.S. and United Kingdom. Global stocks rose amid the two deals, the latter seeing the Dow surge over 1,000 points and the S&P 500 go on to notch a six-day winning streak.

2025-05-27T13:30:16.000Z,"Bitcoin Price: Warning Signs Emerge for Potential Correction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Warning Signs Emerge for Potential Correction Are you invested in Bitcoin? Keeping a close eye on the latest market signals is crucial, especially when prominent analysts weigh in. Recently, well-known on-chain analyst Willy Woo shared insights suggesting that the current state of the crypto market might be flashing cautionary signs for the Bitcoin price . What is Willy Woo Saying About the Bitcoin Price? Willy Woo, highly regarded in the crypto community for his data-driven approach to market analysis, has pointed to specific on-chain metrics that indicate potential headwinds for Bitcoin. His recent observations, shared on platform X, highlight concerns about excessive speculation and investor behavior at current price levels. According to Woo, one key metric, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator , is signaling that investors are taking profits. While profit-taking is a natural part of any market cycle, excessive or widespread profit realization, especially after a significant run-up, can indicate that selling pressure is mounting. Woo specifically noted: Investor profits are peaking, suggesting a potential top in the short term. The SOPR indicator reaching certain levels often precedes market cool-downs or corrections. If Bitcoin doesn’t establish new all-time highs relatively soon, long-term charts could show bearish divergences, a technical pattern that often signals a potential trend reversal or significant pullback. Understanding the SOPR Indicator and Bearish Divergence To fully grasp Woo’s warning, let’s break down the concepts he mentioned: The SOPR Indicator: SOPR stands for Spent Output Profit Ratio. It’s an on-chain metric that looks at the average profit or loss of all coins moved on a given day. It’s calculated by dividing the realized value (price when sold) by the acquisition value (price when bought) for all spent outputs. Here’s what different values mean: SOPR > 1: On average, coins moved were sold at a profit. SOPR On average, coins moved were sold at a loss. SOPR = 1: On average, coins moved broke even. When SOPR is significantly above 1 and stays there, it indicates that market participants are, on average, selling for profit. While this is normal, extended periods or rapid spikes can suggest euphoria and potential overextension, making the market vulnerable to a Bitcoin correction . Bearish Divergence: In technical analysis, a bearish divergence occurs when the price of an asset makes a higher high, but a related indicator (like RSI, MACD, or potentially on-chain metrics smoothed over time) makes a lower high. This divergence suggests that the underlying momentum supporting the price increase is weakening, even as the price itself pushes higher. If Bitcoin’s price were to struggle to make new highs while certain long-term on-chain indicators like SOPR (or derivatives of it) show declining strength, it could form a bearish divergence pattern, increasing the probability of a downward move. Why is a Lull in Capital Flows Concerning for the Crypto Market? Willy Woo also highlighted a noticeable slowdown in capital inflows following a hypothetical significant rally (as mentioned in the source, from $75,000 to $112,000 – Note: This specific rally did not occur recently in real market history, but the principle of observing capital flows after a rally remains relevant to the analyst’s point ). Capital flows, whether from new investors entering the market or existing holders deploying more capital, are the fuel for price increases. Think of it like this: Strong Inflows: More buyers entering than sellers, pushing prices up. Weak/Lulling Inflows: The buying pressure is decreasing. If selling pressure (like profit-taking signaled by SOPR) remains constant or increases while buying slows down, the path of least resistance for the price is downwards. A lull suggests that the immediate impetus that drove the recent rally might be fading. This shift in momentum makes the market more susceptible to pullbacks, especially if combined with signals of profit-taking like those from the SOPR indicator . Potential Scenarios and Challenges Ahead Based on Woo’s analysis, here are some potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price : Scenario 1: Continued Sideways Movement or Minor Pullback If profit-taking continues but is met with moderate buying interest, Bitcoin might trade sideways or experience a shallow correction as the market digests the recent gains and the supply absorbed by profit-takers is gradually bought up by new demand. Scenario 2: Increased Profit-Taking Leading to a Significant Bitcoin Correction If the signals from the SOPR indicator intensify, leading to a cascade of selling pressure (perhaps triggered by a negative news event or broader market sentiment shift), the price could see a more significant downturn. This aligns with Woo’s warning about a potential correction if profit-taking accelerates. Scenario 3: Overcoming Signals and Pushing to New Highs Despite the warning signs, markets are dynamic. A sudden influx of significant buying pressure (e.g., from institutional investors or positive macroeconomic news) could potentially override the bearish signals, allowing Bitcoin to break through resistance and set new highs, invalidating the potential bearish divergence scenario. The main challenge for investors is navigating this period of uncertainty. Relying on a single indicator or analyst’s view can be risky. The crypto market is known for its volatility and rapid shifts in sentiment. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the potential for a Bitcoin correction and the signals from analysts like Willy Woo, what steps can investors consider? Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance. If you’ve made significant profits, consider taking some off the table or setting stop-loss orders to protect gains. Stay Informed: Keep watching key on-chain indicators like SOPR, funding rates, and exchange flows. Follow reputable analysts but understand that no one has a crystal ball. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re accumulating Bitcoin, continue with a DCA strategy. Corrections can present opportunities for buying at lower prices. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just react to headlines. Try to understand the underlying reasons behind market movements, whether they are driven by speculation, fundamental adoption, or macroeconomic factors. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a major focus, consider the broader crypto market and how different assets might perform in various scenarios. These are not financial recommendations, but rather points to consider as part of your own research and strategy. Summary: Is a Bitcoin Correction on the Horizon? Willy Woo’s analysis serves as a timely reminder that even after significant price rallies, caution is warranted. Signals from the SOPR indicator pointing to increased profit-taking and observations of a lull in capital flows suggest that the immediate bullish momentum may be waning. While not a definitive prediction, these signs raise the probability of a potential Bitcoin correction or a period of consolidation. Investors should pay close attention to how these on-chain dynamics evolve and consider managing their risk accordingly in the ever-watchful crypto market .

Trump Media & Technology Group reportedly plans a $3 billion investment in cryptocurrencies. India’s crypto industry advocates for tax reforms to revive domestic digital asset trading. Bitcoin reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $112,000 on May 22, but data shows that the daily trading volume was notably low at $20 billion. This is over 50% less than volumes observed during previous big events, such as Trump’s inauguration day or last year’s ATH in December. For comparison, daily trading volume hit $55 billion during Trump’s inauguration and $53 billion during the December 2024 ATH. This points out that traders may be exercising caution, possibly awaiting further market developments or clearer signals before increasing their activity.

The company said it will continue to serve the U.S. sports betting and global iGaming markets, but the ETH strategy signals a dual identity as a public vehicle with crypto exposure. “This is a significant milestone in SharpLink’s journey,” said CEO Rob Phythian. “We look forward to working with Consensys and welcoming Joseph to the Board.” You might also like: WinnerMining launches efficient cloud mining amid 2025 Bitcoin Conference Joseph Lubin to join the company’s Board Joseph Lubin will become Chairman of the Board after the deal closes, marking a deeper alignment between SharpLink and the Ethereum ecosystem. “This is an exciting time for the Ethereum community,” said Lubin. “We look forward to working with SharpLink to explore and develop their Ethereum Treasury Strategy.” The offering was conducted in reliance on private placement exemptions and includes a registration rights agreement for resale of the shares.

2025-05-27T13:25:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Declines But Analysts Expect Bounce To $120,000","Bitcoin’s (BTC) momentum has waned this week as markets remained flat thanks to the extended weekend. Price action remained muted despite Strategy announcing its latest Bitcoin purchase. The firm completed the acquisition of 4,020 BTC for $427 million, taking its total stash to over 580,000 BTC . The flagship cryptocurrency experienced selling pressure as short-term holders faced margin calls and liquidations. However, long-term holders took advantage and increased their accumulation. Robert Kiyosaki Calls Bitcoin “Easiest Money Ever” Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki believes Bitcoin (BTC) represents the easiest way in history to become rich, citing the asset’s limited supply and endorsements from prominent industry figures. Kiyosaki’s comments came after the flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high, hovering around $110,000. The author also said this was just the beginning of Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, predicting a move to $250,000 by the end of the year. Kiyosaki expressed disbelief at investors who had not yet embraced Bitcoin , saying that even holdings as small as 0.01 BTC could become priceless within years. He pointed at the asset’s limited supply as a key driver for future price appreciation. “I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich…so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years and maybe make you very rich. Sure, Bitcoin goes up and down, but so does real life. There are only 1 or 2 million Bitcoin left to be mined, and the price will go as Raoul Pal describes, into the Banana Zone.” Bitcoin (BTC) Trades Flat On Memorial Day Bitcoin (BTC) traded flat on Monday, ending the session where it began after some negligible intraday price action. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly crossed the $110,000 mark but fell back by the afternoon, with trading volumes lower than usual thanks to the extended weekend. Analysts believe Bitcoin could still move towards $120,000. Analyst Aziz Zamani stated, “The bullish market structure remains intact. From the key swing low at $91,500, Bitcoin has consistently carved out higher lows and higher highs which represents signs of a strong trend. As long as $106,500 continues to hold, momentum remains with the bulls. The current pause in the market appears to be a consolidation within an uptrend rather than a reversal or topping pattern.” However, several macroeconomic factors could set the tone for the week on Tuesday. President Trump announced a delay in the planned 50% tariff on imports from the EU, pushing the deadline from June 1 to July 9, easing immediate fears of another trade war. Markets are also waiting for key data releases, with consumer confidence data set to be released on Tuesday, followed by a GDP report on Thursday and GDP figures on Friday. Was Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Driven By The Japanese Bond Market Crisis? BTC’s surge to a new all-time high could be linked to ongoing issues in the Japanese bond market, indicating BTC’s growing reputation as a hedge against instability in traditional financial systems. Analysts also attributed the surge to geopolitical developments, while macroeconomic developments have also played a significant role in dictating BTC’s recent price action. According to Bitwise’s head of European research, Andre Dragosch, Japan’s long-term bond yields have registered a substantial spike. The 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20 before retreating to 3.115% on May 23. Government bonds are considered safe-haven assets. However, a sharp increase in yields suggests investors are concerned about fiscal sustainability and repayment risk. Dragosch stated, “Because yields are increasing, sustainability becomes more of an issue, meaning credit risk increases, meaning yields increase even more. And so you end up in this kind of fiscal debt doom loop. This is now affecting other bond markets, especially the US Treasury market. Bitcoin is an immutable asset. It’s free of counterparty risk. It’s a hedge against sovereign risk and sovereign default. Perceived default risk continues rising yields continue rising. This is a rough benchmark of why Bitcoin could be heading toward $200,000.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week on a mellow note as US markets remained closed thanks to the extended Memorial Day weekend. Some analysts believe that besides the holiday, BTC’s rally to a new all-time high has triggered buyer fatigue. The rally dragged the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) into the overbought zone, suggesting an imminent decline. Signs of waning momentum emerged as the RSI dropped below 70 after a 15% decline. Market intelligence firm Glassnode stated, “This decline may signal cooling buyer enthusiasm, reduction in upward momentum, and a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.” Data from Glassnode also shows that while Bitcoin futures Open Interest reached an all-time high and funding rates increased, the perpetual CVD trended lower, suggesting stronger sell-side flows. “The persistent decline in CVD reflects bearish sentiment, highlighting dominant sell-side pressure in Bitcoin’s futures market.” Analysts believe BTC could break out to $150,000, with AlphaBTC stating, “Bitcoin is still holding above the 106K level. After taking the all-time high, I am watching how $BTC performs over the next couple of days. Ideally, it blasts up and shows strength to leave the breakout to be tested in the future.” BTC registered a marginal decline on Friday (May 16) and Saturday to settle at $103,235. The price rebounded on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a decline of almost 1%. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to reclaim $106,000 and settle at $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. Source: TradingView BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, surging to $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,582. Price action turned bearish on Friday thanks to President Trump’s renewed tariff threats. As a result, BTC fell nearly 4% to $107,356. The drop also occurred after the flagship cryptocurrency encountered a wall of resistance around $112,000. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Sunday to settle at $109,095. Price action was muted on Monday as BTC registered a marginal increase, briefly rising above $110,000 before settling at $109,453.

2025-05-27T13:21:23.000Z,"Here’s why XRP price could blast to $10 in 2025","XRP’s price has remained consolidated over the first half of the year, currently trading at the same level it was at the beginning of the year. Ripple ( XRP ) was trading at $2.3188 on May 27, down 32% from its peak in November last year. This price action has unfolded despite numerous bullish catalysts, including ETF applications, the launch of CME futures, and the resolution of the SEC vs. Ripple case. Still, there are signs that this consolidation could lead to more gains in the long term, including a potential surge to $10. XRP price chart points to an eventual surge One potential catalyst for the XRP price is supportive technicals that may trigger a strong breakout in the coming months. First, the coin formed a giant cup and handle pattern at $1.966 between April 2021 and November last year. This pattern features a rounded bottom followed by consolidation at the top. The cup section has been completed, and the coin is now forming the handle. The cup has a depth of about 85%, and projecting the same distance from its upper edge gives a target price of $3.66. Second, XRP has also formed a bullish pennant pattern, consisting of a vertical rally followed by a symmetrical triangle. A breakout appears likely as the two trendlines approach confluence. You might also like: Quant eyes $146 as inverse H&S breakout fuels bullish reversal hopes Additionally, Ripple is supported by both short- and long-term moving averages. A bullish breakout would be confirmed if the price rises above the year-to-date high of $3.4. A move above that level could open the door to further gains, potentially reaching the psychological threshold at $5, an increase of 117% from the current level. Flipping $5 would bring the next key psychological level at $10 into view. A rally to $10 would mark a 335% surge from current levels, a plausible scenario given XRP’s nearly 500% jump in November. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news Potential catalysts for Ripple surge Several catalysts could push XRP to $10 this year. First, on the macro front, analysts expect the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in September. Such a move would likely lift Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoin prices. Second, there are rumors that BlackRock is preparing to enter the XRP ETF race, joining firms like VanEck and Franklin Templeton. That would be a significant bullish signal, given BlackRock’s influence in the ETF space. The odds that the SEC will approve XRP ETFs are over 80% on Polymarket . If approved, these products could see strong inflows, as evidenced by the leveraged XXRP ETF, which has amassed $112 million in assets in under two months. Meanwhile, data shows that XRP whales are accumulating. Addresses holding over 1 million XRP have acquired billions of tokens in recent months, positioning for a continued rally. XRP whales are buying | Source: Santiment Further, Ripple Labs is aiming to onboard more U.S. companies to the RippleNet ecosystem following the end of its legal battle with the SEC. This, along with the HiddenRoad acquisition, is expected to drive increased activity on the XRP Ledger network.

This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy.

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools.

This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings.

Source: CointelegraphRelated: SEC acknowledges slew of crypto ETF filings as reviews, approvals accelerateChanging regulatory stanceUnder the previous US presidential administration, the SEC brought enforcement actions against several crypto firms for offering staking services it alleged were unregistered securities offerings.Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the SEC has softened its stance.In February, the agency issued guidance stating that memecoins do not qualify as investment contracts under US law. In April, the regulator clarified that stablecoins also do not qualify as securities if they are marketed solely as a means of making payments.Still, the agency has yet to approve staking in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or issue formal guidance on how staking services can be offered compliantly in the US.Other policy goalsMuehr said she is optimistic the SEC will eventually approve staking for cryptocurrency ETFs, including for proposed Solana (SOL) funds.“Getting there means first getting the SEC comfortable with the structure,” she said, noting the industry has recently had “some productive meetings with the agency.”“I’m hopeful we’ll see a Solana ETF and even a staked Solana ETF in the US sometime soon.”The SEC is not the only agency the crypto industry is looking to persuade. Muehr said the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — the top US tax authority — has also taken a position the industry opposes.“The IRS finally issued a statement saying staking rewards are service income,” she said. “We disagree with that interpretation and continue to engage.”Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-industry-groups-urge-sec-to-clarify-staking-stance?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

Investors in their 30s saw the biggest growth, up 29%, followed by those in their 40s (27%), while investors over 50 increased by 25%.The FIU’s findings show that older investors have larger holdings. By year-end, 221,000 investors held at least 100 million won (about $73,000) in crypto. Of those, 172,500 — or 78% — were over 40.Related: XRP and Solana race toward the next crypto ETF approvalIn February, the head of the financial industry association urged regulators to approve Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, citing rising demand among older investors. He argued that ETFs offer safer exposure than direct investment.The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has been a key campaign pledge for both Lee Jae-myung and Kim.

It’s a bit disappointing — we could have taken the lead ourselves,” Cho Jaewoo, assistant professor of social science at Hansung University, told Cointelegraph.However, the nation’s Capital Markets Act is a barrier that does not recognize crypto as eligible assets underlying ETFs. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ETFs under its dedicated crypto committee.Lee ahead in presidential election voter surveyYoon’s failed coup accelerated the presidential election and brought renewed urgency to unresolved issues in the local crypto industry.“In the 2022 presidential election, cryptocurrency was viewed as speculative and untrustworthy. But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said.South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In Q1 2024, the Korean won ranked as the most-traded fiat currency against crypto, driven largely by retail investors. Institutional players remain on the sidelines, awaiting their turn as the FSC prepares to launch pilot trading for professional investors.FSC’s planned schedule for a phased introduction of institutional crypto investment in 2025.Crypto policies were once seen as campaign strategies to sway younger voters, but this year, they’re seen as an economic and social issue that impacts multiple generations. In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs.“Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active. In the past, people looked at it with skepticism, but now it feels like the public is approaching it more neutrally and making their own judgments,” Cho said.Lee Jae-myung leads the latest voter survey by local media and Next Research.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption.

The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction.

The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto.

Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

The restrictions specifically mentioned China, and the government cited concern over the risk that the technology “may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, its market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when US export restrictions first impacted its products, to 50% currently. Jensen Huang on Taiwanese TV.

The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn't be outraged.”“Look, I don't know anything about the dinner,” Johnson answered, claiming he “was a little busy this past week,” focusing on passing a $1.6 trillion federal budget funding bill.“I'm not going to comment on something I haven't even heard about.

2025-05-26T03:27:00.000Z,"Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure rule","American banking and financial industry advocacy groups have petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to repeal its cybersecurity incident public disclosure requirements. Five US banking groups led by the American Bankers Association asked the regulator to remove its rule in a May 22 letter, arguing that disclosing cybersecurity incidents “directly conflicts with confidential reporting requirements intended to protect critical infrastructure and warn potential victims.”The group, which also included the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Bank Policy Institute, Independent Community Bankers of America and the Institute of International Bankers, claimed that the rule compromises regulatory efforts to enhance national cybersecurity.The SEC’s Cybersecurity Risk Management rule, published in July 2023, requires companies to rapidly disclose cybersecurity incidents such as data breaches or hacks. However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling. Source: SIFMAThe groups specifically want “Item 1.05” to be rescinded from the SEC’s rules for Form 8-K reporting and parallel reporting requirements applicable to Form 6-K. Form 8-K is used to publicly notify investors in US public companies of specified events, including cybersecurity incidents, that may be important to shareholders or the SEC. “Critically, without Item 1.05, investor interests will still be protected, and we believe they would be better served through the pre-existing disclosure framework for reporting material information, which may include material cybersecurity incidents,” the groups stated.Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain cryptoThe full petition included examples of confusion from participants, specific incidents of ransomware attacks and documented regulatory conflicts. Public crypto companies impacted The requirement also impacts publicly listed crypto companies such as Coinbase, which disclosed earlier this month that hackers had bribed its support staff to leak its user data.The disclosure saw the company hit with at least seven lawsuits over the disclosure.Coinbase said that it rejected a $20 million ransom demand after staff leaked user data in a major phishing attack, which the exchange said could cost it up to $400 million in damages.If the SEC rescinds the requirement, it may give firms such as Coinbase more time to disclose cybersecurity incidents to the public. Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/banking-groups-tell-sec-drop-cybersecurity-incident-disclosure-rule?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, the stock did stage a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase stock closed down over 3% on May 23 at $263, falling another $1.62 after the bell.

Source: Google FinanceNessler’s complaint is seemingly the first to argue damages caused by Coinbase’s stock drop following its breach disclosure in a series of recent class-action lawsuits over the incident.The crypto exchange was hit with at least six lawsuits in the days after disclosing the data breach, all accusing it of mishandling the incident and failing to protect their data. UK agreement breach hurt stock, suit saysThe FCA fined Coinbase’s UK arm $4.5 million in July 2024 for breaching a 2020 voluntary agreement preventing the exchange from onboarding customers considered high risk by the regulator.The FCA said Coinbase onboarded 13,416 customers that the regulator considered high-risk and offered them crypto services.Related: Coinbase presses to axe rule banning SEC staff from holding cryptoNessler said in the suit that the fine saw Coinbase’s stock fall by over 5%, closing at $231.52 on July 25, 2024.Nessler also claimed that Coinbase didn’t disclose it had breached this agreement when the exchange first listed its shares on the Nasdaq in April 2021, and as a result, “the market price of the Company’s securities had been artificially,” inflated. Nessler claims had she known about the agreement violation, she would not have purchased the stock at the “artificially inflated prices.”Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The class suit was filed on behalf of anyone who bought Coinbase stock between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025, and is asking for damages and a jury trial. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and chief financial officer Alesia Haas are also named as defendants.Another lawsuit filed in Illinois on May 13, alleges Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-another-breach-related-class-lawsuit-stock-drop?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
