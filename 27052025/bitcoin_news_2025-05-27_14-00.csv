2025-05-27T11:53:12.000Z,"Michael Saylor Warns: On-Chain Proof-of-Reserves Is Risky","The crypto community controversy over proof-of-reserves has taken a new turn, with MicroStrategy CEO and self-described Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor recently calling on-chain proof-of-reserves ”a security nightmare.” Saylor's comments, which have stirred controversy among the broader crypto community, highlight growing concerns about privacy and security when exchanges publish wallet addresses. Saylor's Security Concerns Saylor argues that requiring exchanges to publish their public wallet addresses leaves them in high risk. ”If you force companies to disclose all their addresses, you open up an executive kidnapping risk and a security nightmare for the company,” he said. Saylor also warned that openness could draw MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks, where malicious actors exploit transaction ordering for profit. Instead of on-chain proofs, Saylor favors third-party auditing as a more pragmatic and secure means. ”The correct answer is a reputable, independent, trusted auditor,” he stated, suggesting that conventional financial regulation offers superior protection for both corporations and clients. Alternative Approaches: Binance and Kraken Saylor's move comes as leading exchanges test different proof-of-reserves protocols. Binance, for example, uses a Merkle-tree-based protocol. The system allows users to verify that their funds are part of the exchange's overall reserves, without revealing the entire list of balances or addresses. The Merkle tree system provides cryptographic proof of reserves while maintaining an element of privacy. Kraken, however, has implemented a zero-knowledge proof system. This advanced cryptographic technique enables Kraken to prove to users that it has sufficient reserves to cover customers' balances without disclosing any sensitive on-chain data. Zero-knowledge proofs are praised for their ability to balance transparency and confidentiality, addressing most of the concerns Saylor has. The proof-of-reserves argument is wide open. On-chain transparency supporters argue that public audits need to be in place in order to bring back confidence in the wake of prominent exchange collapses. Opponents, like Saylor, counter that full transparency brings new risks to exchanges and users alike. Industry norms are still in development. Although Merkle-tree and zero-knowledge proofs offer promising alternatives, these also require users to assume that exchanges utilize these systems honestly and efficiently. Third-party audits, Saylor's preference being noted, can provide another layer of assurance, yet their usefulness rests in the auditor's reputation and liberty. Practical Challenges and Regulatory Perspectives Aside from technical and security concerns, exchanges also have to contend with a complex regulatory landscape. Regulators in different jurisdictions have varying requirements for transparency and auditability, which would complicate the ability of global exchanges to adopt a one-size-fits-all solution. Furthermore, the rapid progress of cryptographic verification means that best practice today would not be very long-lived. For clients, the answer lies in remaining vigilant and informed. As the proof-of-reserves brouhaha continues, users must look not only at exchanges' practices but also at how frequently and transparently they report. At the end of the day, the goal is to keep user balances safe, accessible, and auditable without exposing exchanges or their users to excessive risk. The bottom line Michael Saylor's warning about the danger of on-chain proof-of-reserves has put into question an important debate in the crypto world. With the consideration of advantages and disadvantages between openness, privacy, and security by the exchanges, the search for best practices continues. Regardless of whether the future of proof-of-reserves is cryptography, third-party auditing, or a combination of both, one thing is for sure: openness must be matched with protection in order to preserve user trust and security.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9290/michael-saylor-speaks-out-against-proof-of-reserves,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BNB","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T11:45:13.000Z,"BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard Accused by US Government of Colluding To Drive Up Energy Prices","US government authorities are accusing the asset management giants BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard of colluding against the coal industry. In November of last year, 11 state attorneys general, led by Texas AG Ken Paxton, accused the three financial firms of engaging in an anticompetitive conspiracy to drive down coal production. The attorneys general allege the firms tapped their influence as shareholders in competing coal companies to reduce industrywide coal output, illegally sharing competitively sensitive information in the process. Now, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) have filed a “Statement of Interest” in support of the AGs’ case. The federal officials argue that BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard’s alleged conduct increased energy prices for consumers and businesses. “This case is not about ordinary activity by asset managers such as passive index investing or even pro-competitive activism. As alleged, the holders of large quantities of stock in competing companies agreed to use those shareholdings to reduce the output of US coal to increase profits at the expense of American consumers and businesses. This case is about precisely the sort of conduct, including concerted efforts to reduce output, which have long been condemned under the antitrust laws.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-27T11:40:05.000Z,"Here’s Why Cryptos Like Solana (SOL) and Salamanca (DON) Token Are Eyeing Massive Upside This Coming Week","The post Here’s Why Cryptos Like Solana (SOL) and Salamanca (DON) Token Are Eyeing Massive Upside This Coming Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has seen new trends as more projects gain popularity. Solana (SOL) and Salamanca (DON) have gained a lot of attention and are expected to see strong growth in the next week. The digital assets could attract more investors as the demand for scalable blockchain and meme coins increases. Salamanca (DON) Token Gains Momentum Among Crypto Investors Salamanca (DON) has become well known in the crypto world for its unique cultural themes and focus on its community. The token is inspired by the Salamanca cartel from the TV series Breaking Bad. It uses elements from memes, anime and pop culture to form its identity. $DON is based on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which provides investors with fast and low cost transactions. Salamanca has attracted more attention because of its recent achievements. Now, users can trade the token on Gate.io, MEXC and PancakeSwap. Gate.io, a top global exchange, offers high liquidity to help the project to grow. The $DON token’s rise has created a lot of excitement about its upcoming listing on Binance. According to analysts, the token could rise by 2000%, which makes it a top meme coin to watch in 2025. Trade $DON now on Gate.io: https://www.gate.io/zh/trade/DON_USDT With more than 105,000 members, Salamanca is also very active on social media. The $DON token has a trading volume of $4.45 million each day with a market cap of $2.21 million. As $DON gets listed on more exchanges, experts say the daily trading volume could grow to around $20 million. With the rise of meme coins’ popularity, Salamanca is ready for additional growth. Solana (SOL) Emerges as a Key Platform in the Digital Asset World Solana (SOL) is a top blockchain platform, providing a scalable environment for decentralized applications (dApps). Solana uses the innovative Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) models, which attract both developers and institutions that need fast and affordable blockchain solutions. SOL’s success is due to its increasing adoption, as its price steadily increases. The price of Solana has seen a 5.19% increase to $177.80 in the last 24 hours. Currently, Solana has a market cap of $92.46 billion with a daily trading volume of $6.31 billion. The Solana Foundation intends to improve DeFi and Web3 features, which has resulted in more projects being developed on the network. Additionally, with improved network stability and continuous upgrades, Solana attracts both developers and investors. Bitcoin’s Slipping Dominance Opens the Door for Altcoins Bitcoin (BTC) has recently seen a decline in its market dominance due to its high cost. With a market cap of $2.2 trillion and a price of $110,715.23, Bitcoin continues to attract investors. The rise in popularity for alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Salamanca (DON) is changing the market outlook. Bitcoin’s market share has increased to 64.18%, after an earlier dip below 62%. This shift in investors is due to including altcoins in their investments. As Solana and Salamanca become more popular, the rise of ecosystem-focused tokens and meme coins is expected to continue. This could position altcoins to compete more directly with Bitcoin in the next few years. Solana and Salamanca show great potential for growth as the cryptocurrency markets continue to develop. The tokens could see new updates in the coming week, which shows their potential in the digital asset world.

2025-05-27T11:38:38.000Z,"Google Researchers Claim Quantum Computers Could Break Bitcoin with 20x Less Effort than Previous Estimates","Google has released a research paper which suggests that quantum computers may be able to crack encryption standards, such as those used by Bitcoin , with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. A Google quantum researcher, Craig Gidney, said developers must ascertain the costs of creating quantum-safe cryptocurrencies to achieve the transition process. Cryptography standards, such as RSA, may be at a higher risk of being cracked than previously thought. Bitcoin users, especially those with custodial funds, may need to measure the risks to safeguard their crypto from quantum attacks. Quantum computing can solve complex puzzles, such as the ones used by Bitcoin to measure proof-of-work, thus presenting a new threat vector that places Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at risk. Bitcoin was designed for older computers, which are quickly becoming obsolete. Peter Shor, cryptographer and computer scientist, created a method called Shor’s algorithm to solve the complex puzzles used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Shor’s algorithm could be combined with a quantum computer to crack crypto wallets rapidly. An efficient algorithm, combined with a powerful computer, could increase the risk of a crypto portfolio, including digital assets that use proof-of-stake algorithms. Craig Gidney and Sophie Schmieg, quantum researchers at Google, discussed their findings on their Google security blog. They addressed the ability of quantum computers to crack public key cryptography, particularly RSA, which could be compromised with a quantum computer of around 1 million noisy qubits. They made this conclusion after taking into account recent advancements in quantum computing. The number of qubits required to crack cryptography is lower than previous estimates. The researchers outlined strategies corporations could take to mitigate the risks of quantum computers, such as collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to transition to a post-quantum computing world. Symmetric cryptography is largely unaffected by this attack. However, cryptography, such as that used by cryptocurrencies, is vulnerable to this attack due to the public exposure of addresses and the longevity of these wallets, providing attackers with a target they can attack for an extended period. NIST has set a timeline to phase out vulnerable systems by 2030 and ban them by 2035. Google has been confirming its strategy with NIST by implementing PQC signatures on its Cloud KMS service. IBM’s Condor, the most powerful quantum computer to date, can only reach 1,121 qubits, which is way short of the million qubits needed to crack RSA encryption. Cryptocurrency seems to be safe for now, unless a new technological innovation can dramatically increase the number of qubits. Google’s Sycamore, another quantum computer, can only get 53 qubits. However, the trend of quantum development suggests that crypto users must take these risks seriously. The Google researchers argue that the increased risk occurs because of technological advancements such as improved error correction and better algorithms. Modular exponentiation, for example, has been made more efficient, effectively doubling its speed. Modular arithmetic is a vital part of cryptographic systems. Further, the researchers found that error correction improvements can speed up their algorithm. They found that creating a separate layer for error correction allowed the qubits layer to be more dense, holding more information to be processed, speeding up the algorithm overall. The researchers could drop the qubit requirement by optimising code at a programmable level. Hackers could further exploit such optimizations to secretly lower the qubit requirements until a future date when quantum computers are more accessible. In early May 2025, BlackRock added a line to their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing, stating that quantum computing poses a risk to the long-term security of Bitcoin. The filing states that if quantum computing advances enough, it could be used to crack the underlying encryption algorithms used to power Bitcoin. BlackRock is concerned that quantum computers will undermine crypto markets and technology. Quantum computers can potentially disrupt the business model of Silicon Valley, potentially causing a market crash. BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, should consider the potential risks of quantum computers. The fact that such a large bank like BlackRock is taking the risk seriously shows that quantum risks could be closer than we think.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/google-researchers-claim-quantum-computers-could-break-bitcoin-with-20x-less-effort-than-previous-estimates/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|ZRX","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Google",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T11:30:52.000Z,"NYC Crypto Horror: New Kidnap Suspect To Turn Himself In – Reports","A second man believed to be connected to a disturbing crypto-related kidnapping in New York is expected to turn himself in to police soon. He’s reportedly a Swiss crypto investor tied to Joel Woeltz , the man already in custody for allegedly kidnapping and torturing a 28-year-old Italian man inside a luxury apartment in Soho. According to multiple reports , the second suspect may already be in custody, though sources differ. NBC New York claimed he would surrender within a week, while FOX5 cited conflicting updates suggesting police may have already arrested him. The unnamed man is said to be the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm. Victim Allegedly Held For 17 Days In Soho Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, a 28-year-old crypto investor from Italy, flew into New York on May 6 to meet his “business partners.” That meeting quickly turned into a nightmare. He was allegedly detained in the five-story Soho apartment for 17 days, during which he was tortured and abused in a bid to extract his crypto wallet seed phrase. Woeltz, nicknamed the “crypto king of Kentucky,” now faces serious charges including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and assault. He remains behind bars, with his next court appearance scheduled for May 28. His assistant, Beatrice Folchi, who is originally from Italy, was also arrested but has since been released without charges. Torture, Threats, And A Narrow Escape Police say Carturan was tied up with electrical cords, electrocuted, and even tased in the feet while they were submerged in water. He was allegedly forced to smoke crack cocaine, urinated on, and shown an electric chainsaw, which was used to threaten to cut off his limbs. Investigators say a Polaroid photo was found showing Carturan tied to a chair with a gun pointed at his head. The entire ordeal reportedly unfolded in an apartment filled with expensive liquor, stripper poles, and loud music — described by NBC reporters as resembling a “high-end frat house.” Carturan finally managed to escape on May 23. He told police that he tricked Woeltz into letting him retrieve his laptop, where the seed phrase was stored. As Woeltz turned his back, Carturan bolted, barefoot, toward a traffic officer outside. Crypto Wealth At The Center Of Attack NBC New York reported that Carturan’s net worth is estimated at $30 million. That figure may have made him an attractive target for a criminal scheme, one where access to a single passphrase could mean millions in stolen digital currency. Investigation Still Ongoing While Woeltz is already in custody, the fate of his alleged accomplice remains unclear. Reports from different outlets conflict over whether the Swiss trader has already turned himself in or is still arranging to do so. Police have not released his name. The investigation is still open, and more arrests could follow depending on what comes to light next. For now, the spotlight remains on Woeltz and the chilling claims that have stunned both the crypto world and the wider public.

2025-05-27T11:30:04.000Z,"Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally","Ethereum is trading above $2,600 after a volatile stretch that saw bulls regain momentum and push the price into a key resistance zone. The recent rebound has brought renewed optimism to the market, with ETH now flirting with a potential bullish continuation. Still, the path forward remains uncertain, as analysts warn of a possible retracement before any major breakout can take shape. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Over the past few days, ETH has shown strength, bouncing off local support and reclaiming short-term moving averages. This move has shifted sentiment, but it hasn’t been enough to fully escape the risk of a short-term pullback. Some market watchers argue that a healthy retrace from current levels would be normal before any sustainable rally above resistance. Top analyst Jelle added to the conversation with a simple but compelling insight: “If ETH goes back above $3,000, the real fun begins.” The $3,000 level has acted as a psychological and technical barrier throughout this cycle, and reclaiming it would likely ignite broader market momentum. Ethereum Leads Altcoins As $3,000 Becomes The Key Battleground Ethereum is showing notable strength among altcoins, leading the market with renewed momentum as bulls continue to push for a new bullish phase. After reclaiming the $2,600 level, ETH has been steadily building support and gaining traction, setting the stage for what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a broader altcoin resurgence. However, for a true altseason to materialize, Ethereum must first reclaim and hold above the $3,000 level. This threshold is more than just a psychological milestone—it has historically acted as a pivot for strong market-wide rallies. Many experts agree that ETH needs to break through this resistance to confirm leadership and spark confidence across the altcoin sector. Hope remains high, particularly among analysts who see Ethereum following Bitcoin’s lead. As BTC continues to test its all-time highs, some believe that once its current bullish impulse cools off, capital will rotate into ETH and other large-cap altcoins. This rotation could serve as the ignition point for a market-wide rally. Jelle supports this view, stating that if Ethereum reclaims $3,000, a bullish impulse will take place. According to his analysis, a confirmed breakout above this level would mark the start of a powerful continuation phase, likely sending ETH quickly toward $3,400 and beyond. Until then, Ethereum remains in a critical position—strong enough to lead, but still facing key resistance. If bulls maintain momentum and reclaim $3,000 with conviction, the stage will be set not only for Ethereum’s next leg up but for a full-scale altseason across the market. The coming days could prove decisive. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? ETH Consolidates Below 200-Day SMA Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,634 on the daily chart, consolidating just below a key resistance zone marked by the 200-day SMA at $2,699.60. After a sharp move up earlier in May, ETH has entered a sideways structure, with bulls defending the $2,500–$2,600 zone while attempting to break above the $2,700 level. Price action shows a tightening range, often a precursor to a breakout or breakdown. ETH is holding above the 34-day EMA ($2,513) and all shorter-term moving averages (50- and 100-day SMAs), signaling that bullish momentum remains intact in the short to mid-term. The fact that Ethereum is consolidating above key support levels rather than correcting sharply is a constructive sign for bulls. Volume remains relatively stable during this phase, suggesting neither buyers nor sellers have fully committed yet. A clean daily close above the 200-day SMA with volume could trigger the next bullish impulse, targeting the psychological $3,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Healthy – Data Shows No Signs Of Overheating However, failure to break resistance may result in a temporary pullback toward the $2,450–$2,500 support area.

The coin hit its all-time high of $111,814 on 22 May, falling 2.4% since. This is a pullback from the intraday high of $111,807, just a few dollars shy of a new ATH. At the same time, XRP recorded the highest loss: 2.2% to the price of $2.3. Of the top 100 coins, only 12 recorded price increases today. Quant (QNT) is the highest gainer and the only one with a double-digit increase. It’s up 10.2% to $106.1. Monero (XMR) fell the most in this category. It’s down 6% to the price of $392. Importantly, the crypto market is still highly influenced by the macroeconomic developments. And macro uncertainty currently grows. James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , argues that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility remains a significant concern. Its price is susceptible to rapid fluctuations due to market sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic shifts, he says. Notably, many analysts have been warning over the past few days that a correction is possible. A short-term pullback tends to follow period of rapid gain. Following a strong rally we saw over the past few days, investors may be capitalizing on profits. This behavior results in short-term sell-offs. There are also some discussions about potential regulatory measures in major markets, which we’ll discuss below. Investors may be more cautious at the moment. 10% Chance for BTC to Surpass $130,000 Nick Forster, Founder of decentralized onchain options AI-powered platform, Derive.xyz , commented that the rally has stalled slightly. Volatility for BTC and ETH has stayed consistent, at 45% and 72%, respectively. There’s a 10% chance of BTC surpassing $130,000 by the end of June. ETH has a 15% chance of exceeding $3,100 in the same time. Looking forward, “short-term, traders are anticipating a move upwards, evidenced by a large buy-up of calls on the $112,000 BTC strike for May 30,” Forster says. “However, expectations for BTC to remain below $110,000 by June 27 are also building, with a significant number of calls sold for that expiry.” Sustained uptrends require fresh demand. Notice the sharp rise in $BTC First Buyers from July–Dec 2024 and again in Mar–May 2025 – both aligned with major price expansions.

As BTC and ETH rise, market makers are forced to buy more to hedge, potentially triggering a short-term price spike. BTC traders on Derive.xyz are positioning for a move upward, Forster added. They’re also capitalizing on cheap volatility. “Over the past 24 hours, 55.6% of premiums traded were calls bought, with 22.3% puts purchased. For ETH, the distribution is more balanced, suggesting a more uncertain outlook and fairly priced volatility,” he concluded.

Trader Bags $2.54M by Flipping Long as Wynn Turned Bearish On May 25, as Wynn switched to a short position, 0x2258 went long on both BTC and ETH, closing the position on May 26 with another $2.54 million gain. When Wynn re-entered a long BTC trade that same day, the trader flipped short again, adding an unrealized $1.7 million in profit, according to Lookonchain’s latest data. The striking symmetry between 0x2258’s gains and Wynn’s moves has fueled speculation. What a smart trader! When @JamesWynnReal goes long, he goes short. When James Wynn goes short, he goes long.

On May 25, when… pic.twitter.com/dj8GourfWW — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 27, 2025 Some users on X questioned whether the wallet might be linked to Wynn himself, suggesting the possibility of hidden hedging or coordinated manipulation. “If it smells like fish, tastes like fish, and swims like fish, it’s probably a fish,” one user wrote, pointing to the uncanny alignment of trades. Others floated the theory that Wynn could be using public losses to generate engagement, while quietly managing risk through private wallets. Wynn pushed back swiftly. Responding directly to Lookonchain’s post, he denied any connection to 0x2258. “I only trade on one HL account and that’s public. Don’t start spreading fake news with zero proof,” he wrote. Not happy with this post at all. Whoever trader 0x2258 is, it is not me and have no clue who it is. I only trade on one HL account and thats public. Don't start spreading fake news with zero proof. — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) May 27, 2025 While the identity of 0x2258 remains unknown, the wallet’s run has become one of the most talked-about streaks on crypto trading X this week. Wynn Loses $36M After Trump’s Tariff Shock Shakes Markets Wynn took a major hit on May 23 after former President Donald Trump proposed a sweeping 50% tariff on all EU imports. The announcement triggered sharp sell-offs in both traditional and crypto markets, sending Bitcoin below $107,000 and dragging Ether to $2,504. Memecoins were hit especially hard, compounding losses across highly volatile tokens. According to data from HypurrScan , Wynn has lost over $36 million over the past week. Despite the setback, he remains $12 million in profit on his all-time trading record. Wynn, known for his aggressive use of leverage and affinity for memecoins, began trading on Hyperliquid two months ago after depositing $4.65 million in USDC. The decentralized exchange (DEX) is built on the Hyperliquid layer-1 chain and supports leveraged trading, spot markets, and lending services.

2025-05-27T11:24:30.000Z,"Bitcoin options open interest hits all-time high as traders bet big","Bitcoin derivatives market just set another record. Options open interest has soared to $48.85 billion, the highest level ever recorded, according to CoinGlass data from May 26. With Bitcoin trading at $109,700, traders are placing outsized bets, including growing interest in $300,000 strike call options set to expire on June 27. Bitcoin options open interest. Source: CoinGlass The surge in open interest shows a deepening layer of speculative and institutional activity now concentrated in the options market. Notably, this all-time high eclipses anything seen during prior bull cycles, underlining just how far the market has evolved. At the top of the leaderboard is Deribit, accounting for a staggering $36.02 billion of open interest. CME follows with $4.73 billion, then OKX at $3.46 billion, Binance with $1.48 billion, and Bybit at just under $1 billion. The dominance of Deribit reaffirms its role as the go-to venue for sophisticated Bitcoin options strategies. Meanwhile, exchange BTC futures open interest is also climbing, now sitting just below $90 billion. Bitcoin’s price and futures exposure have been rising in near lockstep, showing that leveraged participation is accelerating. Bitcoin futures open interest. Source: CoinGlass Why Bitcoin open interest matters For newer market participants, open interest refers to the total value of outstanding options contracts that haven’t been settled. It gives insight into how much capital is committed to the market, whether for speculation, hedging, or structured trades. In this case, the volume clustered around the $300,000 strike doesn’t necessarily imply a moonshot forecast. Positions that far out-of-the-money are often part of complex strategies, such as hedging spot holdings, capturing volatility, or managing asymmetric exposure. But the fact that traders are engaging at that level speaks to the scale of conviction, and the willingness to take on tail-risk bets. It’s not just retail enthusiasm either. CME’s sizable share of open interest reflects meaningful institutional involvement, particularly from funds seeking regulated exposure or hedging tools in advance of macro catalysts. All eyes are now on the June 27 expiry, which could become a volatility flashpoint. If Bitcoin maintains strength or pushes higher, market makers may be forced to hedge aggressively, amplifying price movement through gamma-driven dynamics. On the other hand, a sharp correction could trigger unwinds that intensify downside pressure.

Data from cryptocurrency exchange Bybit reveals $644 million in stolen funds — nearly half of the exchange’s massive $1.4 billion theft — has vanished from public tracking after being processed through mixing services. Approximately $693 million (or 49.5%) remains traceable, while exchanges and authorities have frozen $63 million (4.5%), the data shows. The stolen funds were systematically laundered through several mixing services. The largest portion — $247.5 million (around 966 BTC) — was laundered through Wasabi Wallet, while another $94.1 million laundered via eXch, a mixing service that publicly claimed to shut down in April but remains operational. Smaller amounts moved through Tornado Cash ($2.5 million in ETH) and Railgun ($1.7 million in ETH). You might also like: Safe Wallet responds to Bybit hack with major security improvements Of particular concern is eXch’s continued activity despite its alleged closure. As crypto.news reported earlier, analysts at TRM Labs confirmed that the service still functions through back-end APIs. The mixer’s pooled transactions create near-total opacity as “all received and sent transactions are mixed together and there is no way to discover how many people are behind certain addresses and traceability is extremely difficult,” TRM Labs explained. In a March article on X, analysts at crypto wallet interface platform Safe revealed that a North Korean hacking group known as TraderTraitor compromised a Safe{Wallet} developer’s laptop and used stolen AWS session tokens to bypass multi-factor authentication, gaining access to Bybit’s funds. The breach occurred in early February, when a Docker project — posing as a “stock investment simulator” — was downloaded onto Safe developer’s Mac.

2025-05-27T11:10:39.000Z,"Bitcoin Warning: Signals Point to Potential Price Correction After 7-Week Rally","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Warning: Signals Point to Potential Price Correction After 7-Week Rally Are you watching the Bitcoin price ? After an impressive seven-week surge, the leading cryptocurrency is flashing potential warning signs that could indicate a shift in momentum. While the overall sentiment for Bitcoin remains largely positive in the long term, short-term data points suggest it might be time to consider the possibility of a Bitcoin correction . Let’s dive into the key indicators causing market analysts to raise cautious eyebrows and explore what this could mean for the broader crypto market . Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Bull Run For the past seven weeks, Bitcoin has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. This rally saw the Bitcoin price climb significantly, fueled by a combination of factors including growing investor confidence, positive macroeconomic signals, and increasing anticipation around key industry developments. This period of sustained growth is characteristic of a bull run, where buying pressure dominates and prices consistently move higher. During this rally, many investors who entered the market earlier saw their holdings appreciate considerably. The momentum felt strong, leading some to believe the ascent would continue uninterrupted. However, financial markets, especially volatile ones like cryptocurrency, rarely move in a straight line indefinitely. Periods of rapid appreciation are often followed by pullbacks or corrections as the market digests gains and participants re-evaluate their positions. Decoding the Data: What Are the Warning Signals? Several on-chain and market indicators are now suggesting that the bullish momentum might be losing steam, potentially paving the way for a Bitcoin correction . Two specific data points have caught the attention of analysts: 1. The Glassnode Accumulation Trend Score Drop According to data from Glassnode, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, the Accumulation Trend Score for wallets holding over 10,000 BTC has seen a notable decline. This metric tracks the aggregate accumulation or distribution behavior of market participants over a specific timeframe. A score closer to 1 indicates strong accumulation (buying), while a score closer to 0 suggests distribution (selling). What Happened: The score for these large holders dropped significantly from a high of 0.8 down to below 0.5 in May. What it Means: This shift indicates that some of the largest players, often referred to as ‘whales,’ have moved from accumulating Bitcoin to either holding steady or, more importantly, starting to sell or distribute their holdings. Significance: Whales hold a substantial amount of Bitcoin , and their selling activity can exert significant downward pressure on the Bitcoin price , potentially triggering a correction. Their moves are often watched closely as they can signal shifts in market sentiment among large capital holders. 2. CryptoQuant’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Data Another key indicator comes from CryptoQuant, another leading on-chain analytics platform. Their data focuses on Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), which essentially represent blocks of Bitcoin that haven’t been spent yet. Analyzing UTXOs by the price at which they were last moved can give insights into the profitability of the current supply. What Happened: CryptoQuant data shows that 99% of all UTXOs are currently in a state of profit. This means that 99% of the existing Bitcoin supply was acquired at a price lower than the current market price. What it Means: When such a high percentage of the supply is in profit, it increases the likelihood of profit-taking. Investors who bought at lower prices have a strong incentive to sell some or all of their holdings to realize gains. Significance: Historically, periods where a vast majority of the Bitcoin supply is in profit have often preceded market corrections. This is because widespread profit-taking can flood the market with sell orders, overwhelming buying demand and causing the Bitcoin price to fall. It signals a potential peak in market exuberance before a necessary cooling-off period. The Mechanism of a Bitcoin Correction A Bitcoin correction is typically defined as a sharp, short-term price decline, usually between 10% and 20%, from a recent peak. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any market cycle. They help to: Shake out overleveraged positions. Allow the market to cool down after rapid gains. Provide opportunities for new investors to enter at lower prices. Test support levels and validate the strength of the overall trend. The signals from Glassnode and CryptoQuant point towards increased selling pressure driven by large holders and widespread profitability. This confluence of factors creates an environment ripe for a correction. Potential Drivers of Short-Term Profit-Taking Why might investors, especially large ones, decide to take profits now? Realizing Gains: After a significant rally, locking in profits is a standard investment strategy. Risk Management: Reducing exposure during periods of high profitability can mitigate potential losses if the market turns south. Rebalancing Portfolios: Investors may sell Bitcoin to reallocate funds to other assets or asset classes. Anticipation of Dip: Some traders might sell now with the intention of buying back at a lower Bitcoin price during the expected correction. While these actions are rational for individual investors, collective profit-taking across the crypto market can cascade into a broader price decline. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? As Bitcoin is the undisputed leader of the crypto market , its price movements often dictate the direction of altcoins. A significant Bitcoin correction would likely lead to pullbacks across the entire market. Altcoins, especially those with lower liquidity, can experience even steeper percentage declines than Bitcoin during such periods. This interconnectedness means that even if you primarily invest in altcoins, paying attention to Bitcoin price signals is crucial for navigating the broader crypto market . A correction could present buying opportunities for altcoins as well, but it also increases the overall market risk in the short term. Despite Short-Term Risks, Why Are Analysts Optimistic Long-Term? While the short-term outlook may involve a potential dip, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin remains robust, according to many analysts. This optimism is largely underpinned by two major factors: Rising Institutional Demand One of the most significant shifts in recent years has been the increasing participation of traditional financial institutions in the crypto market . This institutional demand comes from various sources: Asset Managers: Firms launching Bitcoin ETFs and other regulated investment products. Hedge Funds: Allocating capital to Bitcoin as part of diversified strategies. Corporations: Adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury reserve asset. Payment Processors & Banks: Offering crypto-related services to their clients. Unlike retail investors who might react more impulsively to price swings, institutional investors often have longer investment horizons and larger capital allocations. Their increasing involvement provides a more stable and significant source of demand for Bitcoin , which is seen as a strong foundation for long-term price appreciation. Global Corporate Accumulation Beyond traditional finance, publicly traded corporations are also accumulating Bitcoin . The most well-known example is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Other companies are exploring or have already adopted similar strategies. This corporate accumulation serves multiple purposes: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a store of value resistant to currency debasement. Treasury Diversification: Holding a non-correlated asset alongside traditional cash reserves. Strategic Investment: Believing in the future growth and adoption of the Bitcoin network. The trend of corporate adoption, driven by institutional demand and strategic decisions, represents a powerful, ongoing source of buying pressure that underpins the long-term bullish case for Bitcoin , despite potential short-term volatility or a Bitcoin correction . Navigating a Potential Correction: Actionable Insights If a Bitcoin correction is indeed on the horizon, what should investors consider? Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much volatility you can handle. Short-term price drops can be significant. Don’t Panic Sell: If you believe in Bitcoin ‘s long-term potential, a correction can be viewed as a temporary dip, not a reason to exit entirely. Consider Your Entry Point: If you bought recently at high prices, a correction might put your position underwater temporarily. If you bought much lower, you have more cushion. Look for Buying Opportunities: For those with capital ready, a correction can be an excellent opportunity to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies at a discount. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue or start a DCA strategy to average into a position over time, regardless of short-term price movements. Reduce Leverage: If you are trading with leverage, a correction can lead to rapid liquidations. Consider reducing leveraged positions. Stay Informed: Keep watching the key on-chain metrics and market news. It’s important to remember that these are just signals, not guarantees. The market could defy expectations. However, being prepared for potential volatility is always a prudent strategy in the crypto market . Summary: Balancing Caution and Long-Term Conviction The recent data points from Glassnode and CryptoQuant regarding whale selling and high UTXO profitability are significant indicators that the impressive seven-week rally in Bitcoin price may be facing headwinds. These signals historically precede periods of profit-taking and potential Bitcoin correction . While the risk of a short-term pullback is elevated, it’s crucial not to lose sight of the bigger picture. The underlying fundamentals supporting Bitcoin ‘s long-term growth, particularly the increasing momentum of institutional demand and corporate accumulation, remain strong. These factors suggest that any potential correction might be a temporary pause in a larger upward trend, potentially offering attractive entry points for long-term investors. Navigating the current environment requires a balanced approach: acknowledging the short-term risks highlighted by on-chain data while maintaining conviction in the long-term growth story driven by fundamental adoption. Staying informed and adhering to a well-defined investment strategy are key to successfully navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of the crypto market .

While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead.

SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range.

However, the current trend favors bulls, with higher lows and stronger weekly closes indicating sustained accumulation. If broader market conditions remain stable, Solana looks poised to attempt a breakout in the coming weeks.

2025-05-27T11:00:38.000Z,"Long-term Bitcoin holders are showing confidence in future bullish momentum","Long-term Bitcoin holders are showing potential bullish momentum following an addition of 300,000 BTC by long-term holders in 20 days. On-chain data also revealed that long-term holder spending dropped to its lowest since September 2024. The behavior of LTHs accumulating BTC while their spending activity drops signals confidence in future price appreciation, as they are considered the backbone of the Bitcoin network. LTHs are wallets that have held digital assets for over 155 days. Long-term BTC holders reduce spending and increase holdings LTH spending is at its lowest level since September 2024. Over the past 20 days, the cohort has added 300K BTC – a bullish signal for the market. pic.twitter.com/sN0YgkxQya — Axel 💎🙌 Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 26, 2025 When long-term Bitcoin holders reduce spending and increase holdings, they expect prices to surge ahead and are unwilling to part with their assets at current levels. Accumulation phases by LTHs also historically precede major market rallies. CryptoQuant researcher Axel Adler noted that miners have stepped up their sales on exchanges after Bitcoin hit its new all-time high of $112,000. On-chain data also showed that inflows have doubled from an average of 25 BTC to 508 BTC per day, while historical peaks reach around 100 BTC. Bitcoin long-term holder spending binary indicator. Source: CryptoQuant According to Adler, selling has accelerated. He also argued that the market is still a long way from peak volumes, and the market is absorbing the extra supply. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is currently exchanging hands at $109,560, a 4% increase in the last 7 days. Adler acknowledged that miners are currently earning around $50M per day, while historical revenue peaks exceed $80M. He suggested that it indicates a high but not yet peak level of network activity. The researcher also said that miners are already generating significant income, but there is still room for the market to climb back to those previous highs. CryptoQuant analytics showed that its Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO) reached is nearing the 99% threshold, meaning 99% of all BTC holdings are in profit. The tool provides a deeper understanding of the state of unrealized profits across the network. The firm noted that its current level historically aligns with periods of market euphoria and strong uptrend but can also signal potential overheating if sustained for too long. CryptoQuant believes that as BTC inches toward new highs, the UTXO metric reinforces the strength of the rally. “Right now, it’s hard to say we’re in a euphoric phase. The broader macroeconomic context and the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s policy direction make it difficult for investors to flip fully risk on.” – Darkfost , Analyst at CryptoQuant. Darkfost also argued that net profits are still within normal levels for a bull run. According to his analysis, profit-taking is not a sign of weakness but a crucial part of market structure during uptrends. He believes it’s what keeps investors engaged and prevents parabolic exhaustion. The CryptoQuant analyst also revealed data showing realized profits currently stand at 104,000 BTC, or around $11 billion. According to him, that number is not as large as it seems because it’s still below the historical danger zone of 350,000 BTC—a level that signals euphoric conditions or overheating. Darkfost said it suggested the market remains in a healthy profit-taking zone. He also noted that profit-taking is not a red flag during a bull market, but it’s necessary because it helps maintain momentum and keeps participants engaged. LTHs capitalize on BTC’s market drop to $109K The BTC market recently experienced two major liquidation events, which caused a cascade of forced selling from over-leveraged traders. Amr Taha from CryptoQuant said overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out while long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the market reset. He noted the first flush occurred when the digital asset fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As BTC broke $109,000, another $88 million longs were wiped out in the second wave. According to Taha, it caused long-term holders’ realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. He also argued that long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin in the long run. Data analytics firm Alphractal noted that Bitcoin’s surge has shifted the behavior of short-term holders (STHs), who are now distributing assets more aggressively. According to the company’s analysis, such distribution often occurs during market peaks, as profit-taking slows buying momentum. The firm argued that the shift could signal that Bitcoin is entering the final stage of its current bull cycle.

2025-05-27T11:00:27.000Z,"XRP To $12: Analyst Reveals What Could Trigger The Breakout","The latest webcast from the market commentator known as Crypto Insight UK centres on a single contention: the technical and fundamental backdrop for XRP now mirrors the pre-euphoric set-ups that propelled the token from $0.50 to $2.70 in four weeks during 2021, and it could drive a surge “towards eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve dollars in the very short term.” When Will XRP Hit $12? The analyst began with Bitcoin, because “Bitcoin price action correlates [with] the rest of the market, at least at the minute, before we start to see dominance breakdown.” Last week’s candle, he notes, was the highest weekly close ever recorded by the benchmark asset, yet—critically—the weekly relative-strength index has not entered the overbought zone. In prior cycles, the RSI’s passage into that territory “is when we start to get this mania push-up” that drags alt-coins with it. XRP’s own history is invoked as corroboration: “When we got the weekly into the overbought, that’s when we went from fifty-cent up to $2.70 in the space of like four weeks.” The analyst then drills into order-book heat-maps. Above Bitcoin price lies what he calls a “dense liquidity” cluster, most prominent around $130,000. A matching reservoir sits below, first at $100,000 and then at $93,000. “If we get a pull-back into this $100K level, I will start to heavily position in leverage in altcoins,” he tells viewers, adding that a deeper flush to $93,000 would see him “continue to add to my positions.” Related Reading: XRP Sees Wave Of Inflows: 70% Of Realized Cap Now New Money The market, he argues, is trapped in a self-reinforcing liquidity cycle: each test of overhead supply squeezes shorts, price consolidates, fresh liquidity builds at the new ceiling, and the pattern repeats until a catalyst—a macro loosening of money, a geopolitical shock, or a technical breakout—propels Bitcoin into the next tranche. A sustained move through $130,000, he contends, would likely be that catalyst and would “probably” mark the formal start of alt-season. XRP’s chart is examined through a similar lens. Price has pushed out of what he labels a Wyckoff accumulation range, broken structure to the upside, and is now “finding support on previous resistance” inside a broad bull-flag. On the weekly ratios—XRP/Bitcoin, XRP/Ether and XRP dominance—momentum is quietly inflecting: “We’re starting to get bullish divergences, which is where we see higher lows on the RSI and lower lows in price action … it’s telling us the sellers are running out of steam.” He identifies a descending trend-line capping the consolidation; once that line breaks, he anticipates “an aggressive move back to the upside for XRP.” XRP Price Catalysts The webcast’s second movement shifts from charts to narrative catalysts. Here the analyst reels off a series of developments he regards as unusually synchronous. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, has just unveiled a partnership with the Dubai Land Department that tokenises real-estate title deeds on the XRP Ledger, a choice the press release describes as grounded in the chain’s “decade-long reliability.” Related Reading: Analyst Shows 3-Cycle Ride For XRP Price To Reach $46 Ripple has closed its acquisition of Hidden Road, a prime brokerage whose name appears in DTCC documentation that references both XRP and XLM for cross-chain settlement. The firm, he reminds viewers, also holds “the full crypto payments license and settlement ability in Dubai.” Speculation that Ripple might purchase Circle—the issuer of USDC—for about $11 billion, though unconfirmed, is folded into the same bullish mosaic, as is the launch of Ripple’s own RLUSD stablecoin and talk of a looming XRP spot-ETF. Brad Garlinghouse himself, the analyst notes, chose ETFs as the single topic for last Thursday’s edition of Ripple’s “Crypto in a Minute,” having already mused on a podcast that an approval could arrive in July. In Washington, the analyst is watching for passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill, timing he calls “very convenient” for RLUSD. Even the on-going SEC litigation—Judge Analisa Torres recently rejected the agency’s procedural bid to bring the penalty phase to a close—is framed not as a hindrance but as a potential upside catalyst once resolved. Taken together, he argues, these technical and narrative strands form a spring: “What I’m basically trying to set you up for here, guys, is a succession of positive narratives that will squeeze XRP’s price higher as we move into price discovery.” Yet his crescendo is tempered by disciplined risk management. He illustrates the peril of euphoria with hypothetical road-maps: Bitcoin might gallop to $150,000 or $170,000 and then recoil 18%; altcoins could shed twice that. Under one XRP scenario, an advance to $12 is followed by a 64% retracement to $4.50. “Take some money off the table,” he urges, because unrealised gains “aren’t good for anybody.” Profits banked at interim targets equip the trader both to enjoy further upside and to “reallocate if we get a pull-back.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.30.

2025-05-27T11:00:00.000Z,"UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini report","The United Kingdom is leading the world in increasing cryptocurrency ownership among its population in 2025, outpacing economies including the United States, according to a new study by Gemini. Gemini, the US-based crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, on May 27 released its latest “State of Crypto” report, giving insights into changes in the global adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Based on a survey of 7,200 adults across the US, Europe, Singapore and Australia, the report found that Europe has been leading the way in growing crypto ownership, with the UK in front. The UK saw the biggest year-over-year growth in crypto ownership of the surveyed nations, with the share of respondents indicating crypto holdings rising to 24% as of April from 18% last year, Gemini said in the report shared with Cointelegraph. Crypto sees highest ownership in Singapore While the UK has reportedly seen an increase in new crypto owners, it’s yet to reach the world’s top crypto ownership rate. According to Gemini’s report, Singapore has been the top country globally for crypto ownership in the past two years, with 28% of local survey respondents saying they were invested in crypto as of April. In 2024, that share was 26%. Crypto ownership percentage in the US, UK, France, Singapore, Italy and Australia. Source: Gemini Some European countries have picked up the pace, with 21% of French respondents reporting owning crypto in 2025, up from 18% in 2024. In the US, the indicator grew to 22% from 21%. Overall crypto ownership rate in the US, UK, France and Singapore increased to 24% by April from 21% last year, suggesting that nearly one in four now own crypto globally. Implications of the EU’s MiCA regulation? According to Gemini, the rise of global crypto ownership in the past few years may be attributed to the impact of the Trump administration’s policies on overall positive sentiment following the bear market of 2022 . “In particular, crypto ownership in France and the UK increased, reflecting a warming regulatory environment for digital assets in Europe,” the report said, referring to the rollout of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA ).

2025-05-27T10:56:58.000Z,"Ripple CTO: XRP Ledger Is Designed to Prevent Hard and Soft Censorship","Vet (@Vet_X0), a validator on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), recently drew attention to an X space he hosted in February, where Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, shared intriguing insights into XRP. Vet mentioned Schwartz’s revelation that XRP was the reason the decentralized exchange (DEX) was created. Schwartz explained the rationale behind the creation of the DEX on the XRPL, tying its development to the network’s resistance to both hard and soft censorship. Did you know – The censorship resistant consensus mechanism of the XRP Ledger led to the development of the DEX . — Vet (@Vet_X0) May 25, 2025 Understanding Censorship in Blockchain Systems He began by describing the distinction between the two forms of censorship. Hard censorship happens when a transaction is entirely blocked, such as when miners ignore it for political reasons, leaving it unconfirmed. This is usually visible, as the transaction is broadcast but never finalized. Soft censorship, by contrast, delays rather than blocks. In Bitcoin, a miner with substantial hashing power could choose to deprioritize a specific user’s transactions, slowing them down without fully preventing them. While the transactions eventually get confirmed, they may take longer than expected, affecting use cases requiring speed and reliability. This is more of a problem for XRP, which is significantly faster than Bitcoin and most competitors and relies on that speed to provide numerous services globally. XRP’s Unique Resistance to Soft Censorship According to Schwartz, the XRPL is designed to prevent both hard and soft censorship. The consensus protocol employed by the XRPL does not rely on a single block producer or leader, meaning no single participant can manipulate the order or inclusion of transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This characteristic is especially relevant in use cases involving financial exchanges. As Schwartz noted, “front-running would be a problem if you didn’t have soft censorship resistance.” The ability to execute transactions fairly and predictably is critical for any trading platform. The DEX Emerges from Technical Strengths Schwartz explained that once the XRPL’s resilience to soft censorship became evident, the team began exploring what applications would benefit most from that property. A decentralized exchange was a logical choice because it depends heavily on transaction order, speed, and fairness. “We realized that that would make sense if you had a sort of multi-currency marketplace where transactions were competing for something like liquidity,” Schwartz said. This realization led Ripple’s Arthur Britto to focus on building the DEX as a core feature of the XRPL. While XRP has been tagged centralized in the past by critics, this approach shows that the asset is decentralized as it champions the principles of decentralization and ensures that any validator attempting soft censorship can be identified and removed from the Unique Node List (UNL).

Elon Musk’s Tweet Goes Viral Amid Crypto Experts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again sparked a big conversation on his X platform with a simple but powerful question: “ How many real people are still on the Internet? ” He quoted crypto influencer Mario Nawfal, who referenced a report from Singapore’s The Straits Times claiming that AI-powered bots are taking over the internet in 2024. This statement caught the attention of the crypto community and beyond. AI Bots Are Taking Over the Web Musk’s question points to a surprising reality. Over half of all web traffic today comes from bots. But these aren’t just harmless programs – many are AI-driven and cause real problems. They scalpers tickets, exploit travel sites, hijack social media accounts, and create online drama and misinformation. Nawfal’s tweet even contained a typo, misspelling The Straits Times as “The Straight Times.” This small error might show how AI is affecting even things like spellchecking. AI BOTS RUN THE INTERNET NOW Congrats, humans: you officially lost the internet to AI-powered bots in 2024. Over half of all web traffic is now bots, and many of them up to no good.

This issue is not just on social media but also in blockchain and crypto platforms. Another X user commented that humans are adapting to machines, which only blurs the line between real and artificial. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Adam Back Invests $1.5M in Swedish Firm Leading Bitcoin Treasury Shift , Is Our Reality Just a Simulation?

He explained that at Tesla and SpaceX, they run many simulations to predict what might happen because the future is uncertain. By this logic, the people who created our reality might also be running a simulation, trying to understand life and consciousness. This idea sparked a lively discussion. Many users insisted they are real humans but also pondered the unsettling possibility that we live in a simulation. Why This Matters As AI bots become smarter and more common, their impact on social media, online markets, and blockchain raises important questions about trust and authenticity. The crypto community, which values transparency and decentralization, faces a tough challenge in this new landscape filled with bots. Elon Musk’s question has done more than shock crypto fans – it has opened a global conversation about AI’s growing role and what it means for human interaction on the internet going forward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-27T10:45:53.000Z,"Shiba Inu liquidity weakens as whale inflows plunge 83%: what’s next for SHIB price?","Cryptocurrencies displayed mixed performances, with Bitcoin hovering below $110,000, trading at $109,679. While analysts view BTC’s weakness as a precedent to an altcoin season, Shiba Inu displayed worrying metrics. IntoTheBlock stats show a significant plunge in whale activity within the Shiba Inu ecosystem over the past month. Notably, large inflows plummeted to under 2 trillion from 8 trillion – a staggering 83% fall. At the same time, outflows dipped by over 80%, reflecting an enormous plunge in large holder transactions. Such developments indicate liquidity contraction, with large-scale traders (responsible for massive volumes) refraining from active trading. These trends have shifted attention to the meme token’s price actions. SHIB’s current price of $0.00001455 places it well below all crucial resistance levels. While that could confirm a lucrative room for upswings, declining whale activity and liquidity contraction raise concerns. The dog-themed token needs an approximately 27% price jump to reclaim $0.000020 for stable recoveries. Can that happen with the prevailing liquidity shrink? Shiba Inu whales hold back The notable plunge in outflows and inflows indicates reduced market participation by these entities. Whales refrain from trading, which could impact SHIB’s ecosystem in various ways. First and foremost, the altcoin will experience reduced volatility (in the near term). Whale actions contribute to massive selling and buying pressure, and their absence could mean more stable but slower price actions. Meanwhile, the meme token will likely experience a substantial liquidity crunch. FutureChain Insights(✸,✸) @Vito24all · Follow 📉 SHIB Inflows Crash 83% — Where Did the Whales Go?Shiba Inu failed to break $0.00001596 & now trades sideways near $0.0000145.🐋 Whale inflows dropped 83% in 30 days💸 Outflows also down 80%🪫 Liquidity drying up = bearish riskNext move: Break below $0.0000135 or reclaim 7:31 PM · May 26, 2025 2 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Traders will unlikely execute significant orders with fewer assets moving between exchanges and wallets. Moreover, these investors could be pulling back as Shiba Inu lacks short-term catalysts. Such trends align with the broad-based sentiments, where assets witnessed reduced speculations due to a more cautious approach. Most participants have adopted a wait-and-see strategy while waiting for potential breakouts on either side. SHIB price outlook The meme token trades at $0.00001455, well below its mid-January peak of $0.00002437. Chart by Coinmarketcap Shiba Inu has struggled with bearishness since losing the $0.000020 foothold on January 28. Nevertheless, chart patterns signal potential breakouts. SHIB’s price actions seem to form a falling wedge – a technical setup often heralding upside movements. However, Shiba Inu has an uphill task to confirm the technical pattern, especially with its current outlook. Firstly, the alt should overpower the immediate resistance at $0.000016 – $0.000017 with a massive buying volume – which remains modest. The project should re-engage whale and retail traders to bolster liquidity levels. A breakout will see Shiba Inu reclaiming the crucial support at $0.000020 and target the potential profit-taking area between $0.000028 and $0.000031. Broad-based bullish sentiments and significant ecosystem news could stretch SHIB’s gain to $0.000042 – a nearly 190% uptick from the current price. However, intensified selling pressure will halt the upside. Shiba Inu could lose 18% to retest the support zone at $0.000012.

2025-05-27T10:45:49.000Z,"Crypto Regulations in the USA 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in the USA 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The US crypto regulation has changed dramatically in 2025, with the Trump administration adopting a pro-innovation, pro-crypto approach.

What Do The US Federal Agencies Think About Crypto in 2025? SEC: The SEC, under new leadership, is moving away from aggressive enforcement and toward developing clear regulatory lines, realistic registration paths, and sensible disclosure guidelines for crypto assets. CFTC: The CFTC is collaborating with the SEC and Congress to clarify jurisdiction, especially over digital commodities and derivatives. FinCEN: AML and CFT requirements remain central, with crypto companies classified as financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act, subject to strict compliance. FDIC/OCC: The FDIC has eased restrictions on banks’ crypto activities, while the OCC supports banks’ ability to custody digital assets US Crypto Tax 2025 Cryptocurrency in the US is taxed based on how long you hold the asset and your total taxable income. Short-term gains (assets held for one year or less) are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term gains (assets held for more than a year) are taxed at lower capital gains rates. Additionally, income from mining, staking, or receiving crypto as payment is taxed as ordinary income. Short-Term Crypto Tax Rates (Held ≤ 1 Year) Tax Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately Head of Household 10% $0–$11,600 $0–$23,200 $0–$11,600 $0–$16,550 12% $11,601–$47,150 $23,201–$94,300 $11,601–$47,150 $16,551–$63,100 22% $47,151–$100,525 $94,301–$201,050 $47,151–$100,525 $63,101–$100,500 24% $100,526–$191,950 $201,051–$383,900 $100,526–$191,950 $100,501–$191,950 32% $191,951–$243,725 $383,901–$487,450 $191,951–$243,725 $191,951–$243,700 37% Over $609,351 Over $731,201 Over $365,601 Over $609,351 Long-Term Crypto Tax Rates (Held > 1 Year) Tax Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately Head of Household 0% Up to $47,025 Up to $94,050 Up to $47,025 Up to $63,000 15% $47,026–$518,900 $94,051–$583,750 $47,026–$291,850 $63,001–$551,350 20% Over $518,900 Over $583,750 Over $291,850 Over $551,350 Additional Crypto Tax Rules Income from mining, staking, or payment: Taxed as ordinary income at the above rates. NFTs: Some may be taxed at a higher collectibles rate (up to 28%). Non-taxable events: Transfers between your own wallets and certain gifts are not taxable. Crypto companies: Subject to standard corporate income tax and must comply with reporting and AML/CFT rules. Example If you are single, earn $50,000 in total taxable income, and realize $5,000 short-term crypto gains and $10,000 long-term crypto gains: Short-term gains taxed at 22%: $1,100 Long-term gains taxed at 15%: $1,500 Total crypto tax owed: $2,600 These rates and rules ensure all crypto investors and companies are taxed in line with other property and investment assets in the US Crypto Adoption Rate In America In 2025, about 28% of American adults—around 65 million people—own cryptocurrency. Crypto ownership in the US has nearly doubled since 2021, rising from 15% to 28%. 14% of non-owners plan to buy crypto in 2025, and 67% of current owners plan to buy more this year. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are the top three cryptocurrencies Americans plan to purchase in 2025. Crypto mining in the USA In 2025, the US leads the world in Bitcoin mining , accounting for over one-third of global mining power. On March 20, 2025, the SEC clarified that proof-of-work crypto mining is not subject to federal securities laws, removing registration requirements for miners. There is no federal ban on crypto mining; regulation is handled at the state level, with some states offering incentives and others imposing environmental restrictions. The Trump administration’s deregulatory approach in 2025 has encouraged domestic mining growth, but all miners must still comply with federal AML and CFT rules. Environmental concerns and energy usage debates continue, especially in states considering stricter oversight or moratoriums on mining operations. US Government’s Crypto Holdings As of April 2025, the US government holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoins, valued at about $18.3 billion. The US is the world’s largest state holder of Bitcoin, with these assets primarily acquired through law enforcement seizures and forfeitures. In March 2025, President Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile, consolidating all federally held Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies (including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP) as permanent reserve assets. Conclusion US crypto regulation in 2025 marks a major turning point. The old approach of punishing innovation is being replaced with clear rules, legal support, and a national strategy for digital assets. While financial crimes are still a concern, the overall direction is bold, business-friendly, and built for long-term crypto adoption. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The IRS treats crypto as property, taxing gains as capital gains and income from mining/staking as ordinary income. What is the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? Established by Trump in March 2025, it’s a federal reserve for Bitcoin, initially capitalized by seized BTC, aiming to manage holdings strategically. How has US crypto regulation changed in 2025? In 2025, the US shifted to a pro-innovation, pro-crypto approach under Trump, with new executive orders and a move toward clear federal legislation. How much tax on crypto USA? In the US, short-term crypto gains (held ≤ 1 year) are taxed at ordinary income rates (10-37%), while long-term gains (> 1 year) are taxed at lower capital gains rates (0-20%), based on your income and filing status.

2025-05-27T10:45:01.000Z,"Thailand mulls crypto payments for tourists using credit cards","Thailand is currently reviewing plans to bring crypto into everyday use, with plans to let tourists spend cryptocurrencies in the country by linking them to their credit cards. Announced by Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira on May 26 during an investment seminar in Bangkok, the initiative is part of a broader strategy to modernise Thailand’s financial system and solidify its role as a regional hub for digital asset innovation. Under the proposal, tourists would be able to connect their crypto wallets to credit card platforms for local transactions. Vendors would receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing cryptocurrency was used in the transaction. According to Pichai, this model avoids direct interaction with the domestic currency, reducing systemic risk. The system is currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, with discussions underway on launching a pilot programme once the necessary infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place. During his speech, Pichai cited international examples where crypto-credit card integration is already operational and noted that Thailand could adopt a similar model if supporting systems are implemented. A timeline for the initiative’s official rollout was not disclosed. Thailand to reform financial laws As part of a broader financial overhaul, Pichai also announced plans to unify the legal frameworks that currently govern the country’s capital markets and digital asset markets. These markets are currently regulated under separate acts, the Securities and Exchange Act and the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses, which creates regulatory fragmentation. According to Pichai, the nation is working on draft rules that would address this issue and remove the friction between the two markets. The planned reforms will reportedly align the regulatory treatment of traditional securities and digital assets, making it easier for investors to diversify across asset classes without facing legal or procedural barriers. Pichai said the reforms would reflect modern investment behaviours and streamline oversight, while also helping Thailand stay competitive with regional financial hubs. Meanwhile, the government also plans to promote “G-Tokens,” digital tokens that enable retail investors to buy government bonds in fractional units. The Ministry of Finance plans to issue $150 million worth of digital investment tokens, which, according to Pichai, are expected to broaden retail access to government bonds, offer higher returns than traditional savings, and raise international awareness of Thai sovereign debt. Thailand warms up to crypto After years of tight controls and headline-making crackdowns, Thailand’s regulators are showing signs of softening. The SEC is actively reviewing proposals to launch domestic Bitcoin ETFs, a move that could both satisfy retail appetite and help the country keep pace with competing jurisdictions like Singapore . Thailand has also explored stablecoins backed by corporate bonds and previously tested Bitcoin payments for tourists in Phuket.

2025-05-27T10:43:36.000Z,"Next Crypto to 1,000x as Strategy Buys More Bitcoin; Is Trump Media Raising $3B for Crypto?","Strategy did what Strategy does best – buy more Bitcoin. This, as rumors swirl that Trump Media is raising some $3B to buy more crypto, though the company later denied them. The initial rumors emerged from Trump’s hotly debated crypto dinner, where not everyone was pleased. As Trump continues to raise eyebrows and Saylor pushes Bitcoin, here’s our prediction for the next 1000x cryptos . Strategy Pushes On, Despite Lawsuit Michael Saylor’s strategy to buy all the Bitcoin he can is outstripping mined supply 4:1. It isn’t just about amassing a vast hedge against coming financial market chaos, or even about building a stockpile of what could be the world’s most valuable asset. He’s actually positioning Strategy as an ETF alternative. With Strategy now built around Bitcoin, buying $MSTR stock essentially serves the same purpose as buying one of the major Bitcoin ETFs (like Blackrock’s or Grayscale’s): indirect exposure to Bitcoin. Not every Strategy stakeholder approves of that approach; at least one is taking Strategy’s C-suite to court over its Bitcoin accounting methods. The argument is less about the potential profitability of Bitcoin and more about how gains and losses are reported. Strategy plans to defend itself, of course, and while Strategy’s stock has dropped 7.5% over the past day , Bitcoin’s continued performance bodes well for its approach. Strategy’s strategy could be prompting other players to buy more Bitcoin, even Trump Media. Will Trump Media Buy More Crypto? Indeed, news has spread about a potential $3B fundraising effort from Trump Media & Technology Group to buy crypto, including Bitcoin. But Trump Media quickly downplayed the initial report from the Financial Times , calling the FT ‘fake news’ and reporters who covered the topic ‘dumb.’ Even so, the move would fit in with earlier reports from TMTG, which pointed to a planned utility token for Truth Social. President Trump hasn’t tried to hide his crypto connections or his desire to promote crypto as an integral part of his ‘America First’ vision for the US economy. But, while his pro-crypto efforts on a regulatory level have been quite successful, his personal projects haven’t always been as well received. That was once again the case at the much-ballyhooed crypto dinner. No ‘Alpha’ at Trump Dinner Admission to the Trump crypto dinner last week was easy: just be in the top 200 holders of $TRUMP, the president’s official meme coin. Get enough $TRUMP and gain access to the most powerful man in the (crypto) world. Imagine the influence you’d wield, the info you could learn! But some attendees were left disappointed. Trump’s speeches were brief and didn’t offer any actionable market intelligence – no alpha, no exclusive insight. There was no mention of a new TMTG (Trump Media and Technology Group) crypto buy, and no juicy geopolitical tidbits that might have created opportunities for those with ears to hear. Trump did speak in general terms of his successful efforts in reforming a pro-crypto environment in the US, and his plans for crypto to remain at the forefront of the economy. Despite the lack of specifics, that might be enough for now. New cryptocurrencies are betting big on a continued crypto-friendly approach from the US government, and Trump shows no signs of changing tack. So if the show must go on, here are three new crypto projects that could be the next 1000x cryptos . BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – World’s First Bitcoin Meme Coin Set to Explode as $BTC Rides High Why reinvent the wheel? BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a low-cap project that bows to the one cryptocurrency that continues to outperform all the others – Bitcoin. So rather than try to beat Bitcoin, $BTCBULL token uses deflationary tokenomics and free crypto airdrops to hitch its own token performance to Bitcoin’s continued rise. With regular token burns interspersed with real $BTC airdrops, $BTCBULL token holders receive attractive incentives every time Bitcoin reaches key price milestones. As $BTC hits $125K, $175K, and $225K, there will be $BTCBULL token burns As $BTC reaches $150K and $200K, $BTC airdrops for $BTCBULL holders who use Best Wallet As $BTC climbs to $250K, a massive $BTCBULL token airdrop The combination of token burns and regular airdrops connects BTC Bull Token’s performance with Bitcoin’s, and gives token holders more than one way to earn from Bitcoin’s gains. The project’s design comes at an opportune time. As Strategy and friends continue to buy Bitcoin, pushing the price higher, the $125K milestone is already on the horizon. Our $BTCBULL price prediction shows the token could hit $0.0084 by the end of the year, up 232% from its current price of $0.00253. Learn how to buy $BTCBULL in our guide. Will it be the next crypto to 1,000X as Bitcoin soars? Visit the BTC Bull Token presale page . Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Layer-2 Savior Arrives Solana’s got speed and low fees. Now, Solaxy ($SOLX) brings the Layer-2 upgrade Solana needs to compete with Ethereum’s reliability and scalability. The Solaxy testnet and multichain bridge are already live, and the presale has just passed the $41M mark. This indicates clear progress towards launching a fully developed, first-of-its-kind Solana Layer-2. In addition to greater scalability, Solaxy will boost Solana’s speed while significantly reducing network congestion and the risk of failed transactions. The $SOLX token will launch on Ethereum, and bridge to Solana and the Solaxy Layer-2 post-launch. There’s not much time left; the Solaxy presale has only 20 days left. Tokens are currently priced at $0.001736, but our Solaxy price prediction shows the price could reach $0.025 by the end of 2025, an incredible 1340% increase. Don’t miss our guide on how to buy $SOLX , and visit the Solaxy presale page . SpacePay ($SPY) – Crypto Payments Go Mainstream The $SPY token facilitates retail payments, providing native crypto acceptance alongside traditional currencies. It’s all bundled in familiar POS terminals, making it easy for retailers to expand their payment options without the need for extensive retraining. In short, SpacePay could power crypto adoption for small retailers everywhere, a major breakthrough for the crypto economy. The $SPY token serves as the utility token for the broader ecosystem, facilitating transactions within the network. With over $1M in the presale and a vast potential market, $SPY could make massive gains in 2025. Trump, Strategy Lead Crypto’s Future Whether a genius or a madman, Trump is shaping the future of crypto. So too is Michael Saylor; his Bitcoin-buying appetite has forced corporations and governments around the globe to adjust course to keep up. The future of crypto looks rosier than ever, and as ever, we’re on the hunt for the next crypto to go 1000X and set the crypto world on fire. The coins listed in this article, like Solaxy and Bitcoin Bull Token , could prove top contenders.

The company, listed on Euronext Paris under the ticker ALTBG, revealed that 95% of the proceeds will go toward acquiring 590 Bitcoin (BTC), taking its total holdings to 1,437 BTC. The move is part of a long-term ambition to secure 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply—equivalent to roughly 170,000 BTC—by 2032. The Blockchain Group @_ALTBG · Follow 🟠The Blockchain Group announces a convertible bond issuance of ~€63.3M to pursue its Bitcoin Treasury Company strategy, bringing its total potential holdings to ~1,437 BTC after completion⚡️Full Press Release (EN): theblockchain-group.com/wp-content/upl… Full Press Release (FR): 11:56 PM · May 26, 2025 326 Reply Copy link Read 34 replies At current prices of approximately $109,000 per BTC, Blockchain Group’s strategy comes as more public companies look to hedge balance sheets with crypto. ALTBG stock surges 766% YTD despite revenue decline Blockchain Group’s BTC treasury strategy has so far rewarded its investors handsomely. The company’s stock, which closed down 5.5% on May 26 at €2.77, has still surged 766% year-to-date. The initial catalyst was its first Bitcoin purchase in November 2023, which alone sent the stock up 225%. In its 2024 financials released in April, the firm reported a 709% yield from its Bitcoin holdings. However, total annual revenue dropped 32% to €13.86 million, highlighting that crypto gains—not core business income—have driven the performance. The new Bitcoin purchase, worth over $64 million, will again dwarf the company’s operating metrics. Fulgur Ventures and Moonlight Capital lead the bond round The €63.3 million bond raise was led by Fulgur Ventures, which contributed €55.3 million. Moonlight Capital followed with €5 million. The bonds are convertible into Blockchain Group shares at €3.809 per share, representing a significant premium to the current trading price. Blockchain Group clarified that while the raised amount could technically buy around 658 BTC at market rates, only 95% of the funds will be spent on Bitcoin. The remaining 5% is earmarked for operational costs and management fees related to the acquisition and treasury operations. More public firms join the Bitcoin treasury race Blockchain Group’s announcement adds to a wave of institutional moves into Bitcoin. On May 22, Sweden’s H100 Group AB said it would begin acquiring Bitcoin for its treasury. Earlier in the month, Strive Asset Management unveiled a similar strategy. Meanwhile, US-based DigiAsia Corp, listed on Nasdaq, saw its shares spike 91% on May 19 after announcing plans to raise $100 million for Bitcoin purchases. The firm stated it would allocate up to 50% of net profits toward building a BTC reserve. That followed a May 20 filing from Blackstone, confirming it had entered the crypto market by acquiring 23,094 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), valued at roughly $1.08 million. Michael Saylor’s Strategy remains a frontrunner in the corporate Bitcoin space. The Virginia-headquartered company is now targeting $84 billion in capital-raising efforts to double down on its Bitcoin holdings. Strategic context as supply shrinks, demand rises With institutional participation rising and the number of Bitcoin available to be mined gradually decreasing, firms like Blockchain Group are positioning themselves early. The company’s goal of acquiring 1% of total Bitcoin supply—approximately 170,000 BTC—would give it a major share of an increasingly scarce asset. Given that only 21 million BTC will ever exist, and nearly 19.7 million have already been mined, the competition for remaining supply is expected to intensify. Blockchain Group’s current holdings of 1,437 BTC represent roughly 0.0068% of the total supply. Achieving the 1% mark would require continued capital inflows and consistent execution of its treasury strategy over the next seven years. The move also underscores the increasing interplay between traditional finance and digital assets, as more listed firms begin to mirror the reserve strategies long seen in crypto-native entities.

2025-05-27T10:30:10.000Z,"Bitcoin at Risk of Sharp Pullback as Traders Take Profit: Bitfinex","Last week, bitcoin posted a new all-time high (ATH) that marked a significant recovery from lows seen in April. The pace and consistency of the rally led to BTC logging its seventh consecutive green weekly close, marking the longest such streak since October 2023. However, according to the newest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report , that streak is about to be broken because traders are beginning to take profits. Also, BTC may struggle to thrive amid an unfavorable macroeconomic environment triggered by tariff tensions in the United States. Increased Possibility of Pullback Within 36 hours of hitting a new ATH, BTC witnessed a slight correction, falling below its previous high of $109,590. This retrace was attributed to reignited global trade war fears triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal of 50% tariffs on European Union imports. While cryptocurrencies struggled with the effects of Trump’s tariff announcement, the Bitcoin perpetual futures market witnessed a flush as excessive leverage unwound. This added to the downside pressure on BTC and increased the possibility of a corrective move in the short term. Although the coming days will tell if BTC will stabilize above the $106,000 weekly lows, profit-taking by short-term holders could lead to a deeper reset before the next leg up. This is because investors tend to lock in gains when BTC records such a pace of appreciation. Short-term Holders Take Profits Bitfinex says there will be two types of sellers: those who bought the BTC dip and are sitting on profits, and those who were in losses during the last correction and are now above breakeven. These cohorts of investors are already taking profits, as seen in the on-chain data. As BTC recovered and rallied past $$93,400, which was the short-term holder (STH) cost basis, profit-taking accelerated. In the last 30 days, STHs have realized at least $11.4 billion in profit, with a daily peak of $747 million. This figure is a far cry from the $1.2 billion in cumulative profit realized within the previous 30-day period. Additionally, the surge in profit-taking is evident in the STH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, which has risen to a level only seen on 8% of trading days in Bitcoinʼs history. “This dramatic shift highlights just how quickly investor sentiment and behavior can pivot when momentum returns. However, it also implies that some degree of consolidation is likely as the market digests this wave of distribution before attempting another leg higher,” Bitfinex analysts stated.

Metaplanet’s stockholders are paying more than a fivefold premium on Bitcoin ( BTC ) when investing in the Japanese company, according to a report by 10x Research published on May 27. “A little-known Japanese stock trades as if Bitcoin were worth $596,154, more than five times its actual price,” the report states. Investors who don’t understand the importance of a firm’s net asset value (NAV) may be “dramatically overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure” on a position that doesn’t provide additional upside leverage, the report adds. The NAV represents the per-unit price of a fund, calculated by dividing the fund’s total assets minus its liabilities by the number of outstanding shares.

2025-05-27T10:29:38.000Z,"BTC Holds Steady Near $110K as Traders Brace for Bitcoin Conference Headlines: QCP","Key Takeaways: Bitcoin is holding steady near $110K as traders eye potential headline risks from the Bitcoin Conference. QCP warns of past volatility spikes tied to political speeches, with short-term traders trimming exposure. Bitfinex sees rising profit-taking and expects consolidation, but institutional buying remains a strong tailwind. Bitcoin is trading in a tight range between $107,000 and $110,000 ahead of the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, according to a May 27 market note from QCP Capital. The muted price action follows Friday’s macro developments, where equities rallied but BTC remained largely unmoved, the firm said in a Telegram note . QCP added that institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains firm, helping to anchor prices. However, near-term implied volatility remains elevated, suggesting traders are bracing for headline risk from the conference, which runs May 27–29. Trump’s 2023 Bitcoin Conference Speech Triggered 30% BTC Crash QCP pointed to last July’s Nashville conference as a cautionary example. Bitcoin volatility spiked above 90 following a keynote from Donald Trump, then dropped nearly 30% over two days. While a repeat of that move is unlikely, traders appear cautious. Open interest in perpetuals has dropped, and funding rates have normalized. Retail exposure is also thinning. High-profile traders like James Wynn have scaled back positions. Short-dated downside protection remains in demand. Adding to market nerves are unconfirmed reports that Trump Media is exploring a $3 billion crypto raise, claims the company has denied. QCP expects Bitcoin to remain range-bound until the event passes, with volatility likely to ease once headline risks subside. QCP says Bitcoin is trading between $107,000 and $110,000, backed by steady ETF demand. Markets are watching this week’s Bitcoin conference. With high short-term volatility, investors are being cautious. After the event, sentiment and volatility are expected to calm down.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 27, 2025 Bitcoin surged past $111,800 last week, capping a more than 50% rebound from April lows. Analysts at Bitfinex say the move represents both a psychological and technical milestone, but warn that a period of profit-taking and consolidation is likely. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, they said the rally began after the April 2 “Liberation Day” sell-off and was fueled by strong ETF inflows, spot market demand, and institutional buying. However, a flood of realized gains, over $11.4 billion among short-term holders in just the past month, has introduced near-term supply pressure. Bitfinex analysts say the current phase mirrors past bull cycles where sharp gains were followed by consolidation. They expect price action to remain range-bound in the short term as leverage resets and spot demand stabilizes. Key support now sits near the short-term holder cost basis of $95,000. Notably, profit-taking is elevated, with realized profit levels among the highest in Bitcoin’s history. Analysts caution that this could cap further upside unless new capital enters the market to absorb overhead supply. Institution Adoption Remains Strong Institutional adoption remains strong. Publicly listed firms like Strategy , Semler Scientific , and Metaplanet have collectively acquired over 8,800 BTC in recent weeks. Their purchases underscore Bitcoin’s evolving role as a long-term strategic asset, especially amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty and fiscal strain in the U.S. Last week, Matrixport also claimed that the current bull market is being driven primarily by institutional capital rather than the wave of individual buyers seen in past cycles. “This rally is unfolding largely without retail participation,” analysts wrote. “Instead of the usual buzz and euphoria, there’s a noticeable absence of retail momentum.” The post BTC Holds Steady Near $110K as Traders Brace for Bitcoin Conference Headlines: QCP appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/btc-holds-steady-near-110k-as-traders-brace-for-bitcoin-conference-headlines-qcp/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Adoption|Bitcoin|Market",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T10:18:11.000Z,"French authorities hunt criminals targeting people involved in crypto","Authorities in Paris, France, have been on a roll, picking up suspects in recent kidnappings and attempted abductions in the country linked to crypto executives, high net-worth individuals and their relatives. There is a fresh crop of criminals targeting crypto holders, and they are not just here to rug tokens or hack protocols. These ones take a much more direct and physical approach, but law enforcement is always just around the corner, as proven by the recent arrests made in connection with crimes linked to crypto-oriented people. French authorities hunt criminals targeting people involved in crypto According to reports, the recent kidnapping cases in the cryptocurrency world have been linked with a common demographic: young and violent perpetrators, hired by the same sponsors who manipulate them, all behind pseudonyms. Enfant exfiltré, arme factice, société en crypto… Récit d’une tentative d’enlèvement surréaliste en plein Paris ➡️ https://t.co/CoiJGY8v2s pic.twitter.com/b43QsZwDiS — Le Parisien (@le_Parisien) May 14, 2025 In Paris, there were two high-profile cases recorded this May alone and one in New York. One was the kidnapping and mutilation of the father of a young poker player who made bank in cryptocurrency on May 1. The other was the attempted kidnapping of the daughter of the CEO of a virtual currency company on May 13. Investigators from the Brigade for the Repression of Banditry (BRB), with the support of several services including the Paris Research and Intervention Brigade (BRI), launched a major raid on Monday morning to apprehend suspects linked to the crimes. The raid was a success, and they came away with more than a dozen suspects, and several minors were among them. In the first case, the criminals demanded between 5 and 7 million euros in the form of a wire transfer from the victim’s son in exchange for his release. They severed one of the victim’s fingers and recorded it to coerce his son into cooperating. Fortunately, the sixty-year-old was rescued during an operation coordinated by the BRI of the Paris judicial police with the BRB and the criminal brigade after locating the hideout where the victim was being held, in Palaiseau (Essonne). Half a dozen suspects, including alleged kidnappers, have already been identified, charged and imprisoned. As for the second case, the target was the 34-year-old daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO and co-founder of Paymium, a cryptocurrency exchange platform. The kidnapping attempt was caught on film by bystanders. The attempted kidnapping happened on May 13, in the middle of the 11th arrondissement of Paris, near a school. Although the shocking scene unfolded before the eyes of many civilians, they were too scared to intervene despite the victim’s screams. It took the heroic intervention of a young man and that of the victim’s companion to deter the kidnappers, and as of Monday morning, no suspects have been arrested in this case. Investigators are now exploring the potential of both crimes being planned by a joint criminal organization, with interchangeable goons recruited on social networks. Violent crimes may increase as crypto gains popularity Violent crimes have spread through the cryptocurrency community like wildfire and have triggered a feeling of insecurity in the cryptocurrency community. On X, formerly Twitter, many users have highlighted the crimes, frowning upon the growing frequency and the sluggishness of the authorities to address it. Aside from kidnappings, there have also been “wrench attacks” that use physical force to obtain victims’ private keys or crypto information, with Bitcoin being the most targeted cryptocurrency.

Woeltz was arrested after the victim escaped from the eight-bedroom townhouse and got help from a passing traffic officer. He is charged with kidnapping, assault, and weapons. Stakeholders have warned that such violent attacks may increase in 2025 because of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous nature and law enforcement challenges.

2025-05-27T10:15:30.000Z,"Whale Accumulation Report: Cardano News Reveals Major Investors Pivoting to Bitcoin Solaris for 10X Returns","The post Whale Accumulation Report: Cardano News Reveals Major Investors Pivoting to Bitcoin Solaris for 10X Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recent Cardano network data shows increased on-chain consolidation among large ADA holders. While this may indicate confidence in long-term fundamentals, it also reflects a broader pattern: capital is rotating from mature assets into earlier-stage opportunities with greater return potential. With ADA’s growth trajectory tapering and staking yields flat, many institutional wallets are reallocating exposure toward projects with fixed supply, real user participation, and defined token scarcity. According to analyst reports, Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as one of the top destinations for that capital. The project’s architecture, mobile-first distribution model, and decentralized reward system are drawing both retail and whale-tier interest for the same reason: it mirrors the early economic blueprint that made Bitcoin and Ethereum wealth engines. Smartphones Become Crypto Mining Infrastructure At the core of Bitcoin Solaris is the Nova App, a mobile mining interface that turns any modern smartphone into a yield-generating asset. Users allocate 1–5 GB of storage and idle CPU to the app, which runs passively while the device charges. Mining rewards are distributed daily in BTC-S based on uptime. This direct protocol-level access stands in sharp contrast to Cardano, where delegation mechanics still favor large pools and require ecosystem fluency. Bitcoin Solaris removes these technical and financial barriers, giving early adopters consistent rewards for real network contribution. Designed for Decentralized Throughput at Global Scale Bitcoin Solaris achieves scalability through a dual-layer blockchain. The Base Layer secures the ledger using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), while the Solaris Layer executes smart contracts and mobile mining via Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT). This enables the network to process 10,000+ transactions per second with 2-second finality — a throughput that outpaces Cardano’s current benchmarks. This design supports real-time reward issuance across tens of thousands of nodes while keeping energy use minimal. For whales entering at scale, the network can support high-volume participation without bottlenecks or centralization risks. Security Audits Back Investor Confidence Bitcoin Solaris has completed comprehensive security and compliance checks. The Cyberscope audit validated smart contract logic and token mechanics. The Freshcoins audit tested mobile mining performance and scalability. The team also passed KYC verification , confirming transparent governance and traceability. This audit trail ensures that BTC-S enters the market as a verified asset, not a speculative token launch. Early Access Window Closes as Network Activation Nears Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Phase 5 of its presale, with BTC-S priced at 5 USDT. Of the fixed 21 million BTC-S supply, 4.2 million (20%) are allocated to the full presale. There will be no inflation or new token creation post-launch. Participants in the presale also secure early Nova App mining access before broader user growth drives up difficulty. As history has shown with Bitcoin and Ethereum, network positioning ahead of public saturation is often the defining factor in long-term returns. In a recent market briefing, Crypto Volt explained why large Cardano holders are shifting toward Bitcoin Solaris. His analysis focuses on token scarcity, mining-first distribution, and why early protocol access through smartphones is becoming the new strategy for crypto-native wealth growth. Cardano remains a leading Layer 1 — but for investors seeking transformative upside, its phase of exponential gains appears to have passed. Bitcoin Solaris presents a structurally different opportunity, one defined by scarcity, real-time rewards, and early-phase access. Now in Presale phase 5 at 5 USDT, BTC-S is drawing both institutional and retail attention as a credible next-generation wealth builder — before the door closes.

2025-05-27T10:10:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Options Skew Signals Dangerous Optimism: What Investors Need to Know","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Options Skew Signals Dangerous Optimism: What Investors Need to Know Are you feeling the intense optimism bubbling in the crypto markets right now? Bitcoin (BTC) has been showing strength, and it seems traders are betting heavily on continued upside. But a recent analysis points to a potential red flag hidden within the options market. Let’s dive into what the latest Bitcoin options skew is telling us. Understanding Bitcoin Options Skew First off, what exactly is Bitcoin options skew ? In simple terms, it’s a way to measure the relative cost of buying protection against a price drop (put options) versus betting on a price increase (call options) for Bitcoin. Options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price (strike price) by a certain date. The skew is calculated based on the implied volatility of these options. Implied volatility reflects the market’s expectation of how much Bitcoin’s price will move. When the implied volatility for call options is significantly higher than for put options, it means traders are willing to pay a higher premium for the chance of profiting from a price surge compared to protecting against a price fall. This indicates strong bullish sentiment. Conversely, if put options have higher implied volatility, it suggests traders are more concerned about downside risk and are paying more for protection. What the Current BTC Options Data Shows According to a recent Chart of the Day shared by Matrixport crypto on May 27, the Bitcoin options skew has reached an extreme level. Matrixport reported that the skew has fallen to nearly -10%. What does a negative skew mean? A negative skew indicates that call options are significantly more expensive than put options. Specifically, implied volatility for calls is now approximately 10% higher than for puts. This highlights a strong bias among traders towards expecting and positioning for further upward price movement in Bitcoin. It suggests traders are prioritizing potential gains over hedging against potential losses. This isn’t just a slight lean towards bullishness; a -10% skew is considered an extreme reading, reflecting a high degree of optimism prevailing in the market. Is Extreme Crypto Market Sentiment a Warning Sign? While it feels good to see high optimism, especially after periods of consolidation or downturns, extreme sentiment can sometimes be a contrarian indicator. This is a key point highlighted by the Matrixport crypto analysis. Why is excessive optimism potentially problematic? When too many market participants are positioned on one side of the trade (in this case, betting heavily on upside via calls), the market can become vulnerable. If something triggers a shift in sentiment or a wave of profit-taking, there might not be enough buyers to absorb the selling pressure, leading to a sharper-than-expected pullback. Matrixport specifically noted that such extreme bullish sentiment readings from the options skew have historically preceded short-term market pullbacks in Bitcoin. Historical Context and Bitcoin Price Analysis Looking back at historical data, there have been instances where a highly negative options skew (indicating extreme bullishness) coincided with or shortly preceded local price tops before a correction occurred. This doesn’t mean a crash is imminent, but it suggests that the market might be getting a little ahead of itself. Consider this simplified idea: Sentiment Indicator (Options Skew) Trader Positioning Potential Market Reaction Extremely Bullish (Negative Skew) Heavy buying of calls, less demand for puts Increased risk of profit-taking or reversal Neutral Skew Balanced interest in calls and puts More stable market conditions Extremely Bearish (Positive Skew) Heavy buying of puts, less demand for calls Increased potential for a relief rally or bottoming This historical pattern is why Bitcoin price analysis often includes looking at derivatives data like options skew. It provides insight into the collective positioning and sentiment of sophisticated traders. Actionable Insights for Your BTC Options Strategy So, if the Bitcoin options skew is flashing an extreme bullish signal that has historically preceded pullbacks, what should traders and investors consider? For Call Buyers: Be cautious. While the trend might still be up, the premium for calls is high. Consider if the potential upside justifies the cost, or if scaling back exposure or using tighter stop losses is warranted. For Put Buyers: Puts are relatively cheaper right now (in terms of implied volatility). If you are concerned about a potential short-term dip, buying puts could be a relatively cost-effective way to hedge your spot holdings or short-term long positions. For Option Sellers: Selling calls when premiums are high might seem attractive, but be aware of the risk if the bullish trend continues strongly. Selling puts could be an option if you expect the market to hold up or rebound, but this also carries significant risk if a sharp downturn occurs. Overall Strategy: This signal doesn’t necessarily mean you should abandon your long-term Bitcoin strategy. However, for short-term trading or managing risk, paying attention to this extreme skew and considering hedging strategies or reducing leverage might be prudent. It’s crucial to remember that options skew is just one indicator among many. A comprehensive Bitcoin price analysis should also include technical indicators, on-chain data, macroeconomic factors, and news events. Beyond the Skew: Other Factors Influencing Crypto Market Sentiment While the Bitcoin options skew provides valuable insight into trader positioning, the overall crypto market sentiment is influenced by numerous factors: Macroeconomics: Interest rates, inflation data, and global economic stability play a significant role. Regulatory News: Developments regarding crypto regulation in major economies can heavily impact sentiment. Institutional Adoption: News about large institutions investing in Bitcoin or offering crypto services often boosts optimism. Technological Developments: Upgrades or issues with the Bitcoin network or other major blockchains can affect confidence. Geopolitical Events: Global events can drive risk-on or risk-off sentiment across all markets, including crypto. Therefore, while the options skew is a powerful tool for understanding derivatives market positioning, it should be viewed as part of a larger mosaic when assessing the overall market outlook. Challenges and Nuances Interpreting the Bitcoin options skew isn’t always straightforward. Extreme readings don’t guarantee an immediate reversal. Sometimes, extreme sentiment can persist for a while before a correction occurs. Also, the skew can be influenced by factors other than pure directional bets, such as large players hedging existing positions. The analysis from Matrixport crypto provides a valuable data point, but it’s essential for traders to do their own research and consider their individual risk tolerance and investment goals. Conclusion: Caution Amidst the Optimism The current state of the Bitcoin options skew , as highlighted by Matrixport, points to a level of bullishness that is historically associated with increased risk of a short-term pullback. While the overall trend for Bitcoin may remain positive, the derivatives market is signaling that caution might be warranted at these elevated levels of optimism. Paying attention to indicators like the Bitcoin options skew is crucial for understanding the underlying dynamics of the market beyond just price action. It helps reveal how traders are positioned and the collective sentiment regarding future price movements. As always, a balanced approach that considers multiple data points and risk management is key in navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency.

2025-05-27T10:07:07.000Z,"Japan’s Debt Crisis and Bond Market Meltdown Explained – Is Bitcoin the Answer?","The post Japan’s Debt Crisis and Bond Market Meltdown Explained – Is Bitcoin the Answer? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Not a lot of people are talking about this. Japan’s bond market is unraveling fast and it’s not just a local problem. More than half a trillion dollars in value has been wiped out in just weeks, triggering alarm bells across global markets. Bond volatility is now back at levels not seen since the 2008 crisis, and the ripple effects are just beginning to surface. If you think this is just another macro event, think again. From Tokyo to Wall Street, this collapse is driving a quiet – but growing – shift into Bitcoin. And it’s happening under the radar. What’s really going on in Japan’s economy? Why are long-dated bonds plunging? And what does all this have to do with crypto? Let’s break it down. A $500B Crash and the Return of Bond Volatility Over the past 45 days, Japan’s 30-year government bond yield has surged by 100bps, hitting a record 3.20%. The 40-year bond, often seen as a long-term safe haven, has dropped over 20% in value, triggering losses of more than $500 billion across the market. This isn’t normal volatility. According to analyst Financelot , “Japan’s bond market liquidity has dropped to 2008 Lehman crisis levels. Are we about to experience another financial crisis?” Let’s talk about the why. Understanding the Japan Bond Crisis The Bank of Japan is unwinding years of ultra-loose policy. After aggressively buying up government bonds for years, the central bank is now stepping back – and that flood of supply is overwhelming buyers. With the BOJ still holding over $4.1 trillion in bonds – 52% of the entire market – even a small shift in policy is enough to rattle the system. Japan’s Debt Machine Is Overheating Japan’s economic numbers aren’t helping. GDP shrank by 0.7% in Q1, more than double the expected drop, while inflation has crept up to 3.6%. Real wages, meanwhile, are down 2.1% year over year. This mix of slowing growth and rising prices – classic stagflation – is squeezing both investors and policymakers. And it’s hitting Japan’s global strategies hard. The yen carry trade, once a go-to for global liquidity, is under pressure as rising Japanese yields flip the math. “The huge mess is coming home to roost,” wrote Wolf Street , pointing to the growing cracks in Japan’s once-stable financial structure. In the background, Japanese institutions are pulling back from U.S. Treasuries too; selling off $119.3 billion in just one quarter. That’s the largest quarterly drop since 2012. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Thailand Unlocks Crypto Payments for Tourists Without Impacting Local Currency , Bitcoin Becomes the Go-To Saviour It’s clear traditional markets are struggling. Now, some investors are quietly moving toward crypto, especially Bitcoin. With bonds no longer feeling so “safe,” BTC is starting to look like a viable hedge against global debt risks. “Is it a coincidence that the UK and Japan are seeing huge demand for bitcoin exposure?” asked analyst James Van Straten , as long-term bond yields in both countries spike. Bitwise’s Andre Dragosche and Cauê Oliveira, Head of Research at BlockTrendsBR echoed the trend – hinting that institutional capital is starting to see Bitcoin in a new light. That shift won’t happen overnight. If the yen continues to fall and the dollar strengthens, crypto markets could still feel pressure from a broader carry trade unwind. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Is Japan the most indebted country in the world? Among developed and advanced economies, Japan consistently has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio. However, countries like Sudan can have a higher overall ratio due to unique crises. Which country has the highest debt in the world?

2025-05-27T10:00:59.000Z,"Here’s Why Hyperliquid Hit New ATH At $39 And Why It Could Continue","Hyperliquid has quickly become a main character in the crypto space after it became the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange for perp trading. As its popularity has grown, so has the price of its native HYPE token. This has seen it rally even at a time of bearish divergence in the crypto market, moving up by more than 50% in one week to reach new all-time highs. Factors Driving The Hyperliquid Price The main driver behind the Hyperliquid price pushing to new all-time highs has been the rise in attention being paid to the platform. As crypto investors are pivoting toward more decentralized platforms for their perpetual trading activities, HYPE’s mindshare has grown exponentially over the last few months. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Rally Over After $111,900 ATH? Global M2 Money Supply Is Still Going This rising interest translated to a major surge in the platform’s trading volume over the last few weeks. Most notable were the billion-dollar bets placed by James Wynn, who has quickly risen to become the most popular crypto trader on Hyperliquid. His trades garnered the interest of thousands, putting more eyes on the platforms as onlookers stood by to see the outcome of his trades. In particular, over the last week, the platform recorded its highest weekly volume since it was launched, reaching $78.672 billion in trading volume between May 11 and May 18, 2025. Daily trading volumes have also not been left out, consistently crossing the $2 billion mark daily. Its highest daily trading volume yet was recorded on May 21, 2025, with $17.731 billion trade on the platform. Cumulatively, the Hyperliquid platform has reached $1.156 trillion in volume in three years of operation, DefiLlama data shows. Other major developments that the platform has seen is the rise in the open interest. The platform celebrated a new all-time high after open interest crossed the $10.1 billion mark on the platform. The amount of USDC locked on the platform also climbed to $3.5 billion, with $5.6 million in fees generated in only a 24-hour period. In one week, the platform was able to generate over $22 million in fees alone. Related Reading: XRP Price Consolidates In Tight Bullish Compression Pattern, Why $5 Is Possible On its own, the HYPE price is still showing a lot of bullish momentum despite already rising 50% in one week. Daily trading volumes crossed $460 million on May 26, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Crypto whales have been especially active during this time, as Lookonchain reported three whales spending $5.33 million to buy HYPE on Monday. With volumes rising and prices going up, it suggests that a lot of the volume is actually from buyers. If this buying pressure continues, then it is likely that the price sees further upside before putting in a correction.

Through the Baanx partnership, Exodus users can spend their crypto on everyday purchases such as travel, online shopping, and anywhere Mastercard is accepted, the firms announced at the BTC Vegas conference on Tuesday. Bringing debit card functionality to self-custody crypto holders is a fast-growing subset of the digital assets space, attracting a range of popular platforms such as Ethereum wallet firm MetaMask , decentralized finance firm 1inch and most recently, Sam Altman’s World Network . Beta testing of the virtual Exodus card begins at BTC Vegas, starting with the two major stablecoins, USDT and USDC, which users can instantly swap for bitcoin and other major cryptos inside the Exodus wallet. A wider rollout to the six million or so Exodus users will happen later this year, said Exodus CEO JP Richardson. “If you consider there are 1.7 billion people who are unbanked out there, well now they don't need a bank account because they can use something like this,” Richardson said in an interview. Baanx chief commercial officer Simon Jones echoed this view: “You are effectively saying that if you've got access to a mobile phone, you've got access to a range of basic financial services,” Jones said in an interview. “Historically, wallets were very much focused around the custodial element with some swaps and trading. Now we are really seeing an evolution happen where your wallet is becoming your virtual account.” In December of 2024, Nebraska-based Exodus was given the greenlight to list on the NYSE American , the New York Stock Exchange's sibling market, not long after Donald Trump’s election victory.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/05/27/bitcoin-wallet-firm-exodus-unveils-crypto-debit-card-with-baanx,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT","Finance|Baanx|Crypto card|News",cryptocompare

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.  Related: Stablecoins’ dominance due to limitations of US banking — Jerald DavidYield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11 billionBitget’s move into yield-bearing stablecoins comes as the asset class has surged to $11 billion. According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-enters-real-world-asset-race-with-yield-bearing-bgusd-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

As a result, any optimism stemming from the delayed US–EU tariffs may be tempered by ongoing concerns surrounding US government debt and the threat of a potential economic recession. The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector.

You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

Investors in their 30s saw the biggest growth, up 29%, followed by those in their 40s (27%), while investors over 50 increased by 25%.The FIU’s findings show that older investors have larger holdings. By year-end, 221,000 investors held at least 100 million won (about $73,000) in crypto. Of those, 172,500 — or 78% — were over 40.Related: XRP and Solana race toward the next crypto ETF approvalIn February, the head of the financial industry association urged regulators to approve Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, citing rising demand among older investors.

It’s a bit disappointing — we could have taken the lead ourselves,” Cho Jaewoo, assistant professor of social science at Hansung University, told Cointelegraph.However, the nation’s Capital Markets Act is a barrier that does not recognize crypto as eligible assets underlying ETFs. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ETFs under its dedicated crypto committee.Lee ahead in presidential election voter surveyYoon’s failed coup accelerated the presidential election and brought renewed urgency to unresolved issues in the local crypto industry.“In the 2022 presidential election, cryptocurrency was viewed as speculative and untrustworthy. But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said.South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In Q1 2024, the Korean won ranked as the most-traded fiat currency against crypto, driven largely by retail investors. Institutional players remain on the sidelines, awaiting their turn as the FSC prepares to launch pilot trading for professional investors.FSC’s planned schedule for a phased introduction of institutional crypto investment in 2025.Crypto policies were once seen as campaign strategies to sway younger voters, but this year, they’re seen as an economic and social issue that impacts multiple generations. In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs.“Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active. In the past, people looked at it with skepticism, but now it feels like the public is approaching it more neutrally and making their own judgments,” Cho said.Lee Jae-myung leads the latest voter survey by local media and Next Research.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption.

In May, such tokens totaled $4.9 billion.  Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures. The data shows that $1.4 billion in tokens will be released through a “cliff unlock,” while $1.9 billion will be emitted through a “linear unlock.” Cliff unlocks release a large portion or all of the vested tokens simultaneously, while linear unlocks emit crypto assets gradually. Largest crypto token unlocks in JuneAmong the largest token unlocks in June is Metars Genesis (MRS), a non-fungible token (NFT) project that will release $193 million worth of tokens on June 21 to fund an artificial intelligence partnership. Since March, MRS has released 10 million tokens per month, with nearly $1 billion in tokens unlocked so far.Sui (SUI) is scheduled to unlock 44 million tokens worth about $160 million on June 1. The tokens will go to the Mysten Labs treasury, early contributors and the community reserve. The largest portion, valued at more than $70 million, is allocated to Series B investors.To date, Sui has unlocked 3.3 billion tokens valued at over $12 billion, roughly 33% of its total supply.

Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.Source: Cyvers AlertZero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction.

The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto.

After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the stock did stage a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase stock closed down over 3% on May 23 at $263, falling another $1.62 after the bell. COIN is up nearly 6% so far this year.Coinbase is down from the May 23 trading session.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last.

When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
