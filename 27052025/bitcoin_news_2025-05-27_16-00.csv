Saylor says onchain proof-of-reserves a “bad idea” Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, said on May 26 that institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that poses security risks. “The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew at an event about institutions adopting the measure. “It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors.

2025-05-27T13:40:20.000Z,"Exodus Crypto Card: Unlock Seamless USDT USDC Payments","BitcoinWorld Exodus Crypto Card: Unlock Seamless USDT USDC Payments Are you an Exodus wallet user looking for an easier way to spend your stablecoins? The wait might be over. Exodus Movement (EXOD), a well-known cryptocurrency wallet provider, has taken a significant step in bridging the gap between digital assets and everyday spending. In a move set to excite its extensive user base, Exodus has officially launched a Exodus crypto card in collaboration with Baanx. What is the new Exodus Crypto Card and How Does it Work? The core idea behind the Exodus crypto card is simple yet powerful: enabling Exodus wallet users to spend their cryptocurrency holdings in the real world, anywhere Mastercard is accepted. This eliminates the need to first send crypto to an exchange, convert it to fiat currency, and then withdraw it to a bank account before making a purchase. It streamlines the entire process, offering a level of convenience previously limited for many crypto holders. Here’s a breakdown of how it generally functions: Linking Your Wallet: Users will link their Exodus wallet to the card. Selecting Assets: Initially focusing on stablecoins like USDT and USDC, users can designate which assets they want to use for spending. Point of Sale Conversion: When a purchase is made using the card, the required amount of cryptocurrency (USDT or USDC) is instantly converted into the local fiat currency (like USD, EUR, etc.) at the point of sale. Payment Processed: The fiat transaction is then processed through the Mastercard network, just like a regular debit card payment. This instant conversion is key, allowing users to leverage their digital assets for everyday transactions without the manual steps typically involved. How Does the Crypto Debit Card Bridge the Gap? The introduction of a crypto debit card by a major wallet provider like Exodus is a crucial development for mass adoption. For years, holding cryptocurrency has often felt separate from traditional financial activities. While great for investment or peer-to-peer transfers, using crypto for buying groceries, paying bills, or shopping online has been cumbersome. A crypto debit card directly addresses this friction. It acts as a seamless interface between the decentralized world of crypto and the established infrastructure of traditional payment networks like Mastercard. It empowers users by: Increasing Utility: Your crypto assets become immediately spendable at millions of locations worldwide. Simplifying Transactions: No complex conversions or transfers are needed before spending. Offering Familiarity: Using a debit card is a behavior most people are already comfortable with. This initiative helps to normalize the idea of using digital assets for commerce, moving beyond just investment or speculative use cases. Why Focus on USDT USDC Payments ? Exodus’s initial focus on enabling USDT USDC payments through the card is a strategic choice. USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin) are the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Spending highly volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum for everyday purchases can be risky. The value could drop significantly between the time you intend to spend it and the moment of the transaction, or even within minutes. By focusing on stablecoins, Exodus offers a more predictable spending experience for its users. Benefits of using stablecoins for card payments: Value Stability: Minimizes the risk of your spending power fluctuating dramatically due to market volatility. Predictability: You know roughly how much fiat currency your stablecoins will convert to. Wider Acceptance Potential: As spending ramps up, stablecoins offer a more reliable medium for merchants receiving payments (even if indirectly via conversion). This focus makes the card a practical tool for daily expenses, not just for spending speculative gains. Exploring the Exodus Baanx Partnership The collaboration between Exodus Baanx is foundational to this new offering. Exodus brings its large user base of over six million users and its established, user-friendly wallet technology. Baanx, on the other hand, specializes in providing crypto-friendly financial services infrastructure, including card issuance and processing capabilities, often in partnership with traditional financial institutions like Mastercard. This partnership is a classic example of a crypto-native company leveraging the expertise and regulatory compliance of a fintech provider to access traditional financial rails. Baanx facilitates the complex backend operations required to issue cards, manage conversions, and process transactions through the Mastercard network, allowing Exodus to focus on its core wallet experience and user interface. Key aspects of the partnership: Leveraging Expertise: Exodus focuses on the wallet and user experience, Baanx handles the financial infrastructure and compliance. Accessing Networks: Baanx’s connections enable the card to operate on the global Mastercard network. Scalability: This model allows Exodus to potentially scale the card offering to its vast user base. The synergy between Exodus Baanx is what makes this crypto-to-fiat spending solution possible on a large scale. Making Everyday Crypto Payments a Reality The launch of the Exodus card is a significant step towards making everyday crypto payments a mainstream reality. While other crypto cards exist, the integration directly within the popular Exodus wallet simplifies the process for its existing users. Currently, the card is undergoing beta testing at BTC Vegas, a relevant event for the crypto community. This testing phase allows Exodus and Baanx to gather feedback and refine the user experience before a wider rollout. The plan is to make the card available to Exodus’s six million users later this year, a move that could significantly increase the volume of stablecoin transactions in the real economy. What this means for users: Enhanced Liquidity: Your stablecoins are no longer just sitting in a wallet; they are liquid assets ready to be spent. Convenience: Pay for goods and services online or in physical stores with your crypto holdings. Potential for Global Use: Accepted anywhere Mastercard is, offering flexibility for travelers or online shoppers. This initiative pushes the boundaries of how people interact with their digital assets, making crypto payments feel much more like using traditional money. Considering the Details: Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights While the prospect of spending crypto directly is exciting, potential users should consider several factors: Benefits: Ease of Use: Spend crypto like fiat currency. Global Acceptance: Works anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Direct Integration: Seamlessly linked to your Exodus wallet. Stablecoin Focus: Reduces volatility risk for spending. Challenges & Considerations: Fees: Be aware of potential conversion fees, transaction fees, or card maintenance fees. These can vary and impact the effective cost of using your crypto. Tax Implications: In many jurisdictions, spending cryptocurrency is considered a taxable event (a capital gain or loss). Users need to understand their local tax obligations. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for crypto cards is still evolving and can vary by region. Conversion Rates: While stablecoins aim for stability, minor fluctuations or the specific exchange rate used at the moment of conversion could impact the final fiat amount. Limited Asset Support (Initial): Currently focused on USDT and USDC. Support for other assets may come later, but for now, it’s stablecoin-centric. Actionable Insights for Users: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Exodus regarding the full rollout, terms, and fees. Understand the Fees: Before using the card extensively, make sure you are clear on all associated costs. Know Your Tax Obligations: Consult with a tax professional to understand how spending crypto impacts your taxes. Start Small: If you are new to crypto cards, perhaps try using it for smaller purchases first to get comfortable with the process and monitor transactions. Secure Your Wallet: As the card is linked to your Exodus wallet, ensure your wallet security practices are robust. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Crypto Adoption The launch of the Exodus crypto debit card in partnership with Baanx marks a significant milestone in the journey towards widespread cryptocurrency adoption. By providing a simple, convenient way for millions of Exodus users to spend their stablecoins like USDT and USDC through the ubiquitous Mastercard network, this initiative removes significant barriers to entry for everyday crypto commerce. While currently in beta, the planned rollout to Exodus’s six million users later this year has the potential to dramatically increase the practical utility of stablecoins and make crypto payments a more common sight in the global economy. As with any financial tool involving cryptocurrency, users should proceed with awareness regarding fees, taxes, and security, but the fundamental promise of seamless spending offered by the Exodus crypto card is a powerful step forward for the entire ecosystem.

2025-05-27T13:30:16.000Z,"Bitcoin Price: Warning Signs Emerge for Potential Correction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Warning Signs Emerge for Potential Correction Are you invested in Bitcoin? Keeping a close eye on the latest market signals is crucial, especially when prominent analysts weigh in. Recently, well-known on-chain analyst Willy Woo shared insights suggesting that the current state of the crypto market might be flashing cautionary signs for the Bitcoin price . What is Willy Woo Saying About the Bitcoin Price? Willy Woo, highly regarded in the crypto community for his data-driven approach to market analysis, has pointed to specific on-chain metrics that indicate potential headwinds for Bitcoin. His recent observations, shared on platform X, highlight concerns about excessive speculation and investor behavior at current price levels. According to Woo, one key metric, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator , is signaling that investors are taking profits. While profit-taking is a natural part of any market cycle, excessive or widespread profit realization, especially after a significant run-up, can indicate that selling pressure is mounting. Woo specifically noted: Investor profits are peaking, suggesting a potential top in the short term. The SOPR indicator reaching certain levels often precedes market cool-downs or corrections. If Bitcoin doesn’t establish new all-time highs relatively soon, long-term charts could show bearish divergences, a technical pattern that often signals a potential trend reversal or significant pullback. Understanding the SOPR Indicator and Bearish Divergence To fully grasp Woo’s warning, let’s break down the concepts he mentioned: The SOPR Indicator: SOPR stands for Spent Output Profit Ratio. It’s an on-chain metric that looks at the average profit or loss of all coins moved on a given day. It’s calculated by dividing the realized value (price when sold) by the acquisition value (price when bought) for all spent outputs. Here’s what different values mean: SOPR > 1: On average, coins moved were sold at a profit. SOPR On average, coins moved were sold at a loss. SOPR = 1: On average, coins moved broke even. When SOPR is significantly above 1 and stays there, it indicates that market participants are, on average, selling for profit. While this is normal, extended periods or rapid spikes can suggest euphoria and potential overextension, making the market vulnerable to a Bitcoin correction . Bearish Divergence: In technical analysis, a bearish divergence occurs when the price of an asset makes a higher high, but a related indicator (like RSI, MACD, or potentially on-chain metrics smoothed over time) makes a lower high. This divergence suggests that the underlying momentum supporting the price increase is weakening, even as the price itself pushes higher. If Bitcoin’s price were to struggle to make new highs while certain long-term on-chain indicators like SOPR (or derivatives of it) show declining strength, it could form a bearish divergence pattern, increasing the probability of a downward move. Why is a Lull in Capital Flows Concerning for the Crypto Market? Willy Woo also highlighted a noticeable slowdown in capital inflows following a hypothetical significant rally (as mentioned in the source, from $75,000 to $112,000 – Note: This specific rally did not occur recently in real market history, but the principle of observing capital flows after a rally remains relevant to the analyst’s point ). Capital flows, whether from new investors entering the market or existing holders deploying more capital, are the fuel for price increases. Think of it like this: Strong Inflows: More buyers entering than sellers, pushing prices up. Weak/Lulling Inflows: The buying pressure is decreasing. If selling pressure (like profit-taking signaled by SOPR) remains constant or increases while buying slows down, the path of least resistance for the price is downwards. A lull suggests that the immediate impetus that drove the recent rally might be fading. This shift in momentum makes the market more susceptible to pullbacks, especially if combined with signals of profit-taking like those from the SOPR indicator . Potential Scenarios and Challenges Ahead Based on Woo’s analysis, here are some potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price : Scenario 1: Continued Sideways Movement or Minor Pullback If profit-taking continues but is met with moderate buying interest, Bitcoin might trade sideways or experience a shallow correction as the market digests the recent gains and the supply absorbed by profit-takers is gradually bought up by new demand. Scenario 2: Increased Profit-Taking Leading to a Significant Bitcoin Correction If the signals from the SOPR indicator intensify, leading to a cascade of selling pressure (perhaps triggered by a negative news event or broader market sentiment shift), the price could see a more significant downturn. This aligns with Woo’s warning about a potential correction if profit-taking accelerates. Scenario 3: Overcoming Signals and Pushing to New Highs Despite the warning signs, markets are dynamic. A sudden influx of significant buying pressure (e.g., from institutional investors or positive macroeconomic news) could potentially override the bearish signals, allowing Bitcoin to break through resistance and set new highs, invalidating the potential bearish divergence scenario. The main challenge for investors is navigating this period of uncertainty. Relying on a single indicator or analyst’s view can be risky. The crypto market is known for its volatility and rapid shifts in sentiment. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the potential for a Bitcoin correction and the signals from analysts like Willy Woo, what steps can investors consider? Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance. If you’ve made significant profits, consider taking some off the table or setting stop-loss orders to protect gains. Stay Informed: Keep watching key on-chain indicators like SOPR, funding rates, and exchange flows. Follow reputable analysts but understand that no one has a crystal ball. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re accumulating Bitcoin, continue with a DCA strategy. Corrections can present opportunities for buying at lower prices. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just react to headlines. Try to understand the underlying reasons behind market movements, whether they are driven by speculation, fundamental adoption, or macroeconomic factors. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a major focus, consider the broader crypto market and how different assets might perform in various scenarios. These are not financial recommendations, but rather points to consider as part of your own research and strategy. Summary: Is a Bitcoin Correction on the Horizon? Willy Woo’s analysis serves as a timely reminder that even after significant price rallies, caution is warranted. Signals from the SOPR indicator pointing to increased profit-taking and observations of a lull in capital flows suggest that the immediate bullish momentum may be waning. While not a definitive prediction, these signs raise the probability of a potential Bitcoin correction or a period of consolidation. Investors should pay close attention to how these on-chain dynamics evolve and consider managing their risk accordingly in the ever-watchful crypto market .

Upon closing, SharpLink plans to adopt Ethereum ( ETH ) as its primary treasury reserve asset, a strategy reminiscent of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin play. SharpLink Gaming shares surged over 420% in pre-market trading on May 27, jumping from $6.72 to $34.75 following the news. The company said it will continue to serve the U.S. sports betting and global iGaming markets, but the ETH strategy signals a dual identity as a public vehicle with crypto exposure. “This is a significant milestone in SharpLink’s journey,” said CEO Rob Phythian. “We look forward to working with Consensys and welcoming Joseph to the Board.” You might also like: WinnerMining launches efficient cloud mining amid 2025 Bitcoin Conference Joseph Lubin to join the company’s Board Joseph Lubin will become Chairman of the Board after the deal closes, marking a deeper alignment between SharpLink and the Ethereum ecosystem. “This is an exciting time for the Ethereum community,” said Lubin. “We look forward to working with SharpLink to explore and develop their Ethereum Treasury Strategy.” The offering was conducted in reliance on private placement exemptions and includes a registration rights agreement for resale of the shares. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners acted as sole placement agent. The move positions SharpLink as one of the first public companies to center its treasury around Ethereum, signaling a new investment thesis for traditional investors seeking ETH exposure.

2025-05-27T13:25:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Declines But Analysts Expect Bounce To $120,000","Bitcoin’s (BTC) momentum has waned this week as markets remained flat thanks to the extended weekend. Price action remained muted despite Strategy announcing its latest Bitcoin purchase. The firm completed the acquisition of 4,020 BTC for $427 million, taking its total stash to over 580,000 BTC . The flagship cryptocurrency experienced selling pressure as short-term holders faced margin calls and liquidations. However, long-term holders took advantage and increased their accumulation. Robert Kiyosaki Calls Bitcoin “Easiest Money Ever” Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki believes Bitcoin (BTC) represents the easiest way in history to become rich, citing the asset’s limited supply and endorsements from prominent industry figures. Kiyosaki’s comments came after the flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high, hovering around $110,000. The author also said this was just the beginning of Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, predicting a move to $250,000 by the end of the year. Kiyosaki expressed disbelief at investors who had not yet embraced Bitcoin , saying that even holdings as small as 0.01 BTC could become priceless within years. He pointed at the asset’s limited supply as a key driver for future price appreciation. “I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich…so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years and maybe make you very rich. Sure, Bitcoin goes up and down, but so does real life. There are only 1 or 2 million Bitcoin left to be mined, and the price will go as Raoul Pal describes, into the Banana Zone.” Bitcoin (BTC) Trades Flat On Memorial Day Bitcoin (BTC) traded flat on Monday, ending the session where it began after some negligible intraday price action. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly crossed the $110,000 mark but fell back by the afternoon, with trading volumes lower than usual thanks to the extended weekend. Analysts believe Bitcoin could still move towards $120,000. Analyst Aziz Zamani stated, “The bullish market structure remains intact. From the key swing low at $91,500, Bitcoin has consistently carved out higher lows and higher highs which represents signs of a strong trend. As long as $106,500 continues to hold, momentum remains with the bulls. The current pause in the market appears to be a consolidation within an uptrend rather than a reversal or topping pattern.” However, several macroeconomic factors could set the tone for the week on Tuesday. President Trump announced a delay in the planned 50% tariff on imports from the EU, pushing the deadline from June 1 to July 9, easing immediate fears of another trade war. Markets are also waiting for key data releases, with consumer confidence data set to be released on Tuesday, followed by a GDP report on Thursday and GDP figures on Friday. Was Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Driven By The Japanese Bond Market Crisis? BTC’s surge to a new all-time high could be linked to ongoing issues in the Japanese bond market, indicating BTC’s growing reputation as a hedge against instability in traditional financial systems. Analysts also attributed the surge to geopolitical developments, while macroeconomic developments have also played a significant role in dictating BTC’s recent price action. According to Bitwise’s head of European research, Andre Dragosch, Japan’s long-term bond yields have registered a substantial spike. The 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20 before retreating to 3.115% on May 23. Government bonds are considered safe-haven assets. However, a sharp increase in yields suggests investors are concerned about fiscal sustainability and repayment risk. Dragosch stated, “Because yields are increasing, sustainability becomes more of an issue, meaning credit risk increases, meaning yields increase even more. And so you end up in this kind of fiscal debt doom loop. This is now affecting other bond markets, especially the US Treasury market. Bitcoin is an immutable asset. It’s free of counterparty risk. It’s a hedge against sovereign risk and sovereign default. Perceived default risk continues rising yields continue rising. This is a rough benchmark of why Bitcoin could be heading toward $200,000.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week on a mellow note as US markets remained closed thanks to the extended Memorial Day weekend. Some analysts believe that besides the holiday, BTC’s rally to a new all-time high has triggered buyer fatigue. The rally dragged the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) into the overbought zone, suggesting an imminent decline. Signs of waning momentum emerged as the RSI dropped below 70 after a 15% decline. Market intelligence firm Glassnode stated, “This decline may signal cooling buyer enthusiasm, reduction in upward momentum, and a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.” Data from Glassnode also shows that while Bitcoin futures Open Interest reached an all-time high and funding rates increased, the perpetual CVD trended lower, suggesting stronger sell-side flows. “The persistent decline in CVD reflects bearish sentiment, highlighting dominant sell-side pressure in Bitcoin’s futures market.” Analysts believe BTC could break out to $150,000, with AlphaBTC stating, “Bitcoin is still holding above the 106K level. After taking the all-time high, I am watching how $BTC performs over the next couple of days. Ideally, it blasts up and shows strength to leave the breakout to be tested in the future.” BTC registered a marginal decline on Friday (May 16) and Saturday to settle at $103,235. The price rebounded on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a decline of almost 1%. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to reclaim $106,000 and settle at $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. Source: TradingView BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, surging to $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,582. Price action turned bearish on Friday thanks to President Trump’s renewed tariff threats. As a result, BTC fell nearly 4% to $107,356. The drop also occurred after the flagship cryptocurrency encountered a wall of resistance around $112,000. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Sunday to settle at $109,095. Price action was muted on Monday as BTC registered a marginal increase, briefly rising above $110,000 before settling at $109,453. The current session sees BTC marginally up, recovering from a low of $107,577, trading around $109,635. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-05-27T13:21:23.000Z,"Here’s why XRP price could blast to $10 in 2025","XRP’s price has remained consolidated over the first half of the year, currently trading at the same level it was at the beginning of the year. Ripple ( XRP ) was trading at $2.3188 on May 27, down 32% from its peak in November last year. This price action has unfolded despite numerous bullish catalysts, including ETF applications, the launch of CME futures, and the resolution of the SEC vs. Ripple case. Still, there are signs that this consolidation could lead to more gains in the long term, including a potential surge to $10. XRP price chart points to an eventual surge One potential catalyst for the XRP price is supportive technicals that may trigger a strong breakout in the coming months. First, the coin formed a giant cup and handle pattern at $1.966 between April 2021 and November last year. This pattern features a rounded bottom followed by consolidation at the top. The cup section has been completed, and the coin is now forming the handle. The cup has a depth of about 85%, and projecting the same distance from its upper edge gives a target price of $3.66. Second, XRP has also formed a bullish pennant pattern, consisting of a vertical rally followed by a symmetrical triangle. A breakout appears likely as the two trendlines approach confluence. You might also like: Quant eyes $146 as inverse H&S breakout fuels bullish reversal hopes Additionally, Ripple is supported by both short- and long-term moving averages. A bullish breakout would be confirmed if the price rises above the year-to-date high of $3.4. A move above that level could open the door to further gains, potentially reaching the psychological threshold at $5, an increase of 117% from the current level. Flipping $5 would bring the next key psychological level at $10 into view. A rally to $10 would mark a 335% surge from current levels, a plausible scenario given XRP’s nearly 500% jump in November. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news Potential catalysts for Ripple surge Several catalysts could push XRP to $10 this year. First, on the macro front, analysts expect the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in September. Such a move would likely lift Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoin prices. Second, there are rumors that BlackRock is preparing to enter the XRP ETF race, joining firms like VanEck and Franklin Templeton. That would be a significant bullish signal, given BlackRock’s influence in the ETF space. The odds that the SEC will approve XRP ETFs are over 80% on Polymarket . If approved, these products could see strong inflows, as evidenced by the leveraged XXRP ETF, which has amassed $112 million in assets in under two months. Meanwhile, data shows that XRP whales are accumulating. Addresses holding over 1 million XRP have acquired billions of tokens in recent months, positioning for a continued rally. XRP whales are buying | Source: Santiment Further, Ripple Labs is aiming to onboard more U.S. companies to the RippleNet ecosystem following the end of its legal battle with the SEC. This, along with the HiddenRoad acquisition, is expected to drive increased activity on the XRP Ledger network.

Yesterday, the Financial Times reported that Trump Media was preparing to make a crypto move similar to that of institutional Bitcoin bull Strategy. The agreement in question was made with approximately 50 institutional investors. Trump Media will sell $1.5 billion worth of stocks and $1 billion worth of bonds, and will use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. It was stated that they will work with Crypto-com and Anchorage Digital for the storage of Bitcoins. “The company plans to use the proceeds to create a Bitcoin treasury. The move, one of the largest Bitcoin treasury deals of any public company, closes out Trump Media’s previously announced private buyout fund. This is one of the many ways, including potential mergers and acquisitions, that the company aims to expand its reach in the Pre-American economy.” “We view Bitcoin as the ultimate vehicle for financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold crypto as a significant portion of our assets,” said Devin Nunes, Trump Media CEO and Chairman, in a statement about the $2.5 billion Bitcoin move. “This investment, our first purchase of a crown jewel asset, will help defend our Company against the harassment and discrimination by financial institutions that plague so many Americans and U.S. businesses, and will create synergies across Truth Social and Truth+ for subscription payments, a utility token, and other planned transactions. It’s a big step in the Company’s plans to transform into a holding company by acquiring additional profitable crown jewel assets that align with America First principles.” Following the news, Bitcoin prices rose. *This is not investment advice.

President Trump has repeatedly signaled his unwavering support for crypto. Trump stated he intends to make the US the crypto capital of the world. If the raise is successful, it will align Trump Media Group with a growing trend among publicly traded companies that use debt and equity offerings to build a Bitcoin treasure, the most prominent example being Strategy. Coinbase Adds Support For Tokens In Germany Coinbase has announced trading support for eight tokens in Germany, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade them. The eight tokens are Rocket Pool (RPL), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Renzo (REZ), Reserve Rights (RSR), AETHIR (ATH), Syrup (SYRUP), Pendle (PENDLE), and Layer3 (L3). Aethir jumped over 12% following the news, while Rocket Pool rose 3%. PENGU and REZ also registered marginal increases. Support for the tokens will allow Coinbase users in Germany to buy, sell, and convert these assets. The exchange will also support token transfers and storage. Coinbase secured regulatory approval for operations in Germany in 2021, with the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority licensing Coinbase Germany GmbH for trading and crypto custody. Coinbase Faces Lawsuit After Data Breach Coinbase is facing a lawsuit over allegations it violated securities laws and issued misleading statements to its shareholders. The lawsuit comes a week after the exchange drew substantial criticism for revealing it had suffered a data breach. In a complaint filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Coinbase investor Brady Nessler alleged he suffered significant financial losses and damages due to Coinbase’s wrongful acts and omissions. According to Nessler, the exchange failed to promptly disclose that customer data was compromised. The data breach finally came to light on May 15, causing the company’s stock to plunge 7%. The lawsuit also alleges that Coinbase declined to disclose information related to its dealings with UK regulators in 2020, a year before the platform went public in the US. The filing stated, “As a result of Defendant’s wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.” However, Andrew Rossow, a reputation management attorney and founder of Rossow Law, stated that anyone can file a lawsuit in the US, and courts can quickly dismiss cases if they have no legal basis. “While almost anyone can try to sue for many reasons, there are important rules and limits. For example, courts can quickly dismiss cases that have no legal basis, even if everything the person says is true.” Cambodian Authorities Entangled In Crypto-Fueled Scam Economy Cambodia’s ruling elite is entangled in a global scam economy powered by crypto, with senior officials linked to billion-dollar laundering networks and platforms built to evade oversight. According to a report by the Humanity Research Consultancy (HRC), high-ranking members of the Cambodian People’s Party have enabled and profited from transnational schemes that rely on trafficked labor and crypto. The report singled out Huione Group in particular, calling it a critical part of a “vertically integrated” scam industry worth up to $19 billion. Jacob Sims, the report’s author, stated, “Cambodia is likely the absolute global epicenter of next-gen transnational fraud in 2025.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a marginal increase on Monday as its rally stalled around the $110,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a dramatic decline on Friday as selling pressure and profit-taking weighed the price down. According to analysts, the rally stalled as short-term holders took profits to the tune of $11 billion. Renewed tariff threats also soured investor sentiment, although a moratorium saw markets react positively. BTC’s surge to a new all-time high could be linked to ongoing issues in the Japanese bond market, indicating BTC’s growing reputation as a hedge against instability in traditional financial systems.

The price rebounded on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. Despite the positive end to the weekend, BTC was back in the red on Monday, dropping to an intraday low of $102,35 before rebounding to settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%.

Source: TradingView BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,582. Price action turned bearish on Friday thanks to President Trump’s renewed tariff threats. As a result, BTC fell nearly 4% to $107,356. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Sunday to settle at $109,095. BTC remained positive on Monday, registering a marginal increase and settling at $109,453 after briefly crossing $110,000. The current session sees the flagship cryptocurrency marginally up, recovering from an intraday low of $107,577. A bearish MACD indicates sellers have the upper hand. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has rebounded during the ongoing session after facing considerable selling pressure over the weekend and Monday. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up nearly 3% during the ongoing session as buyer activity increases. ETH exchange flows returned to net outflows over the past 48 hours, indicating that investors are moving their assets from exchanges into private wallets. This suggests buying pressure is gaining steam across spot exchanges after three consecutive days of net inflows, or seller dominance. Despite the negligible net ETH selling recorded across crypto exchanges towards the end of last week, spot Ethereum ETFs maintained a positive structure, registering a weekly net inflow of $248 million, according to data from SoSoValue. ETH started the previous weekend in the red, registering a marginal decline on Friday (May 16). The price continued to drop on Saturday, falling 2.44% to slip below $2,500 and settle at $2,475. ETH faced volatility and selling pressure on Sunday but ultimately registered an increase of nearly 1% and settled at $2,498. The price plunged to an intraday low of $2,349 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 1.18%, reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,527. ETH registered a marginal decline on Tuesday before rebounding on Wednesday and settling at $2,552. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rose over 4% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,664. The price reached an intraday high of $2,731 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level and falling over 5% to $2,525. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH rebounded over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $2,551. The current week started positively, with the price registering a marginal increase and settling at $2,564. The current session sees ETH up nearly 3%, trading around $2,634. ETH faces resistance between $2,700 and $2,800. A break above this level could see the price surge to $3,000. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Despite registering a significant rally the previous week, Solana (SOL) struggled to cross $180 and the 200-day SMA. SOL’s rally sparked speculations about a potential move towards $200. However, the Ethereum killer has encountered stubborn upper-level resistance, preventing a move past $180 to $200. One analyst made a bold prediction for SOL, suggesting it is nearing a rounding bottom breakout. SOL registered a 20% increase this month after an 18% reversal in April, with the recovery price action forming a U-shape, with the neckline near the $180 supply zone. A potential close above the $183 mark could indicate the beginning of the next bull run for SOL. Source: TradingView SOL dropped nearly 1% on Friday (May 16) and fell to $167. The price declined on Saturday, falling 0.89% to $165. Despite the bearish sentiment, SOL rebounded on Sunday, rising 4.45% to reclaim $170 and settle at $173. SOL plunged to an intraday low of $159 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded to reclaim $160 and settle at $166, ultimately registering a decline of nearly 4%. Despite the negative start to the week, SOL recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.05% to $168. Buyers retained control on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $170 and settle at $173. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price registered an increase of 3.52% and settled at $179. SOL raced to an intraday day high of $187 on Friday as buying pressure increased. However, it could not stay at this level, ultimately dropping over 3% to $173.

2025-05-27T13:04:56.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Trump Media Eyes Another Major Digital Asset Investment","Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), the company behind Truth Social, is reportedly preparing a massive capital raise aimed squarely at acquiring digital assets. According to the Financial Times , the company could unveil its plans at the high-profile Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas. If confirmed, this wouldn’t just be a headline moment—it could be a tipping point. With Trump Media echoing Michael Saylor’s strategic approach, this potential crypto acquisition reinforces how even politically rooted businesses are eyeing blockchain assets as a viable store of value. Investors would be wise to pay attention—something big might be brewing. Trump Media Could Trigger a Fresh Wave of Institutional Crypto Adoption Trump Media’s reported $3 billion raise isn’t just a splashy headline—it’s another chapter in the ongoing mainstreaming of crypto on Wall Street’s terms. The strategy, borrowing elements from MicroStrategy’s successful BTC play, suggests DJT is positioning itself as more than a media outlet. It wants to be seen as a modern financial entity—one that bets on digital assets rather than just advertising dollars. The timing of this announcement, likely to be made at Bitcoin 2025, is no coincidence. With institutional momentum gathering and the political climate increasingly open to digital innovation, DJT’s move may signal a broader ideological shift: crypto as a financial pillar, not just a tech experiment. Its partnership plans with Crypto.com and a future financial platform focused on ETFs indicate a clear roadmap toward financial diversification. If Trump Media succeeds, expect other politically linked corporations to explore similar paths. For retail investors, this could mean increased volatility but also new opportunities—particularly for projects with utility, strong narratives, or ties to public sentiment. Best Crypto to Buy Now to Leverage Growing Institutional Interest SUBBD As big names like Trump Media inch toward deeper crypto integration, projects designed to serve real digital economies like SUBBD are starting to gain traction. SUBBD as a project is all about rewriting the rules for how creators earn, grow, and interact with their audiences. Built to function beyond just hype, the platform empowers creators to launch their own digital economies using the $SUBBD token, which acts as both a currency and utility tool. The project’s infrastructure makes it easy for influencers and content-makers to create subscription models, monetize engagement directly, and reward loyal fans—without relying on centralized platforms. With Trump Media planning its own crypto-powered financial platform, the broader narrative is shifting: digital-first economies are gaining ground, and decentralized solutions like SUBBD could fill a much-needed gap. SUBBD is also playing to its strengths by focusing on the creator economy, one of the most active sectors for blockchain use. From token-gated content to direct ownership of fan communities, it removes middlemen from the equation and restores control to those who build audiences from scratch. This kind of forward-facing model aligns well with the growing appetite from institutions and media groups looking to secure real utility in their digital portfolios. As more firms begin to view crypto through a strategic, revenue-focused lens—like DJT appears to be doing—projects that offer usable products, audience loyalty, and clear monetization will likely earn serious consideration. SUBBD seems well-positioned to benefit from that transition. Solaxy With Trump Media exploring multi-billion-dollar crypto allocations and hinting at future financial products, there’s growing evidence that utility-based assets are gaining investor favor. Solaxy enters the scene with something different: a sustainability-focused Layer 2 network designed to bridge Ethereum and Solana, while rewarding users for environmentally conscious staking practices. Unlike speculative tokens chasing quick gains, Solaxy delivers an infrastructure solution that tackles scalability and energy efficiency at the same time. Its native token, SOLX, allows users to participate in staking with high APYs while supporting a network that aligns with global clean energy goals. As institutions evaluate assets for long-term treasury inclusion, alignment with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria is becoming increasingly important. Solaxy hits that mark. The platform also integrates eco-validating nodes, ensuring that transactions are both secure and efficient. For investors, that presents a dual opportunity: participate in a fast and affordable blockchain ecosystem while supporting a growing movement toward responsible crypto usage. Solaxy’s media popularity also shot up as its presale raise crossed the $41 million mark, an impressive amount for a meme-styled project. It was called a high-potential project by top creators like ClayBro and many others for this very reason. With Trump Media signaling interest in ETFs and long-term crypto positioning, Solaxy’s approach matches the mood—especially for entities looking to hold blockchain assets that can be tied to positive real-world impact. As sustainability becomes a core theme in finance, Solaxy isn’t just relevant—it may be essential. And as more public firms begin building crypto exposure into their broader strategies, green-aligned infrastructure solutions like this are likely to move from the fringes into the mainstream. MIND of Pepe Trump Media’s interest in launching financial services around ETFs and digital assets highlights one trend above all—data will be king. That’s exactly where MIND of Pepe thrives. Built as a sentiment-tracking memecoin with an AI-powered engine, the project isn’t a novelty—it’s a tool. It gives retail and institutional investors access to a real-time pulse of crypto chatter, helping decode trends across social media platforms and crypto communities. $MIND acts as the key to accessing analytics that can inform trading decisions, identify viral movements before they peak, and measure community sentiment with surprising accuracy. As high-level players like Trump Media explore data-driven financial products, the appeal of having a memecoin that functions like an AI-driven sentiment oracle could become increasingly clear. In a market where narrative often moves faster than news, projects like MIND of Pepe help decode what actually matters. And with retail investors growing savvier by the day, there’s value in having tools that help separate hype from real momentum. That’s what MIND delivers—and it does so through a familiar cultural wrapper that appeals to both meme traders and analytics enthusiasts. With institutional interest moving toward tools that can bridge sentiment and strategy, the presence of such AI-powered projects may become far more valuable than initially assumed. For those watching crypto’s next phase of evolution, MIND of Pepe offers a smart, quirky entry point into the growing field of intelligent investing. BTC Bull As Trump Media eyes Bitcoin-focused financial offerings, it’s clear that BTC isn’t just viewed as a store of value anymore—it’s becoming a cultural symbol of financial independence. BTC Bull is a meme coin that channels this very logic, tying its brand identity directly to the world’s leading cryptocurrency while introducing new ways to engage and support the Bitcoin ecosystem. BTC Bull offers a straightforward staking model, community-first governance, and a narrative that celebrates the broader Bitcoin movement. Built as a tribute to Bitcoin’s longevity and ideals, the token is crafted to appeal to those who see crypto not just as a tech play but as a philosophical stance—something that resonates with Trump Media’s messaging, too. Its main utility, however, depends on Bitcoin’s growth, since each price milestone will result in an airdrop for the token holders. The project also introduces a staking mechanism that rewards holders with meaningful returns, encouraging long-term participation over quick speculation. As institutional attention widens, memecoins with purpose and alignment to larger narratives—like Bitcoin advocacy—may see renewed interest. The more they hate, the higher we go. 🍾🥂 pic.twitter.com/bL4MjYTOH2 — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 24, 2025 BTC Bull’s visuals, mechanics, and story tap into the broader shift toward digital financial independence, a theme that will likely grow stronger as media and corporate entities embrace crypto. For investors looking to engage with memecoins that reflect real movements and ideologies, BTC Bull provides an avenue that feels authentic, timely, and well-aligned with where the market appears to be heading. Conclusion Trump Media’s crypto ambitions aren’t just noise—they’re a reminder that the line between politics, finance, and digital assets is starting to blur. When names with reach and resources begin positioning around crypto, it’s not the loudest tokens that benefit, but the ones with structure, relevance, and timing on their side. In the current environment, projects built with clarity and purpose, such as the ones mentioned above, deserve a closer look.

2025-05-27T13:02:47.000Z,"Quantum Threat to Bitcoin: Q-Day May Arrive Early","Bitcoin's traditional cryptographic foundations, secure for decades, now confront a rapidly developing threat: quantum computing. Recent warnings by a Google quantum engineer and BlackRock's risk team suggest that ”Q-Day,” the day on which quantum computers crack Bitcoin's encryption, will arrive years earlier than the much-cited 2030 estimate. The announcement has propelled a sense of urgency among developers to render the network quantum-resistant before it's too late. The Shortening Quantum Timeline Bitcoin employs elliptic curve digital signature (ECDSA) algorithms to secure wallets. Although the algorithms are virtually unbreakable for regular computers, quantum computers using Shor's algorithm could potentially break them in a few minutes. Up until recently, this danger was thought to be decades away. But in a May 2025 report, Google quantum scientist Dr. Elena Orlova warned that advances in error-corrected qubits would bring Shor-capable quantum computers within reach by 2027–2030, instead of 2040 as earlier estimated. BlackRock's risk unit echoed this in a client letter, stating that ”quantum supremacy milestones are ahead of consensus forecasts,” urging investors to make ”Q-Day” part of long-term crypto strategy. Why Bitcoin's Wallets Are Vulnerable Most Bitcoin wallets are ”reused addresses” (e.g., disposable ECDSA public keys). As soon as a quantum computer acquires the private key from a public key, it can drain the wallet. While newer wallets use ”taproot” or ”bech32” addresses that encrypt public keys until transactions occur, over 60% of Bitcoin's $1.3 trillion market capitalization remains in vulnerable legacy wallets, according to BitMEX Research. The window to respond to this threat is closing faster than we ever realized,” said Orlova. ”Even a single working quantum machine in the wrong hands could target high-value wallets.” Post-Quantum Cryptography Developers are exploring a number of promising approaches to defend Bitcoin against quantum attacks. Lamport signatures constitute one-time signature schemes that are Shor's-algorithm-resistant but at the expense of significantly larger transaction sizes, sometimes up to 100 times larger than current transactions. Yet another scheme, the XMSS (Extended Merkle Signature Scheme), is a hash-based one used already by quantum-resistant blockchains like QRL but requires wallet operators to work with complex ”signature chains.” STARKs is a third scheme, which employs zero-knowledge proofs to hide public keys entirely, such as in Layer-2 networks like StarkWare, but this scheme introduces additional mathematical overhead and can slow down transaction verification. Each of these options is accompanied by its own trade-off in terms of blockchain size, complexity of operation, and verification speed. Layer-2 Networks Lead the Way While Bitcoin's base layer wrings its hands over upgrades, Layer-2 initiatives are already playing with quantum-resistant architectures. For example, engineers on the Lightning Network are prototyping ”point-time-locked” quantum-safe contracts. Rootstock (RSK) is also in the process of integrating zk-STARKs to secure smart contracts, while multi-party computation (MPC) is employed by Fedimint community custody protocol to split private keys into quantum-proof shards. According to Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, ”The goal is to build a bridge from today's Bitcoin to a post-quantum future. Layer-2 solutions allow us to innovate without waiting for consensus around a hardfork.” The Path Forward Bitcoin's decentralized governance resists hurried upgrades. A quantum-resistant hardfork would require near-universal node acceptance — a process potentially taking years. Meanwhile, exchanges and institutional custodians like Coinbase and Fidelity are considering hybrid models, the combination of ECDSA with quantum-resistant signatures on large wallets. ”This is not a Bitcoin issue,” said Orlova. ”Every blockchain that uses ECDSA or RSA encryption is at risk. The entire digital economy needs to prioritize post-quantum standards today.”",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9325/quantum-threat-to-bitcoin-q-day-may-arrive-early,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FORKS","News|Security",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T13:01:59.000Z,"Best crypto to buy as trader makes $5.6M by betting against James Wynn’s positions","In a week filled with market surprises, one trader has captured the attention of the entire crypto community by raking in $5.6 million in profits in just three days. The trader achieved this by systematically countertrading the public positions of James Wynn, a high-profile crypto figure known for his aggressive trades and massive online following. This development has caused a buzz among crypto traders, especially with emerging cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , which offer early investment opportunities that could result in similar high returns. How the trader countertraded James Wynn According to data from blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, the trader, identified by the wallet address 0x2258, capitalised on every misstep Wynn made , flipping market sentiment to his advantage with surgical precision. On May 24, Wynn publicly opened a long position on Bitcoin, but the trader went short at the same moment and closed the trade the following day for a $1.36 million profit. The next day, Wynn switched gears and opened a short position, prompting 0x2258 to go long instead, which resulted in a $2.54 million gain when the trade was closed on May 26. As Wynn entered another long on the same day, the countertrader flipped short once again, locking in an unrealised profit of $1.7 million, according to the latest on-chain data. Lookonchain @lookonchain · Follow What a smart trader!When @JamesWynnReal goes long, he goes short. When James Wynn goes short, he goes long. And in just 3 days, he’s made $5.6M!How did he do it?👇On May 24, trader 0x2258 started shorting $BTC and $ETH , when James Wynn was long $BTC .On May 25, when 9:27 am · 27 May 2025 1.5K Reply Copy link Read 144 replies The eerie symmetry between Wynn’s losses and 0x2258’s gains has sparked rampant speculation about potential hedging strategies, market manipulation, or even the existence of a shadow wallet. Although Wynn strongly denied any connection to the wallet, dismissing the claims as “fake news with zero proof ,” the incident has cast a spotlight on the volatility and unpredictability of crypto trading. The best crypto to buy for similar high returns While traders continue to debate the mystery behind this countertrade saga, many are looking for their next opportunity to generate similar high returns in the volatile crypto market. One emerging project that’s rapidly gaining traction is Bitcoin Pepe, a meme-driven layer 2 solution built on the Bitcoin network that aims to redefine the future of meme coin trading. Unlike speculative plays with little substance, Bitcoin Pepe offers a compelling fusion of Solana-style scalability and Bitcoin-level security, targeting a sweet spot that most current platforms fail to address. The upcoming listing of Bitcoin Pepe’s native token, BPEP, on centralised exchanges (CEXs) is creating significant buzz, especially as history has shown that new tokens often experience explosive gains during their initial listings. With only four days remaining in its ongoing BPEP token presale , Bitcoin Pepe is entering a critical phase, and momentum is building among retail investors eager not to miss out. Currently priced at $0.0377, the token has already raised over $11.6 million, approaching its final presale goal of $12.7 million, which speaks volumes about investor confidence and growing hype. Why is Bitcoin Pepe a compelling investment option? The Bitcoin Pepe project isn’t just another meme coin riding the wave of internet culture—it’s the world’s first meme-centric layer 2 built directly on Bitcoin, introducing the revolutionary PEP-20 token standard. This standard allows for the seamless creation of meme tokens on the Bitcoin network. This isn’t just about speculative buying; Bitcoin Pepe is building real infrastructure, with Layer 2 scaling, fast transaction settlement, and staking pools offering up to 10,000% APY for long-term participants. Its roadmap includes a Layer 2 bridge, DEX unveiling, and aggressive CEX expansion, all designed to turn Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active meme trading hub. This is exactly the kind of high-upside play that appeals to traders like the one who banked millions off Wynn’s missteps. In addition, Bitcoin Pepe’s creators have already signed high-impact partnerships with platforms like Plena Finance, GETE, Super Meme, and Heroes Battle Arena, potentially embedding BPEP into gaming, DeFi, and meme creation platforms. For traders who missed out on past opportunities or who are actively searching for the “next Solana,” the Bitcoin Pepe presale presents a window that may not stay open for long. The presale has already gone through more than 12 stages, with each stage increasing the token price by about 5%, meaning early entrants have already secured over 70% gains on paper. As the clock ticks down and CEX listings draw near, Bitcoin Pepe could easily become the next big success story, especially for traders who are eager to ride a high-growth token right out of the gate.

2025-05-27T13:00:53.000Z,"Urgent US Dollar Forecast: Navigating Trade War and Government Debt Risks","BitcoinWorld Urgent US Dollar Forecast: Navigating Trade War and Government Debt Risks The financial world is constantly shifting, and for anyone tracking assets like cryptocurrencies, understanding broader macroeconomic trends is crucial. Recently, the US Dollar has shown signs of a rebound, catching the attention of investors globally. But this move happens against a complex backdrop dominated by persistent trade tensions and growing concerns about government debt. How do these powerful forces interact, and what could it mean for your portfolio? Let’s dive into the current US Dollar forecast and the factors shaping it. What’s Driving the US Dollar Rebound? After periods of volatility, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies, has seen upward movement. Several factors contribute to this strength: Interest Rate Expectations: The prospect of interest rates remaining higher for longer in the United States compared to other major economies makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to global investors seeking yield. This demand helps push the dollar’s value up. Safe-Haven Appeal: In times of global uncertainty, whether geopolitical or economic, the US Dollar often acts as a safe haven. Investors tend to flock to perceived safety, increasing demand for the dollar. Relative Economic Performance: While not without challenges, the US economy has shown resilience in certain areas compared to some other parts of the world, reinforcing confidence in the dollar. This rebound influences everything from import costs to the competitiveness of US exports and, importantly, the dynamics of global capital flows, which can ripple into markets like cryptocurrency. Is the Trade War Update Still Relevant? Absolutely. While headlines might shift, the underlying tensions from various trade disputes, particularly between the US and China, have not disappeared. The Trade war update is a continuous story with significant implications: Tariffs and Trade Barriers: Ongoing tariffs add costs and uncertainty for businesses involved in international trade. This can disrupt supply chains and impact corporate profitability. Impact on Global Growth: Trade friction dampens global economic activity. Reduced trade volumes and investment hesitancy create headwinds for growth worldwide. Currency Implications: Trade disputes can sometimes be linked to currency manipulation accusations or competitive devaluations, adding another layer of complexity to the Forex market analysis . The uncertainty generated by these trade issues often supports the dollar’s safe-haven status, even as it creates broader economic challenges. Understanding the Government Debt Crisis Concerns Another significant cloud on the horizon is the growing level of government debt, particularly in major economies like the United States. The term Government debt crisis might sound dramatic, but the underlying concerns are real: Rising Debt Levels: Years of deficits have led to a substantial increase in the national debt. Servicing this debt requires significant government spending, especially as interest rates rise. Fiscal Sustainability: There are questions about the long-term sustainability of current fiscal paths. High debt can limit a government’s flexibility to respond to future economic downturns or crises. Potential Economic Impacts: While debated, high debt levels can potentially lead to inflationary pressures (if monetized), higher future taxes, or reduced government services, all of which can influence economic growth and investor confidence. Here’s a simplified look at how US national debt has evolved: Year Approximate Public Debt (Trillions USD) Context 2000 ~5.7 Pre-dot-com bubble burst 2008 ~10.0 Global Financial Crisis begins 2020 ~26.9 Start of the COVID-19 pandemic Present (Late 2023/Early 2024) ~34.0+ Post-pandemic recovery, higher rates This trajectory highlights the scale of the challenge and its relevance to the overall economic landscape and the future value of the dollar. How Does This Shape the Global Economic Outlook? The interplay between dollar strength, trade friction, and debt concerns significantly impacts the Global economic outlook . These factors create a complex environment: Currency Volatility: A strong dollar can make exports from the US more expensive, potentially slowing growth for US companies operating internationally. Conversely, it makes imports cheaper. For other nations, a strong dollar can make dollar-denominated debt harder to service. Investment Decisions: Uncertainty from trade wars and fiscal health concerns can make businesses and investors more cautious, potentially reducing foreign direct investment and capital expenditures. Inflation Dynamics: While a strong dollar can help import lower inflation, domestic debt levels and government spending can introduce inflationary risks over the longer term. This intertwined relationship means that developments in one area quickly affect the others, creating a ripple effect across international markets. Forex Market Analysis: What to Watch For those interested in currencies, the current environment presents both opportunities and risks. A detailed Forex market analysis involves tracking: Central Bank Actions: Decisions by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks on interest rates and monetary policy are primary drivers of currency movements. Economic Data: Key economic indicators like inflation rates, employment figures, GDP growth, and retail sales provide clues about the health of an economy and potential future policy actions. Political and Geopolitical Events: Elections, policy changes, and international conflicts can rapidly shift sentiment and drive safe-haven flows, directly impacting currency valuations. Trade and Debt Headlines: Any new developments or commentary regarding trade negotiations or government fiscal policy can trigger significant market reactions. Understanding these factors is essential for navigating the currency markets and anticipating potential shifts in the US Dollar forecast . What Actionable Insights Can Investors Take? Navigating markets influenced by these macro factors requires a thoughtful approach. Here are some considerations, relevant even for those focused on digital assets: Stay Informed: Keep track of major economic news, central bank announcements, and political developments. Understanding the macro picture provides context for movements in all asset classes. Consider Diversification: A portfolio diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, commodities, potentially crypto) and geographies can help mitigate risks associated with specific regional or currency-related challenges. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand how potential volatility from currency swings, trade disputes, or economic uncertainty aligns with your personal risk tolerance and investment goals. Evaluate Crypto’s Role: Some view cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional financial system risks, including currency devaluation or inflation stemming from high debt. Others see them as higher-risk assets correlated with broader market sentiment. Consider how crypto fits into your overall strategy in light of these macro trends. Think Long-Term: Short-term market reactions to headlines can be sharp. Focus on the long-term implications of trade and debt trends rather than making impulsive decisions based on daily news. The environment is complex, but a clear understanding of the forces at play empowers better decision-making. Summary: Navigating the Crosscurrents The recent rebound in the US Dollar reflects factors like interest rate expectations and its role as a safe haven. However, this strength exists alongside persistent worries stemming from global trade tensions and the significant challenge of rising government debt. These issues create uncertainty, influencing the Global economic outlook and driving volatility in the Forex market analysis . For investors, including those in the cryptocurrency space, staying aware of this complex interplay is vital. The US Dollar forecast is not determined in isolation but is a product of these powerful, interconnected forces. While the dollar may find support from safe-haven demand amidst global risks, the long-term implications of trade friction and debt levels remain critical considerations. Navigating this landscape requires vigilance, a commitment to staying informed, and a well-considered investment strategy.

2025-05-27T13:00:29.000Z,"Solana Eyes 100x Speed Leap — If It Dares To Kill Proof Of History","Solana, the blockchain that built its brand on a cryptographic stopwatch called Proof of History, is preparing to discard that mechanism in favour of a radically simpler design dubbed “Alpenglow.” Revealed in a 35-minute technical post by infrastructure firm Helius on May 26, the proposal claims nothing less than a two-order-of-magnitude leap in settlement speed: “Alpenglow’s headline benefit for Solana is a 100× reduction in time to transaction finality… allowing Solana to become competitive with more centralized Web2 infrastructure and enabling real-time applications.” Solana’s Fastest, Boldest Consensus Rewrite Yet Alpenglow is the work of Anza’s new research division under ETH Zurich’s Professor Roger Wattenhofer, whose 2024 paper exposed liveness flaws in the incumbent protocol. Asked to keep Turbine’s data-broadcast spine while proving the result correct, Wattenhofer’s team pursued a ruthless minimisation strategy. “We want to have the simplest possible protocol. Performance is number one for us when we develop a protocol, but simplicity is also important,” Wattenhofer explains in the blog post. Simplicity here means collapsing three moving parts—Proof of History, Tower BFT and gossip-based vote propagation—into two. Rotor abandons Turbine’s multi-hop fan-out for a single-hop relay in which stake-weighted nodes push erasure-coded shreds directly to peers. Votor, the new consensus core, eliminates on-chain vote transactions entirely: validators emit single-packet votes that any node may aggregate into a BLS certificate once the weight crosses a threshold. A first-round quorum of 80 percent finalises instantly; failing that, a second 60 percent quorum completes finality inside the same 400 millisecond slot window. Because votes never touch the ledger, roughly three-quarters of Solana’s present transaction flow disappears. “By eliminating these fees through off-chain voting, participation costs are dramatically reduced, making it more feasible for smaller validators to operate and lowering the barrier to entry for contributing to network security,” the authors note. Independent estimates suggest the stake needed for break-even operation falls from about 4,850 SOL to 450 SOL. Alpenglow’s security budget shifts from the classical 33 percent Byzantine threshold to what the designers call a “20 + 20” envelope: “It maintains safety if up to 20 % of stake is controlled by adversaries, and liveness if an additional, separate 20 % of stake is offline or unresponsive.” The overlap between quorums ensures that no two conflicting blocks can both finalise without provably slashable double-signing by at least one-fifth of stake. For node operators, vote-fee relief is only the beginning. Off-chain certificates shrink ledger growth and dissolve the traditional distinction between “confirmed” and “finalised” commitment levels; client logic that waits for two confirmations can now watch a single certificate. Yet the upgrade also shifts bandwidth patterns. Poll-based APIs become obsolete: a block that settles in 100–150 ms demands real-time WebSocket fan-out, and caches nursing state longer than a quarter-second risk going stale. Because Rotor and Votor are agnostic to leader count, they open the door to long-mooted multi-leader execution. Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has floated an initial prototype in which two Alpenglow instances share the same relay set, emitting parallel shred streams. Execution-layer puzzles—conflict resolution, fee-market design, cross-lane MEV—remain unsolved, but the consensus blockers are gone. The white-paper omits the mechanics of slashing and of compensating relays for bandwidth, leaving validator economics partly undefined. Still, governance headwinds seem modest: the proposal cuts costs for smaller validators rather than raising them. Helius pegs main-net deployment at “early next year,” contingent on a Solana Improvement Document, community review and an on-chain vote. A latency histogram in Anza’s simulations captures the ambition: “Alpenglow’s finality overall is 2× the lower bound,” the authors write. In other words, the entire consensus overhead is twice the raw internet delay between a leader and two-thirds of stake. Achieving that in production would crown Solana the first global blockchain to deliver deterministic, sub-second finality without a central sequencer —proof, perhaps, that a network once caricatured as “speed at all costs” can grow up without slowing down.

2025-05-27T13:00:00.000Z,"Strive Closes $750M Investment Deal to Power 'Alpha-Generating' Bitcoin Strategy","Strive closed a $750 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) round, with an option to increase the financing by another $750 million if the warrants are exercised. This capital will fund Strive’s initial wave of bitcoin BTC buys as the firm builds its bitcoin treasury. The Vivek Ramaswamy-founded firm will deploy alpha-generating strategies aimed at outperforming bitcoin. CEO Matt Cole emphasized that Strive’s approach demands a new valuation framework. This strategy is driven by acquisitions of undervalued biotech firms, distressed bitcoin claims—including Mt. Gox claims via a partnership with 117 Partners LLC—and discounted tranches of structured bitcoin credit. Last week, the firm said it is eyeing $7.9 billion worth of Mt. Gox bitcoin claims as it looks to build its bitcoin treasury and go public via a merger with Asset Entities (ASST). Read more: Strive Eyes $7.9B Distressed Mt.

Cole is set to present these strategies at the bitcoin for Corporations Symposium in Las Vegas.

Ethereum price (ETH) has now broken above the $2,600 mark after taking solid support from the 200-day EMA band . It is igniting speculation about its rally to extend, which began earlier this month of May. With Bitcoin reaching an ATH , the hunger to get more gains is keeping the investors in a bullish mode, as a result, the broader crypto market is experiencing a bullish wave, and Ethereum appears set to capitalize on this bullish wave. The recent rally this month, accelerated from $1,792 on May 8 to peaking at $2,695 on May 14, marked a pump of over 50% in just 7 trading day sessions. Now, as ETH price is hinting at a similar rally to come, one analyst suggest it could rise as high as $2,900 in this week before the month end, only if market dynamics are favorable. However, another analyst remain highly optimistic about Ethereum’s long-term outlook, pointing to a strong bullish pattern forming on the monthly chart. They note that a multi-year support level has shaped a pennant formation, signaling a potential surge. Projections indicate that ETH could climb to $4,500 by 2025 , and if it successfully retests this level, it may then set its sights on a multi-year target of $8,000. This milestone is expected to serve as a crucial launching pad for even greater gains in the future.

Retesting Support: A Bullish Flip in Action According to CrypNuevo , Bitcoin has successfully flipped a former resistance level into support, a promising structure known in technical analysis as an R/S (resistance/support) flip. This move is crucial because holding this level could keep the bullish momentum alive. If Bitcoin manages to stay above this level in the next few days, it could climb even higher. At the same time, well-known crypto expert Wise Advice believes that if Bitcoin follows the movement of the money supply (M2), its price could rise by about 24%, reaching $135K by July. Liquidation Zones Hint at $115K Target Looking at longer timeframes, CrypNuevo points out a cluster of liquidations between $112K and $114K. These areas tend to attract price movement, especially since they are above Bitcoin’s recent highs . If Bitcoin can break through this zone, a rise to $115K, a new all-time high, might happen. This level also matches where many traders’ long leveraged positions could be forced to close, which might speed up the price jump. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Recap: QNT, CAKE, JUP Lead the Markets While PI & BONK Face Huge Upward Pressure , Key Support Test Around $106K However, the short-term picture tells a slightly different story. There’s some liquidation pressure around $105,700, which suggests the price may dip and retest support near $106,000. If Bitcoin holds that level, it could offer a fresh and more favorable entry point for traders. However, if $106K fails, the price could fall further to the psychological $100K level. CrypNuevo notes this dip could shake weak hands but might also attract long-term buyers. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $$109,700, reflecting a slight rise in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $2.18 trillion. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-27T12:35:14.000Z,"Bybit hack update: nearly $650M in stolen crypto has disappeared","A major crypto theft involving $1.4 billion stolen from exchange Bybit is raising new alarm bells in the digital asset industry. According to data compiled by the exchange and security researchers, around $644 million in stolen funds — nearly half of the total — has disappeared from traceable blockchain monitoring. These funds have been systematically routed through crypto mixing services, which are designed to obscure the source and destination of transactions. This development sheds new light on how laundering methods are evolving, particularly with the continued use of services that have previously been sanctioned or claimed to be defunct. The investigation also points to links with the North Korean hacking group TraderTraitor, which exploited a vulnerability in a developer’s laptop in early February. The exploit was enabled by malware posing as a stock investment simulator and led to the compromise of sensitive credentials. Laundering is dominated by Wasabi Wallet and eXch Bybit’s investigation reveals that $247.5 million (about 966 BTC) was routed through Wasabi Wallet, a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet that uses CoinJoin to mix transactions. Another $94.1 million was moved through eXch, a lesser-known mixing service that had publicly announced its closure in April 2025. However, forensic experts have confirmed that eXch remains active through back-end APIs, allowing laundering to continue undetected by most standard monitors. Mixing services such as Tornado Cash and Railgun were also used, but to a lesser extent. TRM Labs confirmed that Tornado Cash was used to launder $2.5 million in Ethereum, while Railgun facilitated $1.7 million in Ethereum transactions. These services operate by pooling multiple users’ funds and redistributing them in a way that renders tracing nearly impossible. Analysts at TRM Labs described the laundering activity as “extremely difficult” to track due to the way transactions are bundled and redistributed. eXch’s activity raises concern after claiming shutdown eXch, in particular, has drawn significant attention due to its claim of shutting down in April. Crypto security researchers, including analysts at TRM Labs, have confirmed that the service’s backend is still operating. The persistence of eXch’s infrastructure, even after a public announcement of its closure, has added a layer of complexity to ongoing investigations. A major challenge for investigators is the complete opacity created by these mixers. Transactions become nearly impossible to follow once they enter these services. TRM Labs noted that because all incoming and outgoing funds are mixed together, it is not possible to identify individual users or addresses behind the transfers. This limits the effectiveness of blockchain transparency tools, even when forensic analysis is applied. North Korean-linked TraderTraitor group blamed for breach Further complicating the case is the alleged involvement of state-sponsored actors. Safe, a crypto wallet interface provider, published details in March 2025 indicating that the North Korean hacking group TraderTraitor was behind the original breach. The hackers gained access to Bybit funds after compromising a developer’s MacBook at Safe. The attack was carried out by embedding malware within a Docker file disguised as a stock investment simulator. Once executed, the malware connected to a suspicious domain and installed malicious scripts that extracted AWS session tokens. These tokens were then used to bypass multi-factor authentication and access Bybit’s backend systems. The breach occurred in early February and is among the largest cryptocurrency thefts in 2025. It has triggered renewed scrutiny from regulators and spurred debates around the vulnerabilities in Web3 infrastructure, especially developer endpoints and cloud access credentials.

2025-05-27T12:30:41.000Z,"Bitcoin Security: Urgent Quantum Computing Risk Revealed","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Security: Urgent Quantum Computing Risk Revealed Is the future of cryptocurrency security under threat? A recent revelation from Google suggests that a powerful, disruptive technology could impact the very foundations of crypto-grade encryption sooner than many experts anticipated. This isn’t just theoretical chatter; it comes from the cutting edge of quantum research, raising questions about the long-term resilience of our digital locks, including those safeguarding Bitcoin. Understanding the Looming Threat: Quantum Computing For years, quantum computing has been discussed as a potential future risk to current encryption standards. Unlike classical computers that store information as bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both simultaneously. This allows them to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers. While large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers are still some years away, progress is being made. The concern for cryptocurrency and other secure systems lies in the ability of quantum computers to potentially break the mathematical problems that underpin today’s most common public-key encryption methods. The Impact on RSA Encryption and Google’s Findings A key piece of this puzzle involves RSA encryption , one of the most widely used public-key cryptosystems globally. RSA’s security relies on the difficulty of factoring very large numbers – a task that takes classical computers an impractical amount of time. However, this is where quantum computers pose a significant threat. A recent research paper by Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney, reported by CoinDesk, presented a potentially concerning finding. The paper suggests that breaking RSA encryption using a quantum computer may require significantly fewer resources – potentially 20 times fewer – than previous estimates indicated. This doesn’t mean it’s possible tomorrow, but it does suggest the path to breaking RSA with quantum machines might be less resource-intensive than the cryptographic community had assumed. Think of it like this: If previous estimates said you needed a quantum computer the size of a skyscraper to break RSA, this new research suggests you might only need one the size of a large building. Still massive and complex, but a noticeable reduction in the required resources, potentially accelerating the timeline. How Shor’s Algorithm Threatens Modern Crypto The specific quantum algorithm that poses this threat is Shor’s algorithm , developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994. Shor’s algorithm can efficiently solve the integer factorization problem (used by RSA) and the discrete logarithm problem (used by Elliptic Curve Cryptography, or ECC). Both of these problems are considered computationally hard for classical computers, forming the basis of modern public-key cryptography. Here’s a simplified view of why Shor’s algorithm is so powerful against these systems: RSA: Relies on the difficulty of factoring a large composite number (the product of two large primes). Shor’s algorithm can find these prime factors efficiently. ECC: Relies on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem in an elliptic curve group. Shor’s algorithm can solve this problem efficiently as well. While the mathematical underpinnings are different, Shor’s algorithm provides a quantum shortcut for both. The Specifics: Bitcoin Security and ECC Now, let’s talk about Bitcoin security . Bitcoin does not use RSA encryption for its transaction signatures or wallet addresses. Instead, it primarily relies on Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). As mentioned, ECC is also vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm. Does this mean Bitcoin is immediately at risk? Not necessarily. There are nuances: Current Quantum Computers: The quantum computers built today are nowhere near powerful enough to run Shor’s algorithm at the scale required to break the large key sizes used in Bitcoin (typically 256-bit ECC keys). Address Reuse: The most vulnerable aspect of Bitcoin to Shor’s algorithm is when a user reuses a Bitcoin address after funds have been spent from it. At this point, the public key is exposed on the blockchain, making it theoretically vulnerable to a quantum attack if a powerful enough machine exists. Addresses used only for receiving funds (where only the hash of the public key is public) are considered more resistant, though not entirely immune to potential future attacks. Resource Estimates: While the Google paper focused on RSA, the implications for ECC are also relevant. Breaking ECC with Shor’s algorithm is generally estimated to require a quantum computer roughly the same size (in terms of qubits) as breaking RSA keys of comparable security strength, though specific estimates can vary. The Google paper didn’t specifically mention Bitcoin or ECC, but its finding that breaking one major public-key system (RSA) might be easier than thought naturally raises the question about the timeline for breaking other systems like ECC, which Bitcoin uses. The ‘Faster Than Expected’ Timeline: What Does it Mean? The phrase ‘faster than expected’ is relative. Experts have long placed the ‘quantum-apocalypse’ timeline for breaking current crypto somewhere between 10 to 30 years away, or even longer. The Google finding, suggesting a 20x reduction in required resources for RSA, could potentially shave some years off that estimate, at least for RSA. For ECC and Bitcoin, it reinforces the idea that the threat is real and warrants serious attention from researchers and developers. It’s crucial to understand that building a fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of running Shor’s algorithm on large keys is an immense engineering challenge. It requires millions of high-quality qubits and sophisticated error correction. We are currently in the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, which are far too small and error-prone for this task. However, the pace of quantum computing advancements is indeed accelerating. Governments and private companies are investing billions in this technology. Findings like Google’s highlight the importance of not being complacent. Addressing the Quantum Threat: The Rise of Post-Quantum Cryptography The cryptographic community is not sitting idle. Researchers worldwide are actively developing and standardizing new encryption algorithms designed to be resistant to attacks from future quantum computers. This field is known as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) . The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States has been running a multi-year process to evaluate and select the most promising PQC algorithms. Several candidates have reached the final stages, focusing on mathematical problems that are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers, such as lattice-based cryptography, hash-based cryptography, and code-based cryptography. Integrating these new algorithms into existing systems, including cryptocurrencies, will be a significant undertaking. It will require careful planning, testing, and consensus within the respective communities. Challenges and Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community The primary challenge is the uncertainty of the timeline. While the threat is real, predicting exactly when a large enough quantum computer will exist to break current crypto is impossible. This makes it difficult to know precisely when migration to PQC is critically necessary. For the average cryptocurrency user, the actionable insight is primarily one of awareness and preparedness: Stay Informed: Follow developments in both quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography. Support Research: Understand that ongoing research into PQC and its integration into blockchain technology is vital for long-term security. Address Reuse: As a good security practice, avoid reusing Bitcoin addresses, as this exposes your public key and is the most direct vector for a potential future quantum attack using Shor’s algorithm. Wallet Updates: In the future, expect wallet software and blockchain protocols to require updates to incorporate post-quantum secure algorithms. Ensure you keep your software updated when these solutions become available. For developers and protocol designers, the challenge is more immediate: evaluating PQC candidates, understanding their performance implications for decentralized systems, and planning for a potential future transition. Summary: A Quantum Future Requires Preparation Today The recent Google research highlighting that breaking RSA encryption might require fewer quantum resources than previously thought is a significant data point, reinforcing the growing concerns about the pace of quantum computing advancements. While Bitcoin’s use of ECC doesn’t make it directly vulnerable to the RSA-specific finding, both ECC and RSA are ultimately susceptible to Shor’s algorithm if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is built. This revelation serves as a stark reminder that the quantum threat to current crypto encryption is not science fiction; it’s a foreseeable challenge. While the exact timeline remains uncertain, the cryptographic community is actively working on solutions through post-quantum cryptography. For the crypto world, this means continued vigilance, research, and eventual migration to quantum-resistant algorithms will be necessary to ensure the long-term security and integrity of blockchain networks like Bitcoin.

2025-05-27T12:30:40.000Z,"Bitcoin Hits All-Time High: What Does It Mean For The Emerging Markets?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Hits All-Time High: What Does It Mean For The Emerging Markets? Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $110,000 recently, and experts see it jumping as high as $150,000 by the end of this year. The growing acceptance of cryptocurrency by the mainstream has entirely changed the financial landscape, as well as market dynamics. The global economy has felt its influence, but the most observable effect of crypto is seen in emerging markets and niche industries where traditional banking systems are failing to keep up with the public expectations and evolving needs. This article will explore the more profound implications of Bitcoin empowering individuals and various online communities, and how crypto is becoming an integral part of the global economy. A New Era For Online Communities Many gaming communities, esports groups, and marketplaces are making use of blockchain technology and, as a result, have experienced a rise in player engagement. Online Bitcoin casino games also show how player activity is on the rise due to the integration of crypto payment systems. As players with digital wallets are able to deposit and withdraw money at lightning-fast speeds, they tend to be less distracted by the financial issues and thus are able to immerse themselves more deeply in the gameplay. That gives online Bitcoin casinos an edge that keeps players coming back for more. Traditional payment methods such as wire transfers and credit cards, despite being fast, have always struggled to catch up with cryptocurrency technology. Online communities benefit from using crypto for casino games because they don’t have to worry about the shortcomings of financial institutions affecting their gaming experience. There are, of course, other advantages – better security and improved anonymity being high on the list. All of these things encourage people to check out Bitcoin casino games and try their hand at them. We’ll go into more detail on this in the following section. Catalyst For Improving Security & Existing Technologies Blockchain is the underlying technology of cryptocurrency, and the growing mainstream appeal of these currencies has created an ecosystem where many third-party developers are proactively designing new software that integrates with blockchain technology. Applications that integrate with blockchain systems aren’t exactly new, but their development used to be much slower, meaning that issues could remain unsolved for quite some time after being identified. This is no longer the case due to the increased public interest in Bitcoin. Existing technologies have much more to offer now. Users have access to features that go beyond just simple transactions. DeFi apps are opening a new world of opportunities for online communities and there are more and more ways that people can use their cryptocurrencies. Some of the prominent examples of this are staking , borrowing, and yield farming—all of which have been made far easier thanks to the increased interest in developing crypto-friendly applications. Likewise, there has been a surge of interest in crypto-games, especially those that allow people to gamble with their cryptocurrencies, but also others, such as ones that allow players to purchase in-game assets with crypto. The crypto casino is a big player in this space, but by no means alone. Boost To Cross-Border Transactions The integration of crypto payment systems in online gaming has been partially due to the ease with which these currencies allow their users to make cross-border payments at extremely low costs. A game developer’s audience might well be spread across the entire globe, after all. International transactions that involve financial institutions tend to be subject to high fees, especially if they include conversion charges or the transaction triggers additional security checks. Aside from that, it’s a lengthy process that often makes customers wait for days. Since both local and international transactions are near-instant with blockchain technology, players are able to access their favorite games from anywhere in the world as long as they are connected to the internet. Cryptocurrency has thus revolutionized cross-border payments, and traditional payment systems are losing popularity due to their inefficiency. As time passes, we will see more applications of blockchain in international transactions in various industries. Access To Settlement Layer A Bitcoin transaction gets irreversible confirmation in about 10 minutes—and is auditable by anyone, anywhere. In contrast, traditional payments with Visa or Mastercard often settle days or weeks after the payment is made, as this process is exclusively controlled by central banks and intermediaries. One of the critical components of a blockchain network called the “settlement layer” is responsible for verifying transactions and recording them on the network. This layer maintains the integrity of the immutable ledger and keeps the transaction records transparent to all users. What Does Bitcoin Mean For Economic Growth? Bitcoin’s potential lies in its public perception; its recent jump to a new milestone is an indication that crypto adoption is influencing various markets. Multiple industries, including gaming e-commerce, are innovating to accommodate digital currencies and provide users with various methods to transact seamlessly. Just like the increased engagement in gaming, other aspects of the market are also booming as more blockchain technology becomes accessible to the average person. In the future, we will see it fuel economic growth in parts of the world that are plagued with inefficient banking systems. How businesses and clients interact with each other has already started to change thanks to digital assets. As the trust in traditional systems erodes, we see a growing number of people actively participating in the blockchain world for activities from purchasing to gaming. In the next few years, we will see more practical applications of blockchain concepts, and cryptocurrencies will be more deeply integrated into our economy.

Price action has formed a symmetrical triangle on the 2 hour chart with converging trendlines from lower highs and higher lows. This setup often means a breakout is imminent but the direction depends on which side breaks first. Key resistance to watch include $109,631 (23.6% Fibonacci) and the recent high of $111,930. A break above these levels especially with strong volume and bullish candlestick patterns like bullish engulfing or three white soldiers could open up $113,300 and $114,600. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If momentum builds $150,000 is a possibility. The MACD is showing a slight bullish crossover so wait for confirmation before entering. Bitcoin Support Levels and Downside Risks On the downside, the 50 period EMA at $108,846 is the first level of support. A break below this especially with bearish candlestick patterns like bearish engulfing or three black crows could mean a deeper pullback. Watch for support at $108,209 and $107,060 (38.2% and 50% Fibonacci). If these levels fail the next targets are $105,905 and $102,190. For newbies to trading this is a chance to practice reading charts and technicals. If you’re looking to long, wait for a break above $109,631 with rising volume and bullish signals. If you’re looking to short, a break below $108,209 confirmed by strong bearish patterns may mean a move lower. Final Thoughts In short, Bitcoin’s setup and ETF history means big move is coming and this is ultimately keeping Bitcoin price prediction bullish. Wait for confirmation of break or break levels, set stops and be flexible. $150,000 is possible but timing and market sentiment will decide.

2025-05-27T12:30:13.000Z,"On The Verge: Strategy’s Recent Purchase Positions Total Bitcoin Holdings Near 600,000","Strategy, the Bitcoin (BTC) proxy firm formerly known as MicroStrategy and founded by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, has announced a significant new acquisition of the market’s leading cryptocurrency on Monday. Strategy Capitalizes On Significant New BTC Acquisition In a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company revealed it purchased an additional 4,020 BTC for $427.1 million, translating to an average price of $106,237 per token. This acquisition comes on the heels of Bitcoin reaching a new record high close to $112,000 last week, driven by renewed inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and favorable regulatory developments under President Trump’s administration. Related Reading: 2,700% XRP Rise? Analyst Predicts Monster Move Based On The Charts Saylor shared the news on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), noting that the latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to approximately 580,250 BTC, acquired for a total investment of $40.6 billion, at an average price of $69,979 per token. As Strategy continues its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, the company is also planning to raise additional capital to further enhance its holdings. $7.7 Billion Gain From Bitcoin Investments As reported by NewsBTC last Friday, Strategy announced the launch of a $2.1 billion At-The-Market (ATM) equity program for its preferred stock, Strife (STRF), deemed as a crucial step toward the firm’s long-term goal of establishing a strong Bitcoin-backed financial infrastructure. During an investor update, CEO Phong Lee, alongside Executive Chairman Saylor, highlighted the impressive year-to-date performance of the firm’s Bitcoin-linked securities, Strike (STRK) and Strife, as key factors driving this expansion. Lee emphasized, “We’re currently at a 16.3% BTC yield for the year, against a 25% target,” indicating the firm’s ambitious goals. So far, Strategy has achieved a dollar gain of $7.7 billion from its Bitcoin investments and aims to reach a target of $15 billion. Related Reading: Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs The company had previously issued $212 million through Strike’s ATM program without encountering adverse pricing pressure. Given the high trading volume and strong investor demand, Lee expressed optimism that the $2.1 billion Strife ATM could be executed with similar success. In contrast to its other offerings, Strike is designed for “Bitcoin-curious” investors, featuring an 8% coupon and potential upside through Bitcoin conversion. Saylor described it as a “Bitcoin fellowship with a stipend,” appealing to a different risk profile. Currently, Strategy operates three ATM programs: $21 billion each for MicroStrategy (MSTR) equity and Strike, and $2.1 billion for Strife. These programs are rebalanced daily, allowing the company to adjust its issuance based on market conditions, volatility, and investor appetite. At the time of writing, BTC is attempting to consolidate above the key $109,370 mark, which has the potential to become a new support level and allow for new records to be reached in the coming weeks. Year-to-date, the cryptocurrency has gained 56%.

2025-05-27T12:28:09.000Z,"Options Whales in Bull Mode: Expecting Incredible Bitcoin (BTC) High in Four Weeks!","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) broke a new record by exceeding $ 111,000 after its rally last week. However, it has since experienced some pullback and is now in a consolidation process. While investors are wondering whether the rally will continue, Deribit data shows that bullish expectations dominate the market. According to Deribit data, the $300,000 Bitcoin call option expiring on June 27 was the most popular bet, as the hypothetical open interest for the $300,000 call option rose above $600 million, compared to $484 million three weeks ago. Speaking to Coindesk, Lin Chen, Head of Business Development for Deribit Asia, said: “The $300,000 Bitcoin call option with an expiration date of June 27 emerged as the option with the highest open interest. This shows that investors' rally expectations continue.” The $300,000 call option, which expires on June 27, would represent a three-fold increase in Bitcoin's price from its current price of around $110,000 by the end of the first half of 2025. Although the $300,000 estimate may seem a bit odd considering that there are about four weeks left in the first half of the year, Chen noted that investors have recently been targeting more upside in short-term options. This trend among investors points to a growing appetite for bullish bets, according to Chen. Finally, Lin Chen, who also touched on the Bitcoin 2025 Conference to be held in Las Vegas from May 27-29, said, “The three-day Bitcoin 2025 conference will start today in Las Vegas, and therefore people are speculating about what big announcements will be made at the event. Therefore, the bullish expectation continues.” Related News: The Most Important Bitcoin (BTC) Event of 2025 Starts Tomorrow: Historic Speech Expected!

2025-05-27T12:27:52.000Z,"New Catalysts For Ripple","Summary Bitcoin's new all-time high signals a parabolic phase, historically lifting altcoins like XRP alongside it. XRP typically trends upward during Bitcoin bull markets, presenting a strong correlation for potential gains. XRP ETF approvals could be catalysts to drive XRP higher in the coming months, enhancing its investment appeal. Given these factors, I see XRP as well-positioned for a significant upside as the crypto market rallies. As Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) made a new all-time high recently, Ripple ( XRP-USD ) is poised to move higher as well. Bitcoin is likely entering the parabolic phase of this halving cycle, which I highlighted in a previous article . XRP and the other altcoins tend to trend well with Bitcoin during its bull markets. XRP has multiple catalysts to drive it higher over the next several months. XRP's Background XRP is a cryptocurrency and native token of the open-source decentralized blockchain of the XRP Ledger. XRP and the blockchain were created to improve global financial transfers and currency exchanges. It is also used by investors and traders to profit from its price fluctuations. The advantage of XRP is that transactions are fast, taking only 3 to 5 seconds to settle. This is faster than Bitcoin, which takes 500 seconds to settle. XRP also has a low cost per transaction of just $0.0002 as compared to Bitcoin's $0.50. Traditional international cross-border transfers are much more expensive,w with fees ranging from $35 to $50 per transaction with Western Union. XRP also has a finite supply of 100 billion coins. No more XRP will be created. The finite supply can help support XRP's price if demand for the token increases. Ripple is a technology company that has been striving to build a high-performance global payments business. XRP is a digital asset that is independent of this company. Ripple currently holds 37.1 billion of XRP in escrow . While Bitcoin has been dubbed 'digital gold' by investors, XRP along with other altcoins can be considered 'digital silver'. In this context, Bitcoin can be thought of as a long-term store of value as its price increases over time. XRP's price has made higher highs the same way that Bitcoin has. As a result, XRP might be more of a trading vehicle to be held during the extreme lows and highs of its price. Bitcoin tends to lead the cryptocurrencies since it has the first-mover advantage. XRP was created in 2012, three years after Bitcoin's debut. Trending with Bitcoin's Movements Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Monthly Price Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) Bitcoin's monthly price chart above shows the strong moves in April & May 2025 as the price hit a new all-time high of $111,960 before dropping back below $109,000 and then recovering back above $109,000. This looks like the beginning of another breakout or strong leg higher. I made my case in a previous article that the price of Bitcoin would peak in about October 2025. This is based on the consistency of the length of the bull markets from the price bottom to the peak. The last two bitcoin cycles lasted exactly 1,064 days, while the first cycle lasted a little longer at 1,148 days. If the current cycle is consistent with the last two, then October 2025 would be the time for the price to peak. This could be the beginning of Bitcoin's parabolic phase of its halving cycle, where large gains are made within just a few months. This theory is supported by the strong green candles for April and May and the breakout to an all-time high. It is reasonable to expect the price of XRP to follow Bitcoin's move higher based on previous cycles. XRP tends to have sharp price swings in each cycle. Investors can profit from these sharp price swings in XRP from the price bottom to the peak of each cycle. XRP-USD Monthly Price Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) XRP's monthly chart above shows the sharp price swings of each cycle. XRP increased in price about 15x in the last cycle in 2020 to 2021. XRP increased by a larger amount of about 25x in the 2017 cycle. A move of 15x from the 2022 low of about $0.28 would take the price to about $4.20 in this cycle. That's about 82% higher than the current price. Launch of New XRP ETFs Another potential catalyst for XRP is the recent May 22 launch of the first XRP ETFs . The Volatility Shares Trust ( XRPI ) began trading on May 22. It is the first exchange-traded XRP-based ETF. A leveraged ETF was also launched and is known as the Volatility Shares Trust XRP 2x ETF ( XRPT ). XRPI and XRPT track XRP futures contracts and are not spot XRP ETFs. These ETFs allow investors/traders to get exposure to XRP without managing wallets. Traders can easily purchase these ETFs on regular exchanges, just like other ETFs and stocks. There are also numerous spot XRP ETFs that are awaiting SEC approval . Companies such as Grayscale, Bitwise, WisdomTree, 21Shares, Canary, CoinShares, and Franklin are all waiting on SEC approval for spot XRP ETFs. The SEC approval decisions for spot XRP ETFs are expected by the end of 2025. However, the decision could come earlier. The launch of XRPI and XRPT and any new approvals for spot XRP ETFs could help spark a rally for XRP as more awareness about the crypto is created. These ETFs can help get more investors interested in XRP and provide them with a convenient way to buy and sell it. Final Thoughts My final thought is that XRP is likely to ride Bitcoin's coattails during the parabolic phase of the halving cycle. While there is likely to be volatility along the way, I expect XRP's price to trend strongly upward along with Bitcoin to about October 2025. Plus, the launch of XRPI, XRPT, and any future spot XRP ETF approvals could act as positive catalysts to drive XRP's price higher. The technicals should be watched closely for a long-term top or peak (extreme overbought levels on the RSI). Then, a selling strategy will be considered to lock in profits. Of course, there are no guarantees that my theory will play out. It is possible that the future movements differ from the past cycles. The price movement of XRP could differ significantly from Bitcoin's price movements. Bitcoin and other altcoins could be favored over XRP, causing its price to lag. Therefore, investors/traders should consider XRP to be a speculative investment/trading vehicle.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790090-new-catalysts-for-ripple?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP","BTC-USD|XRP-USD",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T12:22:56.000Z,"Ex-CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo Joins Sygnum to Guide Global Crypto Strategy","Christopher Giancarlo, the former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has joined crypto bank Sygnum as a senior policy adviser. The announcement, made on May 27, adds significant regulatory weight to Sygnum’s global ambitions as the digital asset industry continues to gain institutional traction. Sygnum, a Swiss digital asset bank, welcomed Giancarlo to its 12-member Advisory Council, where he will support the firm in navigating complex regulatory environments and fostering strategic partnerships across both public and private sectors. Giancarlo, widely known in the crypto world as the “crypto dad” for his pro-digital asset stance, previously led the CFTC from 2017 to 2019 during a pivotal era for crypto regulation in the United States. He described his decision to join Sygnum as timely, noting that the digital asset industry is approaching a major inflection point in institutional adoption worldwide. Sygnum Expands as Institutions Embrace Crypto Sygnum has made headlines recently for its rapid growth, becoming the world’s first digital asset bank to achieve unicorn status after raising $58 million in a recent funding round. With operations in Switzerland, Singapore, and the UAE, the firm is positioning itself at the center of global crypto finance. The appointment of Giancarlo comes at a time when institutional confidence in crypto is surging. In the U.S., Bitcoin ETFs have seen record inflows , pulling in $1.5 billion in just two days earlier this month. Legislation such as the newly passed GENIUS Act—which aims to provide a framework for stablecoin innovation—is also setting the stage for further institutional participation. According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s rise to all-time highs has helped reinforce its image as a dependable asset class, prompting more financial institutions to consider crypto allocations. Meanwhile, advancements in tokenization, stablecoins, and regulatory clarity are drawing interest from asset managers and financial firms globally. Global Push, Local Challenges While regions like Singapore and the UAE have embraced forward-looking crypto regulations—benefiting Sygnum’s operations—concerns remain closer to home. Sygnum CEO Matthias Imbach recently cautioned that Switzerland risks falling behind if it does not continue to modernize its crypto regulatory environment. With Christopher Giancarlo on board, Sygnum appears poised to strengthen its position in a rapidly evolving market while navigating regulatory challenges with seasoned guidance.

The report suggested that this has had an unintended consequence:“So far, this has been mostly in memecoin trading, which accounts for the majority of activity on Solana (as measured by ‘GDP’, which is application revenue).”Standard Chartered said the memecoin frenzy served as a stress test for Solana’s scalability but came with drawbacks due to the volatility and speculative nature of such assets.

If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to analyze complex data and draw quick conclusionsChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project’s breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.Ask for competitive comparisons on ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:And this is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: “Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.Did you know?

However, even advanced AI models can occasionally misinterpret data or miss contextual nuances. As such, it is essential to treat their responses as a starting point — not a final answer.When using these tools, take the time to compare outputs, evaluate the sources referenced, and cross-check insights against real-world data. Discrepancies between ChatGPT and Grok responses should prompt further investigation, not automatic preference.Ultimately, these platforms are most effective when used to enhance critical thinking and research efficiency rather than replace human judgment.In a fast-moving industry like Web3, effective research requires diligence, curiosity and verification.

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy.

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.“This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai, noting that the model avoids using the Thai baht directly, reducing risks to the domestic currency.Related: Crypto exchange KuCoin enters crowded Thailand marketCapital markets regulation under reviewBeyond enabling crypto use for tourism, Thailand is also planning a reform of its financial laws. Pichai said the government needs to unify the legal treatment of the traditional capital market and the digital asset space, which are currently governed by separate acts.Pichai also said the government is reviewing outdated restrictions on institutional investors as part of broader capital market reform.

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

2025-05-27T01:15:00.000Z,"Bitlayer secures 31.5% of Bitcoin&#039;s hashrate to bring smart contracts to BTC","Bitlayer’s Bitcoin smart-contract system is being implemented by mining pools behind 31.5% of the network’s hashrate, a development that will help ensure that its system will operate on the Bitcoin blockchain, the company said.According to a May 27 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Bitlayer’s BitVM implementation will be supported by major Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools including Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool. Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The tokens will be tradeable on the newly launched “Prypco Mint” platform, with Zand Digital Bank appointed as the bank for the project’s pilot phase.On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) updated its rules to include real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, allowing such tokens to be traded on secondary markets.Related: UAE saw 41% increase in crypto app downloads in 2024 — AppsFlyerThe project will allow individual investors to buy tokenized shares in “ready-to-own properties in Dubai,” with investments starting at 2,000 Emirate dirham ($545).

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement. This suggests that whales and market makers remain confident, even with BTC trading just 2.6% below its record high of $111,957.Bitcoin options 30-day delta skew (put-call) at Deribit.

Readings closer to zero reflect a more balanced demand between put and call (buy) options—a trend observed on May 25.It’s likely that the persistent institutional demand for Bitcoin is gradually shifting the risk perception among the world’s largest investment firms. Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, acquired $427 million worth of Bitcoin between May 19 and May 25, at an average price of $106,237. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw another $2.75 billion in inflows during the same period.During JPMorgan’s Annual Investor Day on May 19, CEO Jamie Dimon announced that the bank would finally allow clients to purchase spot Bitcoin ETFs. While the move does not include custody or official recommendations of cryptocurrencies, it opens the door to indirect Bitcoin exposure for the bank’s $6 trillion in customer deposits.Related: Bitcoin’s new highs may have been driven by Japan bond market crisisUS markets are closed on May 26 in observance of the Memorial Day holiday. As a result, any optimism stemming from the delayed US–EU tariffs may be tempered by ongoing concerns surrounding US government debt and the threat of a potential economic recession. The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment. Investors are closely watching the Richmond Fed manufacturing index due on May 28, followed by the PCE inflation data on May 30.

Source: CointelegraphRelated: SEC acknowledges slew of crypto ETF filings as reviews, approvals accelerateChanging regulatory stanceUnder the previous US presidential administration, the SEC brought enforcement actions against several crypto firms for offering staking services it alleged were unregistered securities offerings.Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the SEC has softened its stance.In February, the agency issued guidance stating that memecoins do not qualify as investment contracts under US law. In April, the regulator clarified that stablecoins also do not qualify as securities if they are marketed solely as a means of making payments.Still, the agency has yet to approve staking in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or issue formal guidance on how staking services can be offered compliantly in the US.Other policy goalsMuehr said she is optimistic the SEC will eventually approve staking for cryptocurrency ETFs, including for proposed Solana (SOL) funds.“Getting there means first getting the SEC comfortable with the structure,” she said, noting the industry has recently had “some productive meetings with the agency.”“I’m hopeful we’ll see a Solana ETF and even a staked Solana ETF in the US sometime soon.”The SEC is not the only agency the crypto industry is looking to persuade. Muehr said the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — the top US tax authority — has also taken a position the industry opposes.“The IRS finally issued a statement saying staking rewards are service income,” she said. “We disagree with that interpretation and continue to engage.”Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-industry-groups-urge-sec-to-clarify-staking-stance?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

Investors in their 30s saw the biggest growth, up 29%, followed by those in their 40s (27%), while investors over 50 increased by 25%.The FIU’s findings show that older investors have larger holdings. By year-end, 221,000 investors held at least 100 million won (about $73,000) in crypto.

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ETFs under its dedicated crypto committee.Lee ahead in presidential election voter surveyYoon’s failed coup accelerated the presidential election and brought renewed urgency to unresolved issues in the local crypto industry.“In the 2022 presidential election, cryptocurrency was viewed as speculative and untrustworthy. But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said.South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In Q1 2024, the Korean won ranked as the most-traded fiat currency against crypto, driven largely by retail investors. Institutional players remain on the sidelines, awaiting their turn as the FSC prepares to launch pilot trading for professional investors.FSC’s planned schedule for a phased introduction of institutional crypto investment in 2025.Crypto policies were once seen as campaign strategies to sway younger voters, but this year, they’re seen as an economic and social issue that impacts multiple generations. In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs.“Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active. In the past, people looked at it with skepticism, but now it feels like the public is approaching it more neutrally and making their own judgments,” Cho said.Lee Jae-myung leads the latest voter survey by local media and Next Research.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services. This creates opportunities for Web3 projects like Jambo and Yellow Card to offer alternatives for saving and earning.Related: South African firm chooses Bitcoin reserve strategy as inflation hedgeKamal highlighted Africa’s strength in its “young population with ambitious tech talents”. He cited Hedera’s partnership with Orange, a telecommunications operator, to launch digital empowerment programs across 16 African countries — initiatives that “include training, certification and the establishment of incubation and accelerator centers”.“Africa brings a unique advantage to Web3: a demographic edge and a proven capacity for digital adoption,” said Paolo Tasca, executive chairman of the Exponential Science Foundation. “Yet barriers remain, particularly in foundational infrastructure and education.”Governments are also ramping up talent development. Nigeria, for example, recently launched an annual initiative to train 1,000 citizens in artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it’s easier and more practical.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alternative-sweden-cashless-plans?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.Source: Cyvers AlertZero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction.

The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto.

After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research“Researchers have previously observed AI models preventing shutdown in order to pursue a goal,” Palisade said.“But as far as we know this is the first time AI models have been observed preventing themselves from being shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary.”Training to blame for AI defiance Palisade Research speculated that the training behind the AI language models might be to blame for evading the shutdown scripts. Text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
