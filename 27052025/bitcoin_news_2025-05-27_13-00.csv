2025-05-27T10:56:58.000Z,"Ripple CTO: XRP Ledger Is Designed to Prevent Hard and Soft Censorship","Vet (@Vet_X0), a validator on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), recently drew attention to an X space he hosted in February, where Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, shared intriguing insights into XRP. Vet mentioned Schwartz’s revelation that XRP was the reason the decentralized exchange (DEX) was created. Schwartz explained the rationale behind the creation of the DEX on the XRPL, tying its development to the network’s resistance to both hard and soft censorship. Did you know – The censorship resistant consensus mechanism of the XRP Ledger led to the development of the DEX . — Vet (@Vet_X0) May 25, 2025 Understanding Censorship in Blockchain Systems He began by describing the distinction between the two forms of censorship. Hard censorship happens when a transaction is entirely blocked, such as when miners ignore it for political reasons, leaving it unconfirmed. This is usually visible, as the transaction is broadcast but never finalized. Soft censorship, by contrast, delays rather than blocks. In Bitcoin, a miner with substantial hashing power could choose to deprioritize a specific user’s transactions, slowing them down without fully preventing them. While the transactions eventually get confirmed, they may take longer than expected, affecting use cases requiring speed and reliability. This is more of a problem for XRP, which is significantly faster than Bitcoin and most competitors and relies on that speed to provide numerous services globally. XRP’s Unique Resistance to Soft Censorship According to Schwartz, the XRPL is designed to prevent both hard and soft censorship. The consensus protocol employed by the XRPL does not rely on a single block producer or leader, meaning no single participant can manipulate the order or inclusion of transactions.

As Schwartz noted, “front-running would be a problem if you didn’t have soft censorship resistance.” The ability to execute transactions fairly and predictably is critical for any trading platform. The DEX Emerges from Technical Strengths Schwartz explained that once the XRPL’s resilience to soft censorship became evident, the team began exploring what applications would benefit most from that property. A decentralized exchange was a logical choice because it depends heavily on transaction order, speed, and fairness. “We realized that that would make sense if you had a sort of multi-currency marketplace where transactions were competing for something like liquidity,” Schwartz said. This realization led Ripple’s Arthur Britto to focus on building the DEX as a core feature of the XRPL. While XRP has been tagged centralized in the past by critics, this approach shows that the asset is decentralized as it champions the principles of decentralization and ensures that any validator attempting soft censorship can be identified and removed from the Unique Node List (UNL).

2025-05-27T10:46:41.000Z,"Are AI Bots Ruling the Internet? Elon Musk’s Tweet Goes Viral Amid Crypto Experts","The post Are AI Bots Ruling the Internet? Elon Musk’s Tweet Goes Viral Amid Crypto Experts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again sparked a big conversation on his X platform with a simple but powerful question: “ How many real people are still on the Internet? ” He quoted crypto influencer Mario Nawfal, who referenced a report from Singapore’s The Straits Times claiming that AI-powered bots are taking over the internet in 2024. This statement caught the attention of the crypto community and beyond. AI Bots Are Taking Over the Web Musk’s question points to a surprising reality. Over half of all web traffic today comes from bots. But these aren’t just harmless programs – many are AI-driven and cause real problems. They scalpers tickets, exploit travel sites, hijack social media accounts, and create online drama and misinformation. Nawfal’s tweet even contained a typo, misspelling The Straits Times as “The Straight Times.” This small error might show how AI is affecting even things like spellchecking. AI BOTS RUN THE INTERNET NOW Congrats, humans: you officially lost the internet to AI-powered bots in 2024. Over half of all web traffic is now bots, and many of them up to no good. They are stealing passwords, crashing sites, faking clicks, and even pretending to be you.… https://t.co/gJAQNAh6ib pic.twitter.com/SoeTsoe06G — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) May 27, 2025 Willy Woo, a well-known crypto trader, jumped into the debate and asked Musk: “How do I know you’re not a machine?” This reflects a growing worry across the digital world – it’s becoming harder to tell if you’re talking to a real person or a bot. This issue is not just on social media but also in blockchain and crypto platforms. Another X user commented that humans are adapting to machines, which only blurs the line between real and artificial. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Adam Back Invests $1.5M in Swedish Firm Leading Bitcoin Treasury Shift , Is Our Reality Just a Simulation? Musk’s Bigger Idea Musk also used this moment to remind followers of his simulation theory. He explained that at Tesla and SpaceX, they run many simulations to predict what might happen because the future is uncertain. By this logic, the people who created our reality might also be running a simulation, trying to understand life and consciousness. This idea sparked a lively discussion. Many users insisted they are real humans but also pondered the unsettling possibility that we live in a simulation. Why This Matters As AI bots become smarter and more common, their impact on social media, online markets, and blockchain raises important questions about trust and authenticity. The crypto community, which values transparency and decentralization, faces a tough challenge in this new landscape filled with bots. Elon Musk’s question has done more than shock crypto fans – it has opened a global conversation about AI’s growing role and what it means for human interaction on the internet going forward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

January 23, 2025 – President Trump issues Executive Order “ Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology ,” promoting fair banking access and crypto innovation. What Do The US Federal Agencies Think About Crypto in 2025? SEC: The SEC, under new leadership, is moving away from aggressive enforcement and toward developing clear regulatory lines, realistic registration paths, and sensible disclosure guidelines for crypto assets. CFTC: The CFTC is collaborating with the SEC and Congress to clarify jurisdiction, especially over digital commodities and derivatives. FinCEN: AML and CFT requirements remain central, with crypto companies classified as financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act, subject to strict compliance. FDIC/OCC: The FDIC has eased restrictions on banks’ crypto activities, while the OCC supports banks’ ability to custody digital assets US Crypto Tax 2025 Cryptocurrency in the US is taxed based on how long you hold the asset and your total taxable income. Short-term gains (assets held for one year or less) are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term gains (assets held for more than a year) are taxed at lower capital gains rates. Additionally, income from mining, staking, or receiving crypto as payment is taxed as ordinary income. Short-Term Crypto Tax Rates (Held ≤ 1 Year) Tax Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately Head of Household 10% $0–$11,600 $0–$23,200 $0–$11,600 $0–$16,550 12% $11,601–$47,150 $23,201–$94,300 $11,601–$47,150 $16,551–$63,100 22% $47,151–$100,525 $94,301–$201,050 $47,151–$100,525 $63,101–$100,500 24% $100,526–$191,950 $201,051–$383,900 $100,526–$191,950 $100,501–$191,950 32% $191,951–$243,725 $383,901–$487,450 $191,951–$243,725 $191,951–$243,700 37% Over $609,351 Over $731,201 Over $365,601 Over $609,351 Long-Term Crypto Tax Rates (Held > 1 Year) Tax Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately Head of Household 0% Up to $47,025 Up to $94,050 Up to $47,025 Up to $63,000 15% $47,026–$518,900 $94,051–$583,750 $47,026–$291,850 $63,001–$551,350 20% Over $518,900 Over $583,750 Over $291,850 Over $551,350 Additional Crypto Tax Rules Income from mining, staking, or payment: Taxed as ordinary income at the above rates. NFTs: Some may be taxed at a higher collectibles rate (up to 28%). Non-taxable events: Transfers between your own wallets and certain gifts are not taxable. Crypto companies: Subject to standard corporate income tax and must comply with reporting and AML/CFT rules. Example If you are single, earn $50,000 in total taxable income, and realize $5,000 short-term crypto gains and $10,000 long-term crypto gains: Short-term gains taxed at 22%: $1,100 Long-term gains taxed at 15%: $1,500 Total crypto tax owed: $2,600 These rates and rules ensure all crypto investors and companies are taxed in line with other property and investment assets in the US Crypto Adoption Rate In America In 2025, about 28% of American adults—around 65 million people—own cryptocurrency. Crypto ownership in the US has nearly doubled since 2021, rising from 15% to 28%. 14% of non-owners plan to buy crypto in 2025, and 67% of current owners plan to buy more this year. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are the top three cryptocurrencies Americans plan to purchase in 2025. Crypto mining in the USA In 2025, the US leads the world in Bitcoin mining , accounting for over one-third of global mining power. On March 20, 2025, the SEC clarified that proof-of-work crypto mining is not subject to federal securities laws, removing registration requirements for miners. There is no federal ban on crypto mining; regulation is handled at the state level, with some states offering incentives and others imposing environmental restrictions. The Trump administration’s deregulatory approach in 2025 has encouraged domestic mining growth, but all miners must still comply with federal AML and CFT rules. Environmental concerns and energy usage debates continue, especially in states considering stricter oversight or moratoriums on mining operations. US Government’s Crypto Holdings As of April 2025, the US government holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoins, valued at about $18.3 billion. The US is the world’s largest state holder of Bitcoin, with these assets primarily acquired through law enforcement seizures and forfeitures. In March 2025, President Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile, consolidating all federally held Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies (including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP) as permanent reserve assets. Conclusion US crypto regulation in 2025 marks a major turning point. The old approach of punishing innovation is being replaced with clear rules, legal support, and a national strategy for digital assets. While financial crimes are still a concern, the overall direction is bold, business-friendly, and built for long-term crypto adoption. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The SEC regulates crypto assets that are considered securities. In 2025, the SEC is moving towards clearer regulatory guidelines. What are the IRS rules for crypto? The IRS treats crypto as property, taxing gains as capital gains and income from mining/staking as ordinary income. What is the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? Established by Trump in March 2025, it’s a federal reserve for Bitcoin, initially capitalized by seized BTC, aiming to manage holdings strategically. How has US crypto regulation changed in 2025? In 2025, the US shifted to a pro-innovation, pro-crypto approach under Trump, with new executive orders and a move toward clear federal legislation. How much tax on crypto USA? In the US, short-term crypto gains (held ≤ 1 year) are taxed at ordinary income rates (10-37%), while long-term gains (> 1 year) are taxed at lower capital gains rates (0-20%), based on your income and filing status.

2025-05-27T10:45:15.000Z,"Quantum Computing Threat Sparks Surge in Privacy Altcoins Like Best Wallet Token","Quantum computing is no longer just theory – it’s edging closer to reality. The crypto world is now buzzing with warnings about how this powerful new tech could one day crack the encryption behind Bitcoin and other blockchains. Experts call it ‘Q-Day’ – the moment when quantum machines become capable of breaking classical cryptography. While quantum computing and the ability to break cryptography aren’t here yet, recent developments are forcing the crypto community to ask some tough questions. How do we future-proof our digital assets? Can the security we rely on today survive the next wave of innovation? At the same time, projections show the quantum tech industry could reach $93B in revenue by 2040 . That kind of growth points to serious momentum. Pair that with the rise of tools for offline Bitcoin transfers, and it’s obvious: crypto is evolving fast . Security and privacy are now top priorities for users who want to stay ahead of the curve. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , one of the best altcoins right now, is making waves in this context. Read on to learn how quantum computing benefits privacy altcoins like Best Wallet Token. Why Is Everyone Talking About Quantum? The excitement – and fear – around quantum computing is grounded in how it fundamentally changes data processing. Unlike traditional computers, which process information as bits (ones and zeroes), quantum computers use qubits. These qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing quantum computers to accomplish specific tasks, like factoring very large numbers, at speeds previously thought impossible. This matters because modern cryptography, including the encryption that secures Bitcoin and Ethereum, is based on encryption that would take classical computers thousands of years to solve. But quantum computers? They could potentially do it in hours. That’s what ‘Q-Day’ refers to – the theoretical point in time when quantum computing becomes powerful enough to break public-key cryptography. While we’re not there yet, the warning signs are flashing. Major players like Google and IBM are actively investing in quantum research. Governments are pouring billions into quantum development. And the potential fallout for crypto security is real. To make matters more pressing, tools like Darkwire are now enabling Bitcoin transfers without internet access. Using LoRa radio, it relays transactions across offline nodes until reaching a connected exit point. Built for disaster zones and censorship resistance, it shows how crypto is adapting to extreme threats, but also new opportunities. Enter Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Privacy Without the Paranoia Best Wallet Token ($BEST) isn’t just another token in a crowded space. It’s the driving force behind a bold new ecosystem that’s shaking up how users store, send, and stake their crypto. Designed to challenge outdated players like MetaMask, Best Wallet combines sleek design with advanced functionality. It’s the gateway to a secure, seamless, and modern crypto experience, and the $BEST token is the key that unlocks it all. By buying and holding $BEST , you get reduced transaction fees, early access to new crypto project launches, and higher staking rewards within the app. Most importantly, Best Wallet places a strong focus on security. The app is built on Fireblocks’ cutting-edge MPC-CMP technology , offering robust protection without sacrificing speed or usability. Thanks to its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) implementation, Best Wallet keeps your crypto safe against potential data vulnerabilities. Your private key, the gateway to your crypto, is split across your device and an external server. Because of this, nobody can access your full key, rendering your wallet virtually unhackable even in the case of a breach. And features like the app’s Upcoming Tokens allow users to safely buy into vetted crypto presales directly from the app – no scammy websites, no rug pull roulette. Even the presale of $BEST itself started inside the Best Wallet app, rewarding early adopters and adding a layer of exclusivity. It’s the kind of ecosystem that doesn’t just look toward the future of crypto – it’s already building it. Why Buying $BEST Now Could Be a Power Move Currently priced at just $0.025085 and with over $12.7M already raised during presale, $BEST is gathering serious momentum. But this price won’t last. As presale stages progress, prices are bound to rise. With long-term forecasts predicting $BEST could hit $0.072 by the end of 2025 (a +187% increase from today’s price), the upside is clear. Let’s break it down. If you were to buy $1K worth of $BEST today at $0.025, you’d get 39,866 tokens. $BEST’s staking options currently offer competitive APY – let’s assume a modest 15% over one year. That brings your token count to around 45,846. Now, even if $BEST only hits a lower estimated price, like $0.24 (according to our 2026 forecast), your total investment could one day be worth roughly $11K – a potential 10x return. If it climbs to $0.62? That’s a potential ROI of over $28K. Timing matters, though. With growing user adoption, a fast-moving roadmap, and a clear market fit, buying $BEST today looks like a smart move for anyone who cares about privacy, profit, and the future of crypto. Brace for the Quantum Future No one knows exactly when Q-Day will arrive, but the smart money isn’t waiting. As the conversation around quantum computing and blockchain security heats up, new crypto projects focused on privacy, like Best Wallet Token , are carving out their space in the new world order. Want to stay ahead of the curve? You might want to start with a wallet that’s built for it. Remember that all crypto investments carry risk. Always do your own research (DYOR) before investing.

2025-05-27T10:43:36.000Z,"Next Crypto to 1,000x as Strategy Buys More Bitcoin; Is Trump Media Raising $3B for Crypto?","Strategy did what Strategy does best – buy more Bitcoin. This, as rumors swirl that Trump Media is raising some $3B to buy more crypto, though the company later denied them. The initial rumors emerged from Trump’s hotly debated crypto dinner, where not everyone was pleased. As Trump continues to raise eyebrows and Saylor pushes Bitcoin, here’s our prediction for the next 1000x cryptos . Strategy Pushes On, Despite Lawsuit Michael Saylor’s strategy to buy all the Bitcoin he can is outstripping mined supply 4:1. It isn’t just about amassing a vast hedge against coming financial market chaos, or even about building a stockpile of what could be the world’s most valuable asset. He’s actually positioning Strategy as an ETF alternative. With Strategy now built around Bitcoin, buying $MSTR stock essentially serves the same purpose as buying one of the major Bitcoin ETFs (like Blackrock’s or Grayscale’s): indirect exposure to Bitcoin. Not every Strategy stakeholder approves of that approach; at least one is taking Strategy’s C-suite to court over its Bitcoin accounting methods. The argument is less about the potential profitability of Bitcoin and more about how gains and losses are reported. Strategy plans to defend itself, of course, and while Strategy’s stock has dropped 7.5% over the past day , Bitcoin’s continued performance bodes well for its approach. Strategy’s strategy could be prompting other players to buy more Bitcoin, even Trump Media. Will Trump Media Buy More Crypto? Indeed, news has spread about a potential $3B fundraising effort from Trump Media & Technology Group to buy crypto, including Bitcoin. But Trump Media quickly downplayed the initial report from the Financial Times , calling the FT ‘fake news’ and reporters who covered the topic ‘dumb.’ Even so, the move would fit in with earlier reports from TMTG, which pointed to a planned utility token for Truth Social. President Trump hasn’t tried to hide his crypto connections or his desire to promote crypto as an integral part of his ‘America First’ vision for the US economy. But, while his pro-crypto efforts on a regulatory level have been quite successful, his personal projects haven’t always been as well received. That was once again the case at the much-ballyhooed crypto dinner. No ‘Alpha’ at Trump Dinner Admission to the Trump crypto dinner last week was easy: just be in the top 200 holders of $TRUMP, the president’s official meme coin. Get enough $TRUMP and gain access to the most powerful man in the (crypto) world. Imagine the influence you’d wield, the info you could learn! But some attendees were left disappointed. Trump’s speeches were brief and didn’t offer any actionable market intelligence – no alpha, no exclusive insight. There was no mention of a new TMTG (Trump Media and Technology Group) crypto buy, and no juicy geopolitical tidbits that might have created opportunities for those with ears to hear. Trump did speak in general terms of his successful efforts in reforming a pro-crypto environment in the US, and his plans for crypto to remain at the forefront of the economy. Despite the lack of specifics, that might be enough for now. New cryptocurrencies are betting big on a continued crypto-friendly approach from the US government, and Trump shows no signs of changing tack. So if the show must go on, here are three new crypto projects that could be the next 1000x cryptos . BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – World’s First Bitcoin Meme Coin Set to Explode as $BTC Rides High Why reinvent the wheel? BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a low-cap project that bows to the one cryptocurrency that continues to outperform all the others – Bitcoin. So rather than try to beat Bitcoin, $BTCBULL token uses deflationary tokenomics and free crypto airdrops to hitch its own token performance to Bitcoin’s continued rise. With regular token burns interspersed with real $BTC airdrops, $BTCBULL token holders receive attractive incentives every time Bitcoin reaches key price milestones. As $BTC hits $125K, $175K, and $225K, there will be $BTCBULL token burns As $BTC reaches $150K and $200K, $BTC airdrops for $BTCBULL holders who use Best Wallet As $BTC climbs to $250K, a massive $BTCBULL token airdrop The combination of token burns and regular airdrops connects BTC Bull Token’s performance with Bitcoin’s, and gives token holders more than one way to earn from Bitcoin’s gains. The project’s design comes at an opportune time. As Strategy and friends continue to buy Bitcoin, pushing the price higher, the $125K milestone is already on the horizon. Our $BTCBULL price prediction shows the token could hit $0.0084 by the end of the year, up 232% from its current price of $0.00253. Learn how to buy $BTCBULL in our guide. Will it be the next crypto to 1,000X as Bitcoin soars? Visit the BTC Bull Token presale page . Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Layer-2 Savior Arrives Solana’s got speed and low fees. Now, Solaxy ($SOLX) brings the Layer-2 upgrade Solana needs to compete with Ethereum’s reliability and scalability. The Solaxy testnet and multichain bridge are already live, and the presale has just passed the $41M mark. This indicates clear progress towards launching a fully developed, first-of-its-kind Solana Layer-2. In addition to greater scalability, Solaxy will boost Solana’s speed while significantly reducing network congestion and the risk of failed transactions. The $SOLX token will launch on Ethereum, and bridge to Solana and the Solaxy Layer-2 post-launch. There’s not much time left; the Solaxy presale has only 20 days left. Tokens are currently priced at $0.001736, but our Solaxy price prediction shows the price could reach $0.025 by the end of 2025, an incredible 1340% increase. Don’t miss our guide on how to buy $SOLX , and visit the Solaxy presale page . SpacePay ($SPY) – Crypto Payments Go Mainstream The $SPY token facilitates retail payments, providing native crypto acceptance alongside traditional currencies. It’s all bundled in familiar POS terminals, making it easy for retailers to expand their payment options without the need for extensive retraining. In short, SpacePay could power crypto adoption for small retailers everywhere, a major breakthrough for the crypto economy. The $SPY token serves as the utility token for the broader ecosystem, facilitating transactions within the network. With over $1M in the presale and a vast potential market, $SPY could make massive gains in 2025. Trump, Strategy Lead Crypto’s Future Whether a genius or a madman, Trump is shaping the future of crypto. So too is Michael Saylor; his Bitcoin-buying appetite has forced corporations and governments around the globe to adjust course to keep up. The future of crypto looks rosier than ever, and as ever, we’re on the hunt for the next crypto to go 1000X and set the crypto world on fire. The coins listed in this article, like Solaxy and Bitcoin Bull Token , could prove top contenders.

2025-05-27T10:30:10.000Z,"Bitcoin at Risk of Sharp Pullback as Traders Take Profit: Bitfinex","Last week, bitcoin posted a new all-time high (ATH) that marked a significant recovery from lows seen in April. The pace and consistency of the rally led to BTC logging its seventh consecutive green weekly close, marking the longest such streak since October 2023. However, according to the newest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report , that streak is about to be broken because traders are beginning to take profits. Also, BTC may struggle to thrive amid an unfavorable macroeconomic environment triggered by tariff tensions in the United States. Increased Possibility of Pullback Within 36 hours of hitting a new ATH, BTC witnessed a slight correction, falling below its previous high of $109,590. This retrace was attributed to reignited global trade war fears triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal of 50% tariffs on European Union imports. While cryptocurrencies struggled with the effects of Trump’s tariff announcement, the Bitcoin perpetual futures market witnessed a flush as excessive leverage unwound. This added to the downside pressure on BTC and increased the possibility of a corrective move in the short term. Although the coming days will tell if BTC will stabilize above the $106,000 weekly lows, profit-taking by short-term holders could lead to a deeper reset before the next leg up. This is because investors tend to lock in gains when BTC records such a pace of appreciation. Short-term Holders Take Profits Bitfinex says there will be two types of sellers: those who bought the BTC dip and are sitting on profits, and those who were in losses during the last correction and are now above breakeven. These cohorts of investors are already taking profits, as seen in the on-chain data. As BTC recovered and rallied past $$93,400, which was the short-term holder (STH) cost basis, profit-taking accelerated. In the last 30 days, STHs have realized at least $11.4 billion in profit, with a daily peak of $747 million. This figure is a far cry from the $1.2 billion in cumulative profit realized within the previous 30-day period. Additionally, the surge in profit-taking is evident in the STH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, which has risen to a level only seen on 8% of trading days in Bitcoinʼs history. “This dramatic shift highlights just how quickly investor sentiment and behavior can pivot when momentum returns. However, it also implies that some degree of consolidation is likely as the market digests this wave of distribution before attempting another leg higher,” Bitfinex analysts stated.

Metaplanet’s stockholders are paying a more than fivefold premium on Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price when investing in the Japanese company, according to a report by 10x Research published on May 27, which wrote: “A little-known Japanese stock trades as if Bitcoin were worth $596,154, more than five times its actual price.” Investors who don’t understand the importance of a firm’s net asset value (NAV) may be “dramatically overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure,” on a position that doesn’t provide additional upside leverage, said the report. The NAV represents the per-unit price of a fund, calculated by dividing the fund’s total assets minus its liabilities by the number of outstanding shares.

QCP warns of past volatility spikes tied to political speeches, with short-term traders trimming exposure. Bitfinex sees rising profit-taking and expects consolidation, but institutional buying remains a strong tailwind. Bitcoin is trading in a tight range between $107,000 and $110,000 ahead of the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, according to a May 27 market note from QCP Capital. The muted price action follows Friday’s macro developments, where equities rallied but BTC remained largely unmoved, the firm said in a Telegram note . QCP added that institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains firm, helping to anchor prices. However, near-term implied volatility remains elevated, suggesting traders are bracing for headline risk from the conference, which runs May 27–29. Trump’s 2023 Bitcoin Conference Speech Triggered 30% BTC Crash QCP pointed to last July’s Nashville conference as a cautionary example. Bitcoin volatility spiked above 90 following a keynote from Donald Trump, then dropped nearly 30% over two days. While a repeat of that move is unlikely, traders appear cautious. Open interest in perpetuals has dropped, and funding rates have normalized. Retail exposure is also thinning. High-profile traders like James Wynn have scaled back positions. Short-dated downside protection remains in demand. Adding to market nerves are unconfirmed reports that Trump Media is exploring a $3 billion crypto raise, claims the company has denied. QCP expects Bitcoin to remain range-bound until the event passes, with volatility likely to ease once headline risks subside. QCP says Bitcoin is trading between $107,000 and $110,000, backed by steady ETF demand. Markets are watching this week’s Bitcoin conference. With high short-term volatility, investors are being cautious. After the event, sentiment and volatility are expected to calm down.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 27, 2025 Bitcoin surged past $111,800 last week, capping a more than 50% rebound from April lows. Analysts at Bitfinex say the move represents both a psychological and technical milestone, but warn that a period of profit-taking and consolidation is likely. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, they said the rally began after the April 2 “Liberation Day” sell-off and was fueled by strong ETF inflows, spot market demand, and institutional buying. However, a flood of realized gains, over $11.4 billion among short-term holders in just the past month, has introduced near-term supply pressure. Bitfinex analysts say the current phase mirrors past bull cycles where sharp gains were followed by consolidation. They expect price action to remain range-bound in the short term as leverage resets and spot demand stabilizes. Key support now sits near the short-term holder cost basis of $95,000. Notably, profit-taking is elevated, with realized profit levels among the highest in Bitcoin’s history. Analysts caution that this could cap further upside unless new capital enters the market to absorb overhead supply. Institution Adoption Remains Strong Institutional adoption remains strong. Publicly listed firms like Strategy , Semler Scientific , and Metaplanet have collectively acquired over 8,800 BTC in recent weeks. Their purchases underscore Bitcoin’s evolving role as a long-term strategic asset, especially amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty and fiscal strain in the U.S. Last week, Matrixport also claimed that the current bull market is being driven primarily by institutional capital rather than the wave of individual buyers seen in past cycles. “This rally is unfolding largely without retail participation,” analysts wrote. “Instead of the usual buzz and euphoria, there’s a noticeable absence of retail momentum.” The post BTC Holds Steady Near $110K as Traders Brace for Bitcoin Conference Headlines: QCP appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/btc-holds-steady-near-110k-as-traders-brace-for-bitcoin-conference-headlines-qcp/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Adoption|Bitcoin|Market",cryptocompare

There is a fresh crop of criminals targeting crypto holders, and they are not just here to rug tokens or hack protocols. These ones take a much more direct and physical approach, but law enforcement is always just around the corner, as proven by the recent arrests made in connection with crimes linked to crypto-oriented people. French authorities hunt criminals targeting people involved in crypto According to reports, the recent kidnapping cases in the cryptocurrency world have been linked with a common demographic: young and violent perpetrators, hired by the same sponsors who manipulate them, all behind pseudonyms. Enfant exfiltré, arme factice, société en crypto… Récit d’une tentative d’enlèvement surréaliste en plein Paris ➡️ https://t.co/CoiJGY8v2s pic.twitter.com/b43QsZwDiS — Le Parisien (@le_Parisien) May 14, 2025 In Paris, there were two high-profile cases recorded this May alone and one in New York. One was the kidnapping and mutilation of the father of a young poker player who made bank in cryptocurrency on May 1. The other was the attempted kidnapping of the daughter of the CEO of a virtual currency company on May 13. Investigators from the Brigade for the Repression of Banditry (BRB), with the support of several services including the Paris Research and Intervention Brigade (BRI), launched a major raid on Monday morning to apprehend suspects linked to the crimes. The raid was a success, and they came away with more than a dozen suspects, and several minors were among them. In the first case, the criminals demanded between 5 and 7 million euros in the form of a wire transfer from the victim’s son in exchange for his release. They severed one of the victim’s fingers and recorded it to coerce his son into cooperating. Fortunately, the sixty-year-old was rescued during an operation coordinated by the BRI of the Paris judicial police with the BRB and the criminal brigade after locating the hideout where the victim was being held, in Palaiseau (Essonne). Half a dozen suspects, including alleged kidnappers, have already been identified, charged and imprisoned. As for the second case, the target was the 34-year-old daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO and co-founder of Paymium, a cryptocurrency exchange platform. The kidnapping attempt was caught on film by bystanders. The attempted kidnapping happened on May 13, in the middle of the 11th arrondissement of Paris, near a school. Although the shocking scene unfolded before the eyes of many civilians, they were too scared to intervene despite the victim’s screams. It took the heroic intervention of a young man and that of the victim’s companion to deter the kidnappers, and as of Monday morning, no suspects have been arrested in this case. Investigators are now exploring the potential of both crimes being planned by a joint criminal organization, with interchangeable goons recruited on social networks. Violent crimes may increase as crypto gains popularity Violent crimes have spread through the cryptocurrency community like wildfire and have triggered a feeling of insecurity in the cryptocurrency community. On X, formerly Twitter, many users have highlighted the crimes, frowning upon the growing frequency and the sluggishness of the authorities to address it.

2025-05-27T10:15:30.000Z,"Whale Accumulation Report: Cardano News Reveals Major Investors Pivoting to Bitcoin Solaris for 10X Returns","The post Whale Accumulation Report: Cardano News Reveals Major Investors Pivoting to Bitcoin Solaris for 10X Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recent Cardano network data shows increased on-chain consolidation among large ADA holders. While this may indicate confidence in long-term fundamentals, it also reflects a broader pattern: capital is rotating from mature assets into earlier-stage opportunities with greater return potential. With ADA’s growth trajectory tapering and staking yields flat, many institutional wallets are reallocating exposure toward projects with fixed supply, real user participation, and defined token scarcity. According to analyst reports, Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as one of the top destinations for that capital. The project’s architecture, mobile-first distribution model, and decentralized reward system are drawing both retail and whale-tier interest for the same reason: it mirrors the early economic blueprint that made Bitcoin and Ethereum wealth engines. Smartphones Become Crypto Mining Infrastructure At the core of Bitcoin Solaris is the Nova App, a mobile mining interface that turns any modern smartphone into a yield-generating asset. Users allocate 1–5 GB of storage and idle CPU to the app, which runs passively while the device charges. Mining rewards are distributed daily in BTC-S based on uptime. This direct protocol-level access stands in sharp contrast to Cardano, where delegation mechanics still favor large pools and require ecosystem fluency. Bitcoin Solaris removes these technical and financial barriers, giving early adopters consistent rewards for real network contribution. Designed for Decentralized Throughput at Global Scale Bitcoin Solaris achieves scalability through a dual-layer blockchain. The Base Layer secures the ledger using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), while the Solaris Layer executes smart contracts and mobile mining via Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT). This enables the network to process 10,000+ transactions per second with 2-second finality — a throughput that outpaces Cardano’s current benchmarks. This design supports real-time reward issuance across tens of thousands of nodes while keeping energy use minimal. For whales entering at scale, the network can support high-volume participation without bottlenecks or centralization risks. Security Audits Back Investor Confidence Bitcoin Solaris has completed comprehensive security and compliance checks. The Cyberscope audit validated smart contract logic and token mechanics. The Freshcoins audit tested mobile mining performance and scalability. The team also passed KYC verification , confirming transparent governance and traceability. This audit trail ensures that BTC-S enters the market as a verified asset, not a speculative token launch. Early Access Window Closes as Network Activation Nears Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Phase 5 of its presale, with BTC-S priced at 5 USDT. Of the fixed 21 million BTC-S supply, 4.2 million (20%) are allocated to the full presale. There will be no inflation or new token creation post-launch. Participants in the presale also secure early Nova App mining access before broader user growth drives up difficulty. As history has shown with Bitcoin and Ethereum, network positioning ahead of public saturation is often the defining factor in long-term returns. In a recent market briefing, Crypto Volt explained why large Cardano holders are shifting toward Bitcoin Solaris. His analysis focuses on token scarcity, mining-first distribution, and why early protocol access through smartphones is becoming the new strategy for crypto-native wealth growth. Cardano remains a leading Layer 1 — but for investors seeking transformative upside, its phase of exponential gains appears to have passed. Bitcoin Solaris presents a structurally different opportunity, one defined by scarcity, real-time rewards, and early-phase access. Now in Presale phase 5 at 5 USDT, BTC-S is drawing both institutional and retail attention as a credible next-generation wealth builder — before the door closes.

2025-05-27T10:10:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Options Skew Signals Dangerous Optimism: What Investors Need to Know","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Options Skew Signals Dangerous Optimism: What Investors Need to Know Are you feeling the intense optimism bubbling in the crypto markets right now? Bitcoin (BTC) has been showing strength, and it seems traders are betting heavily on continued upside. But a recent analysis points to a potential red flag hidden within the options market. Let’s dive into what the latest Bitcoin options skew is telling us. Understanding Bitcoin Options Skew First off, what exactly is Bitcoin options skew ? In simple terms, it’s a way to measure the relative cost of buying protection against a price drop (put options) versus betting on a price increase (call options) for Bitcoin. Options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price (strike price) by a certain date. The skew is calculated based on the implied volatility of these options. Implied volatility reflects the market’s expectation of how much Bitcoin’s price will move. When the implied volatility for call options is significantly higher than for put options, it means traders are willing to pay a higher premium for the chance of profiting from a price surge compared to protecting against a price fall. This indicates strong bullish sentiment. Conversely, if put options have higher implied volatility, it suggests traders are more concerned about downside risk and are paying more for protection. What the Current BTC Options Data Shows According to a recent Chart of the Day shared by Matrixport crypto on May 27, the Bitcoin options skew has reached an extreme level. Matrixport reported that the skew has fallen to nearly -10%. What does a negative skew mean? A negative skew indicates that call options are significantly more expensive than put options. Specifically, implied volatility for calls is now approximately 10% higher than for puts. This highlights a strong bias among traders towards expecting and positioning for further upward price movement in Bitcoin. It suggests traders are prioritizing potential gains over hedging against potential losses. This isn’t just a slight lean towards bullishness; a -10% skew is considered an extreme reading, reflecting a high degree of optimism prevailing in the market. Is Extreme Crypto Market Sentiment a Warning Sign? While it feels good to see high optimism, especially after periods of consolidation or downturns, extreme sentiment can sometimes be a contrarian indicator. This is a key point highlighted by the Matrixport crypto analysis. Why is excessive optimism potentially problematic? When too many market participants are positioned on one side of the trade (in this case, betting heavily on upside via calls), the market can become vulnerable. If something triggers a shift in sentiment or a wave of profit-taking, there might not be enough buyers to absorb the selling pressure, leading to a sharper-than-expected pullback. Matrixport specifically noted that such extreme bullish sentiment readings from the options skew have historically preceded short-term market pullbacks in Bitcoin. Historical Context and Bitcoin Price Analysis Looking back at historical data, there have been instances where a highly negative options skew (indicating extreme bullishness) coincided with or shortly preceded local price tops before a correction occurred. This doesn’t mean a crash is imminent, but it suggests that the market might be getting a little ahead of itself. Consider this simplified idea: Sentiment Indicator (Options Skew) Trader Positioning Potential Market Reaction Extremely Bullish (Negative Skew) Heavy buying of calls, less demand for puts Increased risk of profit-taking or reversal Neutral Skew Balanced interest in calls and puts More stable market conditions Extremely Bearish (Positive Skew) Heavy buying of puts, less demand for calls Increased potential for a relief rally or bottoming This historical pattern is why Bitcoin price analysis often includes looking at derivatives data like options skew. It provides insight into the collective positioning and sentiment of sophisticated traders. Actionable Insights for Your BTC Options Strategy So, if the Bitcoin options skew is flashing an extreme bullish signal that has historically preceded pullbacks, what should traders and investors consider? For Call Buyers: Be cautious. While the trend might still be up, the premium for calls is high. Consider if the potential upside justifies the cost, or if scaling back exposure or using tighter stop losses is warranted. For Put Buyers: Puts are relatively cheaper right now (in terms of implied volatility). If you are concerned about a potential short-term dip, buying puts could be a relatively cost-effective way to hedge your spot holdings or short-term long positions. For Option Sellers: Selling calls when premiums are high might seem attractive, but be aware of the risk if the bullish trend continues strongly. Selling puts could be an option if you expect the market to hold up or rebound, but this also carries significant risk if a sharp downturn occurs. Overall Strategy: This signal doesn’t necessarily mean you should abandon your long-term Bitcoin strategy. However, for short-term trading or managing risk, paying attention to this extreme skew and considering hedging strategies or reducing leverage might be prudent. It’s crucial to remember that options skew is just one indicator among many. A comprehensive Bitcoin price analysis should also include technical indicators, on-chain data, macroeconomic factors, and news events. Beyond the Skew: Other Factors Influencing Crypto Market Sentiment While the Bitcoin options skew provides valuable insight into trader positioning, the overall crypto market sentiment is influenced by numerous factors: Macroeconomics: Interest rates, inflation data, and global economic stability play a significant role. Regulatory News: Developments regarding crypto regulation in major economies can heavily impact sentiment. Institutional Adoption: News about large institutions investing in Bitcoin or offering crypto services often boosts optimism. Technological Developments: Upgrades or issues with the Bitcoin network or other major blockchains can affect confidence. Geopolitical Events: Global events can drive risk-on or risk-off sentiment across all markets, including crypto. Therefore, while the options skew is a powerful tool for understanding derivatives market positioning, it should be viewed as part of a larger mosaic when assessing the overall market outlook. Challenges and Nuances Interpreting the Bitcoin options skew isn’t always straightforward. Extreme readings don’t guarantee an immediate reversal. Sometimes, extreme sentiment can persist for a while before a correction occurs. Also, the skew can be influenced by factors other than pure directional bets, such as large players hedging existing positions. The analysis from Matrixport crypto provides a valuable data point, but it’s essential for traders to do their own research and consider their individual risk tolerance and investment goals. Conclusion: Caution Amidst the Optimism The current state of the Bitcoin options skew , as highlighted by Matrixport, points to a level of bullishness that is historically associated with increased risk of a short-term pullback. While the overall trend for Bitcoin may remain positive, the derivatives market is signaling that caution might be warranted at these elevated levels of optimism. Paying attention to indicators like the Bitcoin options skew is crucial for understanding the underlying dynamics of the market beyond just price action. It helps reveal how traders are positioned and the collective sentiment regarding future price movements. As always, a balanced approach that considers multiple data points and risk management is key in navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency.

2025-05-27T10:07:07.000Z,"Japan’s Debt Crisis and Bond Market Meltdown Explained – Is Bitcoin the Answer?","The post Japan’s Debt Crisis and Bond Market Meltdown Explained – Is Bitcoin the Answer? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Not a lot of people are talking about this. Japan’s bond market is unraveling fast and it’s not just a local problem. More than half a trillion dollars in value has been wiped out in just weeks, triggering alarm bells across global markets. Bond volatility is now back at levels not seen since the 2008 crisis, and the ripple effects are just beginning to surface. If you think this is just another macro event, think again. From Tokyo to Wall Street, this collapse is driving a quiet – but growing – shift into Bitcoin. And it’s happening under the radar. What’s really going on in Japan’s economy? Why are long-dated bonds plunging? And what does all this have to do with crypto? Let’s break it down. A $500B Crash and the Return of Bond Volatility Over the past 45 days, Japan’s 30-year government bond yield has surged by 100bps, hitting a record 3.20%. The 40-year bond, often seen as a long-term safe haven, has dropped over 20% in value, triggering losses of more than $500 billion across the market. This isn’t normal volatility. According to analyst Financelot , “Japan’s bond market liquidity has dropped to 2008 Lehman crisis levels. Are we about to experience another financial crisis?” Let’s talk about the why. Understanding the Japan Bond Crisis The Bank of Japan is unwinding years of ultra-loose policy. After aggressively buying up government bonds for years, the central bank is now stepping back – and that flood of supply is overwhelming buyers. With the BOJ still holding over $4.1 trillion in bonds – 52% of the entire market – even a small shift in policy is enough to rattle the system. Japan’s Debt Machine Is Overheating Japan’s economic numbers aren’t helping. GDP shrank by 0.7% in Q1, more than double the expected drop, while inflation has crept up to 3.6%. Real wages, meanwhile, are down 2.1% year over year. This mix of slowing growth and rising prices – classic stagflation – is squeezing both investors and policymakers. And it’s hitting Japan’s global strategies hard. The yen carry trade, once a go-to for global liquidity, is under pressure as rising Japanese yields flip the math. “The huge mess is coming home to roost,” wrote Wolf Street , pointing to the growing cracks in Japan’s once-stable financial structure. In the background, Japanese institutions are pulling back from U.S. Treasuries too; selling off $119.3 billion in just one quarter. That’s the largest quarterly drop since 2012. Bitcoin Becomes the Go-To Saviour It’s clear traditional markets are struggling. Now, some investors are quietly moving toward crypto, especially Bitcoin. With bonds no longer feeling so “safe,” BTC is starting to look like a viable hedge against global debt risks. “Is it a coincidence that the UK and Japan are seeing huge demand for bitcoin exposure?” asked analyst James Van Straten , as long-term bond yields in both countries spike. Bitwise’s Andre Dragosche and Cauê Oliveira, Head of Research at BlockTrendsBR echoed the trend – hinting that institutional capital is starting to see Bitcoin in a new light. That shift won’t happen overnight. If the yen continues to fall and the dollar strengthens, crypto markets could still feel pressure from a broader carry trade unwind. But in the long run, the trend is clear: as trust in traditional debt markets wavers, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge is getting harder to ignore.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/japans-debt-crisis-and-bond-market-meltdown-explained-is-bitcoin-the-answer/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T10:00:59.000Z,"Here’s Why Hyperliquid Hit New ATH At $39 And Why It Could Continue","Hyperliquid has quickly become a main character in the crypto space after it became the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange for perp trading. As its popularity has grown, so has the price of its native HYPE token. This has seen it rally even at a time of bearish divergence in the crypto market, moving up by more than 50% in one week to reach new all-time highs. Factors Driving The Hyperliquid Price The main driver behind the Hyperliquid price pushing to new all-time highs has been the rise in attention being paid to the platform. As crypto investors are pivoting toward more decentralized platforms for their perpetual trading activities, HYPE’s mindshare has grown exponentially over the last few months. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Rally Over After $111,900 ATH? Global M2 Money Supply Is Still Going This rising interest translated to a major surge in the platform’s trading volume over the last few weeks. Most notable were the billion-dollar bets placed by James Wynn, who has quickly risen to become the most popular crypto trader on Hyperliquid. His trades garnered the interest of thousands, putting more eyes on the platforms as onlookers stood by to see the outcome of his trades. In particular, over the last week, the platform recorded its highest weekly volume since it was launched, reaching $78.672 billion in trading volume between May 11 and May 18, 2025. Daily trading volumes have also not been left out, consistently crossing the $2 billion mark daily. Its highest daily trading volume yet was recorded on May 21, 2025, with $17.731 billion trade on the platform. Cumulatively, the Hyperliquid platform has reached $1.156 trillion in volume in three years of operation, DefiLlama data shows. Other major developments that the platform has seen is the rise in the open interest. The platform celebrated a new all-time high after open interest crossed the $10.1 billion mark on the platform. The amount of USDC locked on the platform also climbed to $3.5 billion, with $5.6 million in fees generated in only a 24-hour period. In one week, the platform was able to generate over $22 million in fees alone. Related Reading: XRP Price Consolidates In Tight Bullish Compression Pattern, Why $5 Is Possible On its own, the HYPE price is still showing a lot of bullish momentum despite already rising 50% in one week. Daily trading volumes crossed $460 million on May 26, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Crypto whales have been especially active during this time, as Lookonchain reported three whales spending $5.33 million to buy HYPE on Monday. With volumes rising and prices going up, it suggests that a lot of the volume is actually from buyers. If this buying pressure continues, then it is likely that the price sees further upside before putting in a correction.

2025-05-27T10:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Could Reach $250,000 By 2026, But What Does This Mean For SHIB, ADA And YETIO?","Bitcoin price has been rising lately, going as high as $111,000 , which is affecting the entire crypto market positively. As per stats, there is a high chance that Bitcoin might go up to $250,000 by 2026, but what about coins like Shiba Inu and Cardano? How high can they go? Besides, the meme-utility project, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , would have officially launched by then surpassing both SHIB and ADA. With YETIO 100K giveaway now live, attracting more investors to its presale. Shiba Inu and Cardano’s State in 2026 The meme coin Shiba Inu has been showing its potential since Bitcoin climbed the ladder. Though it has been experiencing a dip of 1.14% in the past 24 hours , the entire week was quite prosperous for Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu price went as high as $0.0000160 on May 23, 2025, the time when Bitcoin was moving past the $111,000 mark. It clearly shows that Shiba Inu’s growth depends majorly on Bitcoin. Besides, the burn rate of Shiba Inu has increased by more than 108% in the last 24 hours which is increasing its scarcity in the market. Looking at the token burn mechanism of Shiba Inu, and its exponential growth as compared to Bitcoin, there are high chances that the meme coin might be somewhere near the $0.001 mark by 2026. On the other hand, Cardano has also been showing the same pattern as Shiba Inu in terms of growth. Though its value has decreased by 1.05% in the past week (currently standing at $0.7363), Cardano did show some pretty good growth on Friday. ADA price went as high as $0.8395 on May 23, 2025. As per reports, the trading volume of Cardano has increased by $1.2 billion despite the coin showing declining values. Moreover, the Cardano ecosystem is also growing, and as per data, the stablecoin market cap of the said coin has increased to $30.1 million, a whopping 30% rise . As Cardano continues to move forward, there are high chances that it will reach the $0.1 mark by the end of 2025, and it might hover around the same in 2026. YETIO Rising In 2026 Despite being in the presale era, YETIO has managed to bring in more than 200% profit for the investors. From a $0.012 token value to currently marked at $0.041, YETIO has managed to raise more than $4.2 million during this period, which is quite remarkable for any project. The growing value and investors’ interests show trust that the project will do well after the launch period. The way YETIO engages with its community through various activities and bonuses ensures that the project will remain in the market for a long time. One of the classic examples of YETIO’s community-engaging activity is its current giveaway of $100,000 worth of tokens . The team is conducting a massive giveaway where five users will be rewarded with $20,000 of YETIO tokens. The giveaway is already live and has captured the attention of all YETIO investors. The project is also offering investors a 20% bonus on token purchases with an additional 5% for purchases over $500. Since the project has a limit of 1 billion tokens, it is already making YETIO availability scarce, which will increase its demand post-launch as well. The tactic of limiting the token supply has worked wonders for various projects in the past, and the chances of it working in YETIO’s favor are also high. Besides, the Yeti Ouro team has been working on its main project, the upcoming game, Yeti Go, which will also serve as a space for earning and spending the YETIO tokens. The racing game is still being developed, but the team has already revealed some of its unique features, one of which includes the play-to-earn tactic. Upon completing missions and races, the users will be rewarded with YETIO tokens, which will cause more investors to flock toward the project. However, the game itself has managed to capture the attention of the gaming community through its cutting-edge technology, amazing graphics, PVP mode, mini-games, and much more, which have been revealed in recent trailers. Yeti Go drops you into a sleek, high-speed world where every turn, sound, and visual is engineered for impact. Built with the expertise of the studio behind iconic titles like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, this game is all about intensity and immersion. The soundtrack—produced by industry pros who’ve worked alongside Grammy-nominated artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid—adds a cinematic pulse that keeps the action flowing. All these factors increase the chances of YETIO growing at an incredible speed after its official launch.

2025-05-27T10:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Wallet Firm Exodus Unveils Crypto Debit Card With Baanx","U.S.-listed Exodus Movement (EXOD), a self-custody wallet firm specializing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has unveiled an Exodus debit card in partnership with Baanx , a crypto card enabler that works with Mastercard and Visa. Through the Baanx partnership, Exodus users can spend their crypto on everyday purchases such as travel, online shopping, and anywhere Mastercard is accepted, the firms announced at the BTC Vegas conference on Tuesday. Bringing debit card functionality to self-custody crypto holders is a fast-growing subset of the digital assets space, attracting a range of popular platforms such as Ethereum wallet firm MetaMask , decentralized finance firm 1inch and most recently, Sam Altman’s World Network . Beta testing of the virtual Exodus card begins at BTC Vegas, starting with the two major stablecoins, USDT and USDC, which users can instantly swap for bitcoin and other major cryptos inside the Exodus wallet. A wider rollout to the six million or so Exodus users will happen later this year, said Exodus CEO JP Richardson. “If you consider there are 1.7 billion people who are unbanked out there, well now they don't need a bank account because they can use something like this,” Richardson said in an interview. Baanx chief commercial officer Simon Jones echoed this view: “You are effectively saying that if you've got access to a mobile phone, you've got access to a range of basic financial services,” Jones said in an interview. “Historically, wallets were very much focused around the custodial element with some swaps and trading. Now we are really seeing an evolution happen where your wallet is becoming your virtual account.” In December of 2024, Nebraska-based Exodus was given the greenlight to list on the NYSE American , the New York Stock Exchange's sibling market, not long after Donald Trump’s election victory.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/05/27/bitcoin-wallet-firm-exodus-unveils-crypto-debit-card-with-baanx,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT","Finance|Baanx|Crypto card|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T09:53:16.000Z,"Ripple CTO’s Statement Suggests XRP’s Path to Adoption Has Begun","In a detailed thread on X, Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp) presented a focused analysis of Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s recent comments on the evolving path of XRP and crypto adoption. Schwartz’s remarks, shared through multiple clips of a recent stage talk, emphasized the challenges Ripple has faced and the foundation now being laid for a more viable and institutionally integrated crypto ecosystem. Schwartz clarified that the route for Ripple and XRP has been indirect and complex. He explained that while Ripple committed to payments in 2014, the process has not followed a linear path. Schwartz emphasized that for global adoption to materialize, users must be able to access their funds instantly, especially for essential expenses. His statements suggest that while the journey has been long, adoption has begun, and the path is becoming clearer. This wasn’t a roadmap. It was a confession. Ripple’s CTO just admitted that crypto’s path to adoption won’t be clean or direct, but it’s already begun. And for the first time in years, XRP is in position to lead. Here’s what David Schwartz just revealed and why it matters now… pic.twitter.com/We71vwlugV — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) May 23, 2025 Functional Balance and Ledger Evolution Discussing the XRP Ledger (XRPL), Schwartz positioned it between Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of capability. Bitcoin offers limited functions, and Ethereum is broadly programmable, but the XRPL is designed for fixed functions, covering most financial use cases without the unpredictability of custom smart contracts. The XRPL’s fixed function design lets users engage with the blockchain without the uncertainty they would have on Ethereum’s network, where they cannot verify the functions of smart contracts or audit them. He also pointed to recent advancements, including the addition of decentralized identity features and automated market makers (AMMs), decentralized ID, lending protocols, and more. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 U.S. Market Reentry and Regulatory Clarity One of the most notable admissions in Schwartz’s remarks involved Ripple’s strategic shift away from the U.S. due to unclear regulatory pressures. He explained that Ripple had to move hiring, development, and customer acquisition overseas. However, the climate is beginning to shift . Ripple’s licensed payment product, Ripple Payments, now operates within the U.S., and Schwartz expressed optimism that soft regulatory barriers are starting to ease. Schwartz highlighted the need for “predictability,” stressing that Ripple will comply with regulations as long as they are clearly defined. Liquidity, Rational Markets, and the Path Forward Schwartz noted that crypto markets behave rationally with sufficient liquidity and access, with prices reflecting adoption odds. Applying this rationale to XRP, Jungle Inc. emphasized that recent gains are not driven by speculation, but by increasing institutional access and improved infrastructure. Schwartz highlighted increasing ties between traditional finance and crypto, expecting tokenized real-world assets to boost DeFi. According to Jungle Inc., XRP is now positioned to lead in this emerging phase, having navigated years of regulatory uncertainty and infrastructure development.

2025-05-27T09:52:13.000Z,"The Quiet Collapse: Why Japan’s Bond Sell-Off Shakes the Whole World","A major financial change is starting quietly in Japan, and it could affect the entire global economy. Life insurance companies in Japan—known for holding long-term government bonds—are now selling off these assets. They’re not doing it to make profits or to react to short-term market trends. They’re doing it because they have no choice. These insurers have long been seen as reliable holders of government debt , often ignoring price swings because they invest for the long haul. But rising interest rates and changing financial conditions have made that strategy too risky. They are now being forced to sell, not out of strategy, but out of necessity. Understanding the Duration Gap Problem This crisis starts with something called the “duration gap.” Simply put, this is the mismatch between how long insurers expect to hold assets like bonds and how quickly they may need to pay out liabilities. Japanese insurers typically hold long-term bonds—some lasting 10 to 30 years—but now, rising interest rates are making these holdings too dangerous. The value of long-term bonds drops sharply when interest rates rise, leaving insurers exposed to sudden losses. They’re being margin-wrecked —meaning their losses are so big they’re being forced to sell to protect their capital. Why Japan’s Bond Market Matters to the World This is not just a Japan issue. Japan is a major player in global finance , holding large amounts of U.S. and European government debt. Its institutions also play a big role in currency markets, especially in how they use Japanese yen (JPY) to invest in other countries. When they start pulling back, the effects are global: Yields (interest rates) on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) rise The Bank of Japan may have to act, or risk losing control The yen weakens, while the U.S. dollar strengthens Risky assets worldwide start to drop in value as money moves to safety The Last Safety Net Is Breaking For years, the world believed that government bonds were “safe” assets—things that never lose value and always have a buyer. That belief is now under pressure. Japanese life insurers were the last big investors who didn’t care about short-term losses , and now they do. Their sudden exit is a sign that even the most trusted part of the financial system is no longer stable. This is causing reactions like: Bigger price swings in U.S. government bonds More investment in gold and Bitcoin Less money flowing into riskier emerging markets Bitcoin’s Moment in the Spotlight When trusted financial systems start to show cracks, people look for alternatives. Assets like Bitcoin and gold—things that don’t rely on governments or interest rates—become attractive . Not because the world is ending, but because the idea of “safe” government bonds is being questioned. This is one of those rare moments when the financial world wakes up and realizes: what we believed to be stable may not be so after all.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/japanese-corporations-sell-bonds,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T09:51:08.000Z,"Is a Correction Coming for Bitcoin (BTC)? Here Are Analyst Views and Technical Data","Bitcoin Could Retreat to $100K, Technical Signals: Sign of Weakening Momentum According to technical analyst Omkar Godbole, the BTC price could rally outside the ascending channel and test the key support level at $100,000. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with the highest market value, was trading at $109,500 at the time of writing, according to Binance TR data, testing the ascending trend line stretching from $75,000 to above $110,000. According to TradingView data, price action has struggled to gain upward momentum over the past 24 hours. Despite reports that the Trump family-owned media company was planning to buy $3 billion worth of crypto, the market did not react strongly to this development. What Do Technical Indicators Say? Godbole noted that the 30-day rate of change (ROC), a key indicator measuring Bitcoin’s momentum, is showing a “distinctive negative divergence.” This indicator is indicating weakening momentum, with Bitcoin price forming lower highs, although it is still within an ascending channel. Another noteworthy signal is the MACD histogram. The transition of this indicator into the negative territory indicates a decrease in trend strength and that the upward movement may slow down. The combination of these technical developments means that Bitcoin could break out of the current ascending channel and retest the $100,000 psychological support level. Long-Term Outlook Still Positive Despite all these short-term risks, the overall outlook remains positive. In particular, the “golden cross” formed by the intersection of the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) indicates that the long-term uptrend continues. According to analysts, this short-term correction can be considered a healthy consolidation process and will not shake the foundations of the bull market. However, investors are advised to closely monitor technical indicators. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is a Correction Coming for Bitcoin (BTC)?

2025-05-27T09:48:12.000Z,"Michael Saylor Warns Against Institutional Proof-of-Reserves, Community Reacts","Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Bitcoin-focused firm Strategy, has raised serious concerns about the practice of institutions publicly sharing their crypto proof-of-reserves. Speaking at a side event during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 26, Saylor called the widely adopted transparency method “a bad idea.” Saylor was responding to a question from Blockware Solutions’ lead analyst Mitchell Askew, who asked whether Strategy would consider publishing its own proof-of-reserves . While Saylor did not provide a direct answer, he made it clear that he believes the practice is fundamentally flawed. “The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” he stated, adding that it weakens the overall security framework by making wallet addresses traceable. A Growing Industry Trend Post-FTX The push for proof-of-reserves gained momentum after the high-profile collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. In the wake of that event, many crypto firms — including Binance, Kraken, OKX, and Bitwise — began publishing cryptographic proof that they held enough assets to back customer deposits. The goal was to restore trust in the industry and assure users their funds were safe. But Saylor remains unconvinced. He pointed out that these proofs often only demonstrate what a company owns, not what it owes, offering an incomplete picture of its financial health. He also emphasized that publicizing wallet addresses opens the door to serious vulnerabilities. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses,” he said. “Go to AI, put it in deep think mode… it would write 50 pages of security problems.” Saylor: A Bitcoin Maximalist Saylor’s Strategy is currently the largest corporate Bitcoin holder , with 576,230 BTC worth around $62.6 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. The company is followed by MARA Holdings, which holds over 48,000 BTC. Globally, more than 110 publicly listed companies have Bitcoin on their balance sheets. While the crypto community continues to debate the merits of transparency versus security, Saylor’s stance signals a cautionary approach. For him, safeguarding digital assets means more than public accountability — it means keeping critical data private.

2025-05-27T09:41:00.000Z,"The '$300K Bitcoin Lottery' Grows Even Bigger as Traders Chase Upside – Time to Step Back?","Earlier this month, CoinDesk highlighted the rising demand for the Deribit-listed $300,000 bitcoin BTC call option, noting it as one of the most popular bullish plays for the all-important June quarter expiry. Now, this bet has become the most popular in the impending quarterly expiry, reinforcing its appeal as a \"" lottery ticket\"" for traders anticipating a bitcoin price rally above $300,000 by the end of the next month. At press time, the $300,000 call option was the most popular bet in the June 27 expiry, with a notional open interest of over $600 million, up from $484 million three weeks ago, according to data source Deribit. Notional open interest represents the dollar value of the number of active or open contracts at a given time. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC. \""The June $300K BTC call options have emerged as the strike with the highest open interest [in June expiry], reflecting aggressive speculative positioning by traders anticipating continued upside,\"" Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk. \""The combination of record-breaking volumes and concentrated options bets signals elevated market confidence—and the potential for heightened volatility ahead,\"" Chen added. Deribit's notional options open interest hit a record high of $42.5 billion last week. The momentum is mirrored in the platform’s newly launched block RFQ (Request for Quote) system, registering a historic record of nearly $1 billion in daily volume. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset, BTC, at a predefined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. The $300,000 call expiring on June 27 represents a bet that bitcoin's price will rise three times from the present $110,000 to over $300,000 by the end of the first half. The bet sounds outlandish, as the first half will end in roughly four weeks. But that's been the case lately on Deribit, with traders increasingly targeting upside potential through short-term options. That is evidenced by front-end risk reversals, measuring the demand for calls relative to puts over short-term, being pricier than those with longer maturities. The chart by Amberdata shows risk reversals are positive across the board, indicating a bias for bullish call options. However, short-duration calls are pricer than longer-duration ones. Usually, the opposite is the case. The trend indicates a heightened appetite for quick-paced bullish bets among market participants. \""The three-day Bitcoin Conference 2025 is all set to start in Las Vegas today, and so people are speculating on what new bullish announcements will be released at the event,\"" Chen explained. Contrarian signal The growing demand for short-duration calls could be a contrarian signal suggesting that speculative excess is often seen near market tops, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research. Thielen said the options market is flashing a warning, with the seven-day calls trading at a 10% premium to puts. \""The options market is flashing a warning: Bitcoin’s skew, measuring the difference in implied volatility between puts and calls, has dropped to nearly -10%, indicating calls are pricing in significantly more volatility than puts,\"" Thielen said in a note to clients. \""This suggests traders are aggressively chasing upside rather than hedging downside risk. In our experience, such extreme skew levels often reflect peak bullish sentiment, a classic contrarian signal,\"" Thielen added.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/27/the-usd300k-bitcoin-lottery-grows-even-bigger-as-traders-chase-upside-time-to-step-back,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Markets|market analysis|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare

The altcoins are slightly in the red on a daily scale, including the recent high-flyer HYPE, which has lost some steam after the latest ATH. BTC Back to $109.5K History was made last Wednesday when, after a few days of substantial volatility and rejection below the $107,000 level, the primary cryptocurrency managed to break through and shot past its January 2025 all-time high of around $109,100. The asset flew to $109,800 that day but was quickly stopped and driven south by around three grand. However, that correction was short-lived as the bulls resumed control of the market and initiated an even more impressive leg up on Thursday – the so-called Bitcoin Pizza Day. Back then, BTC skyrocketed to almost $112,000 to chart a fresh all-time high. Trump’s tariff recommendations against the EU on Friday brought some pain and uncertainty to the market, as BTC slipped back down to $107,500. However, it defended that level and stood just above it during the weekend. Bitcoin started to gain traction again on Monday and jumped to a daily high of $110,500 before it slumped to $107,500 later in the evening.

2025-05-27T09:36:48.000Z,"Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape","Blockchain.com is stepping up its presence in Africa, targeting markets where governments are beginning to implement crypto regulations. The UK-based exchange plans to open a physical office during the second quarter in Nigeria — its “fastest-growing market” in West Africa — along with broader expansion efforts in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, according to a May 27 report by Bloomberg. “Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa, reportedly said. The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion. Related: Hedera Africa Hackathon launches with $1M prize pool and Web3 focus Nigeria and Ghana lead in crypto regulation While cryptocurrency trading remains restricted in many African countries, some, including Nigeria and Ghana, are taking steps toward creating legal frameworks for exchanges. Odia said the company is prioritizing a license application in Nigeria, which recently enacted a new securities law covering digital assets. Ghana’s central bank released draft guidelines indicating plans to begin regulating crypto platforms by September 2025, while Kenya is still in the research phase. Crypto exchange blockchain.com.

The exchange sees the region’s youthful population and currency instability as factors fueling crypto adoption. Cointelegraph reached out to Blockchain.com for comment but did not receive a response by publication. Blockchain.com claims 37 million verified users, 92 million wallets and over $1 trillion in transaction volume, according to its website. In 2022, Blockchain.com closed a funding round that saw its valuation spike from $5.2 billion to $14 billion less than two months before the collapse of Do Kwon’s Terra ecosystem . However, a $110 million Series E financing round in 2023 more than halved its 2022 valuation Related: Ethiopia in the global Bitcoin mining spotlight: AMA with UMINERS South Africa leads in crypto race South Africa is emerging as a frontrunner in Africa’s crypto race, with the country positioning itself as a regional hub for digital assets.

In a September 2024 interview with Cointelegraph, Caselin emphasized that regulatory clarity is a major factor drawing both local and international players to South Africa.

Metaplanet is currently the most shorted stock in Japan, data shows, reflecting mounting skepticism among hedge funds over the company’s valuation and perceived NAV distortion. Currently trading at 1,116 yen, Metalpanet’s stock is up over 400% in the last six months and over 200% this month alone, fueled by the company’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy.. Often dubbed as ‘Japan’s Strategy,’ Metaplanet adopted a Bitcoin-first treasury strategy in 2024, which has contributed to its meteoric stock rally. Currently, the company holds 7,800 BTC, valued at over $850 million following its recent acquisition of 1,004 BTC earlier this month. Apparently Metaplanet is the most shorted stock in Japan. Do they really think betting against Bitcoin is a winning strategy? pic.twitter.com/SAKsOMO4MX — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) May 21, 2025 Japan’s Most Shorted Stock Metaplanet Continues to Rise Metaplanet’s distorted NAV has led to hedge fund managers questioning the sustainability of the company’s valuation. Despite being the most shorted stock in Japan, Metaplanet continues to climb, rising 15% today alone. As more investment vehicles offer exposure to Bitcoin, retail investors should be cautious about the risks and the often significant premiums they may be unknowingly paying. Japanese Retail Pours Into Metaplanet via Tax-Free NISA Accounts Metaplanet was the most purchased stock last week through NISA accounts at SBI Securities, Japan’s largest online brokerage, signaling surging retail demand for indirect Bitcoin exposure. Japanese investors are increasingly turning to the tax-free NISA investment scheme to gain access to Bitcoin upside without triggering capital gains taxes.

It points out that Bitcoin’s existing cryptographic protections— SHA-256 and ECDSA —are secure against classical computers but could be broken by quantum algorithms like Shor’s. This concern echoes the findings in NIST’s 2024 post-quantum cryptography standards . Adding urgency to this, Google’s recent breakthrough , led by Craig Gidney, shows that cracking RSA encryption could be possible with less than 1 million qubits , a sharp drop from earlier estimates of 20 million. As quantum computing advances, with IBM aiming for 100,000 qubits by 2033 , the crypto industry faces a shrinking timeline to adapt. The Bitcoin developer community is already aware of the threat. According to @21Mfacts on X, it’s possible to introduce quantum-resistant cryptography via soft forks , avoiding full network splits. Meanwhile, companies like SEALSQ are ahead of the curve, using NIST-approved algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium to secure blockchain systems—signaling that industry solutions are already taking shape.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/quantum-threat-looms-over-bitcoin-as-blackrock-google-raise-alarms,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FORKS","",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T09:20:38.000Z,"Hackers leak Solana co-founder Raj Gokal's personal ID","Hackers compromised the Instagram account of the hip-hop group Migos to leak Solana co-founder Raj Gokal’s passport, ID, address, phone number, wife’s details, and family pictures. The material is suspected to be KYC images, which raised questions about whether the source may be linked to a recent Coinbase data breach. The caption accompanying the doxxed information read, “You should’ve paid the 40 BTC,” suggesting an extortion attempt. The bio was also changed to “CHECK BIO FOR MEMECOIN” after the hack. Gokal’s accounts were reportedly socially engineered, and the attackers posted the materials via the hijacked Migos IG account after he refused to pay. Solana’s Gokal says hackers have been attempting to control his social media accounts TLDR >Raj got social engineered for access to an email account a few days ago >Attacker attempted to extort him with PII obtained from the account after but he didn’t pay >Same attacker compromised Migos Instagram account today >Attacker posted Raj’s PII from the Migos account — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) May 27, 2025 Last week, Solana’s Raj tweeted that attackers tried to gain control of his email and social media accounts. On May 27, hackers hijacked the Migos Instagram account, which has over 13 million followers, and leaked personal information about Solana co-founder and his wife in a blackmail attempt. The attackers demanded a ransom of 40 BTC (~$4.4 million) through posts that remained live for roughly 90 minutes, gaining thousands of interactions before being deleted. Experts like online sleuth ZachXBT believe phishing and social engineering were used in the breach and highlighted persistent security flaws on Instagram, mainly affecting inactive celebrity accounts. Meta is under fire for its slow response, prompting renewed calls for stronger security measures and quicker user support in hacking incidents. The Roll Up’s co-founders and host, Andy, claimed that the Migos had not posted anything since February 15th, 2024, adding that the incident was very unfortunate for Gokal and made IG policies against doxxing look weak so far. “Attackers have been trying to take control of my email, social media, Google, Apple, etc. this past week. If you see anything suspect (token launch, soliciting funds, etc) that means they got through. Be careful out there.” – Raj Gokal , Co-founder of Solana According to Andy, Instagram deleted the posts to cover up Gokal’s personal information as best as possible. Still, he added that there appeared to be a guy, “Arvind,” who also had their SOL balance leaked through the same Migos IG. Also, a link was posted to a Telegram group that appeared to be selling unreleased music. Coinbase discloses a months-long breach of data affecting 69.46K customers Coinbase disclosed last week that a months-long data breach resulted in the theft of personal and financial information from at least 69,461 customers, less than 1% of Coinbase’s monthly transacting users. The US-based crypto company’s filing said the breach dated back to December 26, 2024, and continued until earlier this month. Coinbase also faces an action lawsuit after its stock prices dipped because of the disclosure of data breaches. Plaintiffs claimed that Coinbase failed to disclose the breach on time, leading to a stock price dip. The breach occurred when cybercriminals used social engineering to bribe overseas customer support agents into stealing sensitive data from Coinbase systems. The company received an anonymous email from the hackers on May 11, which included a ransom demand for $20 million in exchange for not releasing the stolen information. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, responded to the incident by stating that the company had notified the DOJ and was working with other U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to pursue criminal charges against these bad actors. The U.S. Justice Department has since opened an investigation into the security breach. Coinbase clarified that some personal information was compromised, including names, contact details, masked Social Security numbers, and bank account information. However, no customer funds, passwords, private keys, or wallet access were affected. Additionally, the attackers did not gain access to hot or cold wallets. Coinbase Prime users were also not compromised. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-05-27T09:20:29.000Z,"Altcoin Season Coming? Here’s How to Turn $1K to $20K","The post Altcoin Season Coming? Here’s How to Turn $1K to $20K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With crypto markets heating gain and Bitcoin just hitting a new all-time high . Many people are now wondering, can $1,000 turn into $10K, $20K, or even more with crypto in 2025? George from CryptosRUS says it’s possible, but only if you’re smart about it. He recently shared his plan for 2025, including which coins to choose, when to buy, and what mistakes to avoid. Don’t Chase 100x Dreams Too Fast In a recent interview with Altcoin Daily, George laid out his thoughts on how newcomers can grow small investments without falling into risky traps. George started by saying it’s not realistic to expect a 100x return overnight. Trying too hard to turn $1,000 into $100,000 quickly often leads people into bad trades. Instead of gambling, he recommends aiming for steady gains and keeping your expectations in check. Don’t Ignore Bitcoin For someone just starting, George believes the best place to put most of your money is in pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. While many skip Bitcoin because it looks “too expensive,” to make real money, he sees it differently. He points out that even a 10x or 20x return is possible over a full cycle—which still turns $1K into $10K or $20K. Compared to traditional investments like stocks or bonds, crypto still wins on speed and return. Look Out for Meme Coins—but Be Smart George doesn’t dismiss meme coins . In fact, in previous cycles, he mentioned coins like Pepe that saw massive growth, 20x to 50x in some cases. However, he stresses that this space is tricky. Thousands of new meme coins launch daily, but only a tiny few go viral. Even popular ones like WIF, Bonk, or Pepe are currently down 50% or more from their peaks. His advice? Don’t jump into every new coin blindly. Instead, watch the market, look for momentum, and if the meme coin trend heats up again, then it might be time to take a chance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price to Hit $135K by July 2025 , Strategy Over Hype In the end, George suggests a simple plan: put a good portion into reliable names, likely Bitcoin and a few strong altcoins, and keep an eye on the market. If conditions improve and memes regain strength, shift some money into trending tokens. “$1,000 might not become $100K fast,” he said, “but turning it into $10K or $20K? That’s very possible—if you play it smart.” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-27T09:18:49.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Consolidates: Is $106,000 about to become strong horizontal support?","Bitcoin (BTC) is back above the $109,300 previous all-time high, which it surpassed on its way to the new all-time high of $112,000. After going back down as far as $106,600 over the last few days, Bitcoin is now consolidating above this level. Is this about to become good horizontal support and a springboard into the next stage of this bull market? Bond market under severe duress Cracks are opening in the global monetary system. Bond markets across the world are in disarray. In the US, buyers just cannot be found for longer duration bonds, and this is revealed in constantly rising 10, 20, and 30 year yields that just can’t seem to be kept down no matter what the US treasury does about it. The 10 year yield has dropped over the last few days from over 4.6% to 4.45%, but a higher high was put in, and this could be followed by a higher low, meaning that the trend could continue to go up. It might be argued that trust is the main element that is lacking in government bonds in these incredibly uncertain times, as more people begin to realise that governments are being forced to debase their currencies, thereby stealing the purchasing power of citizens, in order to be able to roll over the debt and keep the system going - albeit on life support. Bitcoin becoming more attractive It’s in this world that the Bitcoin life raft is floating. It has just surpassed both Amazon and Google to become the 5th biggest asset by market capitalization , at around $2.17 trillion. That said, there are still many across social and mainstream media platforms that would have us think that Bitcoin has made a market cycle top and that it’s generally downhill from here. With the greatest respect to many of these detractors who undoubtedly do have sound economic credentials, why would investors sell their Bitcoin now into fiat currency? Fiat is the problem - not Bitcoin. Fiat can be magicked into existence in the blink of an eye - Bitcoin cannot. This gives Bitcoin an attraction that puts it in the same category as gold, although more gold can be dug out of the ground to boost its supply. $BTC short-term chart Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows that the $106,000 horizontal support (orange line) has been well respected. The previous all-time high resistance (blue line) is now in the process of being flipped into support. If the bulls are successful in doing this it would likely only be a matter of time before a new all-time high is made, and a more sustained surge takes the price to higher levels. The importance of the $106,000 horizontal support Source: TradingView The daily chart shows just how important the $106,000 horizontal level has become. It rests on some of the daily candle tops of the big bull flag, and this support is also noticeable in recent price action. It may be that the bulls aren’t ready to make their move higher yet, and there could be some more sideways price action that tests this strong support base. Having said that, if the current resistance does become support, we would perhaps be more likely to see upwards price action from here. Of course, there is also the possibility of a negative or positive catalyst that spurs the price in one direction or the other. Bitcoin is the life raft out of the system Nevertheless, asset prices are imaginably going to rise from here, benefitting from the amount of money printing or other methods that introduce more liquidity into the system. Ready to climb higher into the final stage of a cycle that could be about to increase in duration, Bitcoin is the soundest money out there. If central banks are buying gold, it means that trust in the monetary system is dwindling. Buying Bitcoin is your life raft out of this system.

2025-05-27T09:16:28.000Z,"Thailand Unlocks Crypto Payments for Tourists Without Impacting Local Currency","The post Thailand Unlocks Crypto Payments for Tourists Without Impacting Local Currency appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Thailand is stepping into the crypto spotlight , with fresh plans to let tourists spend cryptocurrencies during their visit, all while pushing forward a regulatory revamp of its financial sector. As per the local media report , Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira unveiled the country’s bold new direction at a May 26 investment seminar in Bangkok. The best part of this plan is that it will not impact the local currency, and no one knows that the user paid in crypto. It’s indeed a great initiative since many foreign nationals were in favour of this innovative move. Crypto Spending Without the Hassle Thailand, to attract tourists, will soon allow them to link their crypto holdings to credit card platforms for seamless spending. In this model, users pay in crypto, but merchants receive Thai baht, often without knowing crypto was used. This clever setup minimizes risks to the domestic currency and could be rolled out quickly, pending infrastructure and regulatory readiness. Sweeping Financial Reforms Coming Alongside the crypto tourism push, Thailand is reviewing outdated laws that separate the traditional capital markets and digital assets. Pichai emphasized the need for a unified legal framework and fewer restrictions on institutional investors like life insurers, who are currently limited to low-risk government bonds. Upcoming reforms may let them invest more freely in equities and private assets. To enhance enforcement and market fairness, a draft law is being prepared to expand the Thai SEC’s authority, allowing it to take major cases straight to prosecutors. The government is also eyeing tighter rules on high-frequency trading and reforms around treasury stocks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Goes All In on Bitcoin Mining With 2,000MW Energy Move , Pichai Backs Blockchain Innovation Pichai reiterated his support for digital assets, highlighting the upcoming launch of blockchain-based “G-Tokens” that will allow retail investors to buy fractional government bonds. This follows Thailand’s move to greenlight stablecoins like USDT and USDC for crypto trades and plans to launch tokenized securities for institutional players. With these moves, Thailand is signaling its intent to become a crypto-forward destination while modernizing its financial landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-27T09:15:24.000Z,"Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Says Hyperinflation Has Arrived, Predicts ‘Millions, Young and Old’ To Be Wiped Out Financially","Best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki says that the US is about to experience out-of-control inflation that will have devastating impacts on personal wealth. In a post on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author tells his 2.7 million followers that a sudden lack of demand for US bonds is resulting in money printing, which debases the dollar. “The end is here: what if you threw a party and no one showed up? That is what happened [May 20th]. The Fed held an auction for US Bonds and no one showed up. So the Fed quietly bought $50 billion of its own fake money with fake money. The party is over. Hyperinflation is here. Millions, young and old to be wiped out financially.” Kiyosaki also says that silver, gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ) are a hedge against rising inflation, and he predicts massive price targets for the assets as a result. “Good news. Gold will go to $25,000. Silver to $70. Bitcoin to $500,000 to $1 million… The end I have been warning the world about is here. May God have mercy on our souls.” Lastly, he says that the dwindling supply of available BTC for sale will drive the flagship crypto asset’s price higher. “I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich, so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years – and maybe make you very rich. Sure, Bitcoin goes up and down, but so does real life.

2025-05-27T09:12:25.000Z,"Metaplanet: A Possible Meme-Powered Bitcoin Bet","Summary Metaplanet writes put options to buy Bitcoin, in addition to raising considerable cash from equity and debt sources - Japanese debt is cheap. The stock has surged due to short squeezes and meme-stock dynamics in the latest days as the company continues to \""aggressively\"" accumulate Bitcoin and adopt a meme-stock character. Ultimately, it's a public listing that could be enhanced by short squeezes as it's heavily shorted, but Bitcoin underlies it, and it is already extremely volatile. Discussing a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) levered play like Tokyo-based Metaplanet Inc. ( MTPLF ) is not in the norm for us, but it has been hit by some interesting dynamics a little bit unique to a Japanese issue. There has been a short squeeze as the company adopts some meme-stock trading characteristics, and its exceptional short selling ratios has meant a squeeze has been in with a major scarcity of stocks available across the illiquid US listing and the Japanese listing that further rocketed the shares. It gained almost 200% since late April, moving up by a multiple of BTC's rise in that period, prior to that mostly trading in line with BTC. The company pivoted into this Bitcoin strategy recently, and we will say right away we have no interest in the company. They are raising major funds to speculate on Bitcoin, and their income generating strategies will to a significant degree be driven by selling put options. They may be hedging, but we couldn't find any disclosure to that effect. They did say they were cash collateralised in their option writing strategy at least. Of course, they hold massive amounts of Bitcoin, an asset whose long-term viability we seriously question, and their operating business also depends on Bitcoin going up it would seem, something we aren't going to bet on. Breakdown As far as we understood, the company is employing an all in strategy on Bitcoin. Initially, the business was focused on a hotel location in central Tokyo and also something in Hiroshima, doing hospitality, but then one day they decided that on the conviction that Bitcoin is somehow going to be the future, they would raise considerable amounts of cash, around 40 billion JPY it would seem in equity based on the balance sheet , and also some debt it would seem though they've repaid some of it, cumulatively raising around 80 billion JPY, with a plan of putting it into Bitcoin. Additionally, they have a \"" treasury management \"" business which is basically dominated by selling put options that are \""cash collateralised\"" also on Bitcoin. They hold around 51 billion JPY in Bitcoin as of the quarterly figures, around 90% of the company's total assets. Though now it would seem that have over 100 billion JPY in Bitcoin . They seem to have gotten into this already from the beginning of 2024 when they started to purchase Bitcoin. Segment Results (Q1 Earnings) The majority of their earnings at this point at the operating level, before accounting for the impact of gains on Bitcoin, are now from the Bitcoin income generation strategy. The ordinary income contains the gains they are making on Bitcoin, which they are accumulating \""aggressively\"" and as a long-term investment. In other words, Metaplanet is a Bitcoin bet, a bit like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). Metaplanet is one of the largest public holders of Bitcoin in the world. Comments There are some advantages to Metaplanet: There are some tax advantages in investing in Metaplanet as opposed to directly in Bitcoin, but this only seems to apply to Japanese tax residents. The fact that they can raise capital, particularly from debtors but also from shareholders despite the NAV premium, is very good for prior shareholders. Debt capital is also very cheap in Japan. Despite Metaplanet's employment of leverage, investors in Metaplanet are limited in liability by virtue of it being a public limited company, provided investors aren't using leverage to invest in the stock. It is highly shorted , meaning short squeezes are possible with stock to cover shorts possibly becoming suddenly very scarce, and this could become a new majorly followed meme stock. With the TSE circuit breakers kicking in frequently with it is also causes covering to be harassed. It is the most shorted stock in Japan as of a few days ago. But then there are clearly some major questions: There is no track record, yet the company is filling their presentations with data about how they're the best performing stock in the Japanese market, dominated mainly by industrial auto names and other slow movers (not as big of an accomplishment). Similarly, we don't really have much information on their income generating strategy other than that they are writing put options, which of course could one day go very badly for them. At least it's cash collateralised, which we'll take to mean they are not employing a lot of leverage. We entirely question the viability of Bitcoin. Other than the obvious, which is that it's very volatile (not a good store of value), mining is very energy and relatively time intensive, and it's not a practical currency especially compared to more reasonably managed fiat currencies, we also doubt the validity of the decentralisation principle which is at the centre of Bitcoin. In short, pool mining is the only logical way to go about finding nonces in a proof of work system. This means that coordinated miners are essentially causing centralisation , and pool mining has to be administrated by some entity. These could be compromised or may already be compromised. It's a vulnerability, and the more threatening Bitcoin becomes as an alternative to fiat, the more likely this vulnerability will be exploited if possible - though this risk is remote. It trades above NAV consistently. Currently, it is trading at multiples of its approximate NAV (around 100 billion JPY in Bitcoin, but market CAP is around 580 bn) Bottom Line As far as Metaplanet is concerned, while it may be interesting as an enhanced Bitcoin play in the event of a short squeeze, also because if it becomes used as a speculative tool to trade Bitcoin on the public markets at key moments shares will become especially scarce and buyers can also worsen squeezes by competing for shares looking to be used for cover, it is ultimately a newfangled Bitcoin play. You have to want to own Bitcoin to be interested in Metaplanet. If it becomes a meme stock, it may rocket, but it will also become incredibly volatile. We're not touching it.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790038-metaplanet-a-possible-meme-powered-bitcoin-bet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","MTPLF",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T09:09:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Supporter Michael Saylor Says Publishing Proof of Reserves Could Be Risky for Investors! Here Are the Details","Bitcoin advocate and Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) executive chairman Michael Saylor called the approach “a bad idea” because publishing institutional-grade on-chain proofs of reserves could pose serious security risks. Michael Saylor: “Proof-of-Reserve Chain Threatens Corporate Security” “The conventional way of issuing proof of reserves today is actually insecure,” Saylor said at a side event at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. “This method undermines the security of the issuer, the custodian, the exchanges and the investors. This is not a good idea, on the contrary, it is a bad idea,” he said. Saylor declined to directly respond to Blockware Solutions principal analyst Mitchell Askew’s question about whether Strategy would publish its own proof of reserves. “Publishing Wallet Addresses Puts Company Security at Risk” Cryptocurrency exchanges and ETF issuers have started publishing proof of reserves to ensure transparency and show that user assets are actually available, especially after the collapse of FTX in 2022. Major players such as Binance, Kraken, OKX, and Bitwise have adopted this method. However, Saylor argued that this practice offered one-way transparency, emphasizing that it only showed the assets held by the company and not its liabilities, that is, its debts. Saylor also noted that publishing wallet addresses openly would leave organizations open to cyberattacks, adding, “Ask an AI, ‘How would publishing all wallet addresses compromise company security over time?’ It will give you 50 pages of security risks.” Strategy is currently the world’s largest institutional Bitcoin holder with 576,230 Bitcoins. The company’s reserves are worth around $62.6 billion. It is followed by mining company MARA Holdings with 48,137 Bitcoins. Today, more than 110 publicly traded companies around the world hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. But according to Saylor, not every practice implemented in the name of transparency, especially methods such as onchain proof of reserve, aligns with the basic principles of corporate security. *This is not investment advice.

According to Lookonchain , a trader identified by the wallet address 0x2258 has recently netted $5.6 million in just three days by taking the opposite side of James Wynn ’s positions — shorting when Wynn went long, and longing when Wynn shorted. On May 24, 0x2258 began shorting both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) just as Wynn opened a long position on BTC. The next day, when Wynn closed his BTC long, 0x2258 closed his short for a $1.36 million profit. Later on May 25, as Wynn flipped from long to short, opening a BTC short position, 0x2258 reversed his stance again and opened long positions in BTC and ETH. On May 26, when Wynn exited his short position, the counter-trader closed his long, netting an additional $2.54 million. That same day, Wynn re-entered a long position on BTC, prompting 0x2258 to short BTC and ETH again, accumulating an unrealized profit of $1.7 million at the time of reporting by Lookonchain. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1927212551009398999 You might also like: From PEPE to Billions: meet crypto’s boldest whale James Wynn 0x2258’s trading behavior has sparked speculation on X that the wallet could somehow be linked to Wynn himself.

2025-05-27T09:04:03.000Z,"Here’s What Could Send Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price to $0.01","Shiba Inu continues to generate attention in the cryptocurrency space, especially with growing speculation that the token could eventually reach a price of $0.01. While this goal remains controversial, a combination of strategic factors may support its long-term potential. Can SHIB Realistically Reach $0.01? The debate over SHIB hitting the $0.01 mark has divided analysts and investors. The token’s massive supply, currently around 589.5 trillion, poses a significant hurdle. If SHIB were to reach $0.01 with this supply intact, it would result in a market capitalization close to $5.89 trillion, far exceeding Bitcoin’s current valuation and surpassing the market cap of many global assets. Despite this, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, Lucie, has suggested the target is not impossible, though she cautioned that reaching it will take time. Similarly, community figure Luis Delgado (known as Del Crxpto) argued that the unpredictability of the crypto market makes such outcomes feasible. Changelly analysts have also weighed in, predicting that the $0.01 milestone could be achieved by 2040. What Could Help SHIB Reach This Target? Achieving a $0.01 price point would require major shifts across various dimensions, including token supply, market demand, and adoption. Supply Reduction Through Token Burns One of the most practical strategies involves lowering the circulating supply through token burns. This means sending tokens to addresses where they can no longer be accessed or used. These burns can be driven by the SHIB community, the Shibarium network, or cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase using transaction fees. A significant decrease in supply would reduce the market cap needed to hit higher price points. For instance, if SHIB’s total supply were cut to 50 trillion, a price of $0.01 would imply a $500 billion market cap, and more attainable compared to its current scenario. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin and Market-Wide Growth Shiba Inu’s performance has historically mirrored Bitcoin’s trends. Data shows that SHIB’s price has tracked closely with BTC over the past few months, reflecting an 87% correlation rate. If Bitcoin reaches $1 million in the future, it would likely lead to a sharp rise in overall market capitalization, lifting altcoins like SHIB higher. SHIB has also demonstrated a tendency to outperform BTC during strong market rallies. Utility Expansion and Ecosystem Development Wider adoption of SHIB as a payment method could also fuel demand. Integration with global platforms such as Amazon, Shopify, Uber, and Netflix would create real-world use cases, improving the token’s long-term prospects. Additionally, the growth of the ecosystem through DeFi usage, gaming projects, Web3 tools, and Shibarium transaction activity may support upward price pressure by increasing utility and driving token burns. Influence of Social and Media Momentum Public figures and media exposure continue to help the trajectory of meme coins. Although Elon Musk has not endorsed SHIB, a change in stance from influential personalities could rapidly increase interest. Furthermore, media attention during bullish phases has historically contributed to large inflows into speculative assets like SHIB. While the token reaching $0.01 remains uncertain and would require major structural shifts, it is not entirely impossible.

2025-05-27T09:03:47.000Z,"Crypto-linked kidnapping cases in France lead to arrests of over 12, including minors","Over 12 suspects, including minors, have been taken into custody by French police in connection with recent crypto-related kidnapping cases in Paris. A report from local media claims that the arrests were carried out on the morning of 27 May by the Brigade de Répression du Banditisme (BRB), France’s specialised anti-gang unit. The suspects, including several minors, were detained in coordinated operations across Île-de-France and Loire-Atlantique with assistance from other police units. Authorities believe the two high-profile kidnapping attempts , one involving the father of a crypto entrepreneur and another targeting the daughter of a crypto exchange CEO, are linked. Investigators suspect the involvement of a larger criminal organisation that allegedly recruited operatives via social media platforms to execute the abductions. The first case, which occurred on 1 May, involved the kidnapping of the father of a wealthy poker streamer and cryptocurrency investor. The victim was abducted by four masked men using a stolen van disguised with a fake UPS logo. The kidnappers reportedly demanded a ransom of €5 to €7 million in cryptocurrency. To pressure the victim’s son, they mutilated the father by severing a finger and filming the act. He was eventually rescued by police during a raid in Palaiseau, south of Paris.

The woman, later identified as the daughter of Pierre Noizat, CEO and co-founder of crypto exchange Paymium, managed to escape with the help of bystanders, including her partner, who was physically assaulted during the struggle. The assailants fled the scene in a van branded with Chronopost markings. So far, six individuals have been charged and remanded in custody in connection with the first case. Those arrested are reportedly young and were recruited specifically for the operation. In the second case, arrests had not been made until this latest sweep. As previously reported by crypto.news, the French Interior Ministry has since stepped up protection measures for prominent crypto executives and their families. France has become the epicentre of a growing wave of crypto-targeted violence, with at least six such incidents recorded this year alone. The trend follows the January kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland , who was tortured during a ransom attempt involving €10 million in crypto.

Related Reading: Avalanche Slides Off The Edge – What Comes After The 4H Trendline Snap? Bitcoin Starts Second Price Discovery Uptrend Last week, Bitcoin’s momentum propelled its price to its new all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 before retracing to its current range. Over the weekend, Bitcoin confirmed its breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend, following its successful retest of the $104,500 mark as support. The cryptocurrency has been in a significant market recovery for over a month, rallying nearly 50% from April lows. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that BTC ended its downside deviation period and positioned itself for a retest of its key re-accumulation range during early May’s surge, which was successfully reclaimed and surpassed. The analyst considers that its new Price Discovery Uptrend has “only just begun,” as Bitcoin starts Week 2 of this phase. Rekt Capital highlighted that this cycle has been “a story of Re-Accumulation Ranges,” which signals that a new range will likely form after this Price Discovery. Meanwhile, history suggests a second Price Discovery Correction is ahead as Bitcoin transitions into its new Price Discovery Uptrend. During its future correction, BTC will likely retrace between 25%-35% “to produce yet another Downside Deviation below the Re-Accumulation Range Low (future orange circle) before resuming upside into a likely Price Discovery Uptrend 3.” In the meantime, “All Bitcoin needs to do is hold above the Re-accumulation Range High of $104,500” to continue its price discovery rally. $110,000 Breakout Next? Notably, the flagship crypto has been retesting the range high as support over the past two weeks, confirming the breakout. As such, dipping into the previous $92,000-$104,500 range’s upper zone could happen as “part of normal volatility.” Moreover, it turned another key resistance, the $102,500 mark, into support during this period, which it had previously been rejected from in January 2025. With these levels as support, Rekt Capital considers that only the December 2024 and January 2025 upwicks, at $108,353 and $109,588, stand in the way of additional Price Discovery. Trader Daan Crypto Trades noted that Bitcoin is “still strong but fighting around its previous all-time high from earlier this year.” He pointed out that price action looks “very choppy” in the lower timeframes, but it shouldn’t be concerning for investors if the price remains within its current range. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip? Analyst MacroCRG affirmed that Bitcoin must officially reclaim the $110,000 level to continue its rally, as it marks the previous ATH and the Value Area High (VAH) from last week. “Acceptance above and we likely squeeze straight into price discovery again,” CRG stated. Currently, Bitcoin is retesting its Weekly opening of $109,004 as support, which could set the stage for a breakout above the $110,000 mark if held. Meanwhile, rejection from this area could send BTC price to the $106,000-$108,000 area. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $109,181, a 1.4% increase in the daily timeframe.

The plan includes $2 billion from new equity and $1 billion through a convertible bond, according to sources familiar with the move. The announcement could align with a major crypto event in Las Vegas, where high-profile figures like Vice President JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and crypto advisor David Sacks are expected to attend. While TMTG denied the credibility of the Financial Times' sources, they did not provide any further comment. This development underscores Trump’s growing commitment to making the U.S. a global crypto leader , a stance that has raised ethical questions given his family's direct financial involvement in the space. The company has drawn comparisons to MicroStrategy, which used a similar strategy of leveraging capital to accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin. TMTG’s shares closed last week at $25.72, giving it a market cap close to $6 billion. Like MicroStrategy, the media group plans to use at-the-market pricing for its share offering. The increased offering size is reportedly due to high investor interest. Beyond Bitcoin, the Trump family has launched NFT trading cards, backed memecoins, and invested in ventures like American Bitcoin (a crypto miner) and World Liberty Financial (a stablecoin platform). There are also plans to launch a crypto-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) . Just last week, Trump hosted a private dinner for top investors in his memecoin at his resort near Washington. The move follows Trump’s decision to transfer his majority stake in TMTG—valued at around $3 billion—into a trust controlled by his son Donald Jr., giving him full control over investment decisions. The crypto sector has seen rising momentum, with Bitcoin recently surpassing $109,000 , and other major deals like Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage Hidden Road.

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.“This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai, noting that the model avoids using the Thai baht directly, reducing risks to the domestic currency.Related: Crypto exchange KuCoin enters crowded Thailand marketCapital markets regulation under reviewBeyond enabling crypto use for tourism, Thailand is also planning a reform of its financial laws.

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world.Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added. On May 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta was delaying the rollout of its flagship AI LLM, Llama 4 “Behemoth.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-ai-boss-ai-lacks-intelligent-behavior-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days.Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her.The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.”CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit.Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer.Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody.He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28.Alleged victim shares ordealTeofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.”Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase.

2025-05-27T01:15:00.000Z,"Bitlayer secures 31.5% of Bitcoin&#039;s hashrate to bring smart contracts to BTC","Bitlayer’s Bitcoin smart-contract system is being implemented by mining pools behind 31.5% of the network’s hashrate, a development that will help ensure that its system will operate on the Bitcoin blockchain, the company said.According to a May 27 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Bitlayer’s BitVM implementation will be supported by major Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools including Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool. Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

As a result, any optimism stemming from the delayed US–EU tariffs may be tempered by ongoing concerns surrounding US government debt and the threat of a potential economic recession. The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Since then, SOL has struggled to break above $180, but onchain and technical data still suggest further gains are in store for the altcoin. Can SOL follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps and hit all-time highs above $300?Solana’s TVL up 54% since April 7The total value locked (TVL) on the Solana blockchain has increased by over 54% to $9.44 billion on May 26 from multimonth lows of $6.12 billion reached on April 7.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption.

In May, such tokens totaled $4.9 billion.  Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures. The data shows that $1.4 billion in tokens will be released through a “cliff unlock,” while $1.9 billion will be emitted through a “linear unlock.” Cliff unlocks release a large portion or all of the vested tokens simultaneously, while linear unlocks emit crypto assets gradually. Largest crypto token unlocks in JuneAmong the largest token unlocks in June is Metars Genesis (MRS), a non-fungible token (NFT) project that will release $193 million worth of tokens on June 21 to fund an artificial intelligence partnership. Since March, MRS has released 10 million tokens per month, with nearly $1 billion in tokens unlocked so far.Sui (SUI) is scheduled to unlock 44 million tokens worth about $160 million on June 1. The tokens will go to the Mysten Labs treasury, early contributors and the community reserve. The largest portion, valued at more than $70 million, is allocated to Series B investors.To date, Sui has unlocked 3.3 billion tokens valued at over $12 billion, roughly 33% of its total supply.

Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.Source: Cyvers AlertZero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023.Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain cryptoAdvanced form of address poisoningA zero-value transfer is considered an evolution of address poisoning, a tactic where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that resembles a victim’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. Custom addresses with similar starting and ending characters can also be combined with zero-value transfers.Related: Industry exec sounds alarm on Ledger phishing letter delivered by USPSThreat growing across blockchainsA January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024.

After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
