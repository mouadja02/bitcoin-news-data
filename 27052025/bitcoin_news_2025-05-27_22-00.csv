2025-05-27T20:00:00.000Z,"67,947 Americans Warned as US City Data Breach May Have Exposed Names, Dates of Birth, Social Security Numbers and More","A cybersecurity incident has compromised the sensitive personal information of tens of thousands of Americans, leaving them exposed to fraud or identity theft. In a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the City of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, says it discovered a serious breach affecting 67,947 Americans. The law firm representing the Sheboygan city government, Constangy, Brooks, Smith and Prophete, LLP, says that “data stored on a segment of the city’s network may have been accessed or acquired without authorization.” The law firm says that a city investigation revealed individuals’ personal information may have been stolen, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, license plate or vehicle ID numbers, and drivers’ license or state ID numbers. “On October 31, 2024, the city experienced an encryption event that resulted in a network disruption. Upon discovering the incident, it swiftly took steps to secure its digital environment. It also engaged a digital forensics and incident response firm to conduct an investigation to determine whether any data may have been affected… Following a comprehensive and thorough review of the data involved, the city learned on May 14, 2025, that certain individuals’ personal information was affected by this incident.” The law firm says letters of notification were sent to those affected to inform them about the data breach, while offering free identity protection services to victims whose Social Security numbers were stolen. For now, the law firm says the Sheboygan city government is currently implementing enhanced security protocols to mitigate the risk of another data breach.

According to a new Bloomberg report, PME says US money managers are allegedly risking significant business by “caving into pressures” from President Donald Trump’s administration by abandoning basic principles of responsible investing. Says Daan Spaargaren, PME’s senior strategist for responsible investing, “[US money managers] aren’t condemning what Trump is doing and how he is operating and how he is handling issues like climate change and demolishing the judiciary. We are worried about that.” The PME warns America’s investment industry that a Trump capitulation is prompting it to think twice about its US investments. The PME is reconsidering its $5.7 billion mandate with BlackRock Inc., after the world’s largest asset manager withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. A decision from PME is expected within weeks. Spaargaren says Trump’s actions that are raising concerns include attacking judges, countering America’s move to cleaner energies and the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. “[If asset managers] align their interests and their policies with the current administration in the US, then we are legitimizing also these steps and these practices by offering them our funds.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-27T19:43:07.000Z,"Bitcoin faces key support test at $108k amid $211m in liquidations: analysts","Bitunix analysts have highlighted the latest data on crypto liquidations near the $108,000 support zone, warning that more liquidations could follow if Bitcoin breaks below this level. Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent volatility has created a notable liquidation pocket, analysts at crypto exchange Bitunix told crypto.news. On Tuesday, May 27, total crypto liquidations reached $211 million, with a clear bias toward long positions. Specifically, $131 million in longs were liquidated, compared to $79.84 million in short positions. Bitunix analysts interpret this imbalance as evidence of a long-side wipeout during Bitcoin’s recent dip to $108,000. As a result, they caution against entering overly aggressive long positions while BTC trades near this key support. “Short-term attention should be paid to the effect of support at $108,500–$109,000, and it is not recommended to chase higher. Analysts advise observing whether the $110,800–$112,000 pressure band is effectively broken before considering further positions,” Bitunix wrote.

2025-05-27T19:31:00.000Z,"Is a Massive XRP Move Coming? Futures Say Yes, Charts Say “Any Minute Now” (XRP Price Prediction)","XRP (XRP) has dipped by 1% over the past week, consolidating below $2.60 — but rising futures activity could change that soon, raising bullish XRP price prediction hopes. Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have gone up slightly by 8.4% and currently stand at $2.2 billion as Bitcoin (BTC) seems determined to retest its latest all-time high of nearly $112,000. Even though the token’s price action has been relatively calm, the futures market has been quite active, according to data from CoinGlass . Open interest in XRP futures across top exchanges have increased since May 7 from $3.6 billion to $4.8 billion – a 29.7% increase in less than a month. However, during this period, the price has gone up by just 8.5% from $2.13 to $2.31. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Drop to $2 Before Rising to a New All-Time High XRP’s daily chart shows that the price has broken its bullish structure and has already retested this former support from below. This is a bearish indication in the near term but not necessarily a sign of an impending collapse as the market needs to raise liquidity for the next leg up. The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) seems like the most plausible landing zone for XRP as it coincides with a key psychological level at $2 per token. It is highly likely that bears will push the price to this threshold to unlock additional liquidity in the next few days to catalyze a pronounced move. In bull markets, short squeezes tend to be one of the most effective ways to propel the price of an asset higher. Hence, a break below $2 could be what the token needs to recapture buyers’ interest and support a bullish XRP price prediction to $3 at least. Patient investors and traders will benefit the most if they wait for the best entry, which is probably the $2 level. In the mean time, as Bitcoin reaches $110,000, the first milestone of a crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) could soon be hit and, with it, an attractive reward for token holders will be unlocked. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Pays Out Bitcoin to Holders BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is an innovative meme coin presale that introduces a reward mechanism tied to the performance of the top crypto – Bitcoin. Rewards are distributed to token holders every time that BTC reaches a new price milestone, the first of which sits at $125,000. Once the price gets to that level, a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. This will foster scarcity and should result in an immediate uptick in its price. Next up, once the price reaches $125K, token holders will receive a direct airdrop of Bitcoin tokens. This system repeats every time that BTC adds $25,000 more to its price, starting at a baseline of $100K. To start earning passive income through BTCBULL, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

2025-05-27T19:20:36.000Z,"Bitcoin price held up by corporate adoption and ‘inflation hedge’ narratives","Key takeaways: Institutional investor demand and corporate adoption may push Bitcoin higher despite recession fears. Investors’ belief that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates favors Bitcoin price upside. Stock markets around the world responded positively to the temporary suspension of import tariffs between the United States and the European Union, with the S&P 500 rising 1.5% on May 27. However, concerns over a global economic recession persist, capping Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) upside, especially since the baseline US import rates have been raised for most regions. Bitcoin remains antifragile and poised to outperform in uncertain times Given the growing investor uncertainty about economic conditions, Bitcoin hovering around the $110,000 level has taken investors by surprise as it consolidates the top-6 position as a global tradable asset by market capitalization. Investors now ask whether Bitcoin is becoming antifragile or if a drop below $100,000 is inevitable in a recessionary environment. Traders currently estimate a 41% chance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will maintain interest rates through September, a steep rise from just 2% one month ago. CME FEDWatch target rate probabilities. Source: CME Normally, a higher cost for capital is bearish for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. However, in this context, it also suggests potential liquidity injections from the Fed, given the unfavorable US fiscal outlook , where government spending exceeds revenue capacity. US President Donald Trump has called for lower interest rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious due to a strong labor market and rising inflation pressures, whether driven by tariffs or easy credit conditions. This tension helps explain why the S&P 500 has struggled to retake its February all-time high of 6,147 and why Bitcoin’s upside has also been limited. Bitcoin’s current market capitalization of $2.2 trillion now exceeds that of Google and Meta, which partially explains the $112,000 resistance level. Still, it would be inaccurate to suggest Bitcoin has decoupled from traditional markets; its 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has remained above 70% over the past four weeks. As such, if equities enter a bear market, Bitcoin is likely to face downside as well. 30-day correlation: Bitcoin/USD vs. S&P 500 futures. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Companies are currently reporting earnings for the first quarter, a period that predates the escalation of the trade war. As a result, the stock market may take longer to reflect the full negative impact, even as macroeconomic indicators show signs of contraction. The 6.3% drop in US durable goods orders in April, reported on May 27, could be the first signal of a weakening economy. US durable goods–new orders for April. Source: US Census Bureau However, even if corporate earnings for the first quarter fall short of expectations, this does not automatically mean the S&P 500 will suffer significantly. In fact, disappointing results could open the door for faster interest rate cuts, which tend to benefit companies by lowering financing costs and potentially stimulating consumer demand. Bitcoin's appeal as a strategic asset grows, Trump Media joins the party Bitcoin’s risk profile appears to have improved after Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans to acquire BTC following a $2.5 billion mix of debt and equity financing. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom,” Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said, according to Reuters. This development suggests that Bitcoin’s trajectory toward $112,000 is not solely tied to broader economic growth. Related: Bitcoin stalls at $110K but institutional investors continue gobbling up BTC The growing institutional and corporate interest in Bitcoin adds a new dimension to its market behavior. While macroeconomic trends and correlations with traditional assets still matter, Bitcoin is increasingly being framed as a strategic asset with utility beyond speculation. As such, its performance could diverge, at least partially, from that of equities, especially as adoption broadens among influential companies and investors. While the stock market may remain sensitive to macro data and earnings surprises, Bitcoin’s upside potential appears to rest on a mix of monetary policy, institutional positioning, and its emerging role as a hedge against systemic financial risk.

KindlyMD’s move to buy 21 Bitcoin ( BTC ) comes a few weeks after David Bailey, the chief executive officer of BTC Inc., and crypto advisor of U.S. president Donald Trump, announced the launch of Nakamoto Holdings.

KindlyMD is a Nasdaq-listed integrated healthcare and healthcare data company looking to become the next Strategy. With its initial BTC purchase, KindlyMD says its on the path to making this quest a reality. The purchase of 21 BTC was completed at an average price of $109,027 per coin, representing a $2.3 million investment. Funds came from gross proceeds of $8.7 million raised through recent warrant exercises. “KindlyMD chose 21 BTC, which is one millionth of the total supply of bitcoin, as a symbolic first step on our journey to be the leading Bitcoin treasury strategy,” Bailey said. “There are many more milestones ahead and we can’t wait to continue to execute our roadmap with KindlyMD.” You might also like: Strive announces $750m private investment to buy Bitcoin Nakamoto Holdings’ launch followed Bailey’s $300 million raise in equity and convertible debt earlier this year.

2025-05-27T19:15:17.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Mega Rally Has Stalled: What’s Next? What Are the Key Levels?","Cryptocurrency analysis company MakroVision stated in its latest technical analysis report that Bitcoin continues its upward trend. The report stated that the leading cryptocurrency broke the $ 102,000 resistance and then surpassed the first extension target at $ 107,365. According to the analysis, Bitcoin is currently moving towards a new liquidity zone at around $ 112,500. MakroVision states that this rise is technically healthy and has a controlled structure. According to the analysis, the rally that started above $ 102,000 has an impulsive structure, while the pullbacks have been short-lived and limited so far. This shows that the market is still driven by buyers and the upward dynamics continue strongly. Related News: Google Publishes Scientific Paper That Could Change What We Know About Bitcoin: “20 Times Easier to Break Than Previously Thought” The first significant resistance level against Bitcoin stands out as $111,200. This level is notable because it is both a Fibonacci 0.618 extension point and a region of intense liquidity. If this level is broken to the upside, analysts consider $121,100 as the next target. This point is seen as a 1.236 extension target on the larger time frame. On the other hand, some critical support levels that investors should follow in case of a possible pullback were also included in the analysis. While it is stated that $ 107,365 works as support in the short term, the $ 106,455 level stands out as a stronger and strategic support area. It is also stated that as long as it remains above $ 102,000, the general technical structure is not disrupted and the upward momentum continues. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-27T19:00:02.000Z,"Bitcoin Supply Concentrates In Experienced Hands – LTHs Show No Signs Of Distribution","Bitcoin is consolidating just below its all-time high near $112,000, maintaining a bullish structure as momentum builds across the broader crypto market. After a strong rally in recent weeks, BTC is showing signs of strength and stability, trading in a tight range that many analysts view as a launchpad for the next major move. The setup points to further upside, with growing confidence that Bitcoin could break into new highs soon. Analysts are increasingly optimistic, calling for an expansive summer as capital begins to flow back into crypto markets. Both technical resilience and compelling on-chain data are fueling the sentiment shift. According to insights from Alphractal, long-term holders (LTHs)—those holding BTC for more than six months—continue to accumulate but not distribute. In fact, the supply held by LTHs is steadily increasing, a sign of deep conviction and reduced liquid supply in the market. This behavior from experienced holders reinforces the bullish thesis: when LTHs are not selling into strength, it often sets the foundation for sustainable rallies . With a strong technical base, rising institutional interest, and long-term holders tightening supply, Bitcoin appears primed for a powerful summer ahead. Bitcoin Consolidates As Market Dynamics Shift Bitcoin is currently consolidating just below the $110,000 level, holding steady after an aggressive rally that brought it close to its all-time high of $112K. Despite the pause in upside momentum, bulls remain firmly in control. Both the daily and weekly charts show a well-defined uptrend structure, with higher highs and higher lows continuing to build. The consolidation appears to be a healthy cooldown before the next major move. Top analyst Darkfost recently shared insights into the market’s underlying structure, focusing on the behavior of Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs). According to Darkfost, LTHs are not distributing their coins—in fact, they are doing the opposite. The supply held by LTHs is steadily increasing, signaling conviction and reinforcing the idea that seasoned investors expect more upside. Interestingly, the behavior of STHs paints a very different picture. Darkfost expressed surprise at the data, which shows that STHs are actively distributing. Unlike past instances where STH selling occurred during corrections, this time the selling is taking place at an all-time high. It suggests a possible transfer from strong hands (LTHs) to weaker hands (STHs), a dynamic that often precedes increased volatility. While STHs may be locking in profits at the top, Darkfost notes it’s hard to say they’re wrong—after all, BTC is at an ATH, not in a mid-cycle dip. Still, with LTHs continuing to hold and reduce available supply, the broader trend remains bullish. The coming days could define whether BTC reclaims $112K and enters price discovery or retreats under growing short-term pressure. Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is currently trading at $109,863 on the daily chart, holding firm just below its all-time high of $112,000. Price action remains bullish, with BTC consolidating in a tight range after a powerful breakout above the $103,600 resistance zone, now acting as a key support level. This consolidation appears healthy and controlled, as buyers continue to defend higher lows. The 34-day EMA sits at $101,928 and is rising steadily, confirming strong short- to mid-term momentum. BTC is also comfortably above the 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, all of which are now aligned to the upside—a classic signal of trend strength. Volume has slightly decreased during this phase, which is typical for consolidation after a breakout. This price behavior suggests bulls are not exhausted but rather preparing for the next leg up. A daily close above $112K with volume confirmation would likely push BTC into price discovery, with potential upside targets around $120K to $125K. Until then, the $103,600–$105,000 zone remains the critical area to hold. As long as BTC stays above this region and maintains its higher structure, the broader uptrend remains intact, and the bullish outlook is unchanged.

Through leveraging the capital markets, SOL Strategies plans to invest more in the Solana network ahead. “The filing of a base shelf prospectus supports our growth strategy by providing us with the flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem. This strategic move enhances our ability to act decisively when compelling investment opportunities present themselves,” Leah Wald, CEO of SOL Strategies, noted . As Coinpedia previously reported , SOL Strategies has strengthened its balance sheet through Solana acquisitions in the past. As of this writing, the company held about 389,675 SOL coins, with the majority acquired YTD. Impact of SOL Strategies Plan on Solana Price The relentless support of the Solana network from SOL Strategies has played a crucial role in the altcoin’s bullish sentiment. Furthermore, on-chain data shows that the Solana network has a significantly higher number of users compared to its direct competitors such as Ethereum (ETH), and Tron (TRX), among others. As Bitcoin (BTC) price teases a rally towards a new all-time high (ATH) in the near future, SOL price has attracted more whale investors and FOMO traders. Moreover, the notable adoption of the Solana-based memecoins in the recent past has helped increase the overall SOL utility. From a technical analysis standpoint, the SOL price is well positioned for a rally beyond $200 in the coming days following a notable bullish momentum in the past two months.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/sol-strategies-files-preliminary-base-shelf-prospectus-to-raise-1b-to-buy-solana/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T18:52:28.000Z,"Telecom Token RZTO and Rizz Wireless: The Future of Mobile Rewards Is Here","The next era of mobile rewards is now beginning in 2025 as the Solana-based utility token RZTO and Rizz Wireless collaborate. Over time, telecom companies have invested a lot of energy into providing connectivity without in-depth consideration of how to promote loyal customer engagements—until today. Telecom token RZTO , a Solana-based utility token, has partnered with Rizz Wireless, an FCC-licensed MVNO in the USA, to create a crypto-integrated model that revolutionizes telecom rewards. This token with rewards is now live with a full suite of mobile rewards and real staking benefits, plus premium travel packages, set to emerge as a superlative offering for users. Imagine gathering digital rewards from your day-to-day calls, using them for quicker returns, cashing them in for travel rewards, while enjoying 5G nationwide coverage. This isn’t a futuristic concept; it’s happening now. RZTO and Rizz Wireless are remaking the telecom market with a model that transforms customer loyalty into a valuable benefit and into more money. How RZTO Powers Rizz Wireless Notably, RZTO has a foundational role in driving Rizz Wireless. Rizz Wireless has 5G wide coverage in the USA at affordable rates, starting from $25/month, and cutting-edge eSIM service that provides constant internet access for Americans and international guests. Through the RZTO token system, users earn digital rewards for ordinary activities that are not customarily appreciated: Whether they’re recharging their monthly subscriptions, using their talk minutes wisely or converting extra data into rewards, users constitute part of Rizz’s innovative ‘Call-to-Earn’ ecosystem, which has been beneficial for the first users since its introduction. Token with rewards earned through RZTO hold tangible value and can be practically applied for purposes such as topping up data during high demand scenarios, accessing inexpensive international roaming options or making purchases at local partner stores – thus creating a financially rewarded ecosystem for telecom users. Benefits for Users and Investors In the digital market environment of 2025, both routine clients and strategic investors prefer the telecom token RZTO and Rizz Wireless’ comprehensive services. In Europe, Asia, and Dubai, RZTO streamlines mobile bills for its subscribers with the potential to cancel all charges through rewards in tokens. These instantly usable incentive tokens can be used toward: controlling high-data periods, managing roaming, or redeeming exclusive travel rewards such as great savings on flights through Zoyilli partnerships. The technological basis of RZTO does not disappoint expectations as it constantly ensures that subscribers remain connected anywhere they may be—whether they are dealing with remote work or venturing into places they do not know. With regards to investments, RZTO is highly regarded for its program that imitates the fixed APY scheme of Bitcoin using a well-structured staking mechanism. The Solana-based utility token holders get practical rewards in the form of mobile data allocations by joining the network, they contribute to its development. At the same time, RZTO uses a complicated dual-burn approach, whereby circulating supply is slowly reduced laying the groundwork for increased growth of the token value. Those interested in security will appreciate the continuous Certik audit process and the upcoming listings in popular platforms such as CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, allowing RZTO to find its reliable position in the sphere of cryptocurrencies. With a global expansion plan and plans to embrace decentralized governance dictated by a DAO system by 2035, RZTO seeks to promote consistent growth, thus becoming a promising investment for crypto enthusiasts interested in projects that offer actual real-world benefits and continuous revenue. A Vision for Global Connectivity Although aimed at short-term results, RZTO and Rizz Wireless are deliberately building the core foundation ready to define global connectivity standards several years down the line. While operating in the United States market today, RZTO’s vision is to grow systematically internationally by powering several global networks by 2027, with specific plans to enter Europe and open 100 retail outlets across the USA. Geographic expansion is accompanied by parallel advances in technological development for RZTO. In 2026, RZTO will introduce its own Layer 1 blockchain and new NFT experiences to support the ecosystem functionality and user interaction alternatives. Artificial intelligence is poised to go into the markets in 2027 and will make possible highly individualized and predictive service delivery, while a comprehensive DAO governance structure is progressively introduced by 2035 and ensures genuine community input in the governance of the network. With its foundation based on the advanced blockchain of Solana, this token with rewards easily caters to its ambitious activities providing transaction efficiency, low-cost advantages needed for the global development. For potential users and investors across the world, the partnership of telecom token RZTO with Rizz Wireless increases the credibility of its business model, and an impeccably planned roadmap lays out a future where universal mobile rewards are a real possibility. The Solana-based utility token RZTO is not just some utility token, but a guiding beacon in the worldwide movement to disrupt global connectivity norms with Web3 and a user-first philosophy. Those who participate in the presale can benefit from greater advantages such as the possibility to receive a 10% bonus on tokens if they use valid promotional codes. By availing of this limited-time opportunity, the participants get a special advantage to benefit from the expected demand and appreciation.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/telecom-token-rzto-and-rizz-wireless-the-future-of-mobile-rewards-is-here/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

According to a May 27 announcement from the company, the capital raise comprises a $1.5 billion stock sale and $1 billion in convertible senior secured bonds, with a 0% coupon. The sale is expected to close on May 29. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said: “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. This investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.\"" TMTG spokespeople responded to the initial report from the Financial Times, published a day before the announcement, with derision. “Apparently, the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources,” TMTG representatives told the FT . Shares of TMTG sank following the $2.5 billion capital raise announcement. Source: TradingView Shares of TMTG fell by over 12% following the announcement and were trading around $23.60 at the time of publication.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Edwards said that bitcoin payments have been faster and cheaper than traditional credit card payments. “When customers choose to pay in bitcoin instead of credit cards, we are saving about 50% in our processing fees,” Edwards said. “This means that bitcoin is a win for the customer, it’s a win for us as a merchant, and it’s a win for the bitcoin community.” Edwards said that on May 16, the day Steak n’ Shake began accepting bitcoin payments, one in every 500 bitcoin transactions globally happened at Steak n’ Shake. “Accepting bitcoin allows us to meet our customers where our customers are,” Edwards said. “We were seeking to provide our customers with another viable option by which to pay for our products.

According to a May 27 announcement, the strategies will include buying undervalued biotech companies, purchasing “distressed Bitcoin claims” like those associated with crypto hacks and bankruptcies, and acquiring bottom tranches of Bitcoin credit vehicles at discounted prices. “ [...] our alpha-generating Bitcoin accumulation strategies are designed to drive sustained outperformance relative to Bitcoin itself, which requires a new valuation framework,” Strive CEO Matt Cole said.

2025-05-27T18:15:07.000Z,"$16 Billion Real Estate Tokenization: Here’s Why Dubai Chose XRP Over Bitcoin","In a groundbreaking move, Dubai has taken a major step into the future of real estate by launching its first tokenized property platform, and notably, it chose the XRP Ledger (XRPL) over Bitcoin to power this ambitious initiative. Earlier this week, the Dubai Land Department (DLD) unveiled Prypco Mint, a pioneering tokenized real estate platform created through a collaboration with Prypco, the Dubai Future Foundation, Ctrl Alt, and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. This innovative system allows investors to gain fractional ownership of Dubai properties by purchasing digital shares tied to real-world assets. The minimum investment starts at just 2,000 dirhams (around $540), opening the door to a wide range of participants. What’s striking is that Ctrl Alt, the technology partner behind this platform, selected XRPL as the blockchain backbone, not Bitcoin, despite its global recognition. This decision sparked heated discussions across the crypto space, with many wondering why Dubai’s government bypassed the original cryptocurrency for this $16 billion project projected to flourish by 2033. Six Key Reasons Dubai Chose XRPL Over Bitcoin To shed light on the choice, crypto analyst and social media figure John Squire offered a clear breakdown , pointing to six critical advantages that gave XRPL the upper hand. Lightning-Fast Transactions: Squire emphasized that XRPL’s transaction speed was a decisive factor. The XRP Ledger can finalize transactions in just 3–5 seconds, a stark contrast to Bitcoin’s sluggish confirmation times, which can range from 10 minutes to an hour. For a dynamic real estate platform handling countless microtransactions, speed is everything. Why did Dubai choose #XRP over #Bitcoin to tokenize $16B in real estate? Spoiler: It’s not hype, it’s brutal efficiency. pic.twitter.com/rOVCglEz0b — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) May 26, 2025 Minimal Transaction Costs : Cost efficiency played another crucial role. While Bitcoin transactions can incur notable fees, XRP transactions cost just a fraction of a cent. Squire highlighted that this ultra-low fee structure makes XRPL ideal for a high-volume system like fractional real estate trading, where every cent matters. Superior Scalability : When it comes to scaling, XRPL outperforms Bitcoin by a wide margin. Squire pointed out that XRPL can process up to 1,500 transactions per second, compared to Bitcoin’s limit of about seven per second. This scalability ensures the platform can handle massive future demand, aligning with Dubai’s long-term vision for a large-scale, tokenized property market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Eco-Friendly Infrastructure : Sustainability is central to Dubai’s development agenda, and here, XRPL shines. Unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mechanism, which relies on energy-hungry mining operations, XRPL uses a consensus protocol that’s energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. Squire explained that this green approach aligns perfectly with Dubai’s push toward eco-conscious innovation. Institutional Compatibility : According to Squire, Ripple — the company behind XRP — has spent years building bridges with banks, regulators, and government agencies worldwide. This track record of institutional engagement made XRPL a natural fit for Dubai’s government-backed project. By contrast, Bitcoin, while popular among retail investors, lacks the same level of institutional alignment and is often seen as less adaptable for large-scale, regulated initiatives. Diverse, Proven Use Cases : Lastly, Squire pointed to XRPL’s broad utility across sectors like cross-border payments, stablecoin issuance, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and asset tokenization. While Bitcoin is predominantly regarded as a store of value, XRPL offers proven technical infrastructure for tokenization, making it the clear winner for a project centered on digital property shares. The Bottom Line: Utility Over Ideology Squire summed it up simply: major government-backed projects prioritize practical utility over ideological appeal. “Dubai chose XRP because it’s fast, cheap, scalable, energy-efficient, and institution-ready,” he explained. With the Dubai real estate tokenization market expected to swell to $16 billion by the next decade, the decision to use XRPL marks a powerful endorsement of the blockchain’s capabilities. As global interest in tokenized real estate grows, Dubai’s move may set the standard for how governments and institutions approach blockchain adoption, prioritizing functionality, sustainability, and scalability over mere name recognition.

You might also like: Here’s why the ETHFI price has gone parabolic In addition to improved sentiment around Ethereum, driven by the SharpLink ETH treasury strategy, ETHFI has benefited from protocol-driven buyback initiatives. On May 24, 2025, the ether.fi Foundation announced that a total of 105 ETH worth about $267k had been used to buy back 206k ETHFI. Since initiating the program, the non-custodial ETH staking platform has used withdrawal fees to fund regular token buybacks. In addition to weekly repurchases, the project also conducts monthly buybacks and redistributes repurchased ETHFI tokens to stakers. The protocol’s revenue comes from staking and restaking rewards as well as fees on liquid vaults. In April, platform revenue hit $2.4 million, with ether.fi Foundation noting that a portion of this would be used to buy back the native token.

2025-05-27T18:08:22.000Z,"MARA’s Fred Thiel Says U.S. Should Start Mining Bitcoin to Fill Strategic Reserve","LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) CEO Fred Thiel has an idea for how U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration can make good on its promises to build out a strategic bitcoin reserve: start mining. Speaking on a panel at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Thiel said that the U.S. government has many potential ways to generate bitcoin to fill the strategic bitcoin reserve that would adhere to the “budget-neutral” acquisition strategy laid out in Trump’s March executive order, including using excess hydroenergy to mine bitcoin domestically. Though it’s been nearly three months since Trump authorized the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve, it remains unclear exactly how — and when — the government will take steps to actually begin filling it, a source of evident frustration among a number of speakers at the conference. “I think it’s critical,” Thiel said of acquiring bitcoin for the reserve. “The U.S. making a statement that we’re going to have a strategic reserve is an empty statement unless you start putting stuff into it.” At this point, the reserve is supposed to hold all of the bitcoin that has been sized by the government in civil and criminal forfeitures — estimated to be approximately 200,000 bitcoins. But many in the industry and government, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), think that getting the government’s existing stockpile of bitcoin into a strategic reserve is merely a first step, to be followed by bigger, more meaningful acquisitions. In March, Lummis re-introduced legislation — the so-called BITCOIN Act of 2025 — aimed at codifying Trump’s plans for a strategic bitcoin reserve. Under Lummis’ plan, after getting all of the forfeited bitcoin into the reserve, the U.S. government would spend the next two to five years converting a portion of its gold certificates into bitcoin. “We have enough assets in under performing assets that we can get five percent of the world’s bitcoin without spending a single dime,” Lummis said. However, Lummis acknowledged that it’s unlikely that any real movement on the BITCOIN Act — or, more broadly, taking any significant steps to fill the strategic reserve with anything other than forfeited assets — will come before Congress works its way through stablecoin and market structure legislation. “It’s going to be a heavier lift than I thought because so many people don’t understand bitcoin,” Lummis said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/27/maras-fred-thiel-says-us-should-start-mining-bitcoin-to-fill-strategic-reserve,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T18:05:56.000Z,"Retail Is Out – So Who’s Fueling Bitcoin’s Next Mania Phase?","Retail investors remain mostly on the sidelines in the current Bitcoin market, showing limited trading activity and reduced participation. Investor behavior this cycle could look very different from previous ones. As such, the next big push in the crypto market might not come from where most expect. Not Retail, Here’s Whose Stepping In Instead In a recent tweet , Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, stated that the next wave of crypto mania may not be driven by retail investors but by small or emerging companies and funds attempting to replicate Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Moreno questioned whether these entities are psychologically prepared to hold through extreme volatility, while noting the challenge of maintaining conviction during a potential 90% drawdown in their stock or fund value. Several non-crypto firms have jumped on the bandwagon and are increasingly adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, in a bid to emulate Strategy’s high-profile returns. Among them, Japan’s Metaplanet has emerged as a key player with its Bitcoin-first strategy and currently holds 7,800 BTC, according to data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries. Meanwhile, Hong Kong-listed Boyaa Interactive has so far accumulated 2,410 BTC, while US-based medical diagnostics company Semler Scientific has added 3,808 BTC to its balance sheet following Strategy’s playbook. Long-Term Holder Conviction Remains Strong As CryptoPotato previously reported , retail participation in Bitcoin appears notably absent despite recent price gains. On-chain data shows exchange netflows remain negative, suggesting BTC is steadily leaving trading platforms. The Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has fallen below 1.0, which is further indicative of continued aggressive selling, likely from retail investors reducing exposure. On the other hand, long-term holders (LTHs) are showing strong conviction, with spending activity now at its lowest since September 2024. According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr., this cohort of BTC holders has accumulated 300,000 BTC over the past 20 days – an encouraging sign of confidence and a potentially bullish indicator for the crypto asset’s price trajectory.

Chainlink ( LINK ) creator Sergey Nazarov says that the flagship cryptocurrency appears to be decoupling from the stock market and behaving more like gold, Fox Business reports . “Bitcoin is starting to behave as a safe haven asset, and there’s more and more instability in the world… For the first time now, it’s starting to get decoupled from tech stocks. So, if you wanted to choose a second safe haven asset after gold, bitcoin would now be a logical choice.” Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president of Robinhood Crypto, told Fox Business that people are beginning to see Bitcoin as a reserve asset. “And so, when there is a bit of instability in the market or in the globe, they actually use bitcoin as a reserve currency.” And crypto asset manager Bitwise says publicly traded companies are increasingly looking at BTC as a reserve asset rather than a speculative, risk-on investment. In a new report , Bitwise states that corporate Bitcoin holders increased their collective holdings from 394,131 to 786,857 BTC over a six-month period, from November 15, 2024, to May 15, 2025. The increase amounts to 392,726 BTC, which is equivalent to 196,363 BTC acquired per quarter. At time of writing, BTC is trading at $110,318, about a 1.2% move away from new all-time highs.

2025-05-27T18:03:22.000Z,"Rumor: Elon Musk to Integrate XRP Into the New Payment System On X","Crypto commentator Pumpius (@pumpius) recently shared a rumor that has drawn attention across the XRP community. In a post on the social media platform X, Pumpius hinted at a potential integration of XRP into the upcoming payment system being developed by the platform. Describing it as “bigger than bullish,” the post emphasized XRP’s capabilities for “fast, borderless, scalable payments” and noted that the social media platform now serves more than 500 million users globally. RUMORS: #XRP to be integrated into the new payment system on X (Twitter)?! If true, this is bigger than bullish — it’s a global liquidity onramp to 500M+ users. XRP was built for fast, borderless, scalable payments. X is building a financial empire. The stars are aligning. pic.twitter.com/rQan0E2gvf — Pumpius (@pumpius) May 27, 2025 Musk recently confirmed that a limited-access beta version of X payments will launch soon, and while the rumor of XRP integration remains unconfirmed, its implications are significant. If true, such a development would introduce XRP to a vast user base through a platform that is actively building its financial infrastructure. Ongoing Support from the XRP Community Supporters of XRP have repeatedly encouraged Musk to adopt the digital asset for X payments . One of the more vocal advocates has been XRPcryptowolf, a notable community figure who has pushed for Musk to adopt XRP for years. XRP is a good choice because it offers low fees, fast transactions, and the ability to handle cross-border transfers efficiently—factors that would support X’s ambition to become a comprehensive financial platform. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s existing infrastructure was designed for global liquidity and settlement solutions. Its integration into a platform like X would create a real-time, scalable alternative to legacy payment systems . The idea that Musk might turn to XRP for such functionality is not unfounded. While Musk has not publicly endorsed XRP, he has demonstrated prior interest in the cryptocurrency space, most notably through Tesla and SpaceX’s interactions with Bitcoin and Dogecoin. The community has also called for Tesla to adopt XRP , as the billionaire’s support for cryptocurrencies and the exposure the asset would gain could give its price a major boost while offering a better way to pay for Tesla products. XRP and The Everything App The addition of a fast and scalable digital asset like XRP would offer a practical option to support global payment rails and bring Musk closer to achieving this goal. Pumpius’s claim that “X is building a financial empire” reflects this broader vision. By leveraging technologies like XRP, Musk’s platform could provide users with real-time value transfer tools that extend beyond traditional currencies.

2025-05-27T18:00:42.000Z,"Trump Media Raises $2.5 Billion To Build Bitcoin Treasury","Trump Media and Technology Group has made a bold entry into cryptocurrency. On May 27, the firm announced that it had raised nearly $2.5 billion from about 50 institutional investors in a private placement deal. This funding will help the company build a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury, joining the growing list of corporate Bitcoin holders. Trump Media Reveal Details of the Deal Trump Media is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol DJT. It owns the social media platform Truth Social and the FinTech brand Truth.Fi, which was launched in January 2025 . Truth.Fi was recently given the green light to invest up to $250 million in traditional and crypto-related assets. Now, Trump Media is expanding this plan with a new Bitcoin-focused strategy. The company revealed it will raise $2.5 billion through two parts: $1.5 billion in common stock and $1 billion in convertible notes. The notes can later be turned into shares at a 35% higher price than the premium price. This investment will place Bitcoin next to Trump Media’s existing funds. As of the end of Q1 2025, the company held $759 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The funds raised will allow Trump Media to buy and hold Bitcoin as part of its core financial assets. Trump Media CEO Says Bitcoin Is Financial Freedom Over the weekend, some reports claimed the company was raising $3 billion for crypto investments. Trump Media denied those reports and strongly criticized the news outlet. In today’s press release, Trump Media CEO and Chairman Devin Nunes called Bitcoin an “apex instrument of financial freedom.” He added that this new crypto investment is part of a larger strategy to protect the company from bias in the banking sector. According to Nunes, the Bitcoin reserve will support new product rollouts. This includes utility tokens and subscription payment tools on Truth Social and the upcoming Truth+ platform. Trump Media is partnering with Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital to store its Bitcoin safely. These firms will handle the security and management of the company’s crypto treasury. Trump Media Joins The Corporate Bitcoin Trend With this recent move, Trump Media has joined other major firms that embrace Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, was one of the first to take this approach and now holds almost 3% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Other firms, such as Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, MARA, Genius Group, have adopted the same strategy, seeing Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset. Now, Trump Media is aiming to follow in those footsteps, but with a focus on politics and social media.

2025-05-27T18:00:31.000Z,"Indecisive Close For Litecoin, But The Real Story Lies In BTC.D’s Next Move","Litecoin (LTC) wrapped up the day with an indecisive close, leaving traders on the edge of their seats. While LTC’s price action offered little clarity, the bigger picture may be unfolding elsewhere. According to market watchers, the real catalyst for Litecoin’s next significant move could come from Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). A shift in BTC.D could tip the scales, either paving the way for a bullish breakout or extending its current sideways drift. Litcoin And LTCBTC Await A Clear Signal In a recent update, market analyst CRYPTOWZRD offered a detailed, cautious take on Litecoin’s current technical position while highlighting key factors to watch for a potential upside move. He observed that the LTC/USDT and LTC/BTC daily candles “closed indecisively,” a classic sign of market hesitation. Related Reading: Market Expert Projects ‘Undervalued’ Litecoin To Soar At Least 1,000% — Here’s How This kind of price behavior often reflects a lack of conviction from traders and can precede either a continuation or a reversal, depending on how subsequent candles develop. According to CRYPTOWZRD, what’s needed now are “more healthy candles” to confirm renewed bullish intent in the coming sessions. A major factor influencing Litecoin’s outlook is Bitcoin dominance. CRYPTOWZRD explained that a decline in BTC.D would likely benefit altcoins like Litecoin, allowing LTCBTC to gain traction. If such a shift occurs, Litecoin could begin forming a bullish “W” reversal pattern, typically a reliable signal of a bottoming process and the start of a new upward trend. This pattern, if confirmed, would signal improving market sentiment around LTC and open the door for a stronger recovery. CRYPTOWZRD is keeping a close eye on the $96 level, which he identified as a key threshold on the daily chart. A sustained move above this level could give Litecoin the strength to rally toward the $128 resistance area. “I will be tracking the intraday chart development,” he noted, suggesting that his next trade decision will be heavily influenced by how Bitcoin performs in the short term. Intraday Choppiness: A Battle For Direction Sharing his thoughts on Litecoin’s intraday performance, the analyst described the chart as “choppy and slow” throughout the day, reflecting a lack of clear momentum in either direction. He emphasized that a decisive move above the $96 mark, followed by sustained price action at that level, could serve as a catalyst for a potential long toward the next significant resistance around $102 or possibly higher. Related Reading: Litecoin Monthly Close Above Key Resistance Could Ignite 30% Rally – Is A Breakout Coming? However, the analyst cautioned that failure to reclaim $96 may result in continued sideways volatility, with no strong directional bias in the near term. He also highlighted the role of Bitcoin in shaping Litecoin’s next move, noting that broader sentiment and movement in BTC will likely decide whether LTC breaks higher or remains range-bound.

2025-05-27T17:54:24.000Z,"Crypto market today: failed Dogecoin recovery, potential BTC bull trap","The cryptocurrency market is experiencing uncertainty today, as Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) exhibit signs of hesitation, with recent movements highlighting potential trend reversals, failed rallies, and tightening consolidations under key resistance levels. While optimism remains among bulls, the broader price action suggests traders are navigating a complex market landscape defined by volatility, liquidation imbalances, and a possible shift in momentum. Dogecoin liquidation imbalance wipes out longs Dogecoin has faced a sharp rejection following an attempted recovery rally, which instead triggered a brutal wave of liquidations concentrated in long positions. According to CoinGlass data , DOGE long traders lost $123,000 in just one hour, as prices dipped from $0.232 to $0.2266 amid a sudden sentiment shift that surprised bullish participants. The sharp liquidation created a staggering 200% imbalance, spotlighting the fragility of the meme coin’s support as it attempted to build momentum above its previous swing high. Although the price has slightly recovered to $0.2268, the move does little to restore confidence, especially as trading volume declined by 0.9% to settle at $1.32 billion. The narrow range between $0.2200 and $0.2300 has become a consolidation zone for DOGE, and while it signals that the market is stabilising, it also suggests indecision among traders. Unless the price can sustain a close above $0.2255 with rising volume, the likelihood of a meaningful breakout remains low, keeping bearish pressure intact in the short term. Moreover, the broader market trend—especially Bitcoin’s current volatility—continues to influence DOGE sentiment, with the meme token mirroring the larger liquidation patterns seen across major crypto assets. Market analysts are eying the $0.27 resistance level as a key pivot point, with a decisive move above that threshold required to validate any sustained bullish reversal. Bitcoin retraces as analysts debate bull trap vs new all-time high Bitcoin has pulled back below the $109,000 mark after hitting a new all-time high of $111,800 last week, raising questions about the sustainability of its recent rally. The 3% retracement has reignited a split among market analysts, with some interpreting the pullback as a healthy consolidation, while others warn of a potential bull trap forming at the top. Technical expert Doctor Profit remains firmly bullish, citing the rare appearance of a Golden Cross on higher time frames—an indicator that has historically preceded major upside moves in Bitcoin. He highlighted that previous Golden Cross signals, such as those in October 2023 and October 2024, led to gains of 170% and 73%, respectively, with the latest signal possibly targeting $113,000 in the near term. Doctor Profit 🇨🇭 @DrProfitCrypto · Follow #Bitcoin – What’s Next?The Big Sunday Report: All You Need to Know🚩TA/LCA/Psychological Breakdown:Today, we’re highlighting one major signal that strongly reinforces my entire thesis: Bitcoin’s bullish run is far from over and it’s likely to go much further than most 3:00 am · 26 May 2025 3.2K Reply Copy link Read 224 replies However, the contrasting view comes from analyst Cameron Fous , who warns that Bitcoin may already be peaking, drawing comparisons with historical market tops that were followed by steep declines. Fous pointed out that breaking below the 50-day moving average could signal an early trend reversal, especially if the current consolidation lacks the volume to support another leg up. Despite his cautious outlook, he acknowledged that BTC could still see price surges toward $130,000 or even $200,000 in the short term, provided bullish conditions persist. Adding to the complexity is the continued accumulation of Bitcoin by large institutional players like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which recently made another purchase that contributes to tightening supply. ETF inflows also remain a crucial variable, with current capital flows into Bitcoin ETFs being nine times higher than the amount of BTC mined, reinforcing long-term bullish potential. Nevertheless, the conflicting narratives have kept the market in a state of limbo, with price action on the daily chart showing tightening movement just below all-time highs. Ethereum enters consolidation as bulls eye breakout Ethereum is coiling below a major resistance level at $2,700, where it has remained for several weeks while maintaining a bullish continuation pattern that has yet to resolve. The price structure is showing signs of strength, with an ascending triangle forming, marked by higher lows that indicate buyers are gradually pressuring the market toward a breakout. Despite recent volatility, ETH has respected its trendline, and sellers have repeatedly failed to drive the price below critical support levels, reinforcing overall bullish sentiment. The longer Ethereum consolidates within this structure without breaking down, the stronger the foundation becomes for a breakout toward higher price targets, possibly as high as $4,000. Volume remains a crucial element in this setup, and while it has declined during the consolidation phase, this is often interpreted as a coiling effect before a high-momentum breakout. However, market observers caution that a breakout attempt without sufficient volume could result in a bull trap, mirroring risks observed in Bitcoin’s recent behaviour. What makes the current formation constructive is the absence of bearish reversal signals, which suggests that Ethereum’s trend is intact and accumulation is likely occurring just beneath resistance. As ETH continues to post higher highs and higher lows, the probability of a sustained rally increases, provided that the breakout is accompanied by strong buying activity. If momentum accelerates above $2,700, Ethereum could enter a price discovery phase, with limited resistance ahead and historical precedence supporting the potential for rapid expansion.

Onchain indicators enter overheated territory, suggesting prolonged profit-taking from BTC investors. Bitcoin (BTC) showed strength on May 27, briefly tagging $110,700 after a strong US equities market open and the Trump Media and Technology Group’s announcement that it would raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets. US National Financial Conditions Index. Source: Ecoinometrics Ecoinometrics mentioned that within four weeks, liquidity has returned, creating a supportive macroeconomic environment for risk assets like Bitcoin. The newsletter noted, “That’s the kind of macro backdrop where Bitcoin thrives. Bitcoin’s rally to new highs didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.” With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity.

Table of Contents Hyperliquid crypto enters price discovery as HYPE outpaces major altcoins What drives the Hyperliquid price? James Wynn’s $1.25B position boosts trust in Hyperliquid wallet Hyperliquid price prediction: Hyperliquid token may face resistance Hyperliquid crypto enters price discovery as HYPE outpaces major altcoins In a market where major altcoins have largely traded sideways through most of May, Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) has quietly built its own bullish momentum. HYPE reached an all-time high of $39.93 on May 26, rising more than 326% from its Apr. 7 low of $9.36. The climb unfolded gradually, with the price crossing $28 by May 21 and pushing past $30 during the final stretch of the month. As of May 27, HYPE is trading around $38.5. While that reflects a 4.5% dip from the recent peak, it still marks a 47% gain over the past seven days. HYPE crypto price chart | Source: crypto.news Trading activity has remained strong, with 24-hour volume hovering around $345 million. Hyperliquid’s market cap now stands at approximately $12.5 billion, placing it as the 11th largest crypto asset by market value. Fueling this rally is a noticeable improvement in key on-chain metrics. Open interest hit a record high of $10.1 billion, and daily trading fees reached $5.6 million on May 26, highlighting increased usage and engagement. Hyperliquid reached new all-time highs again: + Open interest: $10.1B + 24h fees: $5.6M + USDC TVL: $3.5B Welcome to all new members of the ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/AoWVPRINGA — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) May 26, 2025 The recent integration of USD Coin ( USDC ) as the main settlement asset has also added more depth to the ecosystem. With $3.5 billion now locked on the platform, confidence appears to be growing among both institutional participants and retail users. Let’s look at what Hyperliquid does, why it’s gaining traction among users, and what current price predictions suggest about its potential path forward. What drives the Hyperliquid price? Hyperliquid, launched in November 2024, runs on a custom layer 1 blockchain architecture designed to support fully on-chain trading of perpetual futures. Unlike many decentralized exchanges that rely on off-chain order matching and on-chain settlement, Hyperliquid processes all transactions, orders, and trades directly on-chain. The system is anchored by two main components: HyperBFT and HyperEVM. HyperBFT, a consensus protocol influenced by Meta’s LibraBFT, is built to handle throughput of up to 2 million transactions per second. It finalizes blocks in under a second and can process as many as 100,000 orders per second. HyperEVM ensures compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine , giving developers the ability to deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts while benefiting from faster execution and lower transaction fees. The platform offers perpetual futures trading across several major crypto assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), Solana ( SOL ), and Sui ( SUI ). Traders can use up to 50x leverage and are not required to hold the underlying asset to open a position. New users onboard through wallet-based login, and the exchange does not conduct know-your-customer checks. This model stands in contrast to most centralized platforms and may raise regulatory questions in certain jurisdictions. In addition to derivatives, Hyperliquid enables spot trading through its HIP-1 token standard, which is structurally similar to Ethereum’s ERC-20 . Token listings come with relatively high costs, a measure aimed at reducing spam and filtering out low-quality projects. The protocol also includes a Vaults feature that allows users to allocate capital to traders or algorithmic strategies in a non-custodial way. All vault performance data is public, and fund movements occur entirely on-chain. Hyperliquid has stated that it has not taken any venture capital funding. Positioning the absence of VC involvement as a strategic choice, the team says it is focused on building long-term infrastructure rather than chasing short-term token performance. James Wynn’s $1.25B position boosts trust in Hyperliquid wallet Hyperliquid’s growing presence in the DeFi space is backed by a series of tangible developments that have unfolded over the past few months. On May 23, Hyperliquid Labs submitted two public comment letters to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in response to the agency’s request for feedback on the future of perpetual futures and 24/7 crypto markets. The letters called for regulatory approaches that support decentralized infrastructure while maintaining financial safeguards, marking the first time Hyperliquid participated in policy discussions at this level. The market reacted swiftly. HYPE rose 15% that day, according to CoinMarketCap data, signaling investor confidence in the platform’s long-term regulatory position. Infrastructure has also remained central to Hyperliquid’s momentum. The February rollout of HyperEVM introduced Ethereum compatibility, enabling smart contracts from the Ethereum ecosystem to run natively on Hyperliquid. This upgrade paved the way for new integrations, including support for Tether ( USDT ), expanding the platform’s stablecoin functionality. As a result, the ecosystem now allows for more flexible trading strategies, smoother interoperability, and easier capital movement across networks. High-volume traders have taken notice. Earlier last week, derivatives trader James Wynn opened a $1.25 billion Bitcoin long position on Hyperliquid, one of the largest on-chain derivatives trades recorded to date, showing that the network can handle institutional-scale activity without performance issues. You might also like: The full breakdown of James Wynn’s $1B Bitcoin positions — and how it all fell apart Retail interest has picked up as well. Throughout May, social media posts have speculated about a second token airdrop. With 38% of the HYPE supply still unallocated, users have begun tracking on-chain signals for eligibility. The speculation builds on the original airdrop from November 2024, which distributed HYPE to early users. Rising wallet activity and cross-chain transactions this month suggest renewed engagement from both first-time participants and returning users. Hyperliquid price prediction: Hyperliquid token may face resistance Hyperliquid’s strong momentum in May has pushed the token into price discovery territory. On the HYPE/BTC weekly chart, the asset is now trading at all-time highs relative to Bitcoin — a rare position for any altcoin during a period when many others are still struggling to break through resistance. https://twitter.com/MetamateDaz/status/1926792832863379662 Pushing higher from this point presents more complexity. One perspective, shared by Defi Monk, a researcher at Messari, suggests that Hyperliquid may be approaching saturation in terms of retail trading activity. There’s actually one $HYPE bear case I see very few people mention. The idea that Hyperliquid is close to maxing out retail taker flow onchain and that getting from 20% of Binance’s volume share to 50% will be a much harder path than getting from 0 to 20%. This is because… https://t.co/Iw4c7akhxb — MONK (@defi_monk) May 18, 2025 According to him, the platform’s growth from zero to capturing 20% of Binance’s volume share happened during a unique window in the market. Expanding further into high-frequency and institutional territory, however, may prove slower. “Getting from 20% of Binance’s volume share to 50% will be a much harder path,” he explains, pointing to latency requirements and the challenges of attracting professional trading flow. At the same time, he notes that Hyperliquid’s current position is difficult to displace. Early on, competition was limited. Now, any new entrant must compete directly with Hyperliquid’s infrastructure, depth of liquidity, and established user base. As he puts it, “Now the bar is Hyperliquid itself.” Going forward, the protocol’s trajectory may depend less on rapid growth and more on how effectively it defends its position against emerging platforms like GTE_XYZ and others. In terms of price action, near-term technical models offer a more cautious view. Forecasts from Coincodex suggest HYPE could decline more than 22% over the next 30 days, targeting a price of $28.50 by June 26. Despite the projected correction, broader sentiment remains positive. The Fear & Greed Index is holding at 74, indicating elevated market appetite, while the sentiment indicator stays in bullish territory. On a longer time frame, projections from Coincodex outline a wider range of outcomes. For 2025, the model places HYPE’s maximum price at $36.86, which sits near current levels and implies limited upside in the short term. For 2026, the model projects a potential high of $94.85, which would represent a gain of over 150%. Estimates continue to climb through 2029, with the upper bound reaching $145.28. Price forecasts, regardless of how data-driven they appear, always involve a degree of uncertainty. The DeFi space moves quickly, and changes in regulation, platform security, or user behavior can shift token performance without warning. Traders considering exposure to HYPE should treat it like any other high-volatility digital asset. As always, trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Mara Holdings produces up to 10% of blocks due to the high efficiency of its mining operations. The corporate miner is among the top 10 pools and the second-largest US-based mining pool following Foundry Digital. Mara Holdings produces new BTC both through its native pool, and through Foundry.USA, receiving regular inflows of BTC. The corporate miner holds 10,765 BTC in its mining-connected wallet for a constantly growing treasury. The mining operations were also the basis of Mara Holding’s leveraged buying. Mara is the second-biggest BTC holder after Strategy (MSTR), with a total of 48,137 BTC . The fund has an extremely low-cost basis for its BTC treasury, fulfilling the purpose of tapping value. The company increased its holdings by 174% in the past five quarters on a mix of mining and sporadic acquisitions. The success of Mara showed miners were now immune to panic-based capitulation, even during BTC downturns. Miners continue to produce BTC under stressful conditions but retain most of the coins. BTC miners hold over 1.8M coins, some of which have been used as the basis for corporate treasuries. MARA shares reach a one-month peak MARA shares recovered to a one-month peak, gaining more rapidly in the past day. MARA traded at $16.34, tracking the BTC expansion in May. Interest in MARA also increased as traders focused on companies carrying Bitcoin treasuries. MARA increased its mindshare on social media, for its unique position as a scalable block producer and direct BTC buyer. The companies also gained exposure during the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas. MARA also achieved the biggest daily gains, though other corporate miner stocks were in the green. Most corporate miner stocks tracked the BTC market, with net gains for the past month. US-based mining corporations were among the big winners in the past month, as BTC recovered above $100,000. | Source: CompaniesMarketCap The shares of Mara Holdings have reflected both its mining results and the robust BTC treasury. However, Mara Holdings has not announced new acquisitions and has not competed with Strategy to acquire more BTC through leveraged instruments. Despite this, the holding’s approach is more sustainable, supported by its mining operations, locations, and the ability to pivot to data centers. The company expanded to a total of 17 data centers as of May 2025. The company has highly efficient mining operations, accessing 1.1 GW in energy, with the option to expand to 1.7 GW. BTC mining costs are estimated at $91,950 per coin, though Mara Holdings has achieved a lower production price due to its early investment and access to cheap energy.

However, in this context, it also suggests potential liquidity injections from the Fed, given the unfavorable US fiscal outlook, where government spending exceeds revenue capacity.US President Donald Trump has called for lower interest rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious due to a strong labor market and rising inflation pressures, whether driven by tariffs or easy credit conditions.

Still, it would be inaccurate to suggest Bitcoin has decoupled from traditional markets; its 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has remained above 70% over the past four weeks.

It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.”With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity.

As of late May 2025, this figure has surged to 19.4 million BTC, nearing historical extremes and entering the “Overheated Zone.” Previously, BTC prices tested this zone on Dec. 17, 2025, which was followed by a price correction to $93,000 from $107,000.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

With thousands of projects emerging or disappearing, you need innovative ways to separate signal from noise. AI solutions such as ChatGPT and Grok could benefit you as your research assistant, reducing research time and delivering actionable information. This article discusses how to use both platforms to make better decisions regarding investment in altcoins.How to share content with ChatGPT and GrokBoth ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 allow you to share content in three ways. You can simply paste content in the text box with inverted commas and write your prompt. Alternatively, you can upload a document from your local drive or Google Drive on ChatGPT 4o. If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to analyze complex data and draw quick conclusionsChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project’s breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.Ask for competitive comparisons on ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:And this is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: “Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.Did you know? Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot was built with a rebellious tone. It excels at quickly pulling crypto insights directly from social chatter, perfect for memecoin hunters.Find info about developer activityDeveloper traction is a dependable indicator of an altcoin’s long-term potential. Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to find information about overall growth in development activity, surges after certain upgrades, developer count and contributions, commit activity, network upgrades and challenges before developers.You could use prompts like:“What has been the developer activity trend on [Project ] over the last 6 months?”You can also request ecosystem breakdowns with prompts like:“List top DeFi projects built on Arbitrum with TVL over $10 million.”ChatGPT 4o generated the following response for this prompt:Here is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can synthesize data points from multiple sources and give you a cleaner picture faster than manual web browsing.

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy. On April 11, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a roadmap that addressed privacy enhancements for wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and infrastructure. Buterin advocated implementing privacy-enhancing norms and features across the Ethereum ecosystem, including adding privacy tools in ETH wallets. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/starkware-unveils-s-two-client-side-zk-prover?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.  Related: Stablecoins’ dominance due to limitations of US banking — Jerald DavidYield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11 billionBitget’s move into yield-bearing stablecoins comes as the asset class has surged to $11 billion.

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

As a result, any optimism stemming from the delayed US–EU tariffs may be tempered by ongoing concerns surrounding US government debt and the threat of a potential economic recession. The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector.

You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

Investors in their 30s saw the biggest growth, up 29%, followed by those in their 40s (27%), while investors over 50 increased by 25%.The FIU’s findings show that older investors have larger holdings. By year-end, 221,000 investors held at least 100 million won (about $73,000) in crypto. Of those, 172,500 — or 78% — were over 40.Related: XRP and Solana race toward the next crypto ETF approvalIn February, the head of the financial industry association urged regulators to approve Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, citing rising demand among older investors.

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ETFs under its dedicated crypto committee.Lee ahead in presidential election voter surveyYoon’s failed coup accelerated the presidential election and brought renewed urgency to unresolved issues in the local crypto industry.“In the 2022 presidential election, cryptocurrency was viewed as speculative and untrustworthy. But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said.South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In Q1 2024, the Korean won ranked as the most-traded fiat currency against crypto, driven largely by retail investors. Institutional players remain on the sidelines, awaiting their turn as the FSC prepares to launch pilot trading for professional investors.FSC’s planned schedule for a phased introduction of institutional crypto investment in 2025.Crypto policies were once seen as campaign strategies to sway younger voters, but this year, they’re seen as an economic and social issue that impacts multiple generations. In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs.“Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active. In the past, people looked at it with skepticism, but now it feels like the public is approaching it more neutrally and making their own judgments,” Cho said.Lee Jae-myung leads the latest voter survey by local media and Next Research.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services. This creates opportunities for Web3 projects like Jambo and Yellow Card to offer alternatives for saving and earning.Related: South African firm chooses Bitcoin reserve strategy as inflation hedgeKamal highlighted Africa’s strength in its “young population with ambitious tech talents”. He cited Hedera’s partnership with Orange, a telecommunications operator, to launch digital empowerment programs across 16 African countries — initiatives that “include training, certification and the establishment of incubation and accelerator centers”.“Africa brings a unique advantage to Web3: a demographic edge and a proven capacity for digital adoption,” said Paolo Tasca, executive chairman of the Exponential Science Foundation. “Yet barriers remain, particularly in foundational infrastructure and education.”Governments are also ramping up talent development.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it’s easier and more practical.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alternative-sweden-cashless-plans?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
