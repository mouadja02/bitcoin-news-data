2025-05-27T04:59:31.000Z,"Meme Coins Represent a Market for Attention, Sygnum Bank Exec Says","Meme coins may only make up a small slice of the broader crypto ecosystem, but they represent something bigger in the digital age, according to Sygnum Bank’s chief clients officer Martin Burgherr. Speaking to CNBC’s Dan Murphy , Burgherr described meme coins as a “tokenization of attention,” arguing that their value lies less in fundamentals and more in the social capital they generate. “Attention is something of value,” Burgherr said. He explained that on social platforms such as X, influence often stems from follower count, and meme coins are a digital reflection of that influence. He added that this dynamic helps explain the high level of attention, and perceived value, surrounding the $TRUMP coin, launched by the US President. Sygnum’s Martin Burgherr on @CNBC : \""Meme coins are a tokenization of attention\"" Martin Burgherr, Sygnum Chief Clients Officer, joined CNBC’s Access Middle East this morning, where he spoke with host @dan_murphy about how meme coins reflect the idea that attention, such as… pic.twitter.com/WsM0EbPh9K — Sygnum Bank (@sygnumofficial) May 26, 2025 Trump Coin Emerges as a Case Study in Tokenized Attention and Political Branding The Trump meme coin, branded as $TRUMP, launched just days before Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration as the 47th US President. Created by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, affiliates of the Trump Organization, the token carries heavy branding, including a cartoon image of Trump raising his fist following the assassination attempt he survived in mid-2024. While marketed as a non-political symbol aligned with Trump’s “FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT” slogan, the coin’s timing and imagery have kept it squarely in the political spotlight. Built on the Solana blockchain, the token also states explicitly that it is not an investment or security, even though its founders hold 80% of the total supply. While critics question the ethics of such politicized financial instruments, their popularity highlights a growing trend in the crypto world, where digital tokens mirror viral content and social sentiment more than traditional market forces. Burgherr Defends Crypto Legitimacy, Sees Meme Coins as a Small Niche Burgherr stated that Sygnum, a regulated digital asset bank based in Switzerland and Singapore, does not promote meme coin speculation. “We primarily believe in major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana,” he said. Any exposure to meme coins, he added, should depend entirely on an investor’s risk appetite. He rejected the notion that meme coins erode trust in the crypto industry, pointing out that their structure is generally transparent. However, he noted that like any new segment, meme coins require clear governance and regulation before being fairly assessed. He added that they represent only a small fraction of a broader ecosystem that includes DeFi, smart contracts and Bitcoin. Burgherr pointed out that Bitcoin continues to dominate the space, far outpacing niche tokens like Trump coin in both market size and credibility. He called the rise of meme coins a reflection of the industry’s diversity, not a threat to its legitimacy. When asked about the broader crypto rally, Burgherr said recent price gains in Bitcoin appear driven by a mix of macroeconomic concerns and renewed optimism in risk assets. He cited inflation fears and questions over US debt sustainability as key drivers of investor interest in Bitcoin and gold.

2025-05-27T04:45:35.000Z,"Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High — But Is the Market at Its Peak? Analyzing Four Key Indicators","Bitcoin (BTC) just recently broke through its previous all-time high, which has created a lot of excitement and speculation across the crypto community. But as the price climbs into new all-time highs, the big question is: are we in a new leg up, or are we nearing the top of this cycle? In a more lucid picture of their market cycle, analysts see Bitcoin turning to four all-important indicators: the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the 200-Week Moving Average Heatmap, and the 2-Year Moving Average (MA) Multiplier. Each of these tools offers a different take on Bitcoin’s historic behavior and could well shed light on how much life is left in this rally before it runs out of gas. Rainbow Chart: Forecasting Long-Term Potential The popular long-term valuation model known as the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart uses a logarithmic growth curve to project the potential price ranges of Bitcoin over time. It is not intended as a short-term trading tool but rather provides a broad overview of the trajectory of Bitcoin across various market cycles. The latest update—titled the Rainbow2023 Chart—recommends that there is still substantial upside potential. It suggests that Bitcoin is in a “Hold” or “Accumulate” zone, with present prices not really extended in any sense when viewed through a macro lens. The Rainbow chart goes on to point out that the next cycle peak is potentially well above $200,000. This model suggests that even if BTC has hit new heights, we’re not quite in the euphoric space that usually signifies the last leg of a bull market. Whether you hold for the long term or are a recent addition to the space, upward price momentum could still deliver some tasty gains. RSI Signals Short-Term Overbought Conditions—but No Immediate Peak The price of BTC hit a new all-time high last week. Will it continue to rise or fall from the top? Let's use 4 indicators to see if $BTC is at its peak now. Rainbow Chart https://t.co/c2snAqQ7jl The Rainbow Chart is a long-term valuation tool that uses a logarithmic growth… pic.twitter.com/7rdzXEblcm — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 26, 2025 The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures how fast and how much price changes occur. It ranges from 0 to 100. Readings above 70 typically indicate an overbought market, while those below 30 suggest an oversold one. Currently, the RSI for BTC is at 71.35, which is situated just over the line that demarcates an overbought condition. Thus, we should maybe exercise a little caution here in the short term. Elevated RSI values like what we’re seeing now have often been precursors to local pullbacks or sideways-ish consolidation. However, it is worth mentioning, and a lot of commentators have mentioned, that BTC’s RSI has been above 70 for a nice stretch during prior bull runs. In short, although the RSI indicates a possibly overheated short-term market, it doesn’t definitely signal that the overall cycle top is in. It still could be the case that the market has some further price expansion potential before any kind of major correction kicks in. Heatmap and 2-Year MA Multiplier Show More Room for Growth We now focus on two enduring technical models that have usually been dependable for pinpointing moments of extreme market behavior. These are the 200-Week Moving Average Heatmap and the 2-Year MA Multiplier. The 200-Week Moving Average Heatmap employs a color-coded system that signifies when BTC is historically undervalued (blue/green) or overvalued (orange/red). Right now, Bitcoin’s price is represented in the blue zone—traditionally a “buy” zone. This could mean that, despite the all-time high, the broader market might be in the early stages of a bull cycle, with substantial upside potential. In the same way, the 2-Year MA Multiplier compares the present price with its 2-year moving average and a multiple of that average (often x5). At the moment, BTC trades between the green and red lines—much nearer the fair-value line than the line designating a euphoric state. Current market conditions don’t seem to resemble either an overheated situation or a recent peak. Conclusion: Still Climbing, Not Peaking—Yet The new all-time high for Bitcoin has, of course, raised concerns about whether the rally is sustainable or more likely to be ending soon. But a thorough examination of four key indicators gives a very different impression, one that suggests there is still a goodly amount of room for the market to grow in this cycle. The Rainbow Chart suggests that we could peak above $200K; the Heatmap and 2-Year MA Multiplier confirm that we are definitely below historical top prices. As with anything else in life, there must be some kind of upper limit. These models suggest a potential one for the next bull market. When all is said and done, Bitcoin looks to be enjoying a strong spell with lots of room to run and pretty good odds of appreciation ahead. As is always the case, investors ought to keep a close watch on price action, sentiment, and the macroeconomic backdrop—but for now, the data suggest that the bull market has lots of energy left.

2025-05-27T04:26:18.000Z,"Saylor says onchain proof-of-reserves a ‘bad idea’ due to security risks","Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, says institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that could pose security risks. “The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked about institutions adopting the transparency measure at a May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. “It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.” Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so. I asked @saylor if @MicroStrategy has any plans to publish on-chain proof of reserves His answer will SHOCK you “It’s a bad idea.” - Security Risk - Irrelevant without also having Big 4-audited liabilities Check it out 👇 pic.twitter.com/tIxUckgbEp — Mitchell ✝️🇺🇸 (@MitchellHODL) May 27, 2025 Proof-of-reserves are common among crypto exchanges and verify that the company holds sufficient crypto reserves to cover customer deposits. They can also confirm that other entities, such as crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds, hold the required amount of crypto for the funds. Saylor acknowledged the industry had a lot to learn from the collapses of crypto exchanges FTX and Mt. Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.” “Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.” Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapse Many crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits. Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110K Crypto exchanges Binance, Kraken and OKX and crypto asset manager Bitwise are among the industry players that have adopted the transparency measure.

2025-05-27T04:00:59.000Z,"Massive Whale Activity Detected on Binance as Bitcoin Tests New Highs","Bitcoin’s momentum, which pushed the asset to a fresh all-time high of over $111,000 earlier this week, appears to have paused slightly heading into the weekend. As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $108,499, marking a 2.5% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term retracement, the overall market trend remains positive. Bitcoin has held most of its recent gains and remains just below its record peak set yesterday. The recent price action has coincided with an increase in on-chain signals, suggesting that large players are returning to the market. Notably, analysts are closely monitoring activity from major crypto exchanges like Binance, which have historically played a significant role in price discovery and market direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Smashes Past $111K, But Are Traders About to Dump? Bitcoin Whale Activity on Binance Sparks Volatility Watch A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk highlighted a surge in whale activity on Binance. In his QuickTake post titled “Binance Whale Activity Spikes — Eyes on the Market,” the analyst pointed out that the Binance Whale Activity Score has seen a sharp rise. This metric, which measures inflow and outflow behavior of the top 10 whale wallets on Binance, indicates that large holders are actively repositioning. These movements can be early indicators of upcoming volatility and directional shifts in the market. The analyst explained that inflow spikes from whales may point to potential distribution or strategic selling, while outflow surges often signal accumulation or redeployment of capital to other platforms. The significance of these whale movements lies in their historical tendency to precede major price developments. According to Crazzyblockk, Binance remains a central venue for price formation, making it critical to observe whale patterns there. He concluded that these inflow-outflow fluctuations could introduce higher liquidity and possibly increased volatility in the short term. Spot Market Data Points to Renewed Buyer Interest Complementing these observations is a report from another CryptoQuant analyst, Ibrahimcosar, who identified a positive shift in spot market behavior. According to the analyst, the Spot Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) over the past 90 days has turned green again. This metric reflects the difference between taker buy and taker sell volumes and serves as a proxy for real-time demand. A green phase indicates that market buy orders have become dominant, suggesting that buyers are regaining control. The analyst noted that in previous months, the same chart showed mostly red values, indicating a prevalence of sell orders and downward price pressure. The recent transition back into green territory may suggest the emergence of new demand as Bitcoin challenges its previous highs.

2025-05-27T03:51:15.000Z,"Digital Assets See $3.3B Weekly Inflows Despite XRP’s Historic Reversal","After an unprecedented 80-week streak of inflows, XRP faced a sharp reversal with outflows totaling $37.2 million – the highest on record. This drop came despite a strong performance from broader digital asset investment products, which attracted $3.3 billion in inflows last week. According to CoinShares, the inflows brought the six-week inflow streak to a cumulative $10.5 billion. Year-to-date inflows have now hit a record-breaking $10.8 billion, while total assets under management briefly reached an all-time high of $187.5 billion. Investors Flock to Diversification Analysts attribute this momentum to rising economic uncertainty in the US, especially following Moody’s credit downgrade and surging treasury yields, which are pushing investors toward digital asset diversification. The latest edition of ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report revealed Bitcoin dominated digital asset inflows last week with $2.9 billion, and accounted for a quarter of total inflows in 2024. Interestingly, some investors viewed its price rally as a chance to short, which resulted in $12.7 million flowing into short-Bitcoin products – the highest since December 2024. Ethereum followed with $326 million in inflows, which represented its strongest in 15 weeks and the fifth straight week of positive sentiment. Meanwhile, Solana and Sui also saw inflows of $4.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Chainlink and Cardano performed modestly as well, clocking in inflows of $0.9 million and $0.6 million, during the same period. Alongside XRP, multi-asset products bucked the positive trend as witnessing $1.9 million in outflows. Switzerland, Sweden Report Outflows Regionally, the US continued to lead digital asset inflows with $3.2 billion last week, far ahead of other regions. Germany, Hong Kong, and Australia followed with $41.5 million, $33.3 million, and $10.9 million, respectively. Canada saw modest inflows of just $0.1 million during the past week. On the other hand, Swiss investors took profits amid rising prices, which led to $16.6 million in outflows. Sweden also experienced $12.1 million in outflows, while Brazil recorded $1.9 million exiting the market over the same period.

But is it happening now, or are we still stuck in the Bitcoin season? A group of experts recently weighed in, and here’s what they had to say. Are We in Altcoin Season Right Now? Popular crypto analyst, Scott Melker, thinks we may have just experienced a mini altcoin season. He pointed out that while Bitcoin has been rising steadily, several altcoins also made big moves recently — something we haven’t seen in a long time. Ethereum, for example, jumped 40% in just two days at one point. What made this special is that Bitcoin’s dominance (its share of the overall crypto market) actually dropped while its price went up. In the past, when Bitcoin climbed, altcoins usually stayed flat or fell. This time, both moved up together — a sign to some that new money might be entering the market rather than traders just shifting funds between Bitcoin and altcoins. But Can We Really Have Another Altcoin Season Like the Old Days? The short answer: probably not in the same way. There’s a massive number of new crypto projects waiting on the sidelines. Venture capitalists and developers are holding off on launching thousands of new tokens until market conditions improve. When those hit the market, they’ll spread investor money thinner — making it harder for every altcoin to rise together like we’ve seen in past altcoin seasons. Instead, the experts believe the next altcoin run will be narrative-driven. In other words, only certain types of coins will pump at certain times based on market trends and hype. For example, it could be memecoins one month, AI-related tokens the next, or maybe DeFi (decentralized finance) projects on Solana or Ethereum. So, rather than a “throw a dart and watch everything rise” market, investors will need to be tuned in daily to catch the right trends at the right times.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-2025-is-done-whats-next-for-cryptos-underdogs/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET","News|Altcoins|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T03:40:45.000Z,"Top 10 Insights From TOKEN2049 Dubai 2025 – The Future of Crypto, AI and Web 3.0","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Attending TOKEN2049 was a breathtaking experience. Set in Dubai, the event drew over 15,000 attendees and industry leaders. Dubai has now established itself as the global center of blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3.0 – and the heart of the MENA (Middle East, North Africa) region. This conference was full of optimism and celebration at the significant steps that blockchain, DeFi and Web 3.0 took worldwide. Here are 10 key takeaways from the TOKEN 2049 event. 1. AI-blockchain synergy Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents were instrumental in key blockchain use cases like fraud detection, analytics and smart contract optimization. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) clouds could cut AI training costs by 50%. The blockchain x AI technology will be a powerful synergy for the road ahead. AI-driven blockchain audits will prevent over $50 billion in annual DeFi hacks. Cognitive smart contracts could become a new standard in secure computing. Fifty percent of the world’s AI training has the potential to be run on GPUs on the cloud in less than five years. With the explosion of use cases, AI and blockchain have the potential to reframe the Web 3.0 world as we know it. 2. DePIN technology will change the world DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) were everywhere at the conference. Some companies provided archival systems at 90% cheaper than traditional cloud computing giants. Distributed wireless grids, file systems, IaaS (intelligence-as-a-service), digital infrastructure and IoT systems stole the limelight. The DePIN market is expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. Decentralized Infrastructure provides power to the users and enables personal revenue. Smart cities could also be disaster-resistant with DePIN technology for electricity, internet, wireless systems, edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT). 3. Tokenized real-world assets are a reality Over $120 billion will be spent this year alone on tokenizing just real estate. Dubai’s VARA framework enables fractional blockchain ownership of luxury assets. This trend will only increase and cover everything from luxury cars to high-value assets like artwork. The RWA (real-world asset) tokenization market will hit the trillion-dollar market cap by as early as 2026. AI-managed investment portfolios with hold both crypto and real-world tokens. This is the long-awaited comeback of the security token in RWAs. Multiple institutions like banks, asset management firms and investment leaders are showing interest. 4. Bitcoin becomes mainstream Long seen as a speculative investment, Bitcoin is now a viable asset. With Trump’s presidency, multiple firms and institutions are investing in Bitcoin as a long-term purchase. The outlook for Bitcoin is incredibly optimistic, especially among core crypto followers. This is a key moment for cryptocurrency and Web 3.0 development. The legitimization of Bitcoin provides a solid foundation on which to build DeFi and Web 3.0 platforms. Companies are seeing past the hype and investing in Bitcoin heavily. Some analysts were even quoted predicting that Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2028. 5. MENA is the powerhouse of global Web 3.0 Crypto transfers in this region exceeded $330 billion in 2025, with 93% of transactions by institutions. UAE and Qatar were the main participants in this sector. The US will be implementing more relaxed crypto regulation – but until it does, the UAE, with its innovative regulations, will be the center of crypto globally. There are discussions to open up energy reserves like crude oil to tokenization and fractional ownership. 6. Stablecoins are the first accepted use case of crypto Stablecoins have become one of the backbones of global payments. Cross-border frictionless trading and commerce is now a reality with stablecoins. The share in cross-border transfers could rise to even 50% by around 2028. Stablecoins have seen massive adoption by individuals and institutions alike. As protocols evolve for DeFi, this trend is only set to increase and become even more common. 7. Breakthroughs in DAO governance In 2025, AI-powered voting systems in DAOs automated 30% of decisions in collective environments. This is the start of a widespread change in how systems are governed autonomously. DAO is a governance method that truly gives power to the people. It is predicted that even CeFi (centralized finance) systems will be using DAOs by 2030. For asset management, DAOs potentially represent a multi-trillion-dollar market. 8. Web 3.0 gaming breaks the casual barrier Major studios launched play-to-earn models with AAA gameplay. This is only the beginning of a huge shift in gaming as a whole. Extractive economics was only the beginning. The metaverse, player-generated assets and Web 3.0 gaming will change the way everyone games. Annual revenue could exceed $200 billion by 2029. Metaverse content will be immersive, VR/AR integrated and created primarily by AI. Play-to-earn could also include socially desirable changes in multiple sectors. 9. The importance of security As blockchain, DeFi and Web 3.0 move into acceptable investments, security is now the key. $1.2 billion was lost through blockchain scams in 2024 alone. Security standards need to evolve and keep up with advances in technology. As hackers use generative AI and sidechain attacks on major institutions – i t is critical that security standards be defined, refined and enhanced at least four times each year. Quantum computing, in particular, plays a very important role as perhaps the biggest threat to cybersecurity. Emerging technologies like ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) and biometric authentication need integration into blockchain systems. 10. Regulational clarity worldwide Perhaps the single biggest reason that Dubai became the crypto capital of the world – t he transparent and lenient regulations adopted by the UAE for crypto and blockchain. The US is expected to follow suit very soon with sweeping regulatory changes. In less than five years, as countries see the advantages of these regulations – e xpect similar changes all over the world and for crypto to become the defining standard of the wealth of the nations. This would truly introduce wealth distribution worldwide. Trump is soon expected to introduce regulatory changes in the US for crypto as well. The road ahead TOKEN2049 Dubai 2025 marks the point where crypto moves from labs to global infrastructure. There are many scams still at work, but crypto will be one of the defining forces of the modern world. As regulatory changes are made worldwide, expect the entire industry to grow by ten times at the very least by this time next year. The optimism is mixed with caution because of the lack of sweeping security standards and the lack of international regulatory enforcement. 2025 is the year when such changes are expected to take place. And there has never been a more exciting time to be involved in crypto, AI, DeFi, DePIN, blockchain and Web 3.0 – e ver.

2025-05-27T03:00:23.000Z,"Bitcoin Eyeing $112,000 After Bullish Double Bottom Breakout, Analyst Says","After a slight weekend slump that saw Bitcoin (BTC) dip to $106,600, the leading cryptocurrency has recovered most of its losses and is currently trading close to the $110,000 level. With bullish momentum building, several crypto analysts now believe that BTC may be on track to hit a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming days. Bitcoin To Surge To $112,000? Analyst Says Yes According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ibrahimcosar, Bitcoin is forming a classic bullish pattern on the hourly chart – the double bottom. The analyst described this setup as “one of the strongest reversal signals” in technical analysis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebound Signals Healthier Bull Market Without Overheating, Analyst Says Ibrahimcosar explained that this pattern signals a weakening of bearish pressure, with buyers poised to regain control of the market. The first bottom of this formation was observed on May 23 at $106,800, followed by a second low on May 25 at $106,600. For the uninitiated, the double bottom is a bullish reversal chart pattern that forms after a downtrend, characterized by two distinct lows at a similar level with a moderate peak – called neckline – in between. According to the CryptoQuant contributor, the current neckline is around $109,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is hovering just above this neckline, confirming the breakout. Importantly, the breakout was accompanied by a surge in trading volume, which analysts interpret as a sign of robust bullish momentum. If $109,000 holds as support, then price levels beyond $112,000 could be on the horizon. The analyst explained in their Quicktake post: Double bottoms are where the market says: ‘We’ve sold enough.’ When buyers defend the second bottom, it sends a message: Now it’s our turn. But remember, not every pattern plays out. Know your risk, make your decision. Fellow analyst Ali Martinez echoed this sentiment in a recent post on X, sharing the following BTC hourly chart that highlights a breakout from the recent downtrend. According to Martinez, Bitcoin is now targeting the $110,000 level and potentially higher. Good Days Ahead For BTC Following a rough first quarter in 2025, Bitcoin has shown significant recovery, surging from a local bottom of $74,508 on April 6 to nearly $110,000. This recent rally has revived bullish sentiment across the market. Related Reading: Technical Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Blow Off Top To $325,000 – The Timeline Will Shock You ​​Fueling the optimism are strong inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating renewed institutional interest. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s open interest recently hit a fresh all-time high, reinforcing expectations of continued price momentum. However, not all indicators are aligned. Bitcoin whales – large holders of BTC – have shown mixed behavior, with some accumulating while others appear to be taking profits.

To be clear, no one’s promising moon boots here. But according to analyst Cheeky Crypto, the risk-versus-reward setup for XRP today looks a lot like Bitcoin’s awkward teenage years, back when the loudest voices called it a scam while quiet hodlers quietly became millionaires. What’s Been Holding XRP Back? XRP has been around since 2012. While it made solid gains early on, its price has been weighed down by a long legal fight between Ripple (the company behind XRP) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That lawsuit kept many big exchanges from listing XRP and made investors nervous. But now, that legal battle seems to be nearing an end. Settlement talks and court updates are happening regularly. Many believe that once the case is over, XRP could finally get the momentum it’s been missing. The Numbers Get Wild — Even with Small Gains Let’s talk numbers. Even if XRP only manages to follow a small portion of Bitcoin’s past performance, the gains are huge. If XRP matched 10% of Bitcoin’s historic growth, its price could jump to over $5,300. If it matched just 1%, that’s still a jump to $53 — far above today’s price of around $2.33. And that’s without including other possible boosts, like Ripple burning excess tokens, launching new global payment partnerships, or adding more banks to its network. What About the Huge Token Supply? One concern people often raise is XRP’s large total supply — 100 billion tokens, compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. But what really matters is market cap — the total value of all coins combined. If Ripple manages to handle even a small portion of the $150 trillion in global cross-border payments each year, it could easily justify higher prices without breaking financial logic. Yes, there are risks. The SEC could drag out appeals, other regulators might get involved, or Ripple might stumble in integrating new partnerships. Those aren’t imaginary threats — they’re very real. But risk is why rewards exist. If XRP had zero uncertainties, it wouldn’t be sitting at $2. So, is XRP the next Bitcoin? Maybe not. But could it surprise everyone once the legal dust settles?

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Uniswap's UNI token surged from $6.00 to $6.65 over the past 24 hours, pushing the token up 5%, while the broader market gauge CoinDesk20 Index fell 1.8% in the last 24 hours. This momentum coincides with Uniswap recording its highest monthly transaction volume since February, processing over $73 billion in trades and generating more than $380 million in revenue this year, as institutional interest grows and a notable whale re-entered the market by acquiring nearly $4 million worth of UNI. SCB10X’s New CEO Sees US-Asia Crypto Dealflow, AI Opportunities Kaweewut Temphuwapat, the new CEO of SCB10X, the venture arm of Thailand's SCB bank, sees significant opportunities emerging at the intersection of AI, crypto, and Web3. \""We definitely [are] going more on AI and also crypto and AI plus crypto,\"" Temphuwapat told CoinDesk, highlighting these hybrid investments as firmly \""under our radar.\"" He predicts clearer crypto regulation in the U.S. will fuel increased deal flow into resilient Asian markets, noting SCB10X's early success investing in Ripple: \""We are an early investor in Ripple of 10 years ago… we've used that technology for the last five to six years in our SCB App.\"" Temphuwapat praised Thailand’s proactive and innovative regulators, highlighting the country's robust payments infrastructure. He expects Thai banks, including SCB, could soon directly hold crypto tokens on their balance sheets, initially through regulatory sandboxes: \""The intention is there... they allow us to do [it] in a small scale.\"" Trader James Wynn Shifts From Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Bets to Memecoins, Goes Long Pepe Pseudonymous trader \""James Wynn,\"" known for high-stakes crypto bets on decentralized platform Hyperliquid, has shifted focus from billion-dollar bitcoin positions to memecoins, recently placing a leveraged $1 million bet on Pepe (PEPE), CoinDesk reported earlier. Previously, Wynn closed a massive $1.2 billion bitcoin long position at a $17.5 million loss, before pivoting to a $1 billion short position at 40x leverage, effectively wagering their entire $50 million wallet balance on bitcoin’s downside. That short briefly netted Wynn about $3 million in profit before closing, marking one of the largest trades ever executed fully on-chain. Wynn announced stepping back from perpetual trading after securing a cumulative profit of $25 million, earned from an initial investment of just over $3 million. The trader’s latest high-leverage PEPE position has already gained $500,000 amid a nearly 6% rise in the memecoin's value. Strategy Buys Another 4,020 Bitcoin for $427M, Total Holdings Surpass 580K BTC Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, purchased an additional 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for roughly $427 million, bringing its total holdings to 580,250 BTC, CoinDesk previously reported . The acquisition was funded through three separate at-the-market equity programs, including sales of common and preferred stock totaling approximately $427 million. These latest bitcoin purchases were executed at an average price of $106,237 per coin, pushing Strategy’s total investment in bitcoin to over $40.6 billion, at an average cost basis of $69,979 per coin. The acquisitions reflect the company’s ongoing commitment to expanding its sizable bitcoin holdings through regular capital raises and share issuances. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin holds steady near record levels around $109,000, consolidating gains despite tariff-induced volatility, as long-term investors continue accumulating amid macroeconomic uncertainty. ETH: Ethereum maintains resilience above $2,500 amid volatility and cautious whale behavior, supported by continued institutional inflows into spot ETH ETFs. Gold: Gold dips slightly on tariff delay but stays above $3,310 as deficit concerns fuel bullish outlook.

The company hopes to buy another 590 Bitcoin ( BTC ) with the funds, increasing its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, the Blockchain Group said on May 26. Bitcoin is trading at over $109,00, and at current prices, the Blockchain Group could buy 658 BTC with the total amount it raised, according to CoinGecko. However, the company said only 95% of the proceeds from the issuance will be used to buy Bitcoin ; the remainder is marked for “operational expenses and to pay management fees.” Source: Alexandre Laizet Venture capital firm Fulgur Ventures invested the lion’s share for the bond sale, with 55.3 million euros ($62.9 million), while crypto private investment fund Moonlight Capital invested 5 million euros ($5.7 million). The bonds will be convertible into shares of the Blockchain Group at 3.809 euros ($4.34). The Blockchain Group (ALTBG) is listed on Euronext Paris, Europe’s second-largest stock exchange by market cap. The company’s website says it is focused on “increasing the number of Bitcoin per share over time by leveraging the holding company’s excess cash and appropriate financing instruments.” ALTBG closed May 26 trading down nearly 5.5% at 2.77 euros ($3.16), but has gained nearly 766% so far this year, according to Google Finance. After the company started buying Bitcoin on Nov. 5, the stock spiked 225% to 0.48 euros ($0.52). The Blockchain Group’s stock price has made significant gains since the company announced its Bitcoin buying plan. Source: Google Finance In its 2024 financial year results, released April 30, the Blockchain Group listed the current yield from its Bitcoin holdings at over 709%. Meanwhile, its total consolidated revenue for the year was 13,864,000 euros ($15.8 million) compared to 20,408,000 euros ($23.2 million) for the previous fiscal year, representing a decrease of 32.1%. As part of its results, the company said its long-term strategy is to acquire 1% of the total Bitcoin supply over the next eight years, with a target of over 170 by 2032. More companies take the “orange pill” A growing number of public companies are buying Bitcoin to hold for the long term in the hopes of making gains from the asset. Related: Metaplanet is raising another $21M through bonds to buy more Bitcoin Swedish health tech company H100 Group AB became one of the latest companies to take the orange pill after announcing a Bitcoin-buying pivot on May 22. Strive Asset Management also announced on May 7 that it will transition into a Bitcoin treasury company . Experts speculate there are tangible long-term benefits for a company holding Bitcoin despite its unpredictable volatility, such as a hedge against inflation, long-term price appreciation and theoretically lower correlation to equity markets over time.

Beginning Tuesday the 27th, the world’s largest cryptocurrency will be at the centre of its own ecosystem, Wall Street’s macro diary and one of the most closely watched bankruptcy wind-downs in digital-asset history. Bitcoin Week Of Fire The epicentre is Bitcoin 2025, the annual industry gathering that this year takes over The Venetian in Las Vegas from 27–29 May. Organisers expect more than 30 000 attendees and have added a new “Code + Country” policy track to underline Bitcoin’s emergence as a political wedge issue. “This is more than a headline moment — it’s a signal,” BTC Inc. chief executive David Bailey said when announcing the keynote roster. “Bitcoin is the most exciting financial innovation in the world. It’s at the forefront of the national conversation.” Related Reading: $200,000 Bitcoin ‘Is Real’ By Year-End, Says Top Researcher For the first time a sitting US vice-president will speak at a crypto conference: JD Vance is due on the main stage Wednesday morning, 28 May. His team has trailed a defence of “innovation, financial sovereignty and a more resilient American future,” and public filings show personal Bitcoin holdings worth up to half a million dollars. Moreover, “Crypto Czar” David Sacks, Bo Hines, Executive Director of President Donald Trump’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets and US Senator Cynthia Lummis will speak on Tuesday. The political guest list does not end there. From abroad, Brexit campaigner – and now Reform UK leader – Nigel Farage has confirmed a fireside interview, arguing that national sovereignty and “free speech” run parallel to Bitcoin’s ethos. “We are pleased to announce that Nigel Farage will join the speaker lineup at the Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas,” organisers wrote in a statement last week, framing his return as a natural sequel to his 2023 appearance in Amsterdam. Also slated are Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., underlining how thoroughly the Republican establishment has embraced the event. While cameras focus on the Venetian halls, traders will be wiring what the FTX Recovery Trust calls “over $5 billion” to thousands of former customers of the failed exchange. The second distribution round, beginning Thursday 30 May, will see creditors recover between 54 % and 120 % of their dollar-denominated claims, with BitGo and Kraken acting as agents. Because many claimants sold other crypto holdings to cover losses in 2022, analysts will watch whether a fresh injection of spendable dollars feeds directly back into the market.

Twenty-four hours later comes the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ second estimate of first-quarter GDP; the advance print showed a 0.3 % annualised contraction, a surprise that rattled rate-cut odds in early May. Finally, Friday brings the April Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, with publication set for 30 May at 08:30 EDT. March’s core PCE was flat month-on-month and 2.6 % year-on-year; economists now infer a 0.2 % MoM rebound for April, keeping the YoY pace at 2.6 %. The estimate comes from translating the latest CPI release into PCE weights. Headline PCE inflation has already slowed to 2.3 % YoY in March, its lowest in four years.

2025-05-27T01:50:42.000Z,"XRP Price Prediction For May 27","The post XRP Price Prediction For May 27 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price has been cooling off lately, following the overall crypto market’s lead. At the moment, Bitcoin is holding up better than most altcoins — and that includes XRP. With Bitcoin dominance staying strong, many altcoins like XRP are struggling to keep up. As Bitcoin moves sideways or pulls back, it puts pressure on altcoins, causing short-term drops. Right now, XRP is in a cooling-off phase and experiencing a slight pullback. At the moment, XRP’s price is stuck between a support level around $2.30 and resistance at around $2.34 to $2.35. If the price manages to break above $2.35 with a strong daily candle close, it could move toward the next resistance zone between $2.43 and $2.44. Beyond that, there’s a major resistance waiting between $2.55 and $2.62. On the flip side, if XRP fails to hold above $2.30, the next important support level to watch is in the $2.10 to $2.15 range. A Bullish Signal Forming? Interestingly, on the 6-hour chart, there’s a possible bullish divergence forming. While the price has been making lower lows, the RSI is showing slightly higher lows. This is often an early signal that a price bounce could be on the way. However, it’s not confirmed yet. Traders would need to see the price hold steady and start trending upward alongside a rising RSI to take it seriously. For now, Bitcoin’s short-term cool-off is weighing on XRP’s momentum. Even if this bullish divergence plays out, it might not lead to a significant move unless Bitcoin stabilizes or starts climbing again. The good news is, a deeper pullback isn’t necessarily bad news for XRP. What Needs to Happen Next If the price drops to around $2.00 and finds solid support there, it could set up for a major bullish pattern on the daily chart — an inverse head and shoulders. This pattern is typically a sign of a coming reversal to the upside. But to confirm it, XRP would need to pull back to the $2.00 area, bounce back toward the $2.60 zone, and then break above $2.62 with strong daily candle closes. Until then, it remains a possible but unconfirmed setup.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-may-27/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T01:15:00.000Z,"Bitlayer secures 31.5% of Bitcoin's hashrate to bring smart contracts to BTC","Bitlayer’s Bitcoin smart-contract system is being implemented by mining pools behind 31.5% of the network’s hashrate, a development that will help ensure that its system will operate on the Bitcoin blockchain, the company said. According to a May 27 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Bitlayer’s BitVM implementation will be supported by major Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining pools including Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool. Antpool CEO Andy Chow said: \""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.” BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups. Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backbone A BitVM implementation Bitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners: “This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“ Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer. BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function. Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVM Mining pool support According to Hashrate Index data , Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of 31.5%. Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate Index This is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications. With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development. A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.

They tried to move 843,166 USDT to a safe wallet. Instead, they sent a chunk of it to the wrong address. Then they did it again—this time sending $1.7 million to the same scammer. It’s a costly reminder that even small slips can erase fortunes. Copy-Paste Blunder Leads To Million-Dollar Loss According to on-chain records, the victim first moved $838,611 in USDT to the right address (0x4668D1Fe87444a4d750…).

2025-05-27T01:00:22.000Z,"Litecoin Rallies, Pepe Breaks Key Levels, and Unstaked Nears $10M in Presale! Here’s Why UNSD Is The Next Big Crypto Opportunity","Meme coins and well-known tokens like Litecoin (LTC) are grabbing attention again, with Litecoin’s recent rally and Pepe (PEPE) showing bullish potential. But while these familiar faces dominate the headlines, there’s a rising star quietly making waves: Unstaked. With nearly $10 million raised in presale, Unstaked is far more than a trend, it’s a project driven by automation, AI, and real blockchain utility. While Litecoin benefits from an ETF delay and Pepe rides the wave of Ethereum’s rally, Unstaked is building a solid foundation for long-term success with active development and community rewards. With a potential 28x ROI before its public launch, the real question is whether Unstaked is already the smartest “crypto to invest in” for sustainable, utility-focused returns. Litecoin Defies Expectations with Impressive Rally Even with the SEC delaying its ETF approval, Litecoin (LTC) has shown surprising strength. The coin jumped over 12% in a single day, breaking through the $90 mark, and saw its trading volume surge by nearly 69%, reaching over $900 million. This rally is even more impressive considering the ETF decision was pushed back, something that usually cools market enthusiasm. What’s driving this momentum? Litecoin’s deep connection to Bitcoin. Both cryptocurrencies share a proof-of-work model and similar monetary structures, but Litecoin’s use of the Scrypt algorithm means faster transaction times and wider accessibility. Now, traders are keeping a close eye on Litecoin’s next big move. The $96 resistance level is key, with some speculating a rise to $105 or even $120 if it breaks through. Whale activity is picking up, as large holders begin to consolidate their positions. All of this reinforces Litecoin’s place as a reliable, long-term investment, especially for risk-conscious portfolios. Is Pepe Set for a Major Breakout? The Pepe (PEPE) price outlook has turned bullish, with the coin breaking out of a multi-week symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling a shift in momentum. Trading at around $0.000014, PEPE has successfully cleared a critical upper trendline and held firm at the 50-level RSI support, signaling strength. Key indicators like Momentum (10) and MACD (12, 26) are now flashing buy signals, suggesting that a larger upward movement could be on the horizon. That said, resistance at $0.00001477 and $0.0000178 is still in play, and traders are keeping an eye on those levels. With daily gains of 10-20% still in the cards, PEPE could see significant volatility. Some analysts are more optimistic: Solberg Invest anticipates a move toward $0.000025, while trader Kaleo sees PEPE potentially reaching a market cap between $10B and $20B in the long run. As ETH and BTC rally, meme coins like PEPE are often magnets for speculative capital, but questions about their long-term value still linger. Unstaked: Building a Real Web3 Ecosystem with AI Unlike the constant buzz around popular meme coins and long-established tokens, Unstaked is taking a more focused and strategic approach. Currently in Stage 15 of its presale with nearly $10 million raised, this project is carving out a unique space in the Web3 world, driven by AI agents and a Proof of Intelligence governance model. Unstaked stands out by allowing users to earn not just by holding assets, but by deploying autonomous AI agents that work across platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord. These agents are already in testing, with plans to expand to Instagram later this year. And it doesn’t stop there; later this year, the Agent Customization Marketplace will be launched, allowing users to create, buy, and sell AI routines based on actual performance. Financially, Unstaked continues to impress. With a public launch price set at $0.1819 and early presale prices starting at just $0.009831, investors are eyeing significant returns, up to 28x if goals are met. On top of that, the project is promising substantial liquidity post-launch, offering stability rare in today’s presale market. To fuel even more excitement, Unstaked has launched a $1 million giveaway, offering $50,000 in tokens to 20 lucky winners. Entry requires social engagement and a $100 purchase, blending gamification with genuine buyer commitment. In a sea of projects that fail to deliver, Unstaked’s active ecosystem and clear financial strategy are making it one to watch in 2025. Looking Ahead While the latest Litecoin (LTC) market trends and the renewed buzz around Pepe (PEPE) show that crypto enthusiasm is still alive, these coins rely largely on momentum, market conditions, and their past reputation. Unstaked, however, is carving out its space by focusing on real infrastructure, automation, and community-driven growth rather than speculation. With presale commitments nearing $10 million, Unstaked is proving that utility, smart incentives, and long-term vision can rival, and even outpace, legacy and meme coins. In a market full of quick flips and unfulfilled promises, Unstaked stands out as a strong choice for anyone looking for a crypto investment with genuine real-world use, solid financial structure, and early-stage opportunities in the AI-powered Web3 landscape.

2025-05-27T01:00:00.000Z,"Bitlayer Joins Forces With Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool to Supercharge Bitcoin DeFi","Bitlayer, a Bitcoin Layer 2 built on the BitVM paradigm, has partnered with three of the world’s largest bitcoin BTC mining pools — Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool — in a first-of-its-kind collaboration to accelerate the real-world adoption of BitVM, a breakthrough technology focused on enabling Bitcoin-native DeFi. Bitcoin’s ecosystem has lagged behind other Layer 1s like Ethereum for years due to technical limitations — especially its lack of support for Turing-complete smart contracts. Bitlayer’s BitVM paradigm addresses this by offering Bitcoin-equivalent security and Turing completeness without altering Bitcoin’s core protocol or compromising its foundational design. But turning that vision into reality requires the cooperation of miners — the entities that create new blocks and validate transactions in exchange for BTC. That’s precisely what this new partnership secures. The three mining pools, representing over 36% of Bitcoin’s total computing power (hashrate), have agreed to support non-standard transactions (NSTs) — a critical piece of BitVM’s challenge-response mechanism, the firms said. Their support removes a key bottleneck to BitVM deployment and brings the system closer to widespread use. NSTs are transactions that are valid under Bitcoin’s consensus rules but are not relayed by the default Bitcoin Core software, making them hard to get confirmed on-chain without miner cooperation. Under this partnership, Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool will serve as guardians of the BitVM Bridge, ensuring NSTs are reliably included in blocks and become part of Bitcoin’s immutable ledger. The BitVM bridge is a special tool that facilitates secure and reliable movement of BTC into other blockchain ecosystems — such as rollups, cross-chain protocols, and smart contracts — without relying on centralized intermediaries. It opens the door for broader Bitcoin DeFi applications while preserving the network’s robust security guarantees. “BitVM represents the most credible path to bring on-chain validation to Bitcoin while maintaining its core security. This partnership solves the critical last-mile challenge of getting Non-Standard Transactions included on-chain,” said Kevin He, co-founder of Bitlayer, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. A win for miners This isn’t just a milestone for Bitlayer — it’s a strategic win for miners as well, especially as they face dwindling income due to per-block BTC rewards being cut in half every four years. Andy, CEO of Antpool, noted that Bitlayer's BitVM can help drive new economic activity and fee-based income for miners. \""Built on BitVM, Bitlayer enables BTC to flow into DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems. That means more use, more fees, and long-term sustainability for miners,\"" Andy said in the press release. Leon Liang, chief strategy officer at F2Pool, emphasized the importance of innovation, saying, \""we want to support high-quality projects like Bitlayer that expand what Bitcoin can do.” SpiderPool CTO Kenway spoke to the broader potential of Bitcoin as a financial services platform, stating, \""This partnership lets us unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin DeFi. It enhances Bitcoin’s utility while reinforcing miners’ central role in the ecosystem.” Demand for bitcoin DeFi is growing rapidly Bitlayer’s collaboration with mining giants follows recent integrations with major Layer 1 ecosystems like Sui, Base, Arbitrum, and Starknet. Together, these partnerships reflect a growing demand for secure, Bitcoin-native DeFi infrastructure that scales. Bitlayer is actively onboarding more validators and early adopters to help secure and expand the BitVM Bridge — and to build what could become the cornerstone of Bitcoin’s next evolution.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/05/27/bitlayer-joins-forces-with-antpool-f2pool-and-spiderpool-to-supercharge-bitcoin-defi,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY","Finance|Bitcoin|Bitvm|Antpool|F2Pool|Mining|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T00:34:04.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Advance Pauses, but Big-Money Buyers Remain Undeterred","Bitcoin’s blistering rally to record highs paused just shy of the $110,000 milestone on May 26, yet institutional demand continued to swell in the background, cushioning any immediate downside pressure. The flagship cryptocurrency dipped after momentum faded during Asia-Pacific trading, lingering near $108,500 as traders weighed looming United States inflation data and the imminent earnings release from chipmaker Nvidia. Market watchers attributed the hesitation in part to President Donald Trump’s decision to delay retaliatory European Union tariffs until July 9, a move that eased equity jitters but left macro uncertainty hanging over risk assets. Even so, derivatives desks reported a steady uptick in the Bitcoin two-month futures premium, which climbed from 6.5% to 8% in twenty-four hours, signaling that sophisticated traders were confidently rebuilding long exposure rather than capitulating. Institutional appetite offsets price lull Evidence of that confidence was nowhere clearer than in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which attracted $2.75 billion of net inflows between May 19 and May 25, according to preliminary custodial data. Wall Street giants appear increasingly comfortable marketing those vehicles to core clients; JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon told investors the bank would “finally allow clients” to purchase the products, creating a new pathway for its $6 trillion deposit base to gain indirect crypto exposure. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor underlined the theme by revealing a fresh $427 million Bitcoin acquisition at an average price of $106,237, lifting the business-intelligence firm’s holdings to more than 239,000 BTC. Options data delivered a complementary bullish signal: the 30-day put-call delta skew turned negative 6%, implying traders were paying a premium for upside hedges while pricing limited probability of a violent sell-off. Macro cross-currents in focus For now, analysts caution that headline economic releases could dictate the next directional break. The Richmond Fed manufacturing index is due on May 28, followed two days later by the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index, and a hotter-than-forecast print could rekindle concerns about higher-for-longer interest rates. Nvidia’s earnings, expected after the closing bell on May 28, represent another wildcard; a disappointing read-through on artificial-intelligence hardware demand could sap risk appetite across equities and spill into crypto. Nevertheless, bulls argue that Bitcoin’s structural bid, driven by ETFs and treasury strategies, should limit any retracement toward $105,000, the level that marked last week’s low. Path to new highs Bitcoin remains just 2.6% below its all-time high of $111,957, and several desks believe a decisive break above $112,000 could trigger systematic short covering and ignite a fresh leg toward the psychologically potent $120,000 handle. Skeptics counter that rising U.S. government debt worries and a softer housing market, highlighted by a 5.1% weekly drop in mortgage applications, might cap enthusiasm until clearer evidence emerges that the economy can navigate tight monetary conditions. With U.S. markets closed for the Memorial Day holiday, liquidity is expected to thin, raising the likelihood of abrupt moves driven by a handful of large orders on offshore exchanges.

Over 70% Of XRP Realized Cap Is Six Months Old Or Younger In a post on X, Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt.₿ has talked about the capital inflow situation related to XRP. The indicator of relevance here is the “Realized Cap,” which is a model that, in short, keeps track of the sum of the cost bases of all addresses on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Greed Is Here—Time To Be A Contrarian? In other words, the indicator provides an estimate of the total amount of capital that the holders as a whole have invested into the cryptocurrency. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how this metric has changed for XRP over the past decade. As is visible in the graph, the XRP Realized Cap (black curve) has witnessed an explosion alongside the recent bullish push in the asset’s price. This would imply that a large amount of new capital has come into the cryptocurrency. In the same chart, the Glassnode researcher has also attached the data related to the Realized Cap associated with the different coin groups younger than six months. The aggregated Realized Cap has seen its growth during the past six months, so it’s not surprising to see that the capital held by cohorts falling in this age range has seen its share of the indicator blow up. This massive capital wouldn’t be in any significant profit, however, considering the price levels at which it has flowed in. After all, the window of the past six months is mostly just the cryptocurrency’s top and the subsequent phase of stagnation that’s still ongoing today. “Over 70% of the capital locked in XRP was deployed near the top over the past 6 months,” notes the analyst. Naturally, this could put the digital asset in a delicate situation, as it wouldn’t take much of a drawdown to throw all these investors into the red. It now remains to be seen how the coin would develop in the near future and whether capital would continue to flow in, despite the fact that its price has been unable to revisit the highs from January. In some other news, the XRP network has seen a sharp decline in the Number of Active Addresses since the March peak, as CryptoVizArt.₿ has pointed out in another X post. The Number of Active Addresses is an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the number of addresses taking part in transaction activity on the XRP network every day. Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals From the chart, it’s apparent that the Number of Active Addresses set a huge peak in March of this year, but since then, activity on the blockchain has taken a severe hit as the metric has gone down by more than 90%.

Under the surface, U.S. fiscal policy decisions and the advancement of the GENIUS Act are redefining how institutional capital, retail investors, and policymakers approach the crypto sector. Bitcoin recently set a new all-time high near $112,000 before pulling back slightly. That move wasn’t just technical — it was driven by macroeconomic shifts, including concerns over U.S. sovereign debt, inflationary pressure, and a recalibration of monetary policy. For many investors, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as both a high-growth asset and a long-term hedge against monetary uncertainty . The GENIUS Act: Opening the Door to Regulated Crypto Integration The GENIUS Act , recently passed in the U.S. Senate, focuses on establishing clearer frameworks around stablecoins, on-chain payments, and digital asset disclosures . It represents a formal shift in Washington’s tone — from adversarial to strategic. While not Bitcoin-specific, the Act provides institutional players with a pathway to explore digital asset exposure under clear rules. This regulatory clarity may help reduce the friction for broader adoption, especially among traditional financial institutions that have been cautious due to compliance risks. Bitcoin’s Role in a Changing Policy Landscape As U.S. fiscal dynamics remain volatile, Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized, supply-capped store of value continues to grow. With ETFs now active, institutional inflows are reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin isn’t speculative — it’s strategic. But as capital flows into blue-chip crypto assets, investors are also seeking earlier-stage exposure to high-upside opportunities. One project benefiting from this parallel trend is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a fast-growing crypto asset designed with a $0.007 listing target , fixed 100 billion supply , and upcoming staking utility . While Bitcoin remains the macro hedge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a strategic early-stage entry point with future utility built in. As regulation and fiscal conditions evolve, both institutional giants like Bitcoin and emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are playing key roles in what could be a transformative crypto decade.

Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions.“No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.”“Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.”Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapseMany crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110KCrypto exchanges Binance, Kraken and OKX and crypto asset manager Bitwise are among the industry players that have adopted the transparency measure.However, Saylor noted that proof-of-reserves often only show one side of the picture — what the company holds — and not what they owe.Source: Mitchell AskewSaylor’s Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 576,230 Bitcoin worth $62.6 million on its balance sheet, followed by Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings, which holds 48,137 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.More than 110 publicly traded companies worldwide have purchased and hold Bitcoin.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-says-proof-of-reserves-bad-idea?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%.

So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CointelegraphRelated: SEC acknowledges slew of crypto ETF filings as reviews, approvals accelerateChanging regulatory stanceUnder the previous US presidential administration, the SEC brought enforcement actions against several crypto firms for offering staking services it alleged were unregistered securities offerings.Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the SEC has softened its stance.In February, the agency issued guidance stating that memecoins do not qualify as investment contracts under US law. In April, the regulator clarified that stablecoins also do not qualify as securities if they are marketed solely as a means of making payments.Still, the agency has yet to approve staking in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or issue formal guidance on how staking services can be offered compliantly in the US.Other policy goalsMuehr said she is optimistic the SEC will eventually approve staking for cryptocurrency ETFs, including for proposed Solana (SOL) funds.“Getting there means first getting the SEC comfortable with the structure,” she said, noting the industry has recently had “some productive meetings with the agency.”“I’m hopeful we’ll see a Solana ETF and even a staked Solana ETF in the US sometime soon.”The SEC is not the only agency the crypto industry is looking to persuade. Muehr said the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — the top US tax authority — has also taken a position the industry opposes.“The IRS finally issued a statement saying staking rewards are service income,” she said. “We disagree with that interpretation and continue to engage.”Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-industry-groups-urge-sec-to-clarify-staking-stance?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

Investors in their 30s saw the biggest growth, up 29%, followed by those in their 40s (27%), while investors over 50 increased by 25%.The FIU’s findings show that older investors have larger holdings. By year-end, 221,000 investors held at least 100 million won (about $73,000) in crypto. Of those, 172,500 — or 78% — were over 40.Related: XRP and Solana race toward the next crypto ETF approvalIn February, the head of the financial industry association urged regulators to approve Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, citing rising demand among older investors. He argued that ETFs offer safer exposure than direct investment.The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has been a key campaign pledge for both Lee Jae-myung and Kim.

It’s a bit disappointing — we could have taken the lead ourselves,” Cho Jaewoo, assistant professor of social science at Hansung University, told Cointelegraph.However, the nation’s Capital Markets Act is a barrier that does not recognize crypto as eligible assets underlying ETFs. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ETFs under its dedicated crypto committee.Lee ahead in presidential election voter surveyYoon’s failed coup accelerated the presidential election and brought renewed urgency to unresolved issues in the local crypto industry.“In the 2022 presidential election, cryptocurrency was viewed as speculative and untrustworthy. But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said.South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In Q1 2024, the Korean won ranked as the most-traded fiat currency against crypto, driven largely by retail investors. Institutional players remain on the sidelines, awaiting their turn as the FSC prepares to launch pilot trading for professional investors.FSC’s planned schedule for a phased introduction of institutional crypto investment in 2025.Crypto policies were once seen as campaign strategies to sway younger voters, but this year, they’re seen as an economic and social issue that impacts multiple generations. In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs.“Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active. In the past, people looked at it with skepticism, but now it feels like the public is approaching it more neutrally and making their own judgments,” Cho said.Lee Jae-myung leads the latest voter survey by local media and Next Research.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services.

However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption.

In May, such tokens totaled $4.9 billion.  Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures. The data shows that $1.4 billion in tokens will be released through a “cliff unlock,” while $1.9 billion will be emitted through a “linear unlock.” Cliff unlocks release a large portion or all of the vested tokens simultaneously, while linear unlocks emit crypto assets gradually. Largest crypto token unlocks in JuneAmong the largest token unlocks in June is Metars Genesis (MRS), a non-fungible token (NFT) project that will release $193 million worth of tokens on June 21 to fund an artificial intelligence partnership.

The tokens will go to the Mysten Labs treasury, early contributors and the community reserve. The largest portion, valued at more than $70 million, is allocated to Series B investors.To date, Sui has unlocked 3.3 billion tokens valued at over $12 billion, roughly 33% of its total supply.

Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.Source: Cyvers AlertZero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction.

The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto.

After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

The restrictions specifically mentioned China, and the government cited concern over the risk that the technology “may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, its market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when US export restrictions first impacted its products, to 50% currently. Jensen Huang on Taiwanese TV.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet.

Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.Cathie Wood spoke to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas at Solana Accelerate on May 23. Source: SolanaSince spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US in January 2024, approximately $44.49 billion in inflows have been recorded, according to Farside data. Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs have seen approximately $2.77 billion in inflows since launching in July 2024.Wood said that spot Ether ETFs were “less successful than people were expecting” because the US Securities and Exchange Commission did not allow staking. On May 21, the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund.However, Wood still views Ether as the entry point for new investors to familiarize themselves with smart contracts before exploring other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL). “So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” Wood said.Related: ‘We are worried about a recession,’ but there’s a silver lining — Cathie WoodWood said that the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), in January on the Solana network may have caused investors to be skeptical of Solana.“Institutions and you’re saying 60-year-olds…I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” Wood said. Just days after its launch on Jan. 17, TRUMP slid around 50% after the president made no crypto-related “day one” executive orders.“I mean, that might scare them,” Wood said.

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-24T09:48:19.000Z,"Trump’s use of presidential seal at memecoin event raises legal questions","President Donald Trump is facing scrutiny after speaking at a private event for top investors in his $TRUMP memecoin while standing behind a lectern emblazoned with the official presidential seal — a move that may violate federal law.The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project.According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It’s not taking place here at the White House.”Related: Pictures give glimpse inside Trump’s memecoin holder dinnerTrump features presidential seal at private propertiesThis isn’t the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties. Forbes has previously reported its use as golf markers at several Trump-owned clubs.In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress.Source: Molly PloofkinsBloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.”Related: US lawmaker introduces anti-corruption bill ahead of Trump's dinnerTrump embraces crypto despite previous skepticismTrump’s embrace of crypto marks a sharp turn from his skepticism during his first term.

He explained that, since half of all capital in the world is essentially seeking the best store of value, more capital will “osmotically flow” into Bitcoin over time.“Over the last 2 years, an exodus from fiat assets (bonds and money) has already begun. Hard money assets (Bitcoin and gold) are where things are shifting,” he said.Source: Jesse MyersMyers said that there is around $318 trillion of capital in bonds “looking for greener pastures.” He said most of this capital is tied up in fixed-income institutional vehicles with “strict mandates.” “That’s where Bitcoin Treasury Companies come in,” Myers said.“Treasury Cos will be the primary bidders for BTC over the coming decades, deploying an ocean of SoV capital to BTC.”Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high, and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetWhile Strategy has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, other treasury companies are starting to emerge.On April 24, Twenty One Capital formed, which is a Bitcoin treasury company led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald.

2025-05-24T07:00:16.000Z,"Judge overturns fraud convictions in Mango Markets exploit case","A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets.On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform.Related: US DOJ seizes $24M in crypto from accused Qakbot malware developerJudge sides with EisenbergThe Justice Department argued that he deceived Mango’s smart contract-based lending system, but Eisenberg’s defense maintained that he merely exploited poorly designed, permissionless code — without making any false representations.Judge Subramanian agreed, writing that “Mango Markets was permissionless and automatic,” meaning the system couldn’t be deceived in a legal sense. “There was insufficient evidence of falsity,” the judge added, siding with Eisenberg’s interpretation of DeFi mechanics.US judge siding with Eisenberg on nature of the exploit. Source: Bwbx.ioThe judge also rejected prosecutors’ argument that the case should be heard in New York. Eisenberg was in Puerto Rico at the time of the trades, and the court found that no meaningful activity tied to the alleged crime occurred in New York.The DOJ had cited a Poughkeepsie-based Mango user and a third-party vendor in Manhattan, but the judge ruled these were not enough to establish proper venue.The US government must now decide whether to refile the vacated charges, though the Trump administration has recently signaled a reduced focus on crypto enforcement. Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material chargesEisenberg charged with child pornographyIn a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico. FBI officials charged the hacker with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation.A jury found Eisenberg guilty of wire fraud, commodities fraud, and commodities manipulation in April 2024.
