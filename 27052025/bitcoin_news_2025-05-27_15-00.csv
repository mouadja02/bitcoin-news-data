Ethereum price (ETH) has now broken above the $2,600 mark after taking solid support from the 200-day EMA band . It is igniting speculation about its rally to extend, which began earlier this month of May. With Bitcoin reaching an ATH , the hunger to get more gains is keeping the investors in a bullish mode, as a result, the broader crypto market is experiencing a bullish wave, and Ethereum appears set to capitalize on this bullish wave. The recent rally this month, accelerated from $1,792 on May 8 to peaking at $2,695 on May 14, marked a pump of over 50% in just 7 trading day sessions. Now, as ETH price is hinting at a similar rally to come, one analyst suggest it could rise as high as $2,900 in this week before the month end, only if market dynamics are favorable. However, another analyst remain highly optimistic about Ethereum’s long-term outlook, pointing to a strong bullish pattern forming on the monthly chart. They note that a multi-year support level has shaped a pennant formation, signaling a potential surge. Projections indicate that ETH could climb to $4,500 by 2025 , and if it successfully retests this level, it may then set its sights on a multi-year target of $8,000. This milestone is expected to serve as a crucial launching pad for even greater gains in the future.

Bitcoin Faces Critical Moment Before 2025 Conference appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin may be on the edge of a breakout, as the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 Conference kicks off May 27 in Las Vegas. While traders set their sights on a potential all-time high near $135,000, one critical support level could decide everything. Analyst CrypNuevo warns that if Bitcoin loses this zone, a sharp drop to the $100K mark might follow. Here’s what’s happening with Bitcoin’s chart right now. Retesting Support: A Bullish Flip in Action According to CrypNuevo , Bitcoin has successfully flipped a former resistance level into support, a promising structure known in technical analysis as an R/S (resistance/support) flip. This move is crucial because holding this level could keep the bullish momentum alive. If Bitcoin manages to stay above this level in the next few days, it could climb even higher. At the same time, well-known crypto expert Wise Advice believes that if Bitcoin follows the movement of the money supply (M2), its price could rise by about 24%, reaching $135K by July. Liquidation Zones Hint at $115K Target Looking at longer timeframes, CrypNuevo points out a cluster of liquidations between $112K and $114K. These areas tend to attract price movement, especially since they are above Bitcoin’s recent highs. If Bitcoin can break through this zone, a rise to $115K, a new all-time high, might happen. This level also matches where many traders’ long leveraged positions could be forced to close, which might speed up the price jump. Key Support Test Around $106K However, the short-term picture tells a slightly different story. There’s some liquidation pressure around $105,700, which suggests the price may dip and retest support near $106,000. If Bitcoin holds that level, it could offer a fresh and more favorable entry point for traders. However, if $106K fails, the price could fall further to the psychological $100K level. CrypNuevo notes this dip could shake weak hands but might also attract long-term buyers. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $$109,700 , reflecting a slight rise in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $2.18 trillion.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/135k-or-100k-bitcoin-faces-critical-moment-before-2025-conference/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T12:30:41.000Z,"Bitcoin Security: Urgent Quantum Computing Risk Revealed","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Security: Urgent Quantum Computing Risk Revealed Is the future of cryptocurrency security under threat? A recent revelation from Google suggests that a powerful, disruptive technology could impact the very foundations of crypto-grade encryption sooner than many experts anticipated. This isn’t just theoretical chatter; it comes from the cutting edge of quantum research, raising questions about the long-term resilience of our digital locks, including those safeguarding Bitcoin. Understanding the Looming Threat: Quantum Computing For years, quantum computing has been discussed as a potential future risk to current encryption standards. Unlike classical computers that store information as bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both simultaneously. This allows them to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers. While large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers are still some years away, progress is being made. The concern for cryptocurrency and other secure systems lies in the ability of quantum computers to potentially break the mathematical problems that underpin today’s most common public-key encryption methods. The Impact on RSA Encryption and Google’s Findings A key piece of this puzzle involves RSA encryption , one of the most widely used public-key cryptosystems globally. RSA’s security relies on the difficulty of factoring very large numbers – a task that takes classical computers an impractical amount of time. However, this is where quantum computers pose a significant threat. A recent research paper by Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney, reported by CoinDesk, presented a potentially concerning finding. The paper suggests that breaking RSA encryption using a quantum computer may require significantly fewer resources – potentially 20 times fewer – than previous estimates indicated. This doesn’t mean it’s possible tomorrow, but it does suggest the path to breaking RSA with quantum machines might be less resource-intensive than the cryptographic community had assumed. Think of it like this: If previous estimates said you needed a quantum computer the size of a skyscraper to break RSA, this new research suggests you might only need one the size of a large building. Still massive and complex, but a noticeable reduction in the required resources, potentially accelerating the timeline. How Shor’s Algorithm Threatens Modern Crypto The specific quantum algorithm that poses this threat is Shor’s algorithm , developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994. Shor’s algorithm can efficiently solve the integer factorization problem (used by RSA) and the discrete logarithm problem (used by Elliptic Curve Cryptography, or ECC). Both of these problems are considered computationally hard for classical computers, forming the basis of modern public-key cryptography. Here’s a simplified view of why Shor’s algorithm is so powerful against these systems: RSA: Relies on the difficulty of factoring a large composite number (the product of two large primes). Shor’s algorithm can find these prime factors efficiently. ECC: Relies on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem in an elliptic curve group. Shor’s algorithm can solve this problem efficiently as well. While the mathematical underpinnings are different, Shor’s algorithm provides a quantum shortcut for both. The Specifics: Bitcoin Security and ECC Now, let’s talk about Bitcoin security . Bitcoin does not use RSA encryption for its transaction signatures or wallet addresses. Instead, it primarily relies on Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). As mentioned, ECC is also vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm. Does this mean Bitcoin is immediately at risk? Not necessarily. There are nuances: Current Quantum Computers: The quantum computers built today are nowhere near powerful enough to run Shor’s algorithm at the scale required to break the large key sizes used in Bitcoin (typically 256-bit ECC keys). Address Reuse: The most vulnerable aspect of Bitcoin to Shor’s algorithm is when a user reuses a Bitcoin address after funds have been spent from it. At this point, the public key is exposed on the blockchain, making it theoretically vulnerable to a quantum attack if a powerful enough machine exists. Addresses used only for receiving funds (where only the hash of the public key is public) are considered more resistant, though not entirely immune to potential future attacks. Resource Estimates: While the Google paper focused on RSA, the implications for ECC are also relevant. Breaking ECC with Shor’s algorithm is generally estimated to require a quantum computer roughly the same size (in terms of qubits) as breaking RSA keys of comparable security strength, though specific estimates can vary. The Google paper didn’t specifically mention Bitcoin or ECC, but its finding that breaking one major public-key system (RSA) might be easier than thought naturally raises the question about the timeline for breaking other systems like ECC, which Bitcoin uses. The ‘Faster Than Expected’ Timeline: What Does it Mean? The phrase ‘faster than expected’ is relative. Experts have long placed the ‘quantum-apocalypse’ timeline for breaking current crypto somewhere between 10 to 30 years away, or even longer. The Google finding, suggesting a 20x reduction in required resources for RSA, could potentially shave some years off that estimate, at least for RSA. For ECC and Bitcoin, it reinforces the idea that the threat is real and warrants serious attention from researchers and developers. It’s crucial to understand that building a fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of running Shor’s algorithm on large keys is an immense engineering challenge. It requires millions of high-quality qubits and sophisticated error correction. We are currently in the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, which are far too small and error-prone for this task. However, the pace of quantum computing advancements is indeed accelerating. Governments and private companies are investing billions in this technology. Findings like Google’s highlight the importance of not being complacent. Addressing the Quantum Threat: The Rise of Post-Quantum Cryptography The cryptographic community is not sitting idle. Researchers worldwide are actively developing and standardizing new encryption algorithms designed to be resistant to attacks from future quantum computers. This field is known as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) . The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States has been running a multi-year process to evaluate and select the most promising PQC algorithms. Several candidates have reached the final stages, focusing on mathematical problems that are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers, such as lattice-based cryptography, hash-based cryptography, and code-based cryptography. Integrating these new algorithms into existing systems, including cryptocurrencies, will be a significant undertaking. It will require careful planning, testing, and consensus within the respective communities. Challenges and Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community The primary challenge is the uncertainty of the timeline. While the threat is real, predicting exactly when a large enough quantum computer will exist to break current crypto is impossible. This makes it difficult to know precisely when migration to PQC is critically necessary. For the average cryptocurrency user, the actionable insight is primarily one of awareness and preparedness: Stay Informed: Follow developments in both quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography. Support Research: Understand that ongoing research into PQC and its integration into blockchain technology is vital for long-term security. Address Reuse: As a good security practice, avoid reusing Bitcoin addresses, as this exposes your public key and is the most direct vector for a potential future quantum attack using Shor’s algorithm. Wallet Updates: In the future, expect wallet software and blockchain protocols to require updates to incorporate post-quantum secure algorithms. Ensure you keep your software updated when these solutions become available. For developers and protocol designers, the challenge is more immediate: evaluating PQC candidates, understanding their performance implications for decentralized systems, and planning for a potential future transition. Summary: A Quantum Future Requires Preparation Today The recent Google research highlighting that breaking RSA encryption might require fewer quantum resources than previously thought is a significant data point, reinforcing the growing concerns about the pace of quantum computing advancements. While Bitcoin’s use of ECC doesn’t make it directly vulnerable to the RSA-specific finding, both ECC and RSA are ultimately susceptible to Shor’s algorithm if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is built. This revelation serves as a stark reminder that the quantum threat to current crypto encryption is not science fiction; it’s a foreseeable challenge. While the exact timeline remains uncertain, the cryptographic community is actively working on solutions through post-quantum cryptography. For the crypto world, this means continued vigilance, research, and eventual migration to quantum-resistant algorithms will be necessary to ensure the long-term security and integrity of blockchain networks like Bitcoin.

2025-05-27T12:30:40.000Z,"Bitcoin Hits All-Time High: What Does It Mean For The Emerging Markets?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Hits All-Time High: What Does It Mean For The Emerging Markets? Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $110,000 recently, and experts see it jumping as high as $150,000 by the end of this year. The growing acceptance of cryptocurrency by the mainstream has entirely changed the financial landscape, as well as market dynamics. The global economy has felt its influence, but the most observable effect of crypto is seen in emerging markets and niche industries where traditional banking systems are failing to keep up with the public expectations and evolving needs. This article will explore the more profound implications of Bitcoin empowering individuals and various online communities, and how crypto is becoming an integral part of the global economy. A New Era For Online Communities Many gaming communities, esports groups, and marketplaces are making use of blockchain technology and, as a result, have experienced a rise in player engagement. Online Bitcoin casino games also show how player activity is on the rise due to the integration of crypto payment systems. As players with digital wallets are able to deposit and withdraw money at lightning-fast speeds, they tend to be less distracted by the financial issues and thus are able to immerse themselves more deeply in the gameplay. That gives online Bitcoin casinos an edge that keeps players coming back for more. Traditional payment methods such as wire transfers and credit cards, despite being fast, have always struggled to catch up with cryptocurrency technology. Online communities benefit from using crypto for casino games because they don’t have to worry about the shortcomings of financial institutions affecting their gaming experience. There are, of course, other advantages – better security and improved anonymity being high on the list. All of these things encourage people to check out Bitcoin casino games and try their hand at them. We’ll go into more detail on this in the following section. Catalyst For Improving Security & Existing Technologies Blockchain is the underlying technology of cryptocurrency, and the growing mainstream appeal of these currencies has created an ecosystem where many third-party developers are proactively designing new software that integrates with blockchain technology. Applications that integrate with blockchain systems aren’t exactly new, but their development used to be much slower, meaning that issues could remain unsolved for quite some time after being identified. This is no longer the case due to the increased public interest in Bitcoin. Existing technologies have much more to offer now. Users have access to features that go beyond just simple transactions. DeFi apps are opening a new world of opportunities for online communities and there are more and more ways that people can use their cryptocurrencies. Some of the prominent examples of this are staking , borrowing, and yield farming—all of which have been made far easier thanks to the increased interest in developing crypto-friendly applications. Likewise, there has been a surge of interest in crypto-games, especially those that allow people to gamble with their cryptocurrencies, but also others, such as ones that allow players to purchase in-game assets with crypto. The crypto casino is a big player in this space, but by no means alone. Boost To Cross-Border Transactions The integration of crypto payment systems in online gaming has been partially due to the ease with which these currencies allow their users to make cross-border payments at extremely low costs. A game developer’s audience might well be spread across the entire globe, after all. International transactions that involve financial institutions tend to be subject to high fees, especially if they include conversion charges or the transaction triggers additional security checks. Aside from that, it’s a lengthy process that often makes customers wait for days. Since both local and international transactions are near-instant with blockchain technology, players are able to access their favorite games from anywhere in the world as long as they are connected to the internet. Cryptocurrency has thus revolutionized cross-border payments, and traditional payment systems are losing popularity due to their inefficiency. As time passes, we will see more applications of blockchain in international transactions in various industries. Access To Settlement Layer A Bitcoin transaction gets irreversible confirmation in about 10 minutes—and is auditable by anyone, anywhere. In contrast, traditional payments with Visa or Mastercard often settle days or weeks after the payment is made, as this process is exclusively controlled by central banks and intermediaries. One of the critical components of a blockchain network called the “settlement layer” is responsible for verifying transactions and recording them on the network. This layer maintains the integrity of the immutable ledger and keeps the transaction records transparent to all users. What Does Bitcoin Mean For Economic Growth? Bitcoin’s potential lies in its public perception; its recent jump to a new milestone is an indication that crypto adoption is influencing various markets. Multiple industries, including gaming e-commerce, are innovating to accommodate digital currencies and provide users with various methods to transact seamlessly. Just like the increased engagement in gaming, other aspects of the market are also booming as more blockchain technology becomes accessible to the average person. In the future, we will see it fuel economic growth in parts of the world that are plagued with inefficient banking systems. How businesses and clients interact with each other has already started to change thanks to digital assets. As the trust in traditional systems erodes, we see a growing number of people actively participating in the blockchain world for activities from purchasing to gaming. In the next few years, we will see more practical applications of blockchain concepts, and cryptocurrencies will be more deeply integrated into our economy.

As Strategy continues its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, the company is also planning to raise additional capital to further enhance its holdings. $7.7 Billion Gain From Bitcoin Investments As reported by NewsBTC last Friday, Strategy announced the launch of a $2.1 billion At-The-Market (ATM) equity program for its preferred stock, Strife (STRF), deemed as a crucial step toward the firm’s long-term goal of establishing a strong Bitcoin-backed financial infrastructure. During an investor update, CEO Phong Lee, alongside Executive Chairman Saylor, highlighted the impressive year-to-date performance of the firm’s Bitcoin-linked securities, Strike (STRK) and Strife, as key factors driving this expansion. Lee emphasized, “We’re currently at a 16.3% BTC yield for the year, against a 25% target,” indicating the firm’s ambitious goals. So far, Strategy has achieved a dollar gain of $7.7 billion from its Bitcoin investments and aims to reach a target of $15 billion. Related Reading: Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs The company had previously issued $212 million through Strike’s ATM program without encountering adverse pricing pressure. Given the high trading volume and strong investor demand, Lee expressed optimism that the $2.1 billion Strife ATM could be executed with similar success. In contrast to its other offerings, Strike is designed for “Bitcoin-curious” investors, featuring an 8% coupon and potential upside through Bitcoin conversion.

2025-05-27T12:28:09.000Z,"Options Whales in Bull Mode: Expecting Incredible Bitcoin (BTC) High in Four Weeks!","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) broke a new record by exceeding $ 111,000 after its rally last week. However, it has since experienced some pullback and is now in a consolidation process. While investors are wondering whether the rally will continue, Deribit data shows that bullish expectations dominate the market. According to Deribit data, the $300,000 Bitcoin call option expiring on June 27 was the most popular bet, as the hypothetical open interest for the $300,000 call option rose above $600 million, compared to $484 million three weeks ago. Speaking to Coindesk, Lin Chen, Head of Business Development for Deribit Asia, said: “The $300,000 Bitcoin call option with an expiration date of June 27 emerged as the option with the highest open interest. This shows that investors' rally expectations continue.” The $300,000 call option, which expires on June 27, would represent a three-fold increase in Bitcoin's price from its current price of around $110,000 by the end of the first half of 2025. Although the $300,000 estimate may seem a bit odd considering that there are about four weeks left in the first half of the year, Chen noted that investors have recently been targeting more upside in short-term options. This trend among investors points to a growing appetite for bullish bets, according to Chen. Finally, Lin Chen, who also touched on the Bitcoin 2025 Conference to be held in Las Vegas from May 27-29, said, “The three-day Bitcoin 2025 conference will start today in Las Vegas, and therefore people are speculating about what big announcements will be made at the event. Therefore, the bullish expectation continues.” Related News: The Most Important Bitcoin (BTC) Event of 2025 Starts Tomorrow: Historic Speech Expected!

2025-05-27T12:27:52.000Z,"New Catalysts For Ripple","Summary Bitcoin's new all-time high signals a parabolic phase, historically lifting altcoins like XRP alongside it. XRP typically trends upward during Bitcoin bull markets, presenting a strong correlation for potential gains. XRP ETF approvals could be catalysts to drive XRP higher in the coming months, enhancing its investment appeal. Given these factors, I see XRP as well-positioned for a significant upside as the crypto market rallies. As Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) made a new all-time high recently, Ripple ( XRP-USD ) is poised to move higher as well. Bitcoin is likely entering the parabolic phase of this halving cycle, which I highlighted in a previous article . XRP and the other altcoins tend to trend well with Bitcoin during its bull markets. XRP has multiple catalysts to drive it higher over the next several months. XRP's Background XRP is a cryptocurrency and native token of the open-source decentralized blockchain of the XRP Ledger. XRP and the blockchain were created to improve global financial transfers and currency exchanges. It is also used by investors and traders to profit from its price fluctuations. The advantage of XRP is that transactions are fast, taking only 3 to 5 seconds to settle. This is faster than Bitcoin, which takes 500 seconds to settle. XRP also has a low cost per transaction of just $0.0002 as compared to Bitcoin's $0.50. Traditional international cross-border transfers are much more expensive,w with fees ranging from $35 to $50 per transaction with Western Union. XRP also has a finite supply of 100 billion coins. No more XRP will be created. The finite supply can help support XRP's price if demand for the token increases. Ripple is a technology company that has been striving to build a high-performance global payments business. XRP is a digital asset that is independent of this company. Ripple currently holds 37.1 billion of XRP in escrow . While Bitcoin has been dubbed 'digital gold' by investors, XRP along with other altcoins can be considered 'digital silver'. In this context, Bitcoin can be thought of as a long-term store of value as its price increases over time. XRP's price has made higher highs the same way that Bitcoin has. As a result, XRP might be more of a trading vehicle to be held during the extreme lows and highs of its price. Bitcoin tends to lead the cryptocurrencies since it has the first-mover advantage. XRP was created in 2012, three years after Bitcoin's debut. Trending with Bitcoin's Movements Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Monthly Price Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) Bitcoin's monthly price chart above shows the strong moves in April & May 2025 as the price hit a new all-time high of $111,960 before dropping back below $109,000 and then recovering back above $109,000. This looks like the beginning of another breakout or strong leg higher. I made my case in a previous article that the price of Bitcoin would peak in about October 2025. This is based on the consistency of the length of the bull markets from the price bottom to the peak. The last two bitcoin cycles lasted exactly 1,064 days, while the first cycle lasted a little longer at 1,148 days. If the current cycle is consistent with the last two, then October 2025 would be the time for the price to peak. This could be the beginning of Bitcoin's parabolic phase of its halving cycle, where large gains are made within just a few months. This theory is supported by the strong green candles for April and May and the breakout to an all-time high. It is reasonable to expect the price of XRP to follow Bitcoin's move higher based on previous cycles. XRP tends to have sharp price swings in each cycle. Investors can profit from these sharp price swings in XRP from the price bottom to the peak of each cycle. XRP-USD Monthly Price Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) XRP's monthly chart above shows the sharp price swings of each cycle. XRP increased in price about 15x in the last cycle in 2020 to 2021. XRP increased by a larger amount of about 25x in the 2017 cycle. A move of 15x from the 2022 low of about $0.28 would take the price to about $4.20 in this cycle. That's about 82% higher than the current price. Launch of New XRP ETFs Another potential catalyst for XRP is the recent May 22 launch of the first XRP ETFs . The Volatility Shares Trust ( XRPI ) began trading on May 22. It is the first exchange-traded XRP-based ETF. A leveraged ETF was also launched and is known as the Volatility Shares Trust XRP 2x ETF ( XRPT ). XRPI and XRPT track XRP futures contracts and are not spot XRP ETFs. These ETFs allow investors/traders to get exposure to XRP without managing wallets. Traders can easily purchase these ETFs on regular exchanges, just like other ETFs and stocks. There are also numerous spot XRP ETFs that are awaiting SEC approval . Companies such as Grayscale, Bitwise, WisdomTree, 21Shares, Canary, CoinShares, and Franklin are all waiting on SEC approval for spot XRP ETFs. The SEC approval decisions for spot XRP ETFs are expected by the end of 2025. However, the decision could come earlier. The launch of XRPI and XRPT and any new approvals for spot XRP ETFs could help spark a rally for XRP as more awareness about the crypto is created. These ETFs can help get more investors interested in XRP and provide them with a convenient way to buy and sell it. Final Thoughts My final thought is that XRP is likely to ride Bitcoin's coattails during the parabolic phase of the halving cycle. While there is likely to be volatility along the way, I expect XRP's price to trend strongly upward along with Bitcoin to about October 2025. Plus, the launch of XRPI, XRPT, and any future spot XRP ETF approvals could act as positive catalysts to drive XRP's price higher. The technicals should be watched closely for a long-term top or peak (extreme overbought levels on the RSI). Then, a selling strategy will be considered to lock in profits. Of course, there are no guarantees that my theory will play out. It is possible that the future movements differ from the past cycles. The price movement of XRP could differ significantly from Bitcoin's price movements. Bitcoin and other altcoins could be favored over XRP, causing its price to lag. Therefore, investors/traders should consider XRP to be a speculative investment/trading vehicle.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790090-new-catalysts-for-ripple?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP","BTC-USD|XRP-USD",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T12:25:31.000Z,"Elon Musk Reveals X Money Edges Closer to Launch Date – Will These Top Meme Coins Rally?","Yesterday, Elon Musk revealed the latest X (formerly Twitter) update: it’ll soon roll out X Money, a payments service in beta mode. Given Musk’s support for Dogecoin ($DOGE) and that his electric car company, Tesla, accepts the meme coin for certain payments , speculation is rampant about crypto’s role in the ‘everything app.’ Cryptos often respond sharply to Musk’s market activity. As X Money’s debut nears, a meme coin rally might be a stone’s throw away. X Money & Visa Partner for Peer-to-Peer Payments In January, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said that X Money would launch later this year in partnership with Visa. Similar to Venmo or Cash App, users will be able to link their debit cards, fund digital wallets, and seamlessly send money. It’ll initially have very limited access, likely to ensure the system is tested thoroughly and any issues addressed before a wider rollout. Neither Musk’s recent comments nor January’s official announcement mention $DOGE or any other crypto. Nevertheless, Anthony Scaramucci (SkyBridge Capital founder and long-time crypto advocate) have high hopes that Musk will integrate digital assets into X Money in the future. Crypto does enable fast, borderless, peer-to-peer transactions, after all. Should Scaramucci’s forecast hold true, there might not be any better time to join BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , MIND of Pepe ($MIND) , and $FARTCOIN before the next meme coin rally takes flight. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Earn Free $BTC When the Crypto King Climbs $150K & $200K Similar to how meme coins capitalize on $DOGE’s success, $BTCBULL is designed to benefit from Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. It achieves this, however, by rewarding token holders with $BTC when the #1 crypto breaks new records ($150K and $200K). To top it off, it offers the chance to win extra $BTCBULL when $BTC reaches the $250K mark. As of today, $BTC is valued at $109K+ (up by over 16% since last month). Standard Chartered predicts that the crypto king will hit $200K in 2025 owing to increased institutional adoption , so winning free $BTC might be within reach this year. Also possibly propelling $BTC is Elon Musk possibly integrating the OG coin into X Money. If so, it would tap into the social media channel’s 600M+ monthly active users worldwide . To qualify for the airdrops, all you need to do is hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet , our top-rated anonymous crypto wallet . You can also enjoy reduced gas fees when buying $BEST , the wallet’s native token. If you want to earn even more additional income, you can stake $BTCBULL at a 64% APY. Over 1.6M tokens are already in the pool, reflecting early community backing and rising investor confidence. And that’s not all. It has planned token burns when $BTC rockets $125K, $175K, and $225K to help propel the token price to greater heights. With $6.4M+ already raised on presale, accelerated by two recent whale buys of over $12K and $20K , BTC Bull Token’s growth is picking up fast. You can join the presale by purchasing one coin for $0.00253. We predict $BTCBULL could reach $0.006467 post-exchange listings, so now’s an attractive entry point. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – $PEPE-Inspired Meme Coin With Exclusive AI Agent MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is inspired by $PEPE, a leading meme coin with a whopping $5.9B market cap . While the original frog coin gained fame as a humorous, reaction-based meme figure, MIND of Pepe reimagines this legacy by injecting it with a community-driven, utility-based spin. With its presale ending in just four days , now’s the last chance to buy $MIND on presale, the entry point into an AI agent designed to assist token holders with exclusive crypto trading insights . The agent interacts with platforms like X and on-chain platforms to find real-time market insights and trading signals. Since May 10, 2025, $MIND holders have begun receiving these insights directly, and will soon find them on MIND Terminal, a token-gated dashboard. While token holders benefit the most, select updates are also shared publicly via the agent’s new X account and the MIND of Pepe Telegram channel. Boosting the AI agent to rosier pursuits, various tool integrations are currently in the works: persona-trained large language models (LLMs), Solana and DexScreener trackers, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) , and vector embeddings . To get the most of the VIP info, you can buy $MIND on presale for just $0.0037515. Then, it can be staked at a 218% APY. After being launched on the best crypto exchanges , we predict $MIND might reach $0.00535 . So, join the presale at its current low-cap price before it’s too late. 3. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – Share Toilet Humor Jokes to Win Rewards & Buy the Dip Up 38%+ compared to last month, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) is another crypto that’s making sound in the meme coin arena. Launched in late 2025, it embraces meme culture with fart-themed jokes to create an interactive and entertaining ecosystem. When buying $FARTCOIN, you can experience its unique gas fee system, which triggers a digital fart-sound effect with every transaction. Then, you can submit fart-themed jokes or memes. If popular, you’ll receive token rewards, and it’ll possibly be featured in the ecosystem’s media-related projects. $FARTCOIN is available at a higher price tag than those mentioned above at $1.43. This is partly because it has already been launched on some of the best DEXs and CEXs (Raydium, KuCoin, BingX, and MEXC). Considering its price has dropped slightly by around 12.5%(from roughly $1.6 to $1.4), it could be a strategic time to buy the dip before it blows up again (possibly spurred by Musk!). Musk’s X Money Might Trigger the Next Meme Coin Rally The meme coin world is bracing for impact as Elon Musk steers X into becoming a fully-fledged financial platform. If he decides to add crypto support to X Money and includes meme coins like $DOGE, the implications for the meme coin market could be massive. Considering that X has over 600M monthly users, even a small percentage engaging with crypto tools would mean tens of millions exposed to meme coins. Meme coins like $BTCBULL , $MIND , and $FARTCOIN might significantly surge if more traders rush into the market. Buying now means you could get ahead of the hype, likely at a lower price. However, it’s vital to be aware that meme coin investments can be highly volatile. You must always only invest what you can afford to lose and DYOR.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/x-money-could-rally-these-top-meme-coins/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T12:22:56.000Z,"Ex-CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo Joins Sygnum to Guide Global Crypto Strategy","Christopher Giancarlo, the former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has joined crypto bank Sygnum as a senior policy adviser. The announcement, made on May 27, adds significant regulatory weight to Sygnum’s global ambitions as the digital asset industry continues to gain institutional traction. Sygnum, a Swiss digital asset bank, welcomed Giancarlo to its 12-member Advisory Council, where he will support the firm in navigating complex regulatory environments and fostering strategic partnerships across both public and private sectors. Giancarlo, widely known in the crypto world as the “crypto dad” for his pro-digital asset stance, previously led the CFTC from 2017 to 2019 during a pivotal era for crypto regulation in the United States. He described his decision to join Sygnum as timely, noting that the digital asset industry is approaching a major inflection point in institutional adoption worldwide. Sygnum Expands as Institutions Embrace Crypto Sygnum has made headlines recently for its rapid growth, becoming the world’s first digital asset bank to achieve unicorn status after raising $58 million in a recent funding round. With operations in Switzerland, Singapore, and the UAE, the firm is positioning itself at the center of global crypto finance. The appointment of Giancarlo comes at a time when institutional confidence in crypto is surging. In the U.S., Bitcoin ETFs have seen record inflows , pulling in $1.5 billion in just two days earlier this month. Legislation such as the newly passed GENIUS Act—which aims to provide a framework for stablecoin innovation—is also setting the stage for further institutional participation. According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s rise to all-time highs has helped reinforce its image as a dependable asset class, prompting more financial institutions to consider crypto allocations. Meanwhile, advancements in tokenization, stablecoins, and regulatory clarity are drawing interest from asset managers and financial firms globally. Global Push, Local Challenges While regions like Singapore and the UAE have embraced forward-looking crypto regulations—benefiting Sygnum’s operations—concerns remain closer to home. Sygnum CEO Matthias Imbach recently cautioned that Switzerland risks falling behind if it does not continue to modernize its crypto regulatory environment. With Christopher Giancarlo on board, Sygnum appears poised to strengthen its position in a rapidly evolving market while navigating regulatory challenges with seasoned guidance.

2025-05-27T12:19:27.000Z,"Is XRP Centralized? Ripple CTO Explains the Truth Behind the Controversy","The post Is XRP Centralized? Ripple CTO Explains the Truth Behind the Controversy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recently, the crypto community has been buzzing about whether XRP is centralized, especially after MMA star Conor McGregor tweeted about the US government potentially investing in XRP, SOL, and ADA. This sparked fresh debates: Is XRP truly decentralized like Bitcoin, or is it controlled by Ripple and its leaders? Unlike Bitcoin – which has no known leader since Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared – Ripple’s well-known CEO Brad Garlinghouse often draws suspicion. Does having public faces mean XRP is centralized? Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, stepped up to explain how XRP’s decentralization really works and why many assumptions miss the mark. Schwartz Explains XRP’s Design: No Issuer, No Control Schwartz quickly tackled the key question: XRP has no issuer. The entire supply of XRP was created at the launch of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and no new XRP tokens have been issued since then. Most cryptocurrencies rely on mining or gradual token releases, but XRP was designed differently. Its full supply was available from day one, allowing anyone to claim XRP without competition or mining. This means Ripple doesn’t control how XRP is distributed. “The XRP Ledger has no mechanism for creating new XRP,” Schwartz stated , firmly dispelling notions of Ripple’s control over the asset. What Does Decentralization Really Mean? Schwartz encourages the crypto community to move beyond debating labels like “centralized” or “decentralized.” Instead, he suggests focusing on the purpose of decentralization: preventing censorship, avoiding control by a single party, and ensuring the network’s integrity. By shifting the conversation to these practical goals, it becomes easier to judge whether XRP’s system can be controlled or compromised. When viewed this way, XRP’s decentralization is more complex, and arguably stronger, than many think. Ripple’s Leadership vs. XRP Control: What’s the Difference? A major source of confusion comes from Ripple’s public leadership. CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other executives are often seen as the faces of XRP in industry and regulatory talks. But Schwartz makes it clear: just because Ripple has visible leaders doesn’t mean it controls XRP. The XRP Ledger operates independently of Ripple’s business. Having a well-known company behind the technology does not translate to centralized control over XRP or the network. Understanding XRP’s Decentralization Today David Schwartz’s explanation reaffirms XRP’s status as a decentralized asset – even if it doesn’t look like Bitcoin’s leaderless model. He reminds us that decentralization isn’t just about having no CEOs or issuing new tokens. It’s about whether the network can protect users from censorship and control. As debates continue in the crypto space, Schwartz’s view challenges us to focus on what truly matters: whether a blockchain is secure, fair, and resistant to central points of failure. In this light, XRP’s decentralization is clearer than ever.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-xrp-centralized-ripple-cto-explains-the-truth-behind-the-controversy/,"ADA|BTC|MINING|WALLET|XRP","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T12:07:37.000Z,"BTC holds steady as investors interest rises in Bitcoin Pepe with only 4 days left to buy","Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady near $110,000 as traders brace for potential volatility stemming from the high-profile Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas . With the event running from May 27 to 29, short-term traders are exercising caution while institutions continue to anchor market momentum with robust ETF demand. This period of relative calm comes at a pivotal time for Bitcoin Pepe, a rising memecoin project that is rapidly approaching its first major centralised exchange (CEX) listing. As BTC trades in a tight range and profit-taking from recent gains begins to unfold, new narratives like Bitcoin Pepe are capturing retail attention with the clock ticking on its presale . Market calm before the conference storm BTC’s current trading range between $107,000 and $110,000 reflects a wait-and-see sentiment, according to market insights shared by QCP Capital on May 27. While equities pushed higher last Friday, Bitcoin (BTC) remained largely unmoved, signalling investor hesitation ahead of potential headline risk from the ongoing Bitcoin Conference. Implied volatility remains elevated, underscoring the market’s sensitivity to political developments and unexpected announcements. QCP warned that a similar pattern emerged during the July 2023 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, when a surprise keynote by Donald Trump sparked a 30% price drop over two days. Traders appear to be trimming exposure again, as open interest in perpetual futures dips and funding rates normalise. Retail activity is also cooling, with high-profile traders like James Wynn scaling back positions and short-dated downside protection gaining demand. Despite this caution, institutional appetite for Bitcoin remains firm, providing a strong tailwind that continues to support the broader market structure. Bitfinex analysts believe that although realised profit-taking is increasing, the presence of institutional buyers has transformed Bitcoin into a long-term strategic asset. Bitcoin rally faces a consolidation phase Bitcoin recently surged past $111,800, marking a significant rebound of over 50% from the April lows. This rally was primarily driven by strong inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, rising institutional demand, and a notable absence of retail euphoria. However, Bitfinex analysts note that this market behaviour mirrors previous bull cycles, where sharp upward moves were often followed by a consolidation phase. The analysts say this consolidation is necessary to reset leverage and allow the market to stabilise before the next leg higher. Key support now lies around the short-term holder cost basis of $95,000, a level that could be tested if short-term selling accelerates. Over $11.4 billion in realised gains among short-term holders in the past month signals potential supply pressure that could weigh on price in the near term. Nonetheless, the market’s long-term trajectory remains intact, especially with institutional adoption accelerating. Publicly listed firms like Strategy, Semler Scientific, and Metaplanet have collectively acquired more than 8,800 BTC in recent weeks, highlighting growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is ready to explode alongside BTC Amid this broader market context, Bitcoin Pepe is rapidly gaining attention as its presale nears the finish line with only four days remaining. The project, which fuses memecoin culture with Bitcoin’s brand strength, has positioned itself as one of the most anticipated token launches of the season. Bitcoin Pepe has already seen substantial gains throughout its presale, with its token price increasing by more than 71% from its initial valuation of $0.0210 to the current price of $0.0377. Each presale stage has delivered consistent appreciation, and with just days to go, many investors are eyeing the final opportunity to enter before the token lists on major CEX platforms. Notably, given the current price of BTC and the heightened visibility of the Bitcoin Conference, Bitcoin Pepe’s listing could coincide with a wave of renewed retail interest. In addition, as memecoins continue to outperform in speculative phases of the market, Bitcoin Pepe stands to benefit from both narrative momentum and strategic timing. Market participants see the project’s dual leverage — a strong association with Bitcoin and viral meme appeal — as key ingredients for explosive post-listing performance. As a result, this window presents what could be a compelling entry point, especially for investors who missed earlier memecoin cycles or those seeking exposure to new projects during BTC’s consolidation.

A London School of Economics grad, he also made it to Forbes’ 30 Under 30 and earned an MBE from King Charles III for his social impact work.

This comes as Pakistan prepares to use 2 thousand megawatts of electricity to power… pic.twitter.com/0cbA24O5jx — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) May 26, 2025 Saqib will be responsible for drafting crypto rules that follow FATF standards, leading government Bitcoin mining, and bringing blockchain to areas like land records and finance. He’s been given the rank of a minister of state but will work without a salary or any official perks. Pakistan Backs Crypto This move follows a series of government initiatives in Pakistan’s digital space. Recently, the government endorsed the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), which will oversee crypto exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, DeFi apps, and more. It was also announced that it will dedicate 2,000 megawatts of extra electricity to bitcoin mining, to support both mining and AI data centers. This initiative is led by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to boost revenue, create tech jobs, and attract foreign investment. Former Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, joined the Council as an advisor in April, after he served a four-month U.S. prison sentence for breaking anti-money laundering laws. Pakistan’s Growing Ties With WLF Pakistan’s growing involvement with cryptocurrency has also raised concerns. One reason why Pakistan may be pushing crypto is due to the dip in its foreign investment, which has dropped 45% in February. In January, Pakistan had also hired a U.S. lobbyist in January to set up meetings in Washington. During a visit, the interior minister even asked for more U.S. investment, according to The Wall Street Journal. Shortly after that, the country started building ties with the Trump-linked crypto project World Liberty Financial. In April, Bin Saqib joined as an advisor following a visit by co-founder Zach Witkoff, who signed an agreement with Pakistan’s ministry to explore using World Liberty’s stablecoin for trade and remittances. The WSJ report claimed that Zhao was helping with World Liberty’s foreign connections, but Zhao denied, calling it “ another hit piece .” The PCC has signed a series of deals with WLF to boost crypto investment and innovation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pakistan-appoints-special-assistant-for-blockchain-and-crypto-in-pms-cabinet/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|BNB","News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T12:03:59.000Z,"XRP Price Prediction For 2025","The post XRP Price Prediction For 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Bitcoin breaks new all-time highs, XRP continues to move slowly, leaving many investors curious. But crypto expert George from CryptosRUS believes a big move is coming. In a talk with Altcoin Daily , he predicted XRP could reach $8 to $10 by 2025, calling it a “conservative” estimate. With shrinking supply and rising demand, some say XRP’s scarcity could fuel a major price surge. Analyst Believes XRP to Make 4x Jump In an interview, George explained that XRP has survived many crypto cycles, which shows its strength in the market. He pointed out that XRP has strong fundamentals, a loyal community, and a clear use case. He also highlighted one of the key reasons George is hopeful about XRP’s price is the possible launch of XRP ETFs in the future. He believes ETFs could bring in more big investors, just like they did with Bitcoin and Ethereum. This could help XRP’s price rise even faster. When asked about XRP’s price potential, he said Bitcoin might still grow 1.5x to 2x, and Ethereum could go up 3x to 4x. For XRP, as the current price is trading around $2.3, it would possibly jump to $8 to $10, meaning a 4x gain, which he says is very possible. XRP’s Unique Token Burn Strategy Beyond these predictions, XRP works differently from most other digital coins because it doesn’t use mining. All of its 100 billion tokens were created at launch. With every transaction, a tiny amount, like 0.00001 XRP, is permanently destroyed to fight spam. Over time, this has led to more than 13.9 million XRP being burned forever , shrinking the total supply little by little. Some experts see this as a sign of future price growth due to increasing scarcity, even as some critics argue that the supply remains large enough to dampen any real impact. Together, the promise of shrinking supply and the potential for future ETF launches have many XRP supporters hoping for a big price surge ahead. XRP Price New As of now, XRP is trading at around $2.31 , showing a slight 1% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite the dip, its market cap stands strong at $136 billion, and interestingly, the 24-hour trading volume has jumped 8%, reaching approximately $2.2 billion.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-2025/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP","News",cryptocompare

Here Are the Details","Bitcoin is currently trading in a narrow range between $107,000 and $110,000, supported by steady demand from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to crypto trading firm QCP Capital. QCP Capital Says Bitcoin Trades in a Tight Range Ahead of Major Conference In a market update, QCP noted that investors are closely monitoring this week’s Bitcoin 2025 conference, which has become a key event for sentiment in the digital asset space. The firm said short-term volatility remains high, leading traders and institutions to take a more cautious approach. Despite the choppy price action, underlying ETF flows remain robust, a sign that long-term interest in Bitcoin remains robust. “Markets are in a holding pattern. We are seeing healthy ETF demand, but traders are waiting for clarity after the conference before taking big directional bets,” QCP said. The firm expects both sentiment and volatility to subside once the event is over, potentially paving the way for a more stable trading environment. Bitcoin last traded around $109,800, according to TradingView data. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin Trading in a Narrow Range, According to Crypto Trading Firm QCP Capital!

2025-05-27T11:53:12.000Z,"Michael Saylor Warns: On-Chain Proof-of-Reserves Is Risky","The crypto community controversy over proof-of-reserves has taken a new turn, with MicroStrategy CEO and self-described Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor recently calling on-chain proof-of-reserves ”a security nightmare.” Saylor's comments, which have stirred controversy among the broader crypto community, highlight growing concerns about privacy and security when exchanges publish wallet addresses. Saylor's Security Concerns Saylor argues that requiring exchanges to publish their public wallet addresses leaves them in high risk. ”If you force companies to disclose all their addresses, you open up an executive kidnapping risk and a security nightmare for the company,” he said. Saylor also warned that openness could draw MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks, where malicious actors exploit transaction ordering for profit. Instead of on-chain proofs, Saylor favors third-party auditing as a more pragmatic and secure means. ”The correct answer is a reputable, independent, trusted auditor,” he stated, suggesting that conventional financial regulation offers superior protection for both corporations and clients. Alternative Approaches: Binance and Kraken Saylor's move comes as leading exchanges test different proof-of-reserves protocols. Binance, for example, uses a Merkle-tree-based protocol. The system allows users to verify that their funds are part of the exchange's overall reserves, without revealing the entire list of balances or addresses. The Merkle tree system provides cryptographic proof of reserves while maintaining an element of privacy. Kraken, however, has implemented a zero-knowledge proof system. This advanced cryptographic technique enables Kraken to prove to users that it has sufficient reserves to cover customers' balances without disclosing any sensitive on-chain data. Zero-knowledge proofs are praised for their ability to balance transparency and confidentiality, addressing most of the concerns Saylor has. The proof-of-reserves argument is wide open. On-chain transparency supporters argue that public audits need to be in place in order to bring back confidence in the wake of prominent exchange collapses. Opponents, like Saylor, counter that full transparency brings new risks to exchanges and users alike. Industry norms are still in development. Although Merkle-tree and zero-knowledge proofs offer promising alternatives, these also require users to assume that exchanges utilize these systems honestly and efficiently. Third-party audits, Saylor's preference being noted, can provide another layer of assurance, yet their usefulness rests in the auditor's reputation and liberty. Practical Challenges and Regulatory Perspectives Aside from technical and security concerns, exchanges also have to contend with a complex regulatory landscape. Regulators in different jurisdictions have varying requirements for transparency and auditability, which would complicate the ability of global exchanges to adopt a one-size-fits-all solution. Furthermore, the rapid progress of cryptographic verification means that best practice today would not be very long-lived. For clients, the answer lies in remaining vigilant and informed. As the proof-of-reserves brouhaha continues, users must look not only at exchanges' practices but also at how frequently and transparently they report. At the end of the day, the goal is to keep user balances safe, accessible, and auditable without exposing exchanges or their users to excessive risk. The bottom line Michael Saylor's warning about the danger of on-chain proof-of-reserves has put into question an important debate in the crypto world. With the consideration of advantages and disadvantages between openness, privacy, and security by the exchanges, the search for best practices continues. Regardless of whether the future of proof-of-reserves is cryptography, third-party auditing, or a combination of both, one thing is for sure: openness must be matched with protection in order to preserve user trust and security.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9290/michael-saylor-speaks-out-against-proof-of-reserves,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BNB","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T11:45:13.000Z,"BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard Accused by US Government of Colluding To Drive Up Energy Prices","US government authorities are accusing the asset management giants BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard of colluding against the coal industry. In November of last year, 11 state attorneys general, led by Texas AG Ken Paxton, accused the three financial firms of engaging in an anticompetitive conspiracy to drive down coal production. The attorneys general allege the firms tapped their influence as shareholders in competing coal companies to reduce industrywide coal output, illegally sharing competitively sensitive information in the process. Now, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) have filed a “Statement of Interest” in support of the AGs’ case. The federal officials argue that BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard’s alleged conduct increased energy prices for consumers and businesses. “This case is not about ordinary activity by asset managers such as passive index investing or even pro-competitive activism. As alleged, the holders of large quantities of stock in competing companies agreed to use those shareholdings to reduce the output of US coal to increase profits at the expense of American consumers and businesses. This case is about precisely the sort of conduct, including concerted efforts to reduce output, which have long been condemned under the antitrust laws.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-27T11:40:05.000Z,"Here’s Why Cryptos Like Solana (SOL) and Salamanca (DON) Token Are Eyeing Massive Upside This Coming Week","The post Here’s Why Cryptos Like Solana (SOL) and Salamanca (DON) Token Are Eyeing Massive Upside This Coming Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has seen new trends as more projects gain popularity. Solana (SOL) and Salamanca (DON) have gained a lot of attention and are expected to see strong growth in the next week. The digital assets could attract more investors as the demand for scalable blockchain and meme coins increases. Salamanca (DON) Token Gains Momentum Among Crypto Investors Salamanca (DON) has become well known in the crypto world for its unique cultural themes and focus on its community. The token is inspired by the Salamanca cartel from the TV series Breaking Bad. It uses elements from memes, anime and pop culture to form its identity. $DON is based on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which provides investors with fast and low cost transactions. Salamanca has attracted more attention because of its recent achievements. Now, users can trade the token on Gate.io, MEXC and PancakeSwap. Gate.io, a top global exchange, offers high liquidity to help the project to grow. The $DON token’s rise has created a lot of excitement about its upcoming listing on Binance. According to analysts, the token could rise by 2000%, which makes it a top meme coin to watch in 2025. Trade $DON now on Gate.io: https://www.gate.io/zh/trade/DON_USDT With more than 105,000 members, Salamanca is also very active on social media. The $DON token has a trading volume of $4.45 million each day with a market cap of $2.21 million. As $DON gets listed on more exchanges, experts say the daily trading volume could grow to around $20 million. With the rise of meme coins’ popularity, Salamanca is ready for additional growth. Solana (SOL) Emerges as a Key Platform in the Digital Asset World Solana (SOL) is a top blockchain platform, providing a scalable environment for decentralized applications (dApps). Solana uses the innovative Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) models, which attract both developers and institutions that need fast and affordable blockchain solutions. SOL’s success is due to its increasing adoption, as its price steadily increases. The price of Solana has seen a 5.19% increase to $177.80 in the last 24 hours. Currently, Solana has a market cap of $92.46 billion with a daily trading volume of $6.31 billion. The Solana Foundation intends to improve DeFi and Web3 features, which has resulted in more projects being developed on the network. Additionally, with improved network stability and continuous upgrades, Solana attracts both developers and investors. Bitcoin’s Slipping Dominance Opens the Door for Altcoins Bitcoin (BTC) has recently seen a decline in its market dominance due to its high cost. With a market cap of $2.2 trillion and a price of $110,715.23, Bitcoin continues to attract investors. The rise in popularity for alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Salamanca (DON) is changing the market outlook. Bitcoin’s market share has increased to 64.18%, after an earlier dip below 62%. This shift in investors is due to including altcoins in their investments. As Solana and Salamanca become more popular, the rise of ecosystem-focused tokens and meme coins is expected to continue. This could position altcoins to compete more directly with Bitcoin in the next few years. Solana and Salamanca show great potential for growth as the cryptocurrency markets continue to develop. The tokens could see new updates in the coming week, which shows their potential in the digital asset world.

2025-05-27T11:38:38.000Z,"Google Researchers Claim Quantum Computers Could Break Bitcoin with 20x Less Effort than Previous Estimates","Google has released a research paper which suggests that quantum computers may be able to crack encryption standards, such as those used by Bitcoin , with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. A Google quantum researcher, Craig Gidney, said developers must ascertain the costs of creating quantum-safe cryptocurrencies to achieve the transition process. Cryptography standards, such as RSA, may be at a higher risk of being cracked than previously thought. Bitcoin users, especially those with custodial funds, may need to measure the risks to safeguard their crypto from quantum attacks. Quantum computing can solve complex puzzles, such as the ones used by Bitcoin to measure proof-of-work, thus presenting a new threat vector that places Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at risk. Bitcoin was designed for older computers, which are quickly becoming obsolete. Peter Shor, cryptographer and computer scientist, created a method called Shor’s algorithm to solve the complex puzzles used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Shor’s algorithm could be combined with a quantum computer to crack crypto wallets rapidly. An efficient algorithm, combined with a powerful computer, could increase the risk of a crypto portfolio, including digital assets that use proof-of-stake algorithms. Craig Gidney and Sophie Schmieg, quantum researchers at Google, discussed their findings on their Google security blog. They addressed the ability of quantum computers to crack public key cryptography, particularly RSA, which could be compromised with a quantum computer of around 1 million noisy qubits. They made this conclusion after taking into account recent advancements in quantum computing. The number of qubits required to crack cryptography is lower than previous estimates. The researchers outlined strategies corporations could take to mitigate the risks of quantum computers, such as collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to transition to a post-quantum computing world. Symmetric cryptography is largely unaffected by this attack. However, cryptography, such as that used by cryptocurrencies, is vulnerable to this attack due to the public exposure of addresses and the longevity of these wallets, providing attackers with a target they can attack for an extended period. NIST has set a timeline to phase out vulnerable systems by 2030 and ban them by 2035. Google has been confirming its strategy with NIST by implementing PQC signatures on its Cloud KMS service. IBM’s Condor, the most powerful quantum computer to date, can only reach 1,121 qubits, which is way short of the million qubits needed to crack RSA encryption. Cryptocurrency seems to be safe for now, unless a new technological innovation can dramatically increase the number of qubits. Google’s Sycamore, another quantum computer, can only get 53 qubits. However, the trend of quantum development suggests that crypto users must take these risks seriously. The Google researchers argue that the increased risk occurs because of technological advancements such as improved error correction and better algorithms. Modular exponentiation, for example, has been made more efficient, effectively doubling its speed. Modular arithmetic is a vital part of cryptographic systems. Further, the researchers found that error correction improvements can speed up their algorithm. They found that creating a separate layer for error correction allowed the qubits layer to be more dense, holding more information to be processed, speeding up the algorithm overall. The researchers could drop the qubit requirement by optimising code at a programmable level. Hackers could further exploit such optimizations to secretly lower the qubit requirements until a future date when quantum computers are more accessible. In early May 2025, BlackRock added a line to their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing, stating that quantum computing poses a risk to the long-term security of Bitcoin. The filing states that if quantum computing advances enough, it could be used to crack the underlying encryption algorithms used to power Bitcoin. BlackRock is concerned that quantum computers will undermine crypto markets and technology. Quantum computers can potentially disrupt the business model of Silicon Valley, potentially causing a market crash. BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, should consider the potential risks of quantum computers. The fact that such a large bank like BlackRock is taking the risk seriously shows that quantum risks could be closer than we think.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/google-researchers-claim-quantum-computers-could-break-bitcoin-with-20x-less-effort-than-previous-estimates/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|ZRX","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Google",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T11:30:04.000Z,"Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally","Ethereum is trading above $2,600 after a volatile stretch that saw bulls regain momentum and push the price into a key resistance zone. The recent rebound has brought renewed optimism to the market, with ETH now flirting with a potential bullish continuation. Still, the path forward remains uncertain, as analysts warn of a possible retracement before any major breakout can take shape. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Over the past few days, ETH has shown strength, bouncing off local support and reclaiming short-term moving averages. This move has shifted sentiment, but it hasn’t been enough to fully escape the risk of a short-term pullback. Some market watchers argue that a healthy retrace from current levels would be normal before any sustainable rally above resistance. Top analyst Jelle added to the conversation with a simple but compelling insight: “If ETH goes back above $3,000, the real fun begins.” The $3,000 level has acted as a psychological and technical barrier throughout this cycle, and reclaiming it would likely ignite broader market momentum. Ethereum Leads Altcoins As $3,000 Becomes The Key Battleground Ethereum is showing notable strength among altcoins, leading the market with renewed momentum as bulls continue to push for a new bullish phase. After reclaiming the $2,600 level, ETH has been steadily building support and gaining traction, setting the stage for what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a broader altcoin resurgence. However, for a true altseason to materialize, Ethereum must first reclaim and hold above the $3,000 level. This threshold is more than just a psychological milestone—it has historically acted as a pivot for strong market-wide rallies. Many experts agree that ETH needs to break through this resistance to confirm leadership and spark confidence across the altcoin sector. Hope remains high, particularly among analysts who see Ethereum following Bitcoin’s lead. As BTC continues to test its all-time highs, some believe that once its current bullish impulse cools off, capital will rotate into ETH and other large-cap altcoins. This rotation could serve as the ignition point for a market-wide rally. Jelle supports this view, stating that if Ethereum reclaims $3,000, a bullish impulse will take place. According to his analysis, a confirmed breakout above this level would mark the start of a powerful continuation phase, likely sending ETH quickly toward $3,400 and beyond. Until then, Ethereum remains in a critical position—strong enough to lead, but still facing key resistance. If bulls maintain momentum and reclaim $3,000 with conviction, the stage will be set not only for Ethereum’s next leg up but for a full-scale altseason across the market. The coming days could prove decisive. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? ETH Consolidates Below 200-Day SMA Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,634 on the daily chart, consolidating just below a key resistance zone marked by the 200-day SMA at $2,699.60. After a sharp move up earlier in May, ETH has entered a sideways structure, with bulls defending the $2,500–$2,600 zone while attempting to break above the $2,700 level. Price action shows a tightening range, often a precursor to a breakout or breakdown. ETH is holding above the 34-day EMA ($2,513) and all shorter-term moving averages (50- and 100-day SMAs), signaling that bullish momentum remains intact in the short to mid-term. The fact that Ethereum is consolidating above key support levels rather than correcting sharply is a constructive sign for bulls. Volume remains relatively stable during this phase, suggesting neither buyers nor sellers have fully committed yet. A clean daily close above the 200-day SMA with volume could trigger the next bullish impulse, targeting the psychological $3,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Healthy – Data Shows No Signs Of Overheating However, failure to break resistance may result in a temporary pullback toward the $2,450–$2,500 support area. Ethereum holds a bullish posture for now, but confirmation is needed to sustain upside continuation. The coming days will be key in defining ETH’s next directional move.

2025-05-27T11:28:15.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – May 27, 2025","The crypto market has seen a minor and expected pullback. Most of the top 100 coins per market cap have decreased over the past day. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased 2.3% over the past day, currently standing at $3.55 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $100 billion. TLDR: Crypto market rally stalls; BTC nears ATH, then pulls back to the $109,180 level; Traders are anticipating a move upwards; BTC has a 10% chance to hit $130,000 by the end of June; Digital asset investment products saw inflows of $3.3 billion last week; Today’s dip doesn’t seem alarming. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, only three of the top 10 coins per market capitalization have appreciated over the past day. Ethereum (ETH) appreciated just 0.2%, meaning it’s mostly unchanged over the past day. It’s now changing hands at $2,585. Its daily high is $2,720. Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) are up 1.5% and 0.8% to $0.276 and $679, respectively. Speaking of BNB, there’s a report that whales have been shorting BNB faster than retail investors. This may be a bear trap. Whales may push the price higher to trigger a large volume of stop orders, leading to a significant short-term increase for BNB. Something Strange Is Happening With BNB! Whales are showing more interest in shorting than retail, and this is especially true for BNB compared to other altcoins.

The coin hit its all-time high of $111,814 on 22 May, falling 2.4% since. This is a pullback from the intraday high of $111,807, just a few dollars shy of a new ATH. At the same time, XRP recorded the highest loss: 2.2% to the price of $2.3. Of the top 100 coins, only 12 recorded price increases today. Quant (QNT) is the highest gainer and the only one with a double-digit increase. It’s up 10.2% to $106.1. Monero (XMR) fell the most in this category. It’s down 6% to the price of $392. Importantly, the crypto market is still highly influenced by the macroeconomic developments. And macro uncertainty currently grows. James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , argues that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility remains a significant concern. Its price is susceptible to rapid fluctuations due to market sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic shifts, he says. Notably, many analysts have been warning over the past few days that a correction is possible. A short-term pullback tends to follow period of rapid gain. Following a strong rally we saw over the past few days, investors may be capitalizing on profits. This behavior results in short-term sell-offs. There are also some discussions about potential regulatory measures in major markets, which we’ll discuss below. Investors may be more cautious at the moment. 10% Chance for BTC to Surpass $130,000 Nick Forster, Founder of decentralized onchain options AI-powered platform, Derive.xyz , commented that the rally has stalled slightly. Volatility for BTC and ETH has stayed consistent, at 45% and 72%, respectively. There’s a 10% chance of BTC surpassing $130,000 by the end of June. ETH has a 15% chance of exceeding $3,100 in the same time. Looking forward, “short-term, traders are anticipating a move upwards, evidenced by a large buy-up of calls on the $112,000 BTC strike for May 30,” Forster says. “However, expectations for BTC to remain below $110,000 by June 27 are also building, with a significant number of calls sold for that expiry.” Sustained uptrends require fresh demand. Notice the sharp rise in $BTC First Buyers from July–Dec 2024 and again in Mar–May 2025 – both aligned with major price expansions. These inflows signal new capital entering the system, adding structural strength: https://t.co/gaoF8tCXup pic.twitter.com/61Fu10iVX8 — glassnode (@glassnode) May 26, 2025 Moreover, market makers remain short gamma, the founder says. As BTC and ETH rise, market makers are forced to buy more to hedge, potentially triggering a short-term price spike. BTC traders on Derive.xyz are positioning for a move upward, Forster added. They’re also capitalizing on cheap volatility. “Over the past 24 hours, 55.6% of premiums traded were calls bought, with 22.3% puts purchased. For ETH, the distribution is more balanced, suggesting a more uncertain outlook and fairly priced volatility,” he concluded. Source: Derive.xyz Levels & Events to Watch Next After hitting the all-time high of $111,814 last Thursday, BTC briefly hit an intraday high of $111,807, and then recorded a pullback to $109,181. Key resistance levels currently stand at $109,653, $111,935, and $113,300. Support levels are $108,731, followed by $107,078. Should it fail to hold the latter level, BTC may fall to $105,905.

Also, year-to-date inflows hit a new record of $10.8 billion. Source: CoinShares Meanwhile, there are some red flags to keep an eye on. Reportedly, Trump Media & Technology Group plans to raise a whopping $3 billion to buy digital assets, including BTC. Importantly, this company operates the Truth Social site, and both are under the control of the US President Donald Trump’s family – and, allegedly, Trump himself. His involvement in the crypto industry, however, keeps raising ethical and regulatory concerns. This may have an effect on the crypto market.

Wynn also lost $36M after Trump’s tariff threat rattled markets, despite remaining $12M up in lifetime profits. A trader has racked up $5.6 million in profits in just three days by systematically betting against the trades of prominent crypto figure James Wynn, raising eyebrows across the trading community. According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain , the trader, identified by the wallet address 0x2258, executed a near-perfect sequence of countertrades against Wynn’s public positions. On May 24, 0x2258 began shorting Bitcoin and Ethereum as Wynn opened a long BTC position. When Wynn closed his long the following day, the trader exited his short for a $1.36 million profit. Trader Bags $2.54M by Flipping Long as Wynn Turned Bearish On May 25, as Wynn switched to a short position, 0x2258 went long on both BTC and ETH, closing the position on May 26 with another $2.54 million gain.

Others floated the theory that Wynn could be using public losses to generate engagement, while quietly managing risk through private wallets. Wynn pushed back swiftly. Responding directly to Lookonchain’s post, he denied any connection to 0x2258. “I only trade on one HL account and that’s public. Don’t start spreading fake news with zero proof,” he wrote.

Wynn Loses $36M After Trump’s Tariff Shock Shakes Markets Wynn took a major hit on May 23 after former President Donald Trump proposed a sweeping 50% tariff on all EU imports. The announcement triggered sharp sell-offs in both traditional and crypto markets, sending Bitcoin below $107,000 and dragging Ether to $2,504. Memecoins were hit especially hard, compounding losses across highly volatile tokens. According to data from HypurrScan , Wynn has lost over $36 million over the past week. Despite the setback, he remains $12 million in profit on his all-time trading record. Wynn, known for his aggressive use of leverage and affinity for memecoins, began trading on Hyperliquid two months ago after depositing $4.65 million in USDC.

Options open interest has soared to $48.85 billion, the highest level ever recorded, according to CoinGlass data from May 26. With Bitcoin trading at $109,700, traders are placing outsized bets, including growing interest in $300,000 strike call options set to expire on June 27. Bitcoin options open interest. Source: CoinGlass The surge in open interest shows a deepening layer of speculative and institutional activity now concentrated in the options market.

CME follows with $4.73 billion, then OKX at $3.46 billion, Binance with $1.48 billion, and Bybit at just under $1 billion. The dominance of Deribit reaffirms its role as the go-to venue for sophisticated Bitcoin options strategies. Meanwhile, exchange BTC futures open interest is also climbing, now sitting just below $90 billion. Bitcoin’s price and futures exposure have been rising in near lockstep, showing that leveraged participation is accelerating. Bitcoin futures open interest. Source: CoinGlass Why Bitcoin open interest matters For newer market participants, open interest refers to the total value of outstanding options contracts that haven’t been settled. It gives insight into how much capital is committed to the market, whether for speculation, hedging, or structured trades. In this case, the volume clustered around the $300,000 strike doesn’t necessarily imply a moonshot forecast. Positions that far out-of-the-money are often part of complex strategies, such as hedging spot holdings, capturing volatility, or managing asymmetric exposure. But the fact that traders are engaging at that level speaks to the scale of conviction, and the willingness to take on tail-risk bets. It’s not just retail enthusiasm either. CME’s sizable share of open interest reflects meaningful institutional involvement, particularly from funds seeking regulated exposure or hedging tools in advance of macro catalysts. All eyes are now on the June 27 expiry, which could become a volatility flashpoint. If Bitcoin maintains strength or pushes higher, market makers may be forced to hedge aggressively, amplifying price movement through gamma-driven dynamics. On the other hand, a sharp correction could trigger unwinds that intensify downside pressure.

Events of the past week including the CETUS DEX hack on the SUI blockchain has broadened industry discussions beyond the incident itself, reigniting debate on the core nature of decentralization in the blockchain space. Against this backdrop, Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, seized the opportunity to explain why blockchain users should care less about a network’s decentralization status but concentrate on their expectations from the networks. In his latest post on X, Schwartz tackled this subject while responding to a blockchain user questioning XRP’s decentralization status. The user asked why Brad Garlinghouse is the face of XRP with Ripple as its issuer, given that XRP is meant to be decentralized; a situation not seen in the case of of Bitcoin (BTC). Garlinghouse is the CEO of Ripple, a company.

2025-05-27T11:14:49.000Z,"Nearly half of stolen $1.4b from Bybit now untraceable","Three months after one of the largest crypto thefts on record, blockchain data shows that almost half of the $1.4 billion stolen from Bybit has gone dark. Data from cryptocurrency exchange Bybit reveals $644 million in stolen funds — nearly half of the exchange’s massive $1.4 billion theft — has vanished from public tracking after being processed through mixing services. Approximately $693 million (or 49.5%) remains traceable, while exchanges and authorities have frozen $63 million (4.5%), the data shows. The stolen funds were systematically laundered through several mixing services. The largest portion — $247.5 million (around 966 BTC) — was laundered through Wasabi Wallet, while another $94.1 million laundered via eXch, a mixing service that publicly claimed to shut down in April but remains operational. Smaller amounts moved through Tornado Cash ($2.5 million in ETH) and Railgun ($1.7 million in ETH). You might also like: Safe Wallet responds to Bybit hack with major security improvements Of particular concern is eXch’s continued activity despite its alleged closure. As crypto.news reported earlier, analysts at TRM Labs confirmed that the service still functions through back-end APIs. The mixer’s pooled transactions create near-total opacity as “all received and sent transactions are mixed together and there is no way to discover how many people are behind certain addresses and traceability is extremely difficult,” TRM Labs explained. In a March article on X, analysts at crypto wallet interface platform Safe revealed that a North Korean hacking group known as TraderTraitor compromised a Safe{Wallet} developer’s laptop and used stolen AWS session tokens to bypass multi-factor authentication, gaining access to Bybit’s funds. The breach occurred in early February, when a Docker project — posing as a “stock investment simulator” — was downloaded onto Safe developer’s Mac. The project communicated with a suspicious domain, leading to the malware’s installation.

2025-05-27T11:10:39.000Z,"Bitcoin Warning: Signals Point to Potential Price Correction After 7-Week Rally","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Warning: Signals Point to Potential Price Correction After 7-Week Rally Are you watching the Bitcoin price ? After an impressive seven-week surge, the leading cryptocurrency is flashing potential warning signs that could indicate a shift in momentum. While the overall sentiment for Bitcoin remains largely positive in the long term, short-term data points suggest it might be time to consider the possibility of a Bitcoin correction . Let’s dive into the key indicators causing market analysts to raise cautious eyebrows and explore what this could mean for the broader crypto market . Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Bull Run For the past seven weeks, Bitcoin has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. This rally saw the Bitcoin price climb significantly, fueled by a combination of factors including growing investor confidence, positive macroeconomic signals, and increasing anticipation around key industry developments. This period of sustained growth is characteristic of a bull run, where buying pressure dominates and prices consistently move higher. During this rally, many investors who entered the market earlier saw their holdings appreciate considerably. The momentum felt strong, leading some to believe the ascent would continue uninterrupted. However, financial markets, especially volatile ones like cryptocurrency, rarely move in a straight line indefinitely. Periods of rapid appreciation are often followed by pullbacks or corrections as the market digests gains and participants re-evaluate their positions. Decoding the Data: What Are the Warning Signals? Several on-chain and market indicators are now suggesting that the bullish momentum might be losing steam, potentially paving the way for a Bitcoin correction . Two specific data points have caught the attention of analysts: 1. The Glassnode Accumulation Trend Score Drop According to data from Glassnode, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, the Accumulation Trend Score for wallets holding over 10,000 BTC has seen a notable decline. This metric tracks the aggregate accumulation or distribution behavior of market participants over a specific timeframe. A score closer to 1 indicates strong accumulation (buying), while a score closer to 0 suggests distribution (selling). What Happened: The score for these large holders dropped significantly from a high of 0.8 down to below 0.5 in May. What it Means: This shift indicates that some of the largest players, often referred to as ‘whales,’ have moved from accumulating Bitcoin to either holding steady or, more importantly, starting to sell or distribute their holdings. Significance: Whales hold a substantial amount of Bitcoin , and their selling activity can exert significant downward pressure on the Bitcoin price , potentially triggering a correction. Their moves are often watched closely as they can signal shifts in market sentiment among large capital holders. 2. CryptoQuant’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Data Another key indicator comes from CryptoQuant, another leading on-chain analytics platform. Their data focuses on Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), which essentially represent blocks of Bitcoin that haven’t been spent yet. Analyzing UTXOs by the price at which they were last moved can give insights into the profitability of the current supply. What Happened: CryptoQuant data shows that 99% of all UTXOs are currently in a state of profit. This means that 99% of the existing Bitcoin supply was acquired at a price lower than the current market price. What it Means: When such a high percentage of the supply is in profit, it increases the likelihood of profit-taking. Investors who bought at lower prices have a strong incentive to sell some or all of their holdings to realize gains. Significance: Historically, periods where a vast majority of the Bitcoin supply is in profit have often preceded market corrections. This is because widespread profit-taking can flood the market with sell orders, overwhelming buying demand and causing the Bitcoin price to fall. It signals a potential peak in market exuberance before a necessary cooling-off period. The Mechanism of a Bitcoin Correction A Bitcoin correction is typically defined as a sharp, short-term price decline, usually between 10% and 20%, from a recent peak. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any market cycle. They help to: Shake out overleveraged positions. Allow the market to cool down after rapid gains. Provide opportunities for new investors to enter at lower prices. Test support levels and validate the strength of the overall trend. The signals from Glassnode and CryptoQuant point towards increased selling pressure driven by large holders and widespread profitability. This confluence of factors creates an environment ripe for a correction. Potential Drivers of Short-Term Profit-Taking Why might investors, especially large ones, decide to take profits now? Realizing Gains: After a significant rally, locking in profits is a standard investment strategy. Risk Management: Reducing exposure during periods of high profitability can mitigate potential losses if the market turns south. Rebalancing Portfolios: Investors may sell Bitcoin to reallocate funds to other assets or asset classes. Anticipation of Dip: Some traders might sell now with the intention of buying back at a lower Bitcoin price during the expected correction. While these actions are rational for individual investors, collective profit-taking across the crypto market can cascade into a broader price decline. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? As Bitcoin is the undisputed leader of the crypto market , its price movements often dictate the direction of altcoins. A significant Bitcoin correction would likely lead to pullbacks across the entire market. Altcoins, especially those with lower liquidity, can experience even steeper percentage declines than Bitcoin during such periods. This interconnectedness means that even if you primarily invest in altcoins, paying attention to Bitcoin price signals is crucial for navigating the broader crypto market . A correction could present buying opportunities for altcoins as well, but it also increases the overall market risk in the short term. Despite Short-Term Risks, Why Are Analysts Optimistic Long-Term? While the short-term outlook may involve a potential dip, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin remains robust, according to many analysts. This optimism is largely underpinned by two major factors: Rising Institutional Demand One of the most significant shifts in recent years has been the increasing participation of traditional financial institutions in the crypto market . This institutional demand comes from various sources: Asset Managers: Firms launching Bitcoin ETFs and other regulated investment products. Hedge Funds: Allocating capital to Bitcoin as part of diversified strategies. Corporations: Adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury reserve asset. Payment Processors & Banks: Offering crypto-related services to their clients. Unlike retail investors who might react more impulsively to price swings, institutional investors often have longer investment horizons and larger capital allocations. Their increasing involvement provides a more stable and significant source of demand for Bitcoin , which is seen as a strong foundation for long-term price appreciation. Global Corporate Accumulation Beyond traditional finance, publicly traded corporations are also accumulating Bitcoin . The most well-known example is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Other companies are exploring or have already adopted similar strategies. This corporate accumulation serves multiple purposes: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a store of value resistant to currency debasement. Treasury Diversification: Holding a non-correlated asset alongside traditional cash reserves. Strategic Investment: Believing in the future growth and adoption of the Bitcoin network. The trend of corporate adoption, driven by institutional demand and strategic decisions, represents a powerful, ongoing source of buying pressure that underpins the long-term bullish case for Bitcoin , despite potential short-term volatility or a Bitcoin correction . Navigating a Potential Correction: Actionable Insights If a Bitcoin correction is indeed on the horizon, what should investors consider? Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much volatility you can handle. Short-term price drops can be significant. Don’t Panic Sell: If you believe in Bitcoin ‘s long-term potential, a correction can be viewed as a temporary dip, not a reason to exit entirely. Consider Your Entry Point: If you bought recently at high prices, a correction might put your position underwater temporarily. If you bought much lower, you have more cushion. Look for Buying Opportunities: For those with capital ready, a correction can be an excellent opportunity to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies at a discount. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue or start a DCA strategy to average into a position over time, regardless of short-term price movements. Reduce Leverage: If you are trading with leverage, a correction can lead to rapid liquidations. Consider reducing leveraged positions. Stay Informed: Keep watching the key on-chain metrics and market news. It’s important to remember that these are just signals, not guarantees. The market could defy expectations. However, being prepared for potential volatility is always a prudent strategy in the crypto market . Summary: Balancing Caution and Long-Term Conviction The recent data points from Glassnode and CryptoQuant regarding whale selling and high UTXO profitability are significant indicators that the impressive seven-week rally in Bitcoin price may be facing headwinds. These signals historically precede periods of profit-taking and potential Bitcoin correction . While the risk of a short-term pullback is elevated, it’s crucial not to lose sight of the bigger picture. The underlying fundamentals supporting Bitcoin ‘s long-term growth, particularly the increasing momentum of institutional demand and corporate accumulation, remain strong. These factors suggest that any potential correction might be a temporary pause in a larger upward trend, potentially offering attractive entry points for long-term investors. Navigating the current environment requires a balanced approach: acknowledging the short-term risks highlighted by on-chain data while maintaining conviction in the long-term growth story driven by fundamental adoption. Staying informed and adhering to a well-defined investment strategy are key to successfully navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of the crypto market .

While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range.

If broader market conditions remain stable, Solana looks poised to attempt a breakout in the coming weeks.

CryptoQuant researcher Axel Adler noted that miners have stepped up their sales on exchanges after Bitcoin hit its new all-time high of $112,000. On-chain data also showed that inflows have doubled from an average of 25 BTC to 508 BTC per day, while historical peaks reach around 100 BTC. Bitcoin long-term holder spending binary indicator. Source: CryptoQuant According to Adler, selling has accelerated. He also argued that the market is still a long way from peak volumes, and the market is absorbing the extra supply. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is currently exchanging hands at $109,560, a 4% increase in the last 7 days. Adler acknowledged that miners are currently earning around $50M per day, while historical revenue peaks exceed $80M. He suggested that it indicates a high but not yet peak level of network activity. The researcher also said that miners are already generating significant income, but there is still room for the market to climb back to those previous highs. CryptoQuant analytics showed that its Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO) reached is nearing the 99% threshold, meaning 99% of all BTC holdings are in profit. The tool provides a deeper understanding of the state of unrealized profits across the network. The firm noted that its current level historically aligns with periods of market euphoria and strong uptrend but can also signal potential overheating if sustained for too long. CryptoQuant believes that as BTC inches toward new highs, the UTXO metric reinforces the strength of the rally. “Right now, it’s hard to say we’re in a euphoric phase. The broader macroeconomic context and the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s policy direction make it difficult for investors to flip fully risk on.” – Darkfost , Analyst at CryptoQuant. Darkfost also argued that net profits are still within normal levels for a bull run. According to his analysis, profit-taking is not a sign of weakness but a crucial part of market structure during uptrends. He believes it’s what keeps investors engaged and prevents parabolic exhaustion. The CryptoQuant analyst also revealed data showing realized profits currently stand at 104,000 BTC, or around $11 billion. According to him, that number is not as large as it seems because it’s still below the historical danger zone of 350,000 BTC—a level that signals euphoric conditions or overheating. Darkfost said it suggested the market remains in a healthy profit-taking zone. He also noted that profit-taking is not a red flag during a bull market, but it’s necessary because it helps maintain momentum and keeps participants engaged. LTHs capitalize on BTC’s market drop to $109K The BTC market recently experienced two major liquidation events, which caused a cascade of forced selling from over-leveraged traders. Amr Taha from CryptoQuant said overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out while long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the market reset. He noted the first flush occurred when the digital asset fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As BTC broke $109,000, another $88 million longs were wiped out in the second wave. According to Taha, it caused long-term holders’ realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. He also argued that long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin in the long run. Data analytics firm Alphractal noted that Bitcoin’s surge has shifted the behavior of short-term holders (STHs), who are now distributing assets more aggressively. According to the company’s analysis, such distribution often occurs during market peaks, as profit-taking slows buying momentum. The firm argued that the shift could signal that Bitcoin is entering the final stage of its current bull cycle. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-05-27T11:00:27.000Z,"XRP To $12: Analyst Reveals What Could Trigger The Breakout","The latest webcast from the market commentator known as Crypto Insight UK centres on a single contention: the technical and fundamental backdrop for XRP now mirrors the pre-euphoric set-ups that propelled the token from $0.50 to $2.70 in four weeks during 2021, and it could drive a surge “towards eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve dollars in the very short term.” When Will XRP Hit $12? The analyst began with Bitcoin, because “Bitcoin price action correlates [with] the rest of the market, at least at the minute, before we start to see dominance breakdown.” Last week’s candle, he notes, was the highest weekly close ever recorded by the benchmark asset, yet—critically—the weekly relative-strength index has not entered the overbought zone. In prior cycles, the RSI’s passage into that territory “is when we start to get this mania push-up” that drags alt-coins with it. XRP’s own history is invoked as corroboration: “When we got the weekly into the overbought, that’s when we went from fifty-cent up to $2.70 in the space of like four weeks.” The analyst then drills into order-book heat-maps. Above Bitcoin price lies what he calls a “dense liquidity” cluster, most prominent around $130,000. A matching reservoir sits below, first at $100,000 and then at $93,000. “If we get a pull-back into this $100K level, I will start to heavily position in leverage in altcoins,” he tells viewers, adding that a deeper flush to $93,000 would see him “continue to add to my positions.” Related Reading: XRP Sees Wave Of Inflows: 70% Of Realized Cap Now New Money The market, he argues, is trapped in a self-reinforcing liquidity cycle: each test of overhead supply squeezes shorts, price consolidates, fresh liquidity builds at the new ceiling, and the pattern repeats until a catalyst—a macro loosening of money, a geopolitical shock, or a technical breakout—propels Bitcoin into the next tranche. A sustained move through $130,000, he contends, would likely be that catalyst and would “probably” mark the formal start of alt-season. XRP’s chart is examined through a similar lens. Price has pushed out of what he labels a Wyckoff accumulation range, broken structure to the upside, and is now “finding support on previous resistance” inside a broad bull-flag. On the weekly ratios—XRP/Bitcoin, XRP/Ether and XRP dominance—momentum is quietly inflecting: “We’re starting to get bullish divergences, which is where we see higher lows on the RSI and lower lows in price action … it’s telling us the sellers are running out of steam.” He identifies a descending trend-line capping the consolidation; once that line breaks, he anticipates “an aggressive move back to the upside for XRP.” XRP Price Catalysts The webcast’s second movement shifts from charts to narrative catalysts. Here the analyst reels off a series of developments he regards as unusually synchronous. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, has just unveiled a partnership with the Dubai Land Department that tokenises real-estate title deeds on the XRP Ledger, a choice the press release describes as grounded in the chain’s “decade-long reliability.” Related Reading: Analyst Shows 3-Cycle Ride For XRP Price To Reach $46 Ripple has closed its acquisition of Hidden Road, a prime brokerage whose name appears in DTCC documentation that references both XRP and XLM for cross-chain settlement. The firm, he reminds viewers, also holds “the full crypto payments license and settlement ability in Dubai.” Speculation that Ripple might purchase Circle—the issuer of USDC—for about $11 billion, though unconfirmed, is folded into the same bullish mosaic, as is the launch of Ripple’s own RLUSD stablecoin and talk of a looming XRP spot-ETF. Brad Garlinghouse himself, the analyst notes, chose ETFs as the single topic for last Thursday’s edition of Ripple’s “Crypto in a Minute,” having already mused on a podcast that an approval could arrive in July. In Washington, the analyst is watching for passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill, timing he calls “very convenient” for RLUSD. Even the on-going SEC litigation—Judge Analisa Torres recently rejected the agency’s procedural bid to bring the penalty phase to a close—is framed not as a hindrance but as a potential upside catalyst once resolved. Taken together, he argues, these technical and narrative strands form a spring: “What I’m basically trying to set you up for here, guys, is a succession of positive narratives that will squeeze XRP’s price higher as we move into price discovery.” Yet his crescendo is tempered by disciplined risk management. He illustrates the peril of euphoria with hypothetical road-maps: Bitcoin might gallop to $150,000 or $170,000 and then recoil 18%; altcoins could shed twice that. Under one XRP scenario, an advance to $12 is followed by a 64% retracement to $4.50. “Take some money off the table,” he urges, because unrealised gains “aren’t good for anybody.” Profits banked at interim targets equip the trader both to enjoy further upside and to “reallocate if we get a pull-back.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.30.

2025-05-27T11:00:00.000Z,"UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini report","The United Kingdom is leading the world in increasing cryptocurrency ownership among its population in 2025, outpacing economies including the United States, according to a new study by Gemini. Gemini, the US-based crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, on May 27 released its latest “State of Crypto” report, giving insights into changes in the global adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Based on a survey of 7,200 adults across the US, Europe, Singapore and Australia, the report found that Europe has been leading the way in growing crypto ownership, with the UK in front. The UK saw the biggest year-over-year growth in crypto ownership of the surveyed nations, with the share of respondents indicating crypto holdings rising to 24% as of April from 18% last year, Gemini said in the report shared with Cointelegraph. Crypto sees highest ownership in Singapore While the UK has reportedly seen an increase in new crypto owners, it’s yet to reach the world’s top crypto ownership rate. According to Gemini’s report, Singapore has been the top country globally for crypto ownership in the past two years, with 28% of local survey respondents saying they were invested in crypto as of April. In 2024, that share was 26%. Crypto ownership percentage in the US, UK, France, Singapore, Italy and Australia. Source: Gemini Some European countries have picked up the pace, with 21% of French respondents reporting owning crypto in 2025, up from 18% in 2024. In the US, the indicator grew to 22% from 21%. Overall crypto ownership rate in the US, UK, France and Singapore increased to 24% by April from 21% last year, suggesting that nearly one in four now own crypto globally. Implications of the EU’s MiCA regulation? According to Gemini, the rise of global crypto ownership in the past few years may be attributed to the impact of the Trump administration’s policies on overall positive sentiment following the bear market of 2022 . “In particular, crypto ownership in France and the UK increased, reflecting a warming regulatory environment for digital assets in Europe,” the report said, referring to the rollout of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA ).

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy.

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.  Related: Stablecoins’ dominance due to limitations of US banking — Jerald DavidYield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11 billionBitget’s move into yield-bearing stablecoins comes as the asset class has surged to $11 billion. According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-enters-real-world-asset-race-with-yield-bearing-bgusd-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.I asked @saylor if @MicroStrategy has any plans to publish on-chain proof of reservesHis answer will SHOCK you“It’s a bad idea.”- Security Risk- Irrelevant without also having Big 4-audited liabilitiesCheck it out ? pic.twitter.com/tIxUckgbEp— Mitchell ✝️??

They can also confirm that other entities, such as crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds, hold the required amount of crypto for the funds.Saylor acknowledged the industry had a lot to learn from the collapses of crypto exchanges FTX and Mt. Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions.“No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.”“Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.”Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapseMany crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110KCrypto exchanges Binance, Kraken and OKX and crypto asset manager Bitwise are among the industry players that have adopted the transparency measure.However, Saylor noted that proof-of-reserves often only show one side of the picture — what the company holds — and not what they owe.Source: Mitchell AskewSaylor’s Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 576,230 Bitcoin worth $62.6 million on its balance sheet, followed by Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings, which holds 48,137 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.More than 110 publicly traded companies worldwide have purchased and hold Bitcoin.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-says-proof-of-reserves-bad-idea?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world.Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added. On May 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta was delaying the rollout of its flagship AI LLM, Llama 4 “Behemoth.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-ai-boss-ai-lacks-intelligent-behavior-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days.Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her.The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.”CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit.Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer.Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody.He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28.Alleged victim shares ordealTeofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.”Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector.

You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe.

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC.

However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said.South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets.

In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs.“Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption.

In May, such tokens totaled $4.9 billion.  Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures. The data shows that $1.4 billion in tokens will be released through a “cliff unlock,” while $1.9 billion will be emitted through a “linear unlock.” Cliff unlocks release a large portion or all of the vested tokens simultaneously, while linear unlocks emit crypto assets gradually. Largest crypto token unlocks in JuneAmong the largest token unlocks in June is Metars Genesis (MRS), a non-fungible token (NFT) project that will release $193 million worth of tokens on June 21 to fund an artificial intelligence partnership. Since March, MRS has released 10 million tokens per month, with nearly $1 billion in tokens unlocked so far.Sui (SUI) is scheduled to unlock 44 million tokens worth about $160 million on June 1. The tokens will go to the Mysten Labs treasury, early contributors and the community reserve. The largest portion, valued at more than $70 million, is allocated to Series B investors.To date, Sui has unlocked 3.3 billion tokens valued at over $12 billion, roughly 33% of its total supply.

Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.Source: Cyvers AlertZero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023.Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain cryptoAdvanced form of address poisoningA zero-value transfer is considered an evolution of address poisoning, a tactic where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that resembles a victim’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. Custom addresses with similar starting and ending characters can also be combined with zero-value transfers.Related: Industry exec sounds alarm on Ledger phishing letter delivered by USPSThreat growing across blockchainsA January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024.

After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built.
