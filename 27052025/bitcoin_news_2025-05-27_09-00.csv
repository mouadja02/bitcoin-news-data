Vance to Speak at Bitcoin 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Las Vegas, NV — BTC Inc., the organizer behind Bitcoin 2025 , is excited to announce that Vice President J.D. Vance will speak from the main stage on Wednesday, May 28, during the world’s largest Bitcoin gathering. His keynote will be delivered to tens of thousands of attendees at The Venetian Las Vegas in the programming track of the conference called “Code + Country” and streamed globally via Bitcoin Magazine’s channels. During his time in the U.S. Senate, Vance took a clear stand against regulatory overreach and pushed to redefine how the U.S. government interacts with open-source money. He’s been critical of current SEC leadership and vocal about the dangers of centralized financial control — pointing to events like Canada’s 2022 bank account freezes as examples of why Bitcoin matters. His appearance at Bitcoin 2025 is expected to center on innovation, financial sovereignty, and how Bitcoin fits into a more resilient American future. “This is more than a headline moment — it’s a signal,” said David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc. “Bitcoin is the most exciting financial innovation in the world. It’s at the forefront of the national conversation.” Bitcoin 2025 is projected to host over 30,000 attendees and features leaders from technology, finance, education, and global policy. Previous speakers have included U.S. presidential candidates Donald J. Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tech innovators, and heads of major financial institutions. About The Bitcoin Conference The Bitcoin Conference is the world’s largest and most influential gathering of Bitcoin professionals, investors, and thought leaders. Committed to fostering Bitcoin adoption and industry innovation, the conference has grown into a global phenomenon since its founding in 2019.

2025-05-27T06:47:40.000Z,"Paris-Based Blockchain Group Plans $72M Bitcoin Purchase After Bond Sale","Key Takeaways: Blockchain Group plans to buy $72M worth of Bitcoin after a €63.3M bond raise led by Fulgur Ventures. The company aims to hold 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2032 as part of its long-term treasury strategy. More public firms, including Blackstone and DigiAsia, are pivoting to Bitcoin as a reserve asset amid rising institutional interest. French crypto holding company Blockchain Group has announced plans to purchase an additional $72 million worth of Bitcoin following a successful €63.3 million bond sale, as it expands its aggressive treasury strategy. The company, listed on Euronext Paris under the ticker ALTBG, intends to acquire 590 BTC with the proceeds, which would push its total Bitcoin holdings to 1,437 BTC. At current prices around $109,000 per Bitcoin, the raised capital could technically buy around 658 BTC, but the firm clarified that 95% of the funds will be allocated to Bitcoin, with the rest reserved for operating costs and management fees. The Blockchain Group announces a convertible bond issuance of ~€63.3M to pursue its Bitcoin Treasury Company strategy, bringing its total potential holdings to ~1,437 BTC after completion Full Press Release (EN): https://t.co/Vw2mGH84Dt Full Press Release (FR):… pic.twitter.com/xDky2hrU4s — The Blockchain Group (@_ALTBG) May 26, 2025 Fulgur Ventures Leads €55.3M Investment in Blockchain Group Bond Sale Venture capital firm Fulgur Ventures led the funding with a €55.3 million investment, while Moonlight Capital contributed €5 million. The bonds are convertible into Blockchain Group shares at €3.809 per share. Despite closing down nearly 5.5% on May 26 at €2.77, ALTBG stock has posted an extraordinary 766% gain year-to-date, following the company’s initial Bitcoin purchase in November 2023. That move alone triggered a 225% jump in the stock price at the time. Blockchain Group’s 2024 earnings, released in late April, showed a 709% yield from its Bitcoin holdings, even as total annual revenue fell 32% to €13.86 million. The company has outlined an ambitious long-term goal of acquiring 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, roughly 170,000 BTC, by 2032. The announcement comes amid a growing trend of public firms adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. On May 22, Sweden’s H100 Group AB joined the list, while Strive Asset Management announced a similar pivot earlier this month. With a shrinking supply and rising institutional interest, Blockchain Group’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy aligns with broader moves by companies seeking long-term exposure to the leading digital asset. Blackstone Makes First Crypto Move On May 20, Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, made its first move into crypto markets , purchasing shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares as of March 31, valued at approximately $1.08 million. Prior to that, shares of Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp surged by over 91% on May 19 , after the Nasdaq-listed company announced plans to raise $100 million to initiate Bitcoin purchases as part of a new treasury strategy. The Jakarta-based firm revealed that its board has approved the creation of a Bitcoin treasury reserve. DigiAsia says it intends to allocate up to 50% of its net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how it plans to manage its capital amid growing corporate interest in digital assets. Notably, public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, leading the charge. The Virginia-based company recently announced it would double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion in order to acquire more Bitcoin.

2025-05-27T06:39:08.000Z,"Bitfinex Announces Critical Price Level That Will Determine Bitcoin's Fate: \""Continuation of Rally Depends on It!\""","Bitcoin experienced a major correction after the January ATH, with a 32% drop. However, after this drop, BTC rose by more than 50% to reach new highs of $111,880. As BTC entered a consolidation phase following the new records seen last week, Bitfinex analysts evaluated the latest situation of Bitcoin in their weekly report. At this point, Bitfinex analysts also said that BTC is probably entering a downward cycle. Analysts stated that with the new record, profit taking by short-term Bitcoin investors increased and that this situation could limit Bitcoin's short-term rise. The report stated that this investor group made a total profit of $11.4 billion in the last 30 days, while their profit in the previous 30-day period was only $1.2 billion. Despite the increased profit-taking and US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose 50% tariffs on the EU, Bitcoin has held firm and absorbed the profit-taking without a significant drop, analysts said. This Level Is A Turning Point For Bitcoin (BTC)! Analysts pointed to $95,000, stating that strong inflows into spot ETFs, steadily increasing spot demand, and increasing institutional adoption were effective in Bitcoin's solid stance. Pointing out that the cost floor of short-term Bitcoin investors at this point is $95,000, analysts said that maintaining this level is of critical importance for the continuation of the upward momentum. According to analysts, holding the $95,000 level will determine whether the BTC rally will continue in Q3. Lastly, Bitfinex analysts added that recent institutional purchases of over 8,800 BTC and positive regulatory moves indicate growing confidence in BTC as a strategic asset. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-27T06:38:40.000Z,"XRP sees increased downward pressure as 80-week inflow streak ends","XRP is under pressure after breaking a key inflow streak that had lasted for 80 consecutive weeks. The token is trading at $2.28 at press time, down 2.6% in the past 24 hours, and has remained within a narrow seven-day range of $2.29 to $2.40. According to a report from CoinShares published on May 26, XRP ( XRP ) investment products saw a record outflow of $37.2 million last week, officially ending the long-running streak of weekly inflows. Month-to-date outflows total $28.6 million, though year-to-date numbers remain positive at $226 million, with $1.36 billion still held in XRP-based products under management. This shift coincides with an apparent increase in institutional interest in other digital assets. Bitcoin ( BTC ) led last week’s inflows with $2.9 billion, followed by $326 million for Ethereum ( ETH ). Meanwhile, Cardano ( ADA ), Sui ( SUI ), Solana ( SOL ), and Litecoin ( LTC ) all recorded significant inflows, highlighting a rotation in investor sentiment. SUI, for example, attracted $2.9 million last week and has $23.9 million in YTD inflows. You might also like: XRP price prediction: Bullish reversal pattern hints at explosive move The broader digital asset market recorded $3.3 billion in inflows last week, bringing the six-week total to $10.5 billion and pushing year-to-date inflows to a record $10.8 billion. CoinShares attributes this increase in demand to rising treasury yields and concerns about the U.S. economy after Moody’s downgrade. Alongside the shift to outflows, derivatives metrics for XRP show declining interest. In the pasf day, open interest declined slightly by 0.8% while derivatives volume fell 8.48% to $2.87 billion, according to Coinglass data . A decline in derivatives volume typically indicates less speculative activity, while stable open interest indicates that traders are holding onto their existing positions without taking on a sizable amount of new risk. From a technical perspective, XRP appears to be in a consolidation phase with signs of bearish momentum. The relative strength index stands at 46.6, now in neutral territory. Several moving averages signal a downtrend. The 10-day and 20-day EMAs are both below the current price and show a “sell” signal, alongside the MACD and momentum indicators. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The Bollinger Bands show price hugging the lower band, indicating increased volatility and the potential for a breakout, though the direction remains uncertain. Further declines toward the 200-day simple moving average at $2.26 may be possible if XRP is unable to maintain above the 100-day SMA, which is around $2.28. Although there is still long-term institutional interest in XRP, its short-term trend warns of caution. A break below current support levels could accelerate losses, especially if capital rotation into other altcoins continues.

McGregor, who has backed the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , is now digging into the decentralization behind XRP, Cardano, and Solana, sparking debate in the crypto world. McGregor Wants to Understand XRP In a post on X, McGregor said he wants to learn more about XRP and other altcoins. He noted that he had been told only Bitcoin and Ethereum are truly decentralized, but the U.S. government’s move to include XRP, Solana, and Cardano in its planned crypto reserve made him curious. It came after the U.S. kicked off the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve earlier this year , and now several states, including Texas and New Hampshire, are following suit. Other countries like Ukraine and Ireland may be next. McGregor has even set a meeting with El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele to explore a similar plan for Ireland. XRP Defenders Step In However, XRP supporters quickly defended its decentralization. Key figures like XRPL validator Vet and Anodos Finance founder Panos Mekras argued that XRP is just as decentralized as Bitcoin and Ethereum. They pointed to recent upgrades on the XRP Ledger that boost its decentralization and utility. Some experts also highlighted XRP’s early innovations in token burning and real-world asset tokenization. Dom Kwok from EasyA clarified to McGregor that Bitcoin is more of a store of value, while XRP, Solana, and Ethereum serve broader utility functions. That’s why, he said, the U.S. government is interested in these altcoins as they bring real use cases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For May 27 , Not All in Sync… In response, one crypto analyst, J L disagreed with Vet, saying the idea of a BTC-only reserve is misleading. He argued that the U.S. crypto reserve includes ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA too, and it’s just starting with BTC. He also claimed the “stockpile” narrative is being downplayed and pointed to a Treasury clarification after the executive order as proof. XRP ETF Hopes Rising Meanwhile, XRP is gaining more attention from institutions. Hopes for a spot XRP ETF are climbing , with odds now sitting at 83%, despite the SEC dragging its feet. McGregor’s curiosity about XRP comes at a time when major governments and investors are reevaluating what tokens belong in the next phase of digital finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-27T06:30:35.000Z,"Bitlayer Accelerates BitVM Adoption Through Powerful Mining Pool Partnerships","BitcoinWorld Bitlayer Accelerates BitVM Adoption Through Powerful Mining Pool Partnerships The world of Bitcoin is constantly evolving, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on the foundational blockchain. A significant stride towards unlocking new functionalities was recently announced: Bitlayer , a Bitcoin layer-2 network, has formed strategic alliances with three prominent Bitcoin mining pools – Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool. This collaboration is specifically aimed at advancing the adoption of the Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BitVM). What Does This Partnership Mean for BitVM and Bitcoin Layer 2? This partnership is more than just a handshake; it’s a technical collaboration crucial for bringing advanced smart contract capabilities closer to Bitcoin. According to a CoinDesk report, the core of this alliance involves these leading Mining Pools providing essential support to Bitlayer for handling non-standard transactions (NSTs). Why are NSTs so important? They are fundamental building blocks required for the practical deployment and operation of BitVM . While Bitcoin’s scripting language (Script) is intentionally limited for security and simplicity, BitVM is a concept that proposes enabling more complex computation and smart contracts off-chain, verifiable on-chain without altering Bitcoin’s core protocol. NSTs are a mechanism within this framework that allows for the necessary interactions and proofs. Understanding the Players: Bitlayer, BitVM, and Mining Pools To fully grasp the significance of this news, let’s quickly break down the key components: Bitlayer: This is a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution. Layer 2 networks are built on top of the main Bitcoin blockchain (Layer 1) to improve scalability, reduce transaction costs, and enable new applications that aren’t feasible directly on Layer 1. Bitlayer aims to provide a secure and efficient environment for decentralized applications (dApps) on Bitcoin. BitVM: Not a virtual machine in the traditional sense like the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), BitVM is a groundbreaking concept introduced by Robin Linus. It leverages Bitcoin’s existing Script capabilities to verify the execution of arbitrary computation off-chain. Think of it as a way to prove that a complex program ran correctly, with the proof being checkable on Bitcoin’s Layer 1. This opens the door for more sophisticated smart contracts and dApps on Bitcoin. Bitcoin Mining Pools: Groups of Bitcoin miners who combine their computational resources (hash rate) to increase their chances of finding a block and earning rewards. Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool are among the largest and most influential pools in the Bitcoin network. Their support is critical for the smooth operation and adoption of any new transaction type or protocol extension like those needed for BitVM. The Technical Bridge: Non-Standard Transactions (NSTs) Bitcoin transactions typically follow standard formats that are easily relayable and understandable by the majority of nodes and miners on the network. Non-standard transactions, however, deviate from these common patterns. While not inherently invalid, they require specific support from network participants, particularly miners, to be included in a block. For BitVM to work, it relies on complex transaction structures and sequences that fall outside the typical standard. This is where the partnership becomes vital. By agreeing to support and process these specific NSTs, Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool are providing the necessary infrastructure backbone for BitVM applications built on networks like Bitlayer to function reliably. Without mining pool support for NSTs, transactions related to BitVM operations could face significant delays or even fail to be confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain, rendering the Layer 2 solution ineffective. This collaboration directly addresses a major technical hurdle for BitVM implementation. Why is This Important for Bitcoin Adoption? The ability to execute more complex smart contracts and build dApps on Bitcoin has long been a goal for many in the crypto space. While other Layer 2s exist, BitVM offers a unique approach focused on verifiability and minimizing trust assumptions by leveraging Bitcoin’s security model. This partnership signifies a crucial step towards making BitVM a reality. By securing the support of major mining pools, Bitlayer is paving the way for developers to confidently build applications that rely on BitVM’s capabilities. This could unlock new use cases for Bitcoin beyond just a store of value, potentially fostering greater Bitcoin Adoption in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and more, all secured by the robust Bitcoin network. Benefits of This Alliance The collaboration brings several tangible benefits: Enabling BitVM: Direct technical support for the transactions required by BitVM. Increased Reliability: Ensures that Bitlayer transactions involving BitVM components are processed and confirmed efficiently by a significant portion of the network hash rate. Boosts Developer Confidence: Signals to developers that the necessary infrastructure is being put in place to build on Bitlayer using BitVM. Accelerates Innovation: Speeds up the transition of BitVM from a theoretical concept to practical applications on a functional Bitcoin Layer 2 . Strengthens the Ecosystem: Highlights collaboration between different parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem (Layer 2s, mining infrastructure) towards a common goal. Potential Challenges Ahead While promising, the path forward isn’t without potential challenges: Technical Implementation: Ensuring seamless and bug-free support for NSTs across different pool software and network conditions. Broader Network Adoption: While three major pools are involved, wider support across the entire mining network would enhance robustness. BitVM Maturity: BitVM itself is still a relatively new concept that requires further development and testing. User Education: Explaining the complexities of Layer 2s, BitVM, and NSTs to end-users for broader adoption. What’s Next? Actionable Insights For those interested in the future of Bitcoin: Developers: Keep an eye on Bitlayer’s progress and the tools they release for building with BitVM. This partnership makes it more feasible to experiment with BitVM-based applications. Users: While immediate impact on typical Bitcoin transactions is minimal, this lays groundwork for future applications you might interact with on Layer 2s. Understand the benefits and risks of using Layer 2 solutions. Investors/Enthusiasts: This development is a positive signal for the innovation happening within the Bitcoin ecosystem. It shows tangible steps being taken to increase Bitcoin’s utility beyond being just digital gold, potentially driving further Bitcoin Adoption . The collaboration between Bitlayer and these influential Mining Pools represents a significant technical and strategic alignment. By tackling the challenge of non-standard transactions, they are directly enabling the practical application of BitVM , pushing the boundaries of what is possible on a Bitcoin Layer 2 . This is a vital step towards unlocking the full potential of smart contracts and dApps on the most secure blockchain network, potentially accelerating global Bitcoin Adoption in novel ways.

2025-05-27T06:30:07.000Z,"What Happened To The Bitcoin Whale Who Opened $1 Billion Long And Short Positions?","James Wynn, a crypto trader who has been sharing his positions on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, has quickly become popular after his large Bitcoin positions went viral. So far, James has opened multiple billion-dollar positions and has garnered a large following after his admirable win rate. The crypto trader has also managed to cross in 8-figure territory in terms of gains. Two of his latest trades have caught attention , and this report takes a look at how the trader has managed these positions. Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Long And Short Positions While James Wynn had been gaining a lot of attention for being a top 5 trader on the Hyperliquid platform in terms of PNL, his most recent round of trades have garnered even more attention. Last week, the crypto trader stunned the community when he opened a $1.2 billion long position, with 40x leverage. With a close liquidation price of $105,179, this seemed to be a risky position, and as the Bitcoin price fluctuated , so did the PNL of the position. As the Bitcoin price moved lower toward the weekend, the trader would close this billion-dollar long position for a $13.4 million loss. After this, James Wynn quickly flipped directions and placed another billion-dollar perp position, but this time in favor of the Bitcoin price going down. With an entry price sitting just above $107, this would prove to be a fatal decision for the trader as the Bitcoin price began to move upward. Once again, Wynn was forced to close this massive perp position, resulting in a heavier loss of $15.87 million. In total, the perp trader lost almost $28 million in a 24-hour period, according to Hyperliquid data. What’s Next For James Wynn? Following the closure of his short position, James Wynn took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the situation. In the post, he explained that after the massive losses, he was looking at no longer playing at perps anymore. Additionally, he revealed that despite the losses, he remains $25 million in the green after starting with a $3-$4 million initial position. The post drew speculation from the crypto community, with some arguing that the crypto trader would not just stop trading. This proved to be right as only hours later, Wynn was back on Hyperliquid to place multiple bets on new positions. The crypto trader initially focused on longing PEPE , which has been one of his most profitable coins to trade, earning him over $25 million in profit. He soon opened another Bitcoin long position with an entry price of $109,733. At the time of writing, James has closed his PEPE position after almost getting liquidated as the Bitcoin price plummed. The Bitcoin long position remains, but has been reduced by half to $439 million. In total, the trader took a $4.4 million loss already, and his Bitcoin position remains shaky at a -$4.12 million loss.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whale-1-billion-long/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin whale|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Whale|Whale news",cryptocompare

Crypto YouTuber Lark Davis was among those who observed that “don’t really do anything” while Bitcoin hits a peak, retreats, and recovers. “That’s the state of the crypto market right now,” he said on X on May 26. It is true, the majority of altcoins are still way down from their peak prices during the last bull market in 2021, so when is altseason coming ? Altseason Coming Soon … Really The majority of analysts and crypto traders share the opinion that it won’t be long, looking at current market conditions. On May 27, Bitcoin OG Kyle Chassé said this altseason will be “epic,” but it won’t be like previous altseasons because there are just too many tokens for everything to go up. Coingecko currently lists more than 17,000 tokens, and CoinMarketCap has a whopping 16 million crypto tokens tracked . However, the vast majority of these are worthless meme coins on Solana and Base.

2025-05-27T06:03:53.000Z,"Exploring the Surge of Bitcoin and the Promising Rise of Mantix in the Crypto Market","The Impact of Trump's Tariff Announcement on Bitcoin Recently, the cryptocurrency world witnessed Bitcoin's price surge to an astonishing $110,000. This increase is largely attributed to a sudden tariff announcement by former President Donald Trump , which instigated concerns about a potential trade war, thus driving investors towards the relative safety of cryptocurrencies. Why Bitcoin Is Considered a Safe Haven The resilience of Bitcoin during times of economic uncertainty is not new. Historical precedents show its price resilience in face of geopolitical tensions, reflecting its role as a macroeconomic hedge. This inherent stability makes Bitcoin a preferred choice among investors during times of financial unpredictability. Introduction to Mantix (MTX) and Its Market Potential While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines with its significant price movements, a new player, Mantix (MTX) , is starting to make waves in the crypto community.

2025-05-27T06:01:52.000Z,"Trump Media Denies $3 Billion Crypto Investment Plan","The denial from Trump Media happened amid broader scrutiny of Trump’s ties to digital assets, including meme coins and NFTs, and also follows the controversial crypto-themed dinner that was hosted by Trump on May 22. Meanwhile, other firms are embracing Bitcoin. Paris-based Blockchain Group raised $72 million to buy 590 BTC, and plans to control 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2032. Similarly, Strategy—the largest corporate Bitcoin holder—added 4,020 BTC to its portfolio for $427.1 million, pushing its total stash to 580,250 BTC. However, executive stock sales and a securities fraud lawsuit weighed on Strategy’s share price. Trump Media Rejects Bitcoin Buying Rumors Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, denied reports that it is preparing to raise $3 billion to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The denial came in response to a May 26 article by the Financial Times, which referred to six sources who are familiar with the matter. Trump Media criticized the report by stating, “apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources.” According to the Financial Times, Trump Media was allegedly planning to raise $2 billion through an equity offering and an additional $1 billion via convertible bonds—which are securities that can be converted into equity at a later stage. The proposed equity issuance was said to be pegged to the market price as of May 23, when shares of Trump Media (DJT) closed at $25.72, pushing the company’s market cap to $5.7 billion after a 4.6% daily increase. Trump Media share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) If the company actually followed through, the move would have made Trump Media part of the many other publicly traded firms like Strategy, Metaplanet, and Semler Scientific that started accumulating Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset. These companies argue that crypto holdings serve as a hedge against inflation and a safeguard against becoming financially stagnant or obsolete. The rumour spread during a growing scrutiny over the Trump family's expanding involvement in the crypto space. Over the past few weeks, Democratic lawmakers raised concerns over what they view as potential conflicts of interest, particularly after Trump hosted a controversial “meme coin dinner” on May 22 that attracted a lot of media attention and protest. Trump’s crypto footprint includes various initiatives like non-fungible token (NFT) collections, the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins, a DeFi project called World Liberty Financial, and a dollar-pegged stablecoin. (Source: Bluesky ) Adding to the complexity, Trump reportedly transferred his 53% ownership in Trump Media to a revocable trust managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr., which raised even more questions about potential financial entanglements after Trump returned to office. Blockchain Group Raises $72M to Buy More Bitcoin While Trump Media made it very clear that it has no interest in buying crypto, the same cannot be said for other companies. Paris-based crypto firm Blockchain Group is expanding its Bitcoin treasury with a new €63.3 million ($72 million) bond sale, to purchase an additional 590 BTC. The announcement was made on May 26, and shared details about the firm’s goal of growing its Bitcoin reserves to 1,437 BTC. At current Bitcoin prices above $109,000, the funds raised could theoretically buy around 658 BTC, though only 95% of the proceeds are earmarked for Bitcoin purchases. The remainder is allocated to management fees and operational costs. The bulk of the bond sale was backed by Fulgur Ventures, which invested €55.3 million ($62.9 million), while Moonlight Capital added another €5 million ($5.7 million). The bonds are structured to be convertible into Blockchain Group shares at €3.809 ($4.34) each. Listed under the ticker ALTBG on Euronext Paris, Europe’s second-largest stock exchange, Blockchain Group has gained a lot of attention since it began acquiring Bitcoin on Nov. 5. After its initial Bitcoin purchase, the stock surged 225% to €0.48 ($0.52) and has soared by 766% year-to-date despite a 5.5% drop on May 26. According to its April 30 financial disclosure , the Blockchain Group reported a yield of over 709% from its Bitcoin holdings. However, the company’s total revenue for the 2024 fiscal year came in at €13.86 million ($15.8 million), which was down 32.1% from €20.4 million ($23.2 million) the year before. The firm also revealed an ambitious long-term objective of buying 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply by 2032, which would equate to more than 170,000 BTC. The Blockchain Group also joined the growing list of companies adopting a Bitcoin-focused treasury strategy. Swedish health tech firm H100 Group AB announced its own Bitcoin pivot on May 22, while Strive Asset Management declared on May 7 that it would also become a Bitcoin treasury company. Strategy Buys 4,020 More Bitcoin Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, also continued its aggressive accumulation strategy with a new purchase of 4,020 BTC for $427.1 million between May 19 and May 23. The company revealed the acquisition on May 26, and pointed out that the latest purchase was made at an average price of $106,237 per coin. This buy coincided with Bitcoin’s sharp rally past $110,000 on May 22. With this addition, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at a staggering 580,250 BTC, which was bought at a cumulative cost of approximately $40.6 billion. The average purchase price for its entire position sits at $69,979 per coin. Despite the bullish accumulation, internal stock sales by company executives have attracted some attention. Jarrod Patten, a director at Strategy, sold 2,650 shares of the company’s Class A stock between May 16 and 21, netting nearly $1.1 million. Since April 22, Patten sold 17,050 shares worth about $6.7 million in total. Meanwhile, Strategy CFO Andrew Kang sold 2,185 shares on May 23, generating proceeds of $719,447. These executive stock sales happened at a time when Strategy’s own shares ( MSTR ) faced sharp declines. After peaking at an all-time high of around $474 in November of 2024, MSTR dropped roughly 12% over the past week, trading down from approximately $420 to $369. Strategy stock price over the past 5 days (Source: TradingView ) The stock decline followed the filing of a class-action lawsuit on May 19, which accuses Strategy of securities fraud.

Taha noted that Bitcoin’s recent drop below the psychological $111,000 threshold led to two significant long liquidation clusters on Binance. The first wave occurred around the $110,900 mark, wiping out over $97 million in long positions. Shortly after, a second wave hit as the price breached $109,000, resulting in a further $88 million in liquidated positions. These back-to-back events reflected cascading margin calls from traders using high leverage, a pattern often seen during sharp short-term corrections. Notably, liquidation clusters tend to emerge when rapid price movements force the automatic closure of margin positions, intensifying sell pressure in the process. This volatility tends to shake out speculative positions and can signal a temporary pause or consolidation phase in the broader trend. According to Taha, while the market absorbed these liquidations, it simultaneously witnessed a contrasting pattern among long-term holders (LTHs), who remained active throughout the volatility. Long-Term Holders Accumulate as Liquidations Unfold While short-term participants absorbed the brunt of the sell-off, LTHs appeared to interpret the price dip as a buying opportunity. Taha highlighted on-chain metrics showing that the LTH realized cap, a measure of the total value paid for held coins by long-term investors, has surged past $28 billion. This level had not been observed since April, reinforcing the narrative that seasoned market participants are increasing their exposure during moments of market dislocation. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Rally Over After $111,900 ATH? Global M2 Money Supply Is Still Going The behavior of long-term holders is often seen as a barometer for market health. Their steady accumulation during liquidation events suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value trajectory. Historically, accumulation by LTHs during volatile periods has coincided with later upward price expansions, as coins are removed from circulation and selling pressure is reduced. With leveraged positions reset and structural accumulation underway, the groundwork may be forming for Bitcoin to attempt another breakout beyond its previous highs.

Giancarlo’s appointment as senior policy adviser places him alongside 11 other members of Sygnum’s Advisory Council, the company disclosed on May 27. In his role, Giancarlo will advise on regulations and strategic partnerships in both the public and private sectors. Sygnum is a Swiss banking group dedicated to providing crypto asset services. It’s often called the first digital asset bank, having recently achieved unicorn status following a $58 million funding round. Giancarlo, who headed the CFTC between 2017 and 2019, said he is joining Sygnum at a time when the global digital asset industry is nearing a turning point in institutional adoption.

In 2023, he said a sweeping political shift in Washington, DC, would be necessary to enact pro-industry legislation. That shift appeared to materialize following Donald Trump’s presidential victory last November. However, shortly after the election, Giancarlo quashed rumors that he would succeed outgoing Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. He also shot down reports that he was interested in a crypto-related role at the US Treasury.

In the United States, Bitcoin ETFs are on track for a record-breaking month , drawing $1.5 billion in inflows over just two days. On the regulatory front, the Senate passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. If enacted into law, the bill could further accelerate institutional adoption , according to DWF Labs managing partner Andrei Grachev. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rally to all-time highs has created a positive feedback loop where more institutions view BTC as a mature asset worthy of inclusion in modern portfolios, according to a recent report by Fidelity Digital Assets . Crypto also shows positive growth in places Sygnum is active, like Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. However, Sygnum’s CEO, Matthias Imbach, recently warned that the company’s native Switzerland may lose its competitive advantage as a crypto destination if it fails to keep innovating.

2025-05-27T05:50:06.000Z,"Altcoin Season Index Alert: Unveiling the Current Bitcoin Season and What it Means for Your Crypto Portfolio","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Alert: Unveiling the Current Bitcoin Season and What it Means for Your Crypto Portfolio Are you wondering what the current state of the crypto market means for your investments? The Altcoin Season Index is a key indicator that provides valuable insights into whether smaller cryptocurrencies are outperforming Bitcoin, or vice versa. Recently, this index has dropped, signaling a significant shift: we are currently in Bitcoin Season . Understanding this dynamic is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. It helps investors and traders gauge market sentiment and potentially adjust their crypto trading strategy accordingly. Let’s dive deeper into what the Altcoin Season Index tells us and what the prevailing Bitcoin Season implies for the broader crypto market trends . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index, as tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is a simple yet powerful metric designed to measure the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin over a specific period. It’s essentially a snapshot of market sentiment and capital flow between Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens). Here’s how it works: It typically looks at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens). The performance is measured over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. A score of 75 or higher indicates Altcoin Season, meaning at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. A score of 25 or lower indicates Bitcoin Season, meaning 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Scores between 25 and 75 suggest a neutral period or a transition phase, where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin have a clear dominance in performance. Think of it as a barometer for market dominance. When the index is high, capital is flowing into altcoins, leading to potentially explosive gains in various smaller cap assets. When the index is low, Bitcoin is the primary beneficiary of market liquidity and momentum. The Current State: Altcoin Season Index at 25, Signaling Bitcoin Season As of a recent reading (May 27, 00:30 UTC), the Altcoin Season Index registered 25. This figure is down slightly from previous days, reinforcing the current market narrative. A score of 25 falls precisely at the threshold for what is defined as Bitcoin Season . What does this number specifically tell us? It means that over the last 90 days, only a quarter or less of the top 100 altcoins have managed to post better performance figures than Bitcoin. This is a strong signal that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer in the recent past, attracting a larger share of investment and showing relative strength compared to the broader altcoin market. This isn’t just a random number; it reflects real capital movements and investor preferences over the preceding three months. During Bitcoin Season, it’s common to see Bitcoin’s market dominance (its percentage of the total crypto market cap) increase or remain high. Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Right Now? Several factors can contribute to a period of Bitcoin Season . Understanding these drivers helps paint a clearer picture of the current crypto market trends : Safe Haven Narrative: In times of market uncertainty or macroeconomic volatility, investors often flock to Bitcoin, viewing it as the most established and relatively ‘safer’ asset in the crypto space compared to more speculative altcoins. Institutional Interest: Significant institutional investment often targets Bitcoin first, especially through products like spot Bitcoin ETFs. Large capital inflows into these instruments directly boost Bitcoin’s price and can draw liquidity away from altcoins. Halving Cycles: The period following a Bitcoin halving event can sometimes see Bitcoin consolidate or make significant moves first, with altcoins potentially lagging before their own rally later. Dominance Rotation: Market cycles often involve a rotation of capital. Sometimes Bitcoin leads the charge, consolidating gains, and then capital rotates into larger cap altcoins, followed by smaller cap altcoins. Bitcoin Season can be the initial phase of this rotation. Liquidity Crunch: In less liquid market conditions, capital tends to concentrate in the most liquid assets, and Bitcoin is by far the most liquid cryptocurrency. The current environment likely involves a combination of these factors, making Bitcoin the preferred asset for many investors in the short to medium term. Navigating the Market: Implications of Bitcoin Season for Altcoins and Your Strategy If you are primarily invested in altcoins, the current Bitcoin Season can present challenges. Many altcoins may struggle to gain significant traction against Bitcoin, or even against the US dollar, while Bitcoin continues to perform relatively well. However, it also presents opportunities for a savvy crypto trading strategy . Challenges for Altcoin Holders: Underperformance: Your altcoin portfolio may underperform Bitcoin, leading to frustration. Increased Volatility: Altcoins can be more susceptible to sharp downturns when Bitcoin dips, often falling harder than BTC. Stagnation: Some altcoins might trade sideways or even decline while Bitcoin makes upward moves. Opportunities and Actionable Insights: Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can be a good time to accumulate promising altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Focus on Bitcoin: Consider increasing your allocation to Bitcoin or focusing trading efforts on BTC pairs if you anticipate its dominance to continue. Research: Use this period to research projects with strong fundamentals that might lead the next altcoin rally. Risk Management: Given the increased risk for altcoins relative to Bitcoin, tight stop-losses and careful position sizing are essential. Consider Stablecoins: If uncertain, moving some capital into stablecoins is a valid strategy during periods of market uncertainty or strong Bitcoin dominance. Look for Outliers: Even during Bitcoin Season, some altcoins will still outperform. These are often driven by specific news, developments, or unique narratives. Identifying these requires diligent research. Understanding the difference between altcoin vs bitcoin performance is key. During Bitcoin Season, the correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin remains high, but the beta (the degree to which altcoins move relative to Bitcoin) often favors Bitcoin. When Might the Shift Occur? From Bitcoin Season Back to Altcoin Season Market cycles are fluid, and Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever. The transition back to Altcoin Season typically happens when certain conditions emerge: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: After a significant run-up, Bitcoin’s price might enter a period of consolidation. This allows capital that profited from the BTC rally to potentially rotate into altcoins seeking higher returns. Increased Risk Appetite: As market confidence grows, investors become more willing to take on the higher risk associated with altcoins in pursuit of larger gains. Major Altcoin Developments: Significant upgrades, launches, or positive news within major altcoin ecosystems (like Ethereum’s developments, Layer 2 growth, specific sector trends like DeFi, NFTs, AI coins) can attract significant capital. Narrative Shifts: New, compelling narratives can emerge around specific altcoin sectors or technologies, driving focused rallies. Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained period where Bitcoin’s market dominance starts to decline is a strong indicator that altcoins are beginning to outperform. There’s no fixed timeline for how long Bitcoin Season lasts. It could be weeks, months, or even longer. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index itself, along with Bitcoin dominance charts and overall market sentiment, helps identify potential shifts. Challenges and Limitations of the Altcoin Season Index While the Altcoin Season Index is a useful tool, it’s important to be aware of its limitations: Historical Data: The index is based on past performance (the last 90 days). The market can change rapidly, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Top 100 Focus: It only considers the top 100 coins. Many innovative or high-performing projects exist outside this list. Excludes Stablecoins/Wrapped Tokens: While necessary for its purpose, it doesn’t reflect the full breadth of the crypto market. Lagging Indicator: The 90-day lookback means it confirms a trend that has already been underway rather than predicting future movements. Doesn’t Differentiate Altcoins: The index treats all altcoins equally. Performance varies significantly between large-cap altcoins (like Ethereum) and small-cap altcoins. Therefore, the index should be used as one of many tools in your analysis, not the sole basis for your crypto trading strategy . Combine it with technical analysis, fundamental analysis of specific projects, and broader market sentiment. Comparing Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season Here’s a quick comparison of the typical characteristics of each season: Characteristic Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Altcoin Season Index 25 or lower 75 or higher Bitcoin Performance Strong, often leading the market Consolidating or lagging behind altcoins Altcoin Performance Generally underperforming Bitcoin; some outliers Strong, often posting higher percentage gains than Bitcoin Market Dominance Bitcoin dominance tends to increase or stay high Bitcoin dominance tends to decrease Capital Flow Flows primarily into Bitcoin Flows from Bitcoin (or stablecoins) into altcoins Risk Appetite Lower; focus on ‘safer’ Bitcoin Higher; willingness to invest in more speculative altcoins Recognizing which season the market is in helps set realistic expectations for your portfolio’s performance and guides your approach to managing risk. Summary: Adapting to the Current Bitcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 25, clearly indicating that the crypto market is in Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin has been the dominant performer over the past 90 days, with most altcoins struggling to keep pace. This phase is often driven by factors like increased institutional interest, safe-haven demand, or capital rotation dynamics. For investors, this period highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between altcoin vs bitcoin performance. While it presents challenges for altcoin-heavy portfolios, it also offers opportunities for strategic accumulation, focusing on Bitcoin, and refining your crypto trading strategy . Remember that market conditions are constantly evolving, and while the index signals the current state, staying informed about broader crypto market trends and project-specific developments is vital for long-term success. Use the index as a guide, but always conduct your own research and manage your risk prudently.

2025-05-27T05:49:07.000Z,"Google Publishes Scientific Paper That Could Change What We Know About Bitcoin: “20 Times Easier to Break Than Previously Thought”","A new scientific paper from Google's quantum research team could change what is known about Bitcoin. Google researchers have revealed that RSA encryption, which protects systems from internet banking to Bitcoin wallets, can be broken by quantum computers with 20 times fewer resources than previously thought. In a study published in 2019, Google Quantum Researcher Craig Gidney predicted that 2048-bit RSA encryption could be broken in eight hours with a quantum computer with 20 million noisy qubits. However, in his new study, he significantly revised this number: This process can now be done in less than a week with a quantum computer with less than 1 million qubits. “This represents a 20-fold reduction in the number of qubits compared to our previous estimate,” Gidney wrote in his blog post. Related News: Anticipated Altcoin Announces Date for Airdrop Distribution: Here's Who Qualifies This development does not mean that your Bitcoin or internet banking passwords will be cracked immediately. Currently, IBM's most powerful quantum computer, called Condor, has a capacity of 1,121 qubits; Google's Sycamore works with only 53 qubits. However, the pace of progress in the quantum field shows that it could pose serious risks to security systems in the future. Google said there are two main drivers behind this development: faster algorithms and more efficient error correction methods. The researchers managed to speed up one of the most difficult operations in cryptography, “modular exponential computations,” by a factor of two. They also improved the error correction layer, allowing more “logical qubits” to operate in the same physical space. This significantly increased processing efficiency. Another technical innovation is a method called “magic state cultivation,” which allows quantum computers to perform complex tasks with higher accuracy and fewer resources. Unlike RSA, Bitcoin is protected by a system called elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). However, both encryption systems are based on similar mathematical foundations. Google’s new finding on RSA could mean that ECC could also be broken sooner than expected. While the 256-bit encryption that Bitcoin uses is currently quite strong, the exponential development of quantum computers could erode this security over time. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-27T05:31:23.000Z,"Bitcoin long-term holders ‘quietly capitalizing’ with drop to $109K","Bitcoin markets recently experienced two major liquidation events, causing a cascade of forced selling from over-leveraged traders, but analysts say a distinct pattern has emerged. “Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave. However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation. This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price. Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.” “Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.” BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

2025-05-27T05:30:00.000Z,"Institutions Flood Crypto ETPs While Token Unlock Wave Looms","Institutional capital continues to pour into crypto investment products at record pace, with global exchange-traded products (ETPs) amassing $10.8 billion in inflows so far this year. The surge, led primarily by Bitcoin and Ethereum funds, comes as several major token vesting schedules are set to expire in June, releasing an estimated $3.3 billion worth of digital assets into circulation. While the influx of new capital highlights growing investor confidence, the upcoming token unlocks may reintroduce short-term volatility and reignite scrutiny over project tokenomics and market supply dynamics. Crypto ETPs Hit $10.8B in Inflows as Institutional Demand Soars Past Records Cryptocurrency investment products have seen an explosive resurgence in demand, with institutional inflows breaching the $10 billion threshold for the year, according to the latest report by European digital asset manager CoinShares. For the week ending May 24, global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) attracted $3.3 billion in net inflows, one of the largest weekly totals in history, pushing 2024’s year-to-date (YTD) cumulative figure to a staggering $10.8 billion. The surge highlights a notable revival in investor appetite for digital assets amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty and renewed confidence in flagship cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Crypto ETP flows by asset as of May 23, 2025 (in millions of US dollars) (Source: CoinShares) Bitcoin investment products dominated last week’s flows, accounting for $2.9 billion of the total $3.3 billion, or roughly 88% of all weekly inflows. According to CoinShares head of research James Butterfill, this wave of capital helped push the total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs to a record $187.5 billion, albeit briefly, before markets experienced minor corrections. The inflows into Bitcoin products came as BTC soared above the $110,000 mark on May 22, marking a new milestone for the digital asset. While the rally attracted long-term capital, it also fueled demand for short-Bitcoin products, which saw $12.7 million in inflows, the largest weekly inflow into short-BTC ETPs since December 2024. This divergence indicates that some investors are preparing for near-term volatility even as the long-term outlook remains bullish. Ethereum Continues Five-Week Winning Streak Post-Upgrade Ethereum (ETH) ETPs also recorded strong performance, pulling in $326 million for the week—its fifth consecutive week of inflows. The continued momentum follows the successful rollout of the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade on May 7, which improved transaction efficiency and scalability on the Ethereum network. Investor confidence in Ethereum has been steadily growing in the wake of developments related to a potential Ethereum spot ETF in the United States. Alongside the Ethereum ecosystem’s technical improvements, this has led to a shift in sentiment favoring sustained capital allocation to ETH-based investment products. In stark contrast, XRP-based ETPs experienced a historic setback. After an 80-week streak of inflows, XRP products saw $37.2 million in outflows, the largest single-week capital flight on record for the asset class. The reversal came despite two potentially bullish developments: the growing speculation around the launch of a spot XRP ETF in the US, and the open interest in XRP futures climbing to $2.2 billion. The disconnect between the token’s price underperformance and these tailwinds has caused some institutional investors to reassess short-term exposure. Butterfill suggested that the withdrawal could indicate waning confidence in XRP's immediate price trajectory rather than a broader dismissal of its long-term viability. Crypto ETP Market Rebounds From February Correction CoinShares’ latest data shows the market has not only recovered but has surpassed levels seen before the February–March 2025 correction. During that period, crypto investment products experienced nearly $7 billion in outflows following a sharp pullback in digital asset prices. That drawdown had initially dampened enthusiasm, but by mid-May, inflows had returned with $785 million added in a single week, pushing the YTD total to $7.5 billion by May 16. Underlying the record-breaking inflows is a broader shift in institutional strategy as macroeconomic pressures mount. Butterfill pointed to the recent downgrade of the US credit outlook by Moody’s and a spike in treasury yields as catalysts pushing investors toward alternative asset classes like digital assets. The reemergence of crypto as a preferred destination for capital, especially within structured products such as ETFs and ETPs, underscores the growing sophistication of the digital asset market and the deepening role of institutions in driving this growth. Outlook: Sustained Growth or Volatility Ahead? While the recent inflows have been overwhelmingly positive for market sentiment, the rise in short-BTC positions suggests that not all investors believe the upward momentum will continue unchecked. With Ethereum’s ecosystem undergoing active upgrades and Bitcoin nearing new psychological levels, the coming weeks will be a critical test for crypto’s resilience. Moreover, with speculation mounting around future ETF approvals for Ethereum and potentially XRP, volatility may increase as regulatory signals begin to shape new investor narratives. Regardless, the crypto ETP landscape continues to break records and draw billions in capital—an unmistakable signal that institutional crypto adoption is not just back, but accelerating. $3.3 Billion in Crypto Tokens Set to Flood Market in June as Vesting Schedules Expire Meanwhile, digital assets worth $3.3 billion are poised to enter circulation in June 2025 as vesting periods for several major crypto projects come to an end, according to new data from crypto vesting tracker Tokenomist. While the figure marks a 32% month-on-month decline from May’s $4.9 billion in token unlocks, the influx is still expected to have a measurable impact on market liquidity, investor sentiment, and potentially token prices. Vesting schedules play a crucial role in managing the distribution of crypto tokens—often for team members, early investors, foundations, or community grants. These locked tokens are typically released either gradually through “linear unlocks” or all at once via “cliff unlocks.” Of the $3.3 billion to be released in June, approximately $1.4 billion will be unlocked through cliff mechanisms, while $1.9 billion will be gradually released through linear emissions, signaling a mix of immediate and ongoing market supply pressure. One of the most closely watched token unlocks in June is from Metars Genesis (MRS)—a metaverse-focused NFT project. The project is scheduled to unlock $193 million worth of MRS tokens on June 21, which it says will be directed toward a new partnership focused on artificial intelligence. Since March, Metars Genesis has been releasing 10 million tokens monthly, and has already seen nearly $1 billion in tokens enter circulation. Analysts will be monitoring how the AI partnership impacts token utility and demand in light of the expanded supply. Sui to Release $160M in Tokens on June 1 Layer-1 blockchain project Sui (SUI) is also scheduled for a major unlock. On June 1, the project will unlock 44 million SUI tokens worth roughly $160 million. The majority of these tokens will be allocated to the Mysten Labs treasury, early contributors, and the community reserve. Notably, more than $70 million worth of these tokens is set aside for Series B investors, prompting speculation over potential profit-taking. Tokenomist data showing Sui’s vesting schedule (Source: Tokenomist) Since its inception, Sui has already unlocked 3.3 billion tokens worth over $12 billion, which constitutes about 33% of its total token supply. However, Tokenomist data reveals that another 5.22 billion SUI tokens—valued at nearly $20 billion—remain without a scheduled release date, leaving uncertainty around future dilution risk. Other high-profile projects are also set for sizable unlocks in June: Fasttoken (FTN) will release 20 million tokens valued at $88 million, allocated to the project’s founders.

2025-05-27T05:30:00.000Z,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 74: Opportunity or Warning?","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 74: Opportunity or Warning? Hey crypto enthusiasts! Ever wonder what the collective mood of the market is? Are traders feeling optimistic and ready to buy everything in sight, or are they huddled in fear, panic selling their holdings? That’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes in. This popular metric gives us a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment , and right now, it’s flashing ‘Greed’ with a reading of 74. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Provided by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a unique tool designed to gauge the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a temperature check for investor psychology. Emotions can significantly influence trading decisions, often leading to irrational behavior. When the market is rising, greed can kick in, pushing prices unsustainably high. Conversely, when prices plummet, fear can lead to panic selling, driving values even lower. The index distills these complex emotions into a simple score ranging from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried. This can signal a potential buying opportunity for those brave enough to enter the market against the prevailing mood. 25-49: Fear – Anxiety is present, but not at extreme levels. Caution is advised. 50-74: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic or outright greedy. This suggests the market is getting expensive. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria is widespread. This can indicate a market bubble that might be due for a correction. The core idea behind the index is based on a classic investment principle: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” By understanding the dominant sentiment, traders and investors might identify potential turning points or confirm existing trends. How Does the Index Get Its Score? Diving into the Data The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number. It’s calculated using a weighted average of several different data points. Alternative.me uses six specific factors to arrive at the daily score. Understanding these factors helps us appreciate the nuance behind the single number: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum to the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market indicates greedy or optimistic behavior. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes posts and hashtags on platforms like Twitter. A rapid increase in specific hashtags and high engagement rates can indicate heightened interest and potentially greedy behavior. Surveys (15%): While paused at times, this factor previously incorporated weekly sentiment surveys. (Note: The index description indicates this is still a factor, though its current implementation might vary). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear (as investors flee riskier altcoins to BTC, seen as a safer haven), while falling dominance can signal increasing greed and a willingness to invest in altcoins (often preceding or accompanying an altcoin season ). Google Trends (10%): This looks at Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in search terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” indicates fear, while terms like “buy crypto” or “Bitcoin rally” suggest greed. Each of these factors contributes to the final score, providing a multi-faceted view of the market’s emotional state. It’s important to note that the index is heavily weighted towards Bitcoin data (Volatility, Momentum, Bitcoin Dominance, Google Trends are largely BTC-centric), as Bitcoin remains the dominant force influencing overall crypto market sentiment . Understanding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 74 Mean Right Now? As of May 27, the index stands at 74, firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, just one point shy of ‘Extreme Greed’. A reading of 74 indicates that investors are feeling confident, optimistic, and perhaps even a bit overly enthusiastic about the market’s prospects. This level of greed typically emerges after a period of price increases, where participants have seen their portfolios grow and are anticipating further gains. When the index is high, it suggests: Increased Buying Pressure: More people are looking to buy, and fewer are looking to sell, driving prices up. Reduced Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): The prevailing narrative is positive, reducing the anxiety that might otherwise deter new investment. Potential for Overextension: High greed can lead to prices becoming detached from fundamental value or sustainable growth rates. A Possible Precursor to Correction: Historically, periods of extreme greed have often been followed by market corrections or significant pullbacks as early investors take profits and the buying pressure wanes. For those watching the Bitcoin price , a high index reading like 74 often correlates with strong upward price action or recent highs. It reflects the bullish conviction currently present in the market. Historical Context: When Has Greed Peaked Before? Looking back at the history of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can provide valuable context. During the peak of the 2021 bull run, the index frequently hit the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone, often exceeding 90. These periods coincided with rapid price increases across the market, but were also often followed by sharp, albeit sometimes temporary, downturns. Conversely, during the depths of the 2022 bear market, the index languished in ‘Extreme Fear’ (below 20) for extended periods, marking points of maximum pessimism that, in hindsight, represented significant buying opportunities before subsequent rallies. A reading of 74 is high, but not historically unprecedented extreme. It suggests strong positive sentiment, but perhaps not yet the full-blown euphoria seen at the very top of major market cycles. However, being this close to the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone warrants careful consideration. Benefits: How Can You Use the Index in Your Crypto Trading Strategy? While not a standalone trading signal, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be a valuable addition to your toolkit. Here are some ways traders and investors utilize it: Counter-Trading Signal: The most common approach is to use it as a contrarian indicator. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’, it might be a good time to consider buying (when others are panic selling). When it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (like it’s approaching now), it might be a time to consider selling or reducing exposure (when others are rushing to buy). Sentiment Confirmation: Use the index to confirm signals from other technical or fundamental analysis tools. If your analysis suggests a potential downturn and the index is showing high greed, it adds weight to your bearish outlook. If your analysis suggests a potential upturn during extreme fear, the index supports a bullish view. Emotional Check: The index can serve as a reminder to check your own emotions. If the index is high and you feel an overwhelming urge to buy aggressively, it might be your own greed influencing your decisions, prompting you to pause and re-evaluate. Spotting Potential Altcoin Season: Keep an eye on the Bitcoin Dominance factor within the index calculation. If the overall index is high (greed) and Bitcoin dominance starts to fall, it could signal that investors are rotating profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, potentially kicking off an altcoin season . Using the index requires discipline and an understanding that sentiment is only one piece of the puzzle. Limitations: Why the Index Isn’t a Crystal Ball It’s crucial to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a perfect predictor of future Bitcoin price movements or overall market direction. It has limitations: Correlation, Not Causation: The index reflects current sentiment, which often correlates with price movements, but it doesn’t *cause* the market to move. Other factors like regulatory news, technological developments, and macroeconomic events play significant roles. Lagging or Coinciding Indicator: The index reacts to market conditions. By the time it hits ‘Extreme Greed’, the market might have already made a significant move up. Similarly, ‘Extreme Fear’ often appears after a crash has already occurred. Limited Data Scope: While it incorporates several factors, it doesn’t capture everything influencing market sentiment or price, such as large institutional moves or private investor activity not reflected in public data. Potential for Manipulation: Social media sentiment, one of the factors, can potentially be influenced or manipulated. Not a Standalone Tool: Relying solely on the index for trading decisions is risky. It should be used in conjunction with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and sound risk management. Treat the index as a helpful indicator of the market’s emotional temperature, not a definitive buy or sell signal. Actionable Insights: Incorporating the Index into Your Strategy So, how should you approach the current reading of 74 in the ‘Greed’ zone? Here are some actionable steps to consider as part of your crypto trading strategy : Exercise Caution: A high reading suggests the market might be getting ahead of itself. This isn’t necessarily a signal to sell everything, but it is a good time to be more cautious with new investments. Avoid chasing pumps driven purely by FOMO. Review Your Portfolio: If you’ve accumulated significant gains during the recent uptrend, consider taking some profits. Selling a portion of your holdings in the ‘Greed’ zone aligns with the contrarian principle. Tighten Stop Losses: If you are holding positions, consider tightening your stop-loss orders to protect against a sudden downturn if sentiment shifts rapidly. Look for Divergences: Compare the index’s movement with price action. If the market continues to rise sharply while the index plateaus or starts to dip from extreme levels, it could be a subtle sign of weakening underlying sentiment despite price strength. Research Altcoins (Carefully): With the index in Greed and potentially signaling an upcoming altcoin season (depending on the Bitcoin Dominance factor), this might be a time to research promising altcoin projects. However, be highly selective and aware that altcoins are generally riskier than Bitcoin, especially if a market correction occurs. Combine with Other Indicators: Always use the index alongside other tools. Look at chart patterns, support/resistance levels, volume analysis, and fundamental news before making decisions. A high index reading is a reminder that market cycles exist and sentiment can shift quickly. Prepare, don’t panic. Is an Altcoin Season on the Horizon? As mentioned, the Bitcoin Dominance factor within the index plays a role in assessing the potential for an altcoin season . When overall market sentiment is greedy (high index) and Bitcoin dominance is falling, it often suggests that capital is flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins. While the index itself at 74 indicates overall greed, keeping an eye on the specific Bitcoin Dominance chart can provide further clues about whether altcoins are likely to outperform Bitcoin in the near term. A high overall index reading combined with decreasing BTC dominance is a classic recipe for altcoin rallies, but always remember that market dynamics are complex and no single indicator guarantees future performance. Conclusion: Summing Up the Sentiment Signal The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently sitting at 74 places the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ territory. This reflects strong positive sentiment driven by factors like market momentum and social media buzz. While a high reading indicates optimism and can coincide with upward price action, it also serves as a crucial warning sign that the market may be getting frothy. Historically, periods of high greed have often preceded market pullbacks or corrections. For anyone involved in crypto, understanding this sentiment is vital for making informed decisions and refining their crypto trading strategy . Don’t let the prevailing greed cloud your judgment; use the index as a tool for awareness, caution, and strategic planning alongside other forms of analysis to navigate the exciting, but volatile, world of cryptocurrency.

2025-05-27T05:20:34.000Z,"Google says quantum computers might break Bitcoin way sooner","Google revealed that breaking the RSA encryption, the same tech that secures crypto wallets, might need 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. The tech company introduced a new quantum computing chip called Willow in December 2024 and said it could break Bitcoin in at least two days. The firm argued that Willow could solve in five minutes a problem that would take most supercomputers 10 septillion years to solve. At the time, critics believed Willow’s power could overtake Bitcoin’s hash rate in minutes, rewrite the Bitcoin blockchain, or even steal Satoshi’s coins. Google sees quantum computing as a potential threat to BTC’s security \""2048-bit RSA #encryption could theoretically be broken by a #quantum computer with 1 million noisy qubits running for one week.\"" https://t.co/MoxGROF3Va #PQC #cybersecurity — Jari Pirhonen (@japi999) May 26, 2025 Google said its breakthrough moved quantum computing one step closer to becoming a practical reality and a potential threat to Bitcoin’s security. The company’s Quantum Researcher, Craig Gidney, believes that planning the transition of quantum-safe cryptosystems requires understanding the cost of quantum attacks on vulnerable ecosystems. Gidney said he published an estimate in Gidney+Ekera 2019 stating that 2048-bit RSA integers could be factored in eight hours by a quantum computer with 20 million qubits. According to him, he significantly reduced the number of qubits required in his research paper. “I estimate that a 2048 bit RSA integer could be factored in less than a week by a quantum computer with less than a million noisy qubits. This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate.” – Craig Gidney , Quantum Research Scientist at Google. Google’s researcher believes that people’s digital assets are still safe for now. He also argued that the trajectory is what matters, and it’s pointing in a direction that should make anyone holding crypto pay attention. Google said the breakthrough would come from better algorithms and smarter error correction. On the algorithmic side, the firm’s researchers figured out how to calculate modular exponentiations twice as fast as the heavy mathematical lifting in encryption. The team also found that error correction improvements were possible because they tripled the density of the logical qubits’ space by adding a new layer of error correction, which packaged more useful quantum operations into the same physical space. Google researchers also deployed magic state cultivation – a trick that makes special quantum ingredients (called T states) stronger and more reliable. The team said it helps quantum computers perform complex tasks more efficiently without wasting extra resources, which reduces the workspace needed for basic quantum operations. Bitcoin operates on elliptic curve cryptography, which works on mathematical principles similar to those of RSA. Google believes that if quantum computers can crack RSA faster than expected, BTC’s security timeline just got smaller. Project 11 believes quantum computers running Shor’s algorithms might break BTC We just launched the Q-Day Prize. 1 BTC to the first team to break a toy version of Bitcoin’s cryptography using a quantum computer. Deadline: April 5, 2026 Mission: Protect 6M BTC (over $500B) — Project 11 (@qdayclock) April 16, 2025 A quantum computing research group called Project 11 launched a Bitcoin bounty worth nearly $85,000 for anyone who can break even a simplified version of BTC’s encryption using a quantum computer. The team is testing keys ranging from 1 to 25 bits, smaller compared to Bitcoin’s 256-bit encryption, but it entails tracking progress. Project 11 wrote that BTC security relies on elliptic curve cryptography. The research group also believes that quantum computers running Shor’s algorithm will eventually break it. The team is now testing how urgent the threat is. Google believes competitors could already be collecting encrypted data to decrypt later once quantum computers become available. The tech firm said it has been encrypting traffic both in Chrome and internally, switching to the standardized version of ML-KEM once it became available. The National Institute of Standards and Technology released post-quantum cryptography standards last year and recommended phasing out vulnerable systems after 2030. Google’s research suggests that the schedule might need to be accelerated.

2025-05-27T05:12:22.000Z,"Ethereum at a Crossroads: Momentum Slows but Inflows Remain Strong","Ethereum , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, sends mixed signals as traders and analysts try to determine where its next big move will be. The price of the ether token has recently dropped. Despite this price drop and the Taker Buy-Sell Ratio falling about 30% in the past month, analysts say strong institutional inflows and a stunning outperformance of ether against bitcoin this quarter say the price of ether has a shot at turning upward again. Market Sentiment Shifts as Sellers Step In In recent days, one of the more pressing concerns has been Ethereum’s weakening short-term structure. The Taker Buy-Sell Ratio—a metric that gauges aggressive buying versus aggressive selling on exchanges—has been falling quickly. This generally signals that sellers are starting to take the order flow, which is often a precursor to a market pullback. Caution is arising from Ethereum’s ETH price action. After a strong rally earlier this month, ETH has just below a major resistance level stalled out. This has created a technical setup that has traders closely watching the second-largest cryptocurrency for signs of either a breakout or a breakdown. $ETH showing signs of weakness? Taker Buy-Sell Ratio is falling fast, which usually means sellers are stepping in. Price is stalling below resistance… could be a small shakeout or a bigger move toward $2.2K. Worth keeping an eye on. Momentum looks like it’s shifting. pic.twitter.com/Z6nG1knZfr — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) May 25, 2025 If selling pressure continues and ETH fails to regain control of key resistance, a drop to around $2,200 could happen. Whether such a move is a temporary shakeout or the start of a deeper correction remains unclear. The stalling momentum occurs at a time when many market players were hoping for even more upward movement. Some analysts are looking at this as a possible consolidation phase before we make another broad move up. But let’s face it: The picture we’re getting right now with the buy pressure not really strengthening is looking a lot more cautious toward just the near-term future. Institutional Inflows Tell a Different Story Although the current market structure looks weak, the overall investment thesis for Ethereum continues to lure in institutional investors. From May 19 to May 23, net inflows across the Ethereum spot ETF landscape topped $248 million. Remarkably, all nine of these funds, including those in Europe, reported zero outflows over that same stretch. From May 19 to May 23 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net weekly inflow of $2.75 billion, marking the third-highest weekly inflow in history. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a net weekly inflow of $248 million, with all nine ETFs reporting no outflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 26, 2025 These inflows indicate a robust underlying demand for exposure to Ethereum. This is especially true for conservative or long-term investors. The kinds of sustained interest in spot ETFs that we have seen lately are, in effect, a layer of price support for Ethereum. This is even if one takes the view that a lot of the interest in Ethereum right now is purely speculative. And if most of the interest in Ethereum right now is speculative, then the lack of any serious outflows reinforces the speculative thesis. Market sentiment is viewed through the lens of ETF flows these days, particularly after the approvals have come in for such products. They are the medium through which these two largest cryptocurrencies now offer fully regulated, institutional grade exposure. As capital has rotated into ETH via these vehicles, it may serve as a buffer against downside volatility. ETH Outperforms BTC as Capital Rotates into Altcoins Even though there are presently technical issues of concern, this past quarter, Ethereum has significantly beaten Bitcoin in terms of price performance, and this very well could be the start of a broader trend in which narrative-driven investing favors Ethereum over Bitcoin. The price jumps we’ve seen could be seen as a couple of good stories fueling Ethereum’s potential as something investors are more comfortable seeing as a high beta. Ethereum is just potentially way more profitable in a narrative-driven rally. Ethereum is heavily outperforming $BTC in this quarter. This shows more money flowing into $ETH , and in my opinion, this momentum will continue, and we will see more highs in ETH, especially the low and mid caps. pic.twitter.com/DQaJ6T42kG — Lucky (@LLuciano_BTC) May 26, 2025 Even more significantly, this ETH-led outperformance seems to be unwinding low- and mid-cap altcoins built on the Ethereum ecosystem. Increased levels of speculation, ecosystem advancements, and staking incentives driving interest make Ethereum the main portfolio concentration for those seeking to unearth value beyond the comparatively stolid Bitcoin. Some analysts maintain that this is just the start of a more extensive Ethereum cycle, powered by institutional products and regulatory clarity. They see this cycle as a growth phase driven predominantly by Layer 2 scaling solutions, and if they are right, then Ethereum’s recent uncorrelated price action may merely be an extended consolidation as a prelude to a new uptrend. Ethereum is in a delicate position, caught between long-term fundamentals that are very bullish and short-term momentum that seems to be weakening. Sellers appear to be gaining the upper hand for now, but there’s a powerful counterbalance that could limit any downside in the price. It’s also worth noting that the overall market environment for crypto currently seems to be favorable. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

There has been little bullish action in the past 24 hours despite reports that the Trump family media company plans to raise $3b billion to buy cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

Additionally, the daily chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, an indicator widely used to gauge trend strength and changes, has flipped negative, indicating a bearish shift in momentum.

2025-05-27T05:10:27.000Z,"Top 2 US stocks to buy for exposure to Bitcoin’s ongoing rally","Chasing a Bitcoin rally has historically been a risky move, but “the current environment appears fundamentally different,” says Chris Brendler, a Rosenblatt analyst. Bitcoin has rallied to record levels in recent sessions on the back of a 90-day trade truce between the US and China. Plus, Moody’s recent downgrade of the US credit rating has driven capital into the digital store of value as well. Still, Brendler sees BTC prices pushing further to the upside in the back half of 2025. Why is Rosenblatt bullish on Bitcoin? Rosenblatt analyst Chris Brendler is convinced that the Trump administration favourable stance on cryptocurrencies is changing the global attitude towards cryptocurrencies. President Trump has even signalled plans of setting up a strategic BTC reserve , leading to “rising interest from global pools of capital that are starting to seriously consider investing in Bitcoin,” he added in a research note. However, Brendler argued that institutional ownership of the world’s largest crypto by market cap remains modest only while the “sovereign/corporate interest is just getting started” to forecast a continued increase in demand and, therefore, sustainable momentum in BTC moving forward. If his Bitcoin price prediction proves true, following are the two stocks that could benefit the most. Mara Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: MARA) Chris Brendler expects Mara shares to benefit from a continued increase in Bitcoin price as it tends to trigger a rebound in hashprice. Mara Holdings is a “pure-play” crypto miner, meaning its core business is generating Bitcoin. So, a higher price tag on the digital asset translates to better revenues and improved profitability for MARA. A healthy bottom-line in turn enables the Nasdaq listed firm to reinvest into expanding its mining operations, improving efficiency, and adopting new technologies like immersion cooling, which reduces costs and enhances performance. Other Wall Street analysts agree with Brendler’s bullish view on Mara stock as well. The consensus rating on the mining company currently sits at “buy” with the mean target of about $20 indicating potential upside of about 45% from here. Terawulf Inc (NASDAQ: WULF) Rosenblatt also sees Terawulf shares rallying on the back of continued upside in BTC in the back half of 2025 for similar reasons as Mara Holdings. The hybrid miner stands to benefit from a Bitcoin price increase as it often unlocks upside in the entire crypto sector. Investors tend to flock to crypto-related stocks when the digital asset is doing well, driving higher demand and stock price appreciation for the likes of WULF. Chris Brendler is constructive on the Nasdaq listed firm even though it came in shy of profit and revenue estimates in its latest reported quarter. That said, Wall Street also currently has a consensus “buy” rating on Terawulf stock with upside to $6.79 on average.

2025-05-27T05:10:09.000Z,"A Shift in the Bitcoin Cycle: Long-Term Holder Behavior Signals Changing Market Dynamics","The price cycles of Bitcoin have for a long time followed familiar patterns that were driven by the behavior of long-term holders. Traditionally, these investors accumulated heavily during bear markets and then gradually distributed their holdings as bull markets gained strength. This well-documented rhythm has been what created the bowl-shaped on-chain accumulation and distribution curves that analysts use to understand Bitcoin’s market phases. But recent data is giving off the impression that this cycle might be evolving or even breaking down. Early and Irregular Distribution Signals Uncertainty In the past, holders of Bitcoin for the long term have demonstrated disciplined behavior. They have continually and steadily accumulated the asset during periods of price downturns and then, as the price has rallied, released coins with great confidence. This behavior has resulted in accumulation-distribution cycles that are smooth (as opposed to erratic), predictable, and in line with the larger, longer-term price trend of Bitcoin. This current cycle, however, is breaking that mold. Instead of a clear, symmetrical distribution phase, the selling activity from long-term holders began earlier than usual. The process has been uneven—marked by intermittent spurts of selling followed by pauses, rather than the steady, measured exit typically observed. This stop-and-go pattern reflects a lack of consensus or confidence, even among Bitcoin veterans, about the precise timing and strength of the ongoing market cycle. Such irregular distribution creates a fragmented on-chain picture. Analysts and investors are finding it harder to draw firm conclusions about whether the bull market is firmly underway or if the cycle might be stalling. The behavior suggests a growing uncertainty or hesitation about the sustainability of current price levels, possibly influenced by broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, or shifts in investor psychology. Something is changing in the Bitcoin cycle Historically, long-term holders have accumulated during bear markets and then distributed into strength during bull markets, carving out the familiar bowl-shaped patterns visible in on-chain charts. This time, however, the script is… pic.twitter.com/gY108qOj7l — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 26, 2025 Record Inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs Highlight Bullish Sentiment Bitcoin’s mixed message from long-term holders is in stark contrast to the strong show of interest that the cryptocurrency is receiving from institutions. Between May 19 and May 23, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a net inflow of $2.75 billion. This amount, which is the third-largest weekly inflow in the history of Bitcoin ETFs, underscores the substantial demand—yet again, from both institutional and retail investors—for some form of regulated, easily accessible exposure to the asset. From May 19 to May 23 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net weekly inflow of $2.75 billion, marking the third-highest weekly inflow in history. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a net weekly inflow of $248 million, with all nine ETFs reporting no outflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 26, 2025 These inflows show that even though long-term holders are uncertain, the broader market remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future. Spot ETFs present an alternative pathway for investment—one that does not require the direct custody or management of private keys—that makes Bitcoin accessible to a much wider audience, including more conservative investors. And this audience is definitely expressing interest. Increased ETF inflows may be absorbing some of the capital being recycled back into the market by private holders who need to sell. Evolving regulatory clarity is undeniably a factor here, and so is the overall market environment. If risk assets can rally without a clear catalyst, then markets like Bitcoin’s may keep flirting with the idea of accomplishing what they used to — being a risk-on play. If ESG forces rallying for climate-baked legislation can do it, then so can we in the crypto climate. Navigating an Evolving Bitcoin Market Landscape The difference between traditional holder behavior and institutional inflows indicates that the market for bitcoin is entering a new phase—one that is more complex and ambiguous. For traders and investors, this signals that it could be less reliable to anticipate market moves simply by looking at historical patterns. This developing cycle may mirror wider shifts in the crypto ecosystem, such as the following: – Institutional investment is maturing. – Regulatory developments are under way. – We are integrating Bitcoin into diversified portfolios of asset classes. These are three dimensions of the crypto ecosystem in which Bitcoin potentially sees increasing market participation. We also need to look at the retail side, which is significant in encompasses: – ETF participation. – More retail investing across the space. Altogether, these dimensions add several layers of nuance to the Bitcoin market that can either dampen or amplify price moves independent of holder activity. Participants in the market should be ready for heightened volatility and price movements that are less predictable as these new forces interact. While the long-term fundamental bullish story for Bitcoin remains intact, the pathway may not follow the neat, textbook accumulation-distribution patterns we have seen in the past. Instead, it seems investors may need to adopt a more nuanced strategy-combining on-chain metrics, ETF flow analysis, the Bitcoin Sentiment Indicator and, just for old friends’ sake, our trusty Days Destroyed chart in what is now a more fragmented and multi-faceted market environment. To sum up, what we see in Bitcoin’s cycle now is that it is changing to something new. We call it—in absence of a better term—the sideways cycle, where holders on both scales, long and short, seem to be engaged in (in the best case) a kind of equilibrated economy and (in the worst case) in an underground economy where a mere 10 percent is said to control up to 98 percent of the effects you can work if you want to engage in a transformative digital economy. Also affecting Bitcoin’s price in this sideways cycle is a record number of ETF inflows that represent the institutional side of that same economy.

2025-05-27T05:06:28.000Z,"Aptos Weekly Recap: DeFi Surge, xBTC Launch, and NFT Growth Highlight Week 3 of May","The period from May 15 to May 21 has been a significant time for the Aptos ecosystem, with large amounts of development across DeFi, NFTs, tokenization, and staking. From the whopping 500 million xBTC that got officially deployed on the network to the several decentralized exchanges that have seen their trading volume breach the $1 billion threshold, Aptos is fast securing its reputation as a Layer 1 blockchain that’s built for scalability and driven by developer creativity. xBTC Launch and Institutional Support Boost Tokenized BTC on Aptos One of the most notable aspects this week was the word that xBTC is now flying under the flag of Aptos to be listed on OKX. xBTC is a version of Bitcoin you can find on the Aptos blockchain. It is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin you can find in cold storage at OKX. This means that OKX has an amount of Bitcoin that is the same as the amount of xBTC you can find on the Aptos blockchain. What does this all mean? Well, if you’re a holder of Bitcoin and you want to stick it in the same smart contract as those who hold xBTC, you can do that now. In contrast with Bitcoin, which you can only find living on its own blockchain, xBTC is clearly more versatile. xBTC support marks a pivotal moment for Aptos. It brings the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency into the Aptos ecosystem—albeit in a wrapped format. Bitcoin has long been considered a benchmark for ecosystem maturity. You integrate Bitcoin and you get ecosystem respect. Aptos now offers Bitcoin exposure in a way that’s closer to a native asset than anything we’ve seen thus far. DeFi Trading Booms as DEXs Cross $1B Milestone The decentralized finance sector on the Aptos network has entered a new phase of competition. Five decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have crossed the mark of $1 billion in cumulative trading volume: Thala Labs Cellana Finance LiquidSwap Hyperion PancakeSwap These projects are now at the forefront of the struggle to attract users and liquidity. In doing so, they are each employing a mix of innovative products and competitive incentives that make the DEXs a good choice for users. This is, of course, a good problem to have. There are, to be sure, other DEXs that have not yet crossed the $1 billion mark that are also doing very well at attracting volumes. But these five in particular have seen, well, apparent success. This week, Hyperion particularly distinguished itself by tallying a remarkable $455 million in weekly trading volume, the highest yet on Aptos. This boosted its all-time trading volume to an impressive $1.6 billion, hinting at very solid user retention and growth of the protocol. At the same time, Amnis Finance hit a fresh staking milestone, as it now has more than 60 million APT staked on the platform. The Aptos ecosystem’s validator map shows worldwide participation, with nodes from Aptos operating in 23 countries and 54 cities. All together, almost 861 million APT is staked across the entire network, with over 71 percent of all APT in circulation now involved with some form of staking. Weekly $APT @Aptos Recap – Tuần 3, tháng 05 xBTC đã chính thức hỗ trợ trên Aptos tại @okx xBTC là token được bảo chứng 1:1 bằng Bitcoin (BTC), được OKX lưu trữ một cách an toàn. Người dùng hiện đã có thể nạp và rút xBTC trực tiếp trên mạng Aptos.… pic.twitter.com/SoCcLrTHlc — Blog Tiền Ảo (@blogtienao_hq) May 26, 2025 The staking engagement and trading volume level suggests that a DeFi environment is maturing, with the user base that we see for Aptos seeming very loyal, and what could be some institutional interest that may be coming in the months ahead. Aptos is not only starting to have applications live; it’s also starting to have some real utility for governance and for its tokens. NFTs Gain Momentum and New Projects Set to Launch The Aptos NFT world is also seeing a lot of activity and growth, providing yet another dynamic and layered aspect to the strange growth story of Aptos. With collectibles not yet a year old, there are already 4,500 of them in our ecosystem. Collectible minting is up, too; we recently hit 1.2 million individual mintings of tokens. We have seen a veritable explosion in new collections, with 240 hitting the ecosystem in just the last month. This uptick is largely being driven by a now-strong and diverse group of creators in our NFT space. Events scheduled for the near future promise to add to the NFT space’s current momentum. The far-from-average LFGO drop has set its dates in stone: whitelist minting starts on May 29 at 21:00, with the public sale following closely behind on May 30 at, well, the same time. If the current NFT energization feels anything but a dead cat bounce, participation in these sale events appears nearly unavoidable. The Aptos ecosystem is extremely active, diversified, and growing simultaneously across several verticals. Unlike other Layer 1s that may be focusing on niche improvements or facing user attrition, Aptos has a very robust NFT, DeFi, and tokenized asset development space. As May goes on, everyone will be watching to see how these progressions pan out in the long-term retention of the ecosystem. If the present course continues, Aptos will not only be recognized for its speed and tech stack but also for the flourishing economy that now exists on-chain.

2025-05-27T05:00:03.000Z,"Dogecoin Breakout Incoming? $3 Target On The Horizon—Analyst","Dogecoin has held steady above $0.22 since May 20 and climbed back after a brief dip. It hit $0.25 on May 23, then eased into the weekend. In the last 24 hours, the token is up 4.1%. Over a week, it’s up 5%, even though it slipped midweek. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip? The Triangle Pattern According to TradingView analyst Akbar Karimzsfeh, Dogecoin has been tracing a long, tightening triangle since its all-time high of $0.73536 on May 3, 2021. That peak was followed by a drop to $0.048 on June 13, 2022. Since then, every attempt to break lower—on June 5, August 14 and October 9 of 2023—has failed. The lines of the triangle are closing in. When they meet, a sharp move is likely. Key Resistance Levels Based on data, the upper trendline of the triangle also matches the top of a large “cup” pattern around $0.4916. There was an attempted breakout in December 2024, and prices almost hit that $0.4916 mark but got pushed back. After that, DOGE slid down to $0.13. It has since recovered some ground, but it still has to clear that $0.4916 hurdle before bulls can claim real control. Recent Price Moves Dogecoin hovered around $0.22 between May 20 and May 26. It peaked at $0.25 on May 23, only to slip afterward. Then the last 24-hour gain of 4.1% showed it can bounce from support. The 5% weekly rise points to steady buying, even with some pullbacks in the middle of the week. Traders are watching for a daily close above $0.50 as a sign that the long squeeze is over. On-Chain Metrics Rise On-chain data backs up the price action. New addresses have jumped by 102.40% in the past seven days. Active addresses climbed 111.32%. Zero balance addresses went up 155.45%. That suggests more people are sending small amounts of DOGE or testing the network. It doesn’t guarantee they’re holding long term, but it does flag higher interest and activity. DOGE price up in the last week. Source: CoinMarketCap Related Reading: Bitcoin To $125K By End Of Q2? Bold Call From Bybit Executive If Dogecoin can break above the top trendline and hold above $0.49, some see a move toward $3.08. That target is based on adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point. It’s a big leap. Psychology and trading fees could slow that run. But the pattern says a strong move may be coming. Based on reports, caution is still wise. Wait for clear confirmation before betting on a moonshot. A slip below the lower trendline near $0.05 would turn the picture bearish. For now, Dogecoin sits in the balance, squeezed between two key trendlines. Traders and fans will be watching every close above $0.49 or fall below $0.05 to gauge the next big move.

2025-05-27T04:59:31.000Z,"Meme Coins Represent a Market for Attention, Sygnum Bank Exec Says","Meme coins may only make up a small slice of the broader crypto ecosystem, but they represent something bigger in the digital age, according to Sygnum Bank’s chief clients officer Martin Burgherr. Speaking to CNBC’s Dan Murphy , Burgherr described meme coins as a “tokenization of attention,” arguing that their value lies less in fundamentals and more in the social capital they generate. “Attention is something of value,” Burgherr said. He explained that on social platforms such as X, influence often stems from follower count, and meme coins are a digital reflection of that influence. He added that this dynamic helps explain the high level of attention, and perceived value, surrounding the $TRUMP coin, launched by the US President. Sygnum’s Martin Burgherr on @CNBC : \""Meme coins are a tokenization of attention\"" Martin Burgherr, Sygnum Chief Clients Officer, joined CNBC’s Access Middle East this morning, where he spoke with host @dan_murphy about how meme coins reflect the idea that attention, such as… pic.twitter.com/WsM0EbPh9K — Sygnum Bank (@sygnumofficial) May 26, 2025 Trump Coin Emerges as a Case Study in Tokenized Attention and Political Branding The Trump meme coin, branded as $TRUMP, launched just days before Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration as the 47th US President. Created by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, affiliates of the Trump Organization, the token carries heavy branding, including a cartoon image of Trump raising his fist following the assassination attempt he survived in mid-2024. While marketed as a non-political symbol aligned with Trump’s “FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT” slogan, the coin’s timing and imagery have kept it squarely in the political spotlight. Built on the Solana blockchain, the token also states explicitly that it is not an investment or security, even though its founders hold 80% of the total supply. While critics question the ethics of such politicized financial instruments, their popularity highlights a growing trend in the crypto world, where digital tokens mirror viral content and social sentiment more than traditional market forces. Burgherr Defends Crypto Legitimacy, Sees Meme Coins as a Small Niche Burgherr stated that Sygnum, a regulated digital asset bank based in Switzerland and Singapore, does not promote meme coin speculation. “We primarily believe in major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana,” he said. Any exposure to meme coins, he added, should depend entirely on an investor’s risk appetite. He rejected the notion that meme coins erode trust in the crypto industry, pointing out that their structure is generally transparent. However, he noted that like any new segment, meme coins require clear governance and regulation before being fairly assessed. He added that they represent only a small fraction of a broader ecosystem that includes DeFi, smart contracts and Bitcoin. Burgherr pointed out that Bitcoin continues to dominate the space, far outpacing niche tokens like Trump coin in both market size and credibility. He called the rise of meme coins a reflection of the industry’s diversity, not a threat to its legitimacy. When asked about the broader crypto rally, Burgherr said recent price gains in Bitcoin appear driven by a mix of macroeconomic concerns and renewed optimism in risk assets. He cited inflation fears and questions over US debt sustainability as key drivers of investor interest in Bitcoin and gold.

2025-05-27T04:45:35.000Z,"Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High — But Is the Market at Its Peak? Analyzing Four Key Indicators","Bitcoin (BTC) just recently broke through its previous all-time high, which has created a lot of excitement and speculation across the crypto community. But as the price climbs into new all-time highs, the big question is: are we in a new leg up, or are we nearing the top of this cycle? In a more lucid picture of their market cycle, analysts see Bitcoin turning to four all-important indicators: the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the 200-Week Moving Average Heatmap, and the 2-Year Moving Average (MA) Multiplier. Each of these tools offers a different take on Bitcoin’s historic behavior and could well shed light on how much life is left in this rally before it runs out of gas. Rainbow Chart: Forecasting Long-Term Potential The popular long-term valuation model known as the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart uses a logarithmic growth curve to project the potential price ranges of Bitcoin over time. It is not intended as a short-term trading tool but rather provides a broad overview of the trajectory of Bitcoin across various market cycles. The latest update—titled the Rainbow2023 Chart—recommends that there is still substantial upside potential. It suggests that Bitcoin is in a “Hold” or “Accumulate” zone, with present prices not really extended in any sense when viewed through a macro lens. The Rainbow chart goes on to point out that the next cycle peak is potentially well above $200,000. This model suggests that even if BTC has hit new heights, we’re not quite in the euphoric space that usually signifies the last leg of a bull market. Whether you hold for the long term or are a recent addition to the space, upward price momentum could still deliver some tasty gains. RSI Signals Short-Term Overbought Conditions—but No Immediate Peak The price of BTC hit a new all-time high last week. Will it continue to rise or fall from the top? Let's use 4 indicators to see if $BTC is at its peak now. Rainbow Chart https://t.co/c2snAqQ7jl The Rainbow Chart is a long-term valuation tool that uses a logarithmic growth… pic.twitter.com/7rdzXEblcm — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 26, 2025 The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures how fast and how much price changes occur. It ranges from 0 to 100. Readings above 70 typically indicate an overbought market, while those below 30 suggest an oversold one. Currently, the RSI for BTC is at 71.35, which is situated just over the line that demarcates an overbought condition. Thus, we should maybe exercise a little caution here in the short term. Elevated RSI values like what we’re seeing now have often been precursors to local pullbacks or sideways-ish consolidation. However, it is worth mentioning, and a lot of commentators have mentioned, that BTC’s RSI has been above 70 for a nice stretch during prior bull runs. In short, although the RSI indicates a possibly overheated short-term market, it doesn’t definitely signal that the overall cycle top is in. It still could be the case that the market has some further price expansion potential before any kind of major correction kicks in. Heatmap and 2-Year MA Multiplier Show More Room for Growth We now focus on two enduring technical models that have usually been dependable for pinpointing moments of extreme market behavior. These are the 200-Week Moving Average Heatmap and the 2-Year MA Multiplier. The 200-Week Moving Average Heatmap employs a color-coded system that signifies when BTC is historically undervalued (blue/green) or overvalued (orange/red). Right now, Bitcoin’s price is represented in the blue zone—traditionally a “buy” zone. This could mean that, despite the all-time high, the broader market might be in the early stages of a bull cycle, with substantial upside potential. In the same way, the 2-Year MA Multiplier compares the present price with its 2-year moving average and a multiple of that average (often x5). At the moment, BTC trades between the green and red lines—much nearer the fair-value line than the line designating a euphoric state. Current market conditions don’t seem to resemble either an overheated situation or a recent peak. Conclusion: Still Climbing, Not Peaking—Yet The new all-time high for Bitcoin has, of course, raised concerns about whether the rally is sustainable or more likely to be ending soon. But a thorough examination of four key indicators gives a very different impression, one that suggests there is still a goodly amount of room for the market to grow in this cycle. The Rainbow Chart suggests that we could peak above $200K; the Heatmap and 2-Year MA Multiplier confirm that we are definitely below historical top prices. As with anything else in life, there must be some kind of upper limit. These models suggest a potential one for the next bull market. When all is said and done, Bitcoin looks to be enjoying a strong spell with lots of room to run and pretty good odds of appreciation ahead. As is always the case, investors ought to keep a close watch on price action, sentiment, and the macroeconomic backdrop—but for now, the data suggest that the bull market has lots of energy left.

It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.” Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.

They can also confirm that other entities, such as crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds, hold the required amount of crypto for the funds. Saylor acknowledged the industry had learned from the collapses of crypto exchanges FTX and Mt. Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.” “Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.” Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapse Many crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.

As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $108,499, marking a 2.5% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term retracement, the overall market trend remains positive. Bitcoin has held most of its recent gains and remains just below its record peak set yesterday. The recent price action has coincided with an increase in on-chain signals, suggesting that large players are returning to the market. Notably, analysts are closely monitoring activity from major crypto exchanges like Binance, which have historically played a significant role in price discovery and market direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Smashes Past $111K, But Are Traders About to Dump? Bitcoin Whale Activity on Binance Sparks Volatility Watch A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk highlighted a surge in whale activity on Binance. In his QuickTake post titled “Binance Whale Activity Spikes — Eyes on the Market,” the analyst pointed out that the Binance Whale Activity Score has seen a sharp rise. This metric, which measures inflow and outflow behavior of the top 10 whale wallets on Binance, indicates that large holders are actively repositioning. These movements can be early indicators of upcoming volatility and directional shifts in the market. The analyst explained that inflow spikes from whales may point to potential distribution or strategic selling, while outflow surges often signal accumulation or redeployment of capital to other platforms. The significance of these whale movements lies in their historical tendency to precede major price developments. According to Crazzyblockk, Binance remains a central venue for price formation, making it critical to observe whale patterns there. He concluded that these inflow-outflow fluctuations could introduce higher liquidity and possibly increased volatility in the short term. Spot Market Data Points to Renewed Buyer Interest Complementing these observations is a report from another CryptoQuant analyst, Ibrahimcosar, who identified a positive shift in spot market behavior. According to the analyst, the Spot Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) over the past 90 days has turned green again. This metric reflects the difference between taker buy and taker sell volumes and serves as a proxy for real-time demand. A green phase indicates that market buy orders have become dominant, suggesting that buyers are regaining control. The analyst noted that in previous months, the same chart showed mostly red values, indicating a prevalence of sell orders and downward price pressure. The recent transition back into green territory may suggest the emergence of new demand as Bitcoin challenges its previous highs.

2025-05-27T03:51:15.000Z,"Digital Assets See $3.3B Weekly Inflows Despite XRP’s Historic Reversal","After an unprecedented 80-week streak of inflows, XRP faced a sharp reversal with outflows totaling $37.2 million – the highest on record. This drop came despite a strong performance from broader digital asset investment products, which attracted $3.3 billion in inflows last week. According to CoinShares, the inflows brought the six-week inflow streak to a cumulative $10.5 billion. Year-to-date inflows have now hit a record-breaking $10.8 billion, while total assets under management briefly reached an all-time high of $187.5 billion. Investors Flock to Diversification Analysts attribute this momentum to rising economic uncertainty in the US, especially following Moody’s credit downgrade and surging treasury yields, which are pushing investors toward digital asset diversification. The latest edition of ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report revealed Bitcoin dominated digital asset inflows last week with $2.9 billion, and accounted for a quarter of total inflows in 2024. Interestingly, some investors viewed its price rally as a chance to short, which resulted in $12.7 million flowing into short-Bitcoin products – the highest since December 2024. Ethereum followed with $326 million in inflows, which represented its strongest in 15 weeks and the fifth straight week of positive sentiment. Meanwhile, Solana and Sui also saw inflows of $4.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively.

Alongside XRP, multi-asset products bucked the positive trend as witnessing $1.9 million in outflows. Switzerland, Sweden Report Outflows Regionally, the US continued to lead digital asset inflows with $3.2 billion last week, far ahead of other regions. Germany, Hong Kong, and Australia followed with $41.5 million, $33.3 million, and $10.9 million, respectively. Canada saw modest inflows of just $0.1 million during the past week.

But is it happening now, or are we still stuck in the Bitcoin season? A group of experts recently weighed in, and here’s what they had to say. Are We in Altcoin Season Right Now? Popular crypto analyst, Scott Melker, thinks we may have just experienced a mini altcoin season. He pointed out that while Bitcoin has been rising steadily, several altcoins also made big moves recently — something we haven’t seen in a long time. Ethereum, for example, jumped 40% in just two days at one point. What made this special is that Bitcoin’s dominance (its share of the overall crypto market) actually dropped while its price went up. In the past, when Bitcoin climbed, altcoins usually stayed flat or fell. This time, both moved up together — a sign to some that new money might be entering the market rather than traders just shifting funds between Bitcoin and altcoins. But Can We Really Have Another Altcoin Season Like the Old Days? The short answer: probably not in the same way. There’s a massive number of new crypto projects waiting on the sidelines. Venture capitalists and developers are holding off on launching thousands of new tokens until market conditions improve. When those hit the market, they’ll spread investor money thinner — making it harder for every altcoin to rise together like we’ve seen in past altcoin seasons. Instead, the experts believe the next altcoin run will be narrative-driven. In other words, only certain types of coins will pump at certain times based on market trends and hype. For example, it could be memecoins one month, AI-related tokens the next, or maybe DeFi (decentralized finance) projects on Solana or Ethereum. So, rather than a “throw a dart and watch everything rise” market, investors will need to be tuned in daily to catch the right trends at the right times.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-2025-is-done-whats-next-for-cryptos-underdogs/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET","News|Altcoins|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T03:40:45.000Z,"Top 10 Insights From TOKEN2049 Dubai 2025 – The Future of Crypto, AI and Web 3.0","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Attending TOKEN2049 was a breathtaking experience. Set in Dubai, the event drew over 15,000 attendees and industry leaders. Dubai has now established itself as the global center of blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3.0 – and the heart of the MENA (Middle East, North Africa) region. This conference was full of optimism and celebration at the significant steps that blockchain, DeFi and Web 3.0 took worldwide. Here are 10 key takeaways from the TOKEN 2049 event. 1. AI-blockchain synergy Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents were instrumental in key blockchain use cases like fraud detection, analytics and smart contract optimization. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) clouds could cut AI training costs by 50%. The blockchain x AI technology will be a powerful synergy for the road ahead. AI-driven blockchain audits will prevent over $50 billion in annual DeFi hacks. Cognitive smart contracts could become a new standard in secure computing. Fifty percent of the world’s AI training has the potential to be run on GPUs on the cloud in less than five years. With the explosion of use cases, AI and blockchain have the potential to reframe the Web 3.0 world as we know it. 2. DePIN technology will change the world DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) were everywhere at the conference. Some companies provided archival systems at 90% cheaper than traditional cloud computing giants. Distributed wireless grids, file systems, IaaS (intelligence-as-a-service), digital infrastructure and IoT systems stole the limelight. The DePIN market is expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. Decentralized Infrastructure provides power to the users and enables personal revenue. Smart cities could also be disaster-resistant with DePIN technology for electricity, internet, wireless systems, edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT). 3. Tokenized real-world assets are a reality Over $120 billion will be spent this year alone on tokenizing just real estate. Dubai’s VARA framework enables fractional blockchain ownership of luxury assets. This trend will only increase and cover everything from luxury cars to high-value assets like artwork. The RWA (real-world asset) tokenization market will hit the trillion-dollar market cap by as early as 2026. AI-managed investment portfolios with hold both crypto and real-world tokens. This is the long-awaited comeback of the security token in RWAs. Multiple institutions like banks, asset management firms and investment leaders are showing interest. 4. Bitcoin becomes mainstream Long seen as a speculative investment, Bitcoin is now a viable asset. With Trump’s presidency, multiple firms and institutions are investing in Bitcoin as a long-term purchase. The outlook for Bitcoin is incredibly optimistic, especially among core crypto followers. This is a key moment for cryptocurrency and Web 3.0 development. The legitimization of Bitcoin provides a solid foundation on which to build DeFi and Web 3.0 platforms. Companies are seeing past the hype and investing in Bitcoin heavily. Some analysts were even quoted predicting that Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2028. 5. MENA is the powerhouse of global Web 3.0 Crypto transfers in this region exceeded $330 billion in 2025, with 93% of transactions by institutions. UAE and Qatar were the main participants in this sector. The US will be implementing more relaxed crypto regulation – but until it does, the UAE, with its innovative regulations, will be the center of crypto globally. There are discussions to open up energy reserves like crude oil to tokenization and fractional ownership. 6. Stablecoins are the first accepted use case of crypto Stablecoins have become one of the backbones of global payments. Cross-border frictionless trading and commerce is now a reality with stablecoins. The share in cross-border transfers could rise to even 50% by around 2028. Stablecoins have seen massive adoption by individuals and institutions alike. As protocols evolve for DeFi, this trend is only set to increase and become even more common. 7. Breakthroughs in DAO governance In 2025, AI-powered voting systems in DAOs automated 30% of decisions in collective environments. This is the start of a widespread change in how systems are governed autonomously. DAO is a governance method that truly gives power to the people. It is predicted that even CeFi (centralized finance) systems will be using DAOs by 2030. For asset management, DAOs potentially represent a multi-trillion-dollar market. 8. Web 3.0 gaming breaks the casual barrier Major studios launched play-to-earn models with AAA gameplay. This is only the beginning of a huge shift in gaming as a whole. Extractive economics was only the beginning. The metaverse, player-generated assets and Web 3.0 gaming will change the way everyone games. Annual revenue could exceed $200 billion by 2029. Metaverse content will be immersive, VR/AR integrated and created primarily by AI. Play-to-earn could also include socially desirable changes in multiple sectors. 9. The importance of security As blockchain, DeFi and Web 3.0 move into acceptable investments, security is now the key. $1.2 billion was lost through blockchain scams in 2024 alone. Security standards need to evolve and keep up with advances in technology. As hackers use generative AI and sidechain attacks on major institutions – i t is critical that security standards be defined, refined and enhanced at least four times each year. Quantum computing, in particular, plays a very important role as perhaps the biggest threat to cybersecurity. Emerging technologies like ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) and biometric authentication need integration into blockchain systems. 10. Regulational clarity worldwide Perhaps the single biggest reason that Dubai became the crypto capital of the world – t he transparent and lenient regulations adopted by the UAE for crypto and blockchain. The US is expected to follow suit very soon with sweeping regulatory changes. In less than five years, as countries see the advantages of these regulations – e xpect similar changes all over the world and for crypto to become the defining standard of the wealth of the nations. This would truly introduce wealth distribution worldwide. Trump is soon expected to introduce regulatory changes in the US for crypto as well. The road ahead TOKEN2049 Dubai 2025 marks the point where crypto moves from labs to global infrastructure. There are many scams still at work, but crypto will be one of the defining forces of the modern world. As regulatory changes are made worldwide, expect the entire industry to grow by ten times at the very least by this time next year. The optimism is mixed with caution because of the lack of sweeping security standards and the lack of international regulatory enforcement. 2025 is the year when such changes are expected to take place. And there has never been a more exciting time to be involved in crypto, AI, DeFi, DePIN, blockchain and Web 3.0 – e ver.

Ahead of the boxing rounds, the pint-sized robots were put through tests to demonstrate a variety of kicks and punches and assist the organizers in refining the rules.The team with the highest points across the three rounds moves on to fight another opponent. A punch to the head was worth one point, and a kick to the head was worth three. Teams lost five points if their robot fell and 10 points if their robot was down for over eight seconds. AI used to teach real fight movesDuring a livestream of the event on the state broadcaster CCTV, Unitree director Wang Qixin  said the robotics company used “AI technology to let robots learn.”?

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days.Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her.The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.”CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit.Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer.Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody.He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28.Alleged victim shares ordealTeofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.”Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase. NBC New York reported that Teofrasto Carturan has an estimated net worth of around $30 million.Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summitPolice said Teofrasto Carturan was tied up with electrical cords and electrocuted. His feet were also tased while submerged in water and the alleged perpetrators held an electric chainsaw to his leg, threatening to cut off his limbs.Police claimed they found a Polaroid of the alleged perpetrators torturing Teofrasto Carturan, one showing him bound to a chair with a gun to his head. Teofrasto Carturan was also allegedly forced to smoke crack cocaine and was urinated on in the Soho apartment, described by NBC New York reporters as a “high-end frat house” with stripper poles and expensive liquor scattered throughout the five-story building.Carturan spent some time being treated at a hospital after escaping, the New York Post said.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/another-suspect-turn-into-cops-new-york-crypto-case-reports?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-27T01:15:00.000Z,"Bitlayer secures 31.5% of Bitcoin&#039;s hashrate to bring smart contracts to BTC","Bitlayer’s Bitcoin smart-contract system is being implemented by mining pools behind 31.5% of the network’s hashrate, a development that will help ensure that its system will operate on the Bitcoin blockchain, the company said.According to a May 27 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Bitlayer’s BitVM implementation will be supported by major Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools including Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool. Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Although the pilot program will be limited to those with UAE ID holders, there are plans to expand it globally.In April, the DLD and VARA agreed to link Dubai’s real estate registry with the tokenization of property.

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement. This suggests that whales and market makers remain confident, even with BTC trading just 2.6% below its record high of $111,957.Bitcoin options 30-day delta skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: laevitas.chThe negative 6% Bitcoin options delta skew indicates that put (sell) options are trading at a discount, a typical characteristic of bullish markets. Readings closer to zero reflect a more balanced demand between put and call (buy) options—a trend observed on May 25.It’s likely that the persistent institutional demand for Bitcoin is gradually shifting the risk perception among the world’s largest investment firms. Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, acquired $427 million worth of Bitcoin between May 19 and May 25, at an average price of $106,237. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw another $2.75 billion in inflows during the same period.During JPMorgan’s Annual Investor Day on May 19, CEO Jamie Dimon announced that the bank would finally allow clients to purchase spot Bitcoin ETFs. While the move does not include custody or official recommendations of cryptocurrencies, it opens the door to indirect Bitcoin exposure for the bank’s $6 trillion in customer deposits.Related: Bitcoin’s new highs may have been driven by Japan bond market crisisUS markets are closed on May 26 in observance of the Memorial Day holiday. As a result, any optimism stemming from the delayed US–EU tariffs may be tempered by ongoing concerns surrounding US government debt and the threat of a potential economic recession. The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment. Investors are closely watching the Richmond Fed manufacturing index due on May 28, followed by the PCE inflation data on May 30. These indicators will likely influence risk appetite and the chances of Bitcoin breaking above the $112,000 mark in the short term.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: CointelegraphRelated: SEC acknowledges slew of crypto ETF filings as reviews, approvals accelerateChanging regulatory stanceUnder the previous US presidential administration, the SEC brought enforcement actions against several crypto firms for offering staking services it alleged were unregistered securities offerings.Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the SEC has softened its stance.In February, the agency issued guidance stating that memecoins do not qualify as investment contracts under US law. In April, the regulator clarified that stablecoins also do not qualify as securities if they are marketed solely as a means of making payments.Still, the agency has yet to approve staking in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or issue formal guidance on how staking services can be offered compliantly in the US.Other policy goalsMuehr said she is optimistic the SEC will eventually approve staking for cryptocurrency ETFs, including for proposed Solana (SOL) funds.“Getting there means first getting the SEC comfortable with the structure,” she said, noting the industry has recently had “some productive meetings with the agency.”“I’m hopeful we’ll see a Solana ETF and even a staked Solana ETF in the US sometime soon.”The SEC is not the only agency the crypto industry is looking to persuade. Muehr said the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — the top US tax authority — has also taken a position the industry opposes.“The IRS finally issued a statement saying staking rewards are service income,” she said. “We disagree with that interpretation and continue to engage.”Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-industry-groups-urge-sec-to-clarify-staking-stance?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

Investors in their 30s saw the biggest growth, up 29%, followed by those in their 40s (27%), while investors over 50 increased by 25%.The FIU’s findings show that older investors have larger holdings.

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ETFs under its dedicated crypto committee.Lee ahead in presidential election voter surveyYoon’s failed coup accelerated the presidential election and brought renewed urgency to unresolved issues in the local crypto industry.“In the 2022 presidential election, cryptocurrency was viewed as speculative and untrustworthy. But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said.South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In Q1 2024, the Korean won ranked as the most-traded fiat currency against crypto, driven largely by retail investors. Institutional players remain on the sidelines, awaiting their turn as the FSC prepares to launch pilot trading for professional investors.FSC’s planned schedule for a phased introduction of institutional crypto investment in 2025.Crypto policies were once seen as campaign strategies to sway younger voters, but this year, they’re seen as an economic and social issue that impacts multiple generations. In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs.“Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active. In the past, people looked at it with skepticism, but now it feels like the public is approaching it more neutrally and making their own judgments,” Cho said.Lee Jae-myung leads the latest voter survey by local media and Next Research.

In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it’s easier and more practical.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alternative-sweden-cashless-plans?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023.Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain cryptoAdvanced form of address poisoningA zero-value transfer is considered an evolution of address poisoning, a tactic where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that resembles a victim’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. Custom addresses with similar starting and ending characters can also be combined with zero-value transfers.Related: Industry exec sounds alarm on Ledger phishing letter delivered by USPSThreat growing across blockchainsA January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024.

After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
