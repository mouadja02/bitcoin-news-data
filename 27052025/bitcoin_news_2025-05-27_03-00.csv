SHIB price trades under key resistance at $0.00001596, with the 50 EMA at $0.00001466 acting as dynamic resistance.

Outflows also fell more than 80% in the same period, showing a sharp drop in large holder activity. IntoTheBlock data confirms that this decline began in early May. Both inflows and outflows fell together, signaling reduced movement of tokens by large wallets. This drop reflects a liquidity contraction and lower trading participation from whales.

Over 70% Of XRP Realized Cap Is Six Months Old Or Younger In a post on X, Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt.₿ has talked about the capital inflow situation related to XRP. The indicator of relevance here is the “Realized Cap,” which is a model that, in short, keeps track of the sum of the cost bases of all addresses on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Greed Is Here—Time To Be A Contrarian? In other words, the indicator provides an estimate of the total amount of capital that the holders as a whole have invested into the cryptocurrency. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how this metric has changed for XRP over the past decade. As is visible in the graph, the XRP Realized Cap (black curve) has witnessed an explosion alongside the recent bullish push in the asset’s price. This would imply that a large amount of new capital has come into the cryptocurrency. In the same chart, the Glassnode researcher has also attached the data related to the Realized Cap associated with the different coin groups younger than six months. The aggregated Realized Cap has seen its growth during the past six months, so it’s not surprising to see that the capital held by cohorts falling in this age range has seen its share of the indicator blow up. This massive capital wouldn’t be in any significant profit, however, considering the price levels at which it has flowed in. After all, the window of the past six months is mostly just the cryptocurrency’s top and the subsequent phase of stagnation that’s still ongoing today. “Over 70% of the capital locked in XRP was deployed near the top over the past 6 months,” notes the analyst. Naturally, this could put the digital asset in a delicate situation, as it wouldn’t take much of a drawdown to throw all these investors into the red. It now remains to be seen how the coin would develop in the near future and whether capital would continue to flow in, despite the fact that its price has been unable to revisit the highs from January. In some other news, the XRP network has seen a sharp decline in the Number of Active Addresses since the March peak, as CryptoVizArt.₿ has pointed out in another X post. The Number of Active Addresses is an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the number of addresses taking part in transaction activity on the XRP network every day. Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals From the chart, it’s apparent that the Number of Active Addresses set a huge peak in March of this year, but since then, activity on the blockchain has taken a severe hit as the metric has gone down by more than 90%.

Under the surface, U.S. fiscal policy decisions and the advancement of the GENIUS Act are redefining how institutional capital, retail investors, and policymakers approach the crypto sector. Bitcoin recently set a new all-time high near $112,000 before pulling back slightly. That move wasn’t just technical — it was driven by macroeconomic shifts, including concerns over U.S. sovereign debt, inflationary pressure, and a recalibration of monetary policy. For many investors, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as both a high-growth asset and a long-term hedge against monetary uncertainty . The GENIUS Act: Opening the Door to Regulated Crypto Integration The GENIUS Act , recently passed in the U.S. Senate, focuses on establishing clearer frameworks around stablecoins, on-chain payments, and digital asset disclosures . It represents a formal shift in Washington’s tone — from adversarial to strategic. While not Bitcoin-specific, the Act provides institutional players with a pathway to explore digital asset exposure under clear rules. This regulatory clarity may help reduce the friction for broader adoption, especially among traditional financial institutions that have been cautious due to compliance risks. Bitcoin’s Role in a Changing Policy Landscape As U.S. fiscal dynamics remain volatile, Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized, supply-capped store of value continues to grow. With ETFs now active, institutional inflows are reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin isn’t speculative — it’s strategic. But as capital flows into blue-chip crypto assets, investors are also seeking earlier-stage exposure to high-upside opportunities. One project benefiting from this parallel trend is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a fast-growing crypto asset designed with a $0.007 listing target , fixed 100 billion supply , and upcoming staking utility . While Bitcoin remains the macro hedge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a strategic early-stage entry point with future utility built in. As regulation and fiscal conditions evolve, both institutional giants like Bitcoin and emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are playing key roles in what could be a transformative crypto decade.

2025-05-26T23:50:25.000Z,"Trump Media Group Plans Astonishing $3 Billion Crypto Investment Targeting Bitcoin","BitcoinWorld Trump Media Group Plans Astonishing $3 Billion Crypto Investment Targeting Bitcoin Breaking news from the Financial Times is sending ripples through both the media landscape and the Digital World of cryptocurrency. Reports indicate that Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), known for its social media platform Truth Social, is exploring a massive fundraising effort specifically aimed at venturing into the crypto space. This potential move could signal a significant embrace of digital assets by a prominent media entity. What is Trump Media Planning for Crypto Investment ? According to the Financial Times, citing unnamed sources familiar with the company’s plans, TMTG is looking to raise a substantial $3 billion. The primary target for deploying these funds is reportedly Crypto Investment , with particular interest in established digital currencies like Bitcoin . The proposed fundraising structure involves a two-pronged approach: Share Issuance: TMTG aims to secure $2 billion by issuing new shares. This would dilute existing ownership but provide a significant capital injection. Convertible Bonds: The remaining $1 billion is planned to be raised through the issuance of convertible bonds. These bonds can later be converted into equity under certain conditions, offering another pathway for capital generation. This ambitious Fundraising goal highlights the company’s apparent conviction in the potential of digital assets as a future area of growth and diversification. Why Would Trump Media Enter the Crypto Space? The potential entry of a company like Trump Media into the cryptocurrency market raises several interesting questions. While the company’s core business is social media and technology, expanding into crypto could be driven by various factors: Diversification: Investing in cryptocurrencies could offer a way to diversify the company’s assets beyond its primary operations, potentially hedging against volatility in the tech or media sectors. Engagement with a Tech-Savvy Audience: The user base for platforms like Truth Social often overlaps with individuals interested in technology, finance, and alternative investments, including cryptocurrencies. A direct involvement in crypto could resonate with this audience. Exploring New Revenue Streams: Beyond direct investment, TMTG could explore integrating crypto features into its platforms, such as payments, NFTs, or tokenized content, tapping into new revenue possibilities within the Digital World . Strategic Positioning: Embracing technologies like Bitcoin and blockchain could be seen as a strategic move to position TMTG at the forefront of digital innovation, aligning with themes popular among its user base. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin and the Market? A $3 billion investment, even if phased over time, represents a significant capital allocation. If a substantial portion of this were directed towards Bitcoin , it could have several implications: Increased Institutional Interest: While not a traditional financial institution, a publicly traded media company making a large crypto allocation adds to the narrative of increasing institutional adoption, potentially encouraging others. Market Impact: A large purchase of Bitcoin could exert upward pressure on its price, depending on market conditions and the timing of the investment. Validation: A high-profile company publicly backing crypto through investment can lend further legitimacy to the asset class in the eyes of mainstream investors. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is currently a report based on unnamed sources. The actual investment amount, the specific cryptocurrencies targeted beyond mentions of Bitcoin , and the timeline for both the Fundraising and investment remain subject to change or confirmation. Navigating the Digital World of Crypto: Challenges and Opportunities While the potential opportunities are clear, venturing into crypto also presents challenges for Trump Media : Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its significant price swings, which could impact the value of TMTG’s investment portfolio. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing potential risks and compliance hurdles. Technical Complexity: Managing and securing significant crypto holdings requires specialized expertise and infrastructure. Public Perception: Crypto remains a polarizing topic for some, and TMTG’s move could face scrutiny or criticism. Successfully navigating these challenges while capitalizing on the opportunities presented by the Digital World will be key to the success of this potential venture. Actionable Insights for Readers For those following the market or interested in TMTG: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from TMTG regarding their Fundraising efforts and investment plans. Monitor Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin , reacts to confirmed news regarding TMTG’s entry. Research Due Diligence: If considering investment in TMTG or cryptocurrencies based on this news, conduct thorough research on both the company’s fundamentals and the specific digital assets. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Digital World ? The report that Trump Media is planning a substantial $3 billion Fundraising effort for Crypto Investment , with a focus on Bitcoin , is a significant development. If confirmed and executed, it represents a bold step by a prominent media company into the rapidly evolving Digital World of digital assets. While opportunities for growth and diversification exist, the company will need to navigate the inherent volatility and regulatory complexities of the crypto market. This potential move underscores the increasing convergence of traditional industries and decentralized finance, signaling a future where digital assets play a more integrated role in corporate strategies.

2025-05-26T23:19:32.000Z,"Chinese underground banks are the financial lifeline of organized crime groups worldwide: TRM Labs","According to a May 2025 report from TRM Labs, Chinese underground banking networks have become critical for the operations of organized crime groups worldwide. These networks, also known as “fei qian” or flying money, operate in the shadows and function outside traditional banking regulations, and as a result, facilitate an array of illicit activities, from drug trafficking to cybercrime. The symbiotic relationship between global crime networks and Chinese underground banks According to TRM Labs’ report , there is a symbiotic relationship between Chinese underground banks and organized crime groups worldwide, and it operates beyond regulatory oversight. These networks have been known to use informal value transfer systems, such as “mirror exchanges,” to move funds across borders, which helps them avoid triggering the AML alarms in regulated banking systems. This network allows a broker in the U.S. to collect drug cartel cash and provide equivalent value in China—often in cryptocurrency or through trade-based money laundering (TBML)—without any cross-border wire transfers. In this way, cartels have been able to repatriate illicit earnings while helping wealthy Chinese clients interested in capital flight evade China’s strict capital controls, creating a mutually beneficial partnership. TRM Labs says these networks’ reach now extends globally, allowing them to serve a diverse clientele of criminal organizations from Mexican cartels to North Korean hackers. The cartels, for example, reportedly rely on Chinese underground bankers to launder drug proceeds, as seen in a Los Angeles-based ring that laundered over USD 50 million in narcotics revenue via crypto and trade-based schemes. Similarly, North Korean hackers depend on Chinese over-the-counter (OTC) brokers to convert stolen digital assets into fiat currency or commodities, evading global sanctions. The symbiotic ecosystem thrives on the ability of underground banks to act as a bridge between the cash-heavy criminal underworld and the formal economy. It depends on encrypted communication platforms like WeChat and Telegram, and exploiting regulatory gaps in jurisdictions with weak oversight, to ensure that illicit funds remain obscure. The financial pipeline for drug trafficking One particularly alarming thing about Chinese underground banking networks is that their capabilities have allowed them to evolve into a shadowy financial pipeline that boosts illicit activities, especially the lucrative drug trafficking between America and China. TRM’s report claims the system, which operates outside regulated channels, allows cartels like Sinaloa to launder hundreds of millions annually while Chinese brokers profit from small commissions, typically 1-2%. The increased adoption of crypto has revolutionized this pipeline, as it enables these groups to make faster, larger and more anonymous transactions. For example, TRM Labs reported cases where Sinaloa Cartel-linked launderers in the U.S. deposited drug cash into crypto ATMs or exchanges, converting it to Bitcoin for transfer to Chinese-controlled wallets. These funds are then used to purchase precursor chemicals for fentanyl production or other goods, which are reinvested into the drug trade. The pipeline not only encourages the opioid crisis but also supports a broader illicit economy, including North Korean sanctions evasion and Russian military supply chains. Disrupting the pipeline will require advanced blockchain analytics, international cooperation, and proactive measures, such as targeting key nodes like OTC brokers. There have been successful cases, such as Binance freezing accounts linked to North Korean launderers in 2022. However, the networks’ constant innovation means law enforcement has to remain on their toes and get even better at their jobs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-05-26T23:10:25.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Japan: Unpacking the Astonishing Rally Fuelled by Bond Turmoil","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Japan: Unpacking the Astonishing Rally Fuelled by Bond Turmoil The cryptocurrency world has been buzzing about Bitcoin’s recent surge to new all-time highs. While factors like the halving event and U.S. spot ETF inflows are often cited, analysts are pointing to a less obvious, yet significant, driver: instability in Japan’s bond market. Understanding the Bitcoin price Japan connection reveals fascinating dynamics at play in the global financial system. Is Japan’s Bond Market Shaking Up Bitcoin? Yes, according to some prominent market watchers. The core idea is that rising yields in Japan’s government bond market signal potential stress and increased sovereign credit risk for one of the world’s largest economies. When the cost for a government to borrow money (the yield on its bonds) goes up significantly, it can make investors nervous about the stability of that nation’s finances. Here’s a breakdown of the situation: Japan has maintained ultra-low interest rates and bond yields for decades as part of its economic policy. Recently, yields on longer-term Japanese government bonds (JGBs), particularly the 30-year yield, have been climbing, reaching levels not seen in years or even decades. This rise suggests market participants are demanding higher returns to hold Japanese debt, indicating concerns about future inflation or the government’s ability to manage its considerable debt load. This volatility in the Japan bond market is reportedly causing institutional investors to look for alternative assets that are not tied to traditional government debt or fiat currencies. Why is Japan Bond Volatility Driving Bitcoin Interest? The link stems from the perception of Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional financial system risks. When sovereign debt markets in major economies show signs of stress, investors, especially large institutions, begin searching for assets that are uncorrelated or even negatively correlated with these risks. Bitwise Asset Management’s Senior Macro Analyst, André Dragosch, highlighted this trend, noting the record high hit by the 30-year Japanese government bond yield. His analysis suggests this move prompted institutional investors to consider Bitcoin as a hedge against potential sovereign default risk. Unlike government bonds or fiat currency tied to a specific nation’s economy, Bitcoin is decentralized and operates outside the direct control of any single government or central bank. Think of it this way: If you are a large fund holding significant amounts of Japanese government bonds, and you see their value potentially eroding due to rising yields or concerns about Japan’s fiscal health, you might seek an asset that behaves differently. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and global, decentralized network, presents itself as one such alternative. Is Bitcoin a True Safe Haven Asset? The debate around whether Bitcoin safe haven status is legitimate continues. Traditionally, assets like gold, certain currencies (like the Swiss Franc), or even specific government bonds (in times of global turmoil) have been considered safe havens – places investors flock to during periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Arguments for Bitcoin as a safe haven: Decentralization: Not controlled by any government or central bank, immune to national monetary policy shifts or political instability (unlike fiat currencies or government bonds). Scarcity: Fixed supply cap (21 million coins) provides a perceived store of value similar to precious metals. Global Accessibility: Can be accessed and transferred anywhere in the world, bypassing traditional banking systems. Arguments against Bitcoin as a safe haven: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings, which contradicts the traditional definition of a stable safe haven asset. Lack of Long-Term Track Record: Relatively young asset class compared to gold or reserve currencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: Its decentralized nature also means it operates in a complex and evolving regulatory landscape across different countries. However, the current narrative linking it to Japan’s bond market suggests that, for some sophisticated investors, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed through this ‘digital gold’ or uncorrelated asset lens, particularly when specific sovereign risks emerge in major economies. The Role of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The thesis put forward by analysts like Dragosch heavily relies on Institutional Bitcoin adoption. It’s not just retail traders reacting to news; it’s the movement of significant capital by large funds, corporations, and asset managers that can truly impact market prices. Several factors point to growing institutional interest: Spot ETF Approvals: The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided a regulated and accessible avenue for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Corporate Treasury Strategies: Some corporations have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. Fund Allocations: Macro hedge funds and other investment vehicles are increasingly including Bitcoin in their portfolios as part of diversification strategies. The idea is that the scale of capital managed by these institutions means even a small allocation to Bitcoin as a hedge against sovereign risk, especially from a market as large as Japan’s, can create substantial buying pressure. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Market Analysis? This connection between the Bitcoin market analysis and traditional macroeconomics, specifically sovereign debt markets, adds a new layer of complexity. It suggests that global financial stability (or lack thereof) in major economies can become a significant factor influencing Bitcoin’s price movements, alongside crypto-specific events like the halving or ETF flows. Analyst predictions, such as Dragosch’s projection of Bitcoin potentially reaching $200,000, are often contingent on the continuation of these macro trends and sustained institutional buying. If Japan’s bond market volatility persists, or if similar sovereign risk concerns arise in other major economies, the demand for perceived uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin could continue to grow. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Pay attention not just to crypto news but also to major global macroeconomic developments, particularly sovereign debt markets in large economies. Understand the Narrative: Recognize that part of Bitcoin’s value proposition for institutions is its potential as a hedge against traditional financial risks. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin is volatile, its potential uncorrelated nature might make it a component of a diversified portfolio for some investors. Evaluate Predictions Carefully: Price targets like $200,000 are based on specific conditions and trends continuing; they are not guarantees. Potential Challenges: Correlation Risk: Bitcoin could still correlate with traditional markets during extreme stress events. Regulatory Headwinds: Increased institutional adoption could also bring more regulatory scrutiny. Market Sentiment Shifts: The narrative could change rapidly, impacting demand. Compelling Summary The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price appears to be influenced not just by crypto-native factors but also by macro-financial dynamics in distant markets like Japan’s. Volatility and rising yields in the Japan bond market are prompting some institutional investors to view Bitcoin as a potential Bitcoin safe haven or hedge against sovereign risk. This growing trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption, driven partly by global financial instability, is a significant element in the current Bitcoin market analysis and future price predictions, including projections like $200,000, provided this institutional interest and the underlying macro drivers persist. The Bitcoin price Japan connection highlights the increasing integration of the crypto asset into the broader global financial landscape.

2025-05-26T23:00:55.000Z,"Angel Investor Says He Will Finally Purchase XRP If This Signal Appears Within 6 Months","Crypto investor and analyst Dennis Liu, known for his insights on the VirtualBacon channel, has indicated that he may enter the XRP market for the first time if a specific technical condition is met within the next three to six months. Although Liu has remained on the sidelines of XRP until now, he believes an upcoming market shift could present a viable entry point. I’ll buy $XRP when this happens I’ve never held $XRP . But that might be about to change. One key signal is setting up and if it triggers in the next 3–6 months, I’ll finally add $XRP to my portfolio. Here’s what I’m watching — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 24, 2025 XRP Price Trails Bitcoin’s Rally As of this year, XRP has seen a modest gain of 12.54%. Despite this upward movement, it continues to struggle near the $2.50 range and has yet to establish a decisive breakout. In contrast, Bitcoin has recently surpassed new all-time highs, reaching $112,000. This disparity has highlighted XRP’s relative underperformance, leading some investors to reconsider its mid- to long-term potential. Investor’s Strategy Focuses on XRP/BTC Ratio Liu’s approach does not rely on speculative price targets or broader community sentiment. Instead, he is closely monitoring the XRP/BTC trading pair, which he believes holds the key to a more sustainable investment entry. As of now, the pair is trading at 0.00002136. According to Liu, this ratio has maintained support near 0.000022 since November 2024 and has formed a rounded top, signaling potential downside. The investor has identified a value range between 0.000017 and 0.000019 BTC. If the ratio drops into this zone, representing a 20% to 23% decline from current levels, he would consider initiating a position. He referred to this price band as the zone where other altcoins, including Ethereum and Solana, have historically begun significant upward movements. Price Scenarios That Could Lead to a Buy Signal Liu outlined two possible developments that might push the XRP/BTC pair into his target zone. One scenario involves XRP declining to around $1.80 while Bitcoin remains stable near $100,000 . Another possibility is that Bitcoin increases further, potentially reaching $128,000, while XRP remains stagnant. In either case, the result would likely be a lower XRP/BTC ratio, creating the conditions Liu is waiting for. He also cautioned that a quick dip to the $1.80–$1.85 range could act as a short-term correction, potentially forcing weaker investors to exit before a recovery begins. This, he believes, would represent a favorable buying opportunity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strengthening Fundamentals Support Long-Term Outlook Beyond price dynamics, Liu cited multiple developments that have improved XRP’s market fundamentals. These include the resolution of Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the listing of XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the approval of a Canadian spot XRP ETF, and the recent filing of a similar ETF application in the U.S. He also mentioned the increasing traction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Additionally, Liu noted that XRP has consistently underperformed Bitcoin since 2017. A reversal of this trend would mark a significant shift, not only for XRP but also for other long-standing altcoins that have lagged during recent market cycles. Liu has set clear conditions for his potential entry into XRP, a drop in the XRP/BTC ratio to the 0.000017–0.000019 range, and a possible price dip to around $1.80. While he has yet to take a position, the next three to six months will be critical in determining whether those technical conditions are met. If they are, Liu has confirmed he is ready to act on what he considers a data-driven and strategically timed opportunity.

2025-05-26T23:00:25.000Z,"Exciting YZi Labs Investment Fuels Avalon Labs’ Bitcoin DeFi Expansion","BitcoinWorld Exciting YZi Labs Investment Fuels Avalon Labs’ Bitcoin DeFi Expansion The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, with significant developments happening across various ecosystems. A recent announcement has caught the attention of many, particularly those interested in the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape built on Bitcoin. YZi Labs , a major player in the crypto investment space, has made a strategic move that could accelerate growth for a promising project. What is This Significant YZi Labs Investment? In a move signaling continued interest in the Bitcoin ecosystem, YZi Labs , known for its strategic investments in innovative blockchain projects, recently announced its investment in Avalon Labs . This announcement, shared via their official communication channels, highlights a commitment to supporting platforms that are building foundational infrastructure in key areas of the crypto market. Avalon Labs is specifically focused on developing a robust Bitcoin DeFi platform. While much of the DeFi activity has historically centered around Ethereum and other smart contract platforms, building decentralized financial applications on top of the Bitcoin network, the most secure and decentralized blockchain, is gaining significant traction. Avalon Labs aims to be a key contributor to this growing segment. Beyond its core DeFi platform, Avalon Labs is also the issuer of the USDa Stablecoin . Stablecoins play a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem by providing a stable medium of exchange and store of value, mitigating the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A well-integrated stablecoin is often essential for facilitating lending, borrowing, and trading activities within a DeFi protocol. How Will Avalon Labs Use the New Crypto Investment? According to the announcement, the funding secured through this Crypto Investment from YZi Labs is earmarked for two primary strategic objectives for Avalon Labs : Pursuing Regulatory Licenses: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape is critical for any financial platform, especially one aiming for institutional adoption. Securing the necessary licenses in various jurisdictions will legitimize Avalon Labs’ operations and open doors to a wider range of users and partners. Expanding Institutional Lending Operations: A major goal for many DeFi projects is bridging the gap between decentralized protocols and traditional finance, particularly institutional capital. Expanding institutional lending operations means building the infrastructure, partnerships, and compliance frameworks needed to onboard large financial entities, bringing significant liquidity and credibility to the platform. This focus indicates Avalon Labs’ ambition to not only serve retail DeFi users but also tap into the vast potential of institutional finance looking for compliant and reliable avenues to participate in the crypto space, particularly leveraging Bitcoin’s underlying security. What’s the Connection to the MVB Program? This investment isn’t a standalone event. It follows Avalon Labs’ participation in the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) incubation program. This program is a significant initiative in the blockchain space, co-led by prominent entities like BNB Chain, YZi Labs (in its former capacity or through its continued association), and CoinMarketCap. Participation in such a rigorous program often signifies a project’s potential, innovation, and readiness for growth. The MVB program provides selected projects with mentorship, resources, and networking opportunities, helping them refine their technology, business model, and market strategy. Avalon Labs’ successful navigation of this program likely played a crucial role in attracting the subsequent Crypto Investment from YZi Labs, validating their progress and future potential. Why is Bitcoin DeFi Gaining Momentum? For years, Ethereum has been the undisputed king of DeFi. However, the narrative is shifting. The desire to leverage Bitcoin’s unparalleled security, liquidity, and brand recognition for decentralized financial applications is driving innovation in the Bitcoin DeFi space. Projects are exploring various technical approaches, including: Layer 2 solutions (like Lightning Network extensions or sidechains) Cross-chain bridges and wrapped Bitcoin assets New protocols built directly on or interacting with the Bitcoin base layer Innovative uses of Bitcoin scripting or other functionalities Avalon Labs, with its platform and the USDa Stablecoin , is positioning itself within this exciting frontier, aiming to unlock the potential of Bitcoin’s dormant capital within the DeFi ecosystem. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? An investment like this brings several potential benefits: Accelerated Development: Funding allows Avalon Labs to hire more talent, improve technology, and expedite product launches. Enhanced Credibility: An investment from a reputable entity like YZi Labs boosts Avalon Labs’ standing in the market. Wider Reach: Resources can be allocated to marketing and business development, attracting more users and institutions. Regulatory Progress: Dedicated funding for licenses can significantly speed up compliance efforts. However, challenges remain: Regulatory Uncertainty: The pace and nature of crypto regulations are unpredictable globally. Competition: The Bitcoin DeFi space, while younger than Ethereum DeFi, is becoming increasingly competitive. Technical Hurdles: Building complex DeFi protocols securely on or connected to Bitcoin can be technically challenging. Market Adoption: Educating users and institutions about new Bitcoin DeFi solutions takes time and effort. Examples in the Bitcoin DeFi Space Avalon Labs is not the only project building in this area. Other examples of platforms contributing to the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem include projects focused on lending, borrowing, trading, and asset issuance using Bitcoin as the base layer or underlying asset. This growing ecosystem signifies a broader trend towards making Bitcoin more programmable and useful within decentralized finance. Actionable Insights for Readers What does this development mean for different stakeholders? For Users: Keep an eye on Avalon Labs for new opportunities to utilize Bitcoin within DeFi, potentially accessing lending, borrowing, or stablecoin services built on a Bitcoin-centric platform. Evaluate the platform’s security and compliance efforts as they progress. For Developers: This investment signals growing interest and capital in Bitcoin DeFi. Explore building applications or contributing to protocols within this ecosystem. For Investors: Research projects like Avalon Labs operating in the Bitcoin DeFi sector. Understand the unique technical and regulatory challenges and opportunities compared to other DeFi ecosystems. Conclusion: A Boost for Bitcoin DeFi and Avalon Labs The strategic Crypto Investment by YZi Labs in Avalon Labs represents a significant vote of confidence in the project and the broader Bitcoin DeFi movement. By focusing on securing regulatory licenses and expanding institutional lending, Avalon Labs is tackling critical areas required for mainstream adoption and growth. Coupled with its foundation as an issuer of the USDa Stablecoin and its pedigree from the MVB program, Avalon Labs appears well-positioned to become a notable player in making Bitcoin’s liquidity and security more accessible within the decentralized finance landscape. This development underscores the increasing maturity and diversification of the crypto market, extending innovation beyond traditional DeFi hubs to leverage the power of the original cryptocurrency.

2025-05-26T23:00:01.000Z,"Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup?","Bitcoin is trading less than 2.5% below its all-time high near $112,000, signaling growing momentum and the potential start of a new impulsive phase in price discovery. After weeks of steady gains and strong consolidation above the $100K level, BTC appears ready to break higher and extend its macro uptrend. The market is watching closely, as a clean move above $112K could trigger a wave of bullish continuation and renewed institutional interest. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? On-chain insights from CryptoQuant add important context to this moment. Specifically, the analysis of UTXOs—Unspent Transaction Outputs—provides a deeper understanding of the state of unrealized profits across the network. UTXOs are the core technical structure that ensures a single bitcoin can only be spent once. But beyond that, they offer critical insight into the profitability of held coins. Currently, the market is nearing the 99% threshold, meaning 99% of all BTC holdings are in profit. This level historically aligns with periods of market euphoria and strong uptrend, but can also signal potential overheating if sustained too long. As Bitcoin inches toward new highs, this metric reinforces the strength of the rally while reminding investors that such high profitability often comes with increased volatility. Bitcoin Thrives In Volatile Times As Market Nears 99% Profit Threshold Bitcoin is showing remarkable strength as it flirts with new highs this week, trading just below $112,000. While global markets react to rising U.S. Treasury yields and persistent inflation, Bitcoin appears to be thriving in the chaos, solidifying its role as both a risk asset and a macro hedge. As traditional markets face pressure, BTC continues to lead with resilience, even as geopolitical and policy-related uncertainty clouds investor sentiment. Top analyst Darkfost shared fresh insights on Bitcoin’s on-chain condition, focusing on the utility of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). UTXOs are the technical mechanism that ensures a single BTC can only be spent once on the blockchain. But beyond that, they serve as a powerful tool for assessing unrealized profits across all held BTC. One key metric derived from UTXOs is the percentage of BTC supply in profit. Currently, Bitcoin is approaching the critical 99% threshold, meaning nearly all coins are in unrealized gain territory. Historically, this level is associated with periods of market euphoria and sustained uptrends, but it also comes with a warning: elevated unrealized profits often precede spikes in profit-taking. While BTC’s structure remains bullish, macro uncertainty—especially around the Trump administration’s policy direction—keeps risk-on conviction muted. As Darkfost notes, “We’re not fully euphoric yet, but we’re entering a zone where late buyers should be cautious.” If the 99% profit signal drops, it may trigger a wave of selling as gains shrink and weaker hands capitulate. For now, though, Bitcoin remains strong, and the uptrend is intact. The market is watching closely because in times like these, BTC tends to move first. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Healthy – Data Shows No Signs Of Overheating BTC Holds Steady Near Highs As Momentum Builds Bitcoin is currently trading at $109,679 on the 4-hour chart, consolidating just below its all-time high after reclaiming short-term support. The price recently bounced off the 100 SMA ($105,586) and is now hovering above the 34 EMA ($108,280), signaling continued bullish momentum. All key moving averages are aligned to the upside, reflecting a strong and healthy trend. Volume has remained relatively stable during the pullback and recovery, suggesting no major distribution phase is underway. The 50 SMA ($107,679) also acted as dynamic support during the recent dip, reinforcing the strength of the $107K–$108K zone. The $103,600 level, previously a major resistance, continues to serve as solid structural support. As long as BTC remains above this zone, the broader uptrend remains intact. Short-term resistance now sits near the $110,200–$112,000 range. A breakout above this level would likely trigger the next leg higher, potentially toward the $120,000 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back To Daily EMA 8 – Can Bulls Hold Momentum? With Bitcoin holding above key EMAs and moving averages on the 4-hour timeframe, bulls remain in control.

2025-05-26T22:40:25.000Z,"Bitcoin Holders Unleash Strategic Buying During Market Dip","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Holders Unleash Strategic Buying During Market Dip The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, is no stranger to volatility. Recent price movements have once again put traders to the test, leading to significant crypto liquidations . While short-term speculators often face the brunt of sharp downturns, a fascinating trend emerges when we look at the behavior of a different cohort: the long-term Bitcoin holders. These experienced participants appear to be viewing the recent Bitcoin market dip not as a threat, but as a prime opportunity to strengthen their positions. What Happened During the Recent Bitcoin Market Dip? The market experienced a notable downturn, pushing Bitcoin’s price below key support levels. According to analysis by Amr Taha from CryptoQuant, this price action triggered two major long liquidations. In total, over $185 million in leveraged long positions were wiped out. This is a common occurrence in volatile markets; traders using leverage amplify both potential gains and losses. When the price moves against a leveraged ‘long’ bet (a bet that the price will go up), and the account equity falls below a certain threshold, the position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses, resulting in a liquidation. For many short-term traders and those using high leverage, this period was undoubtedly stressful, leading to significant losses. The scale of the liquidations underscores the swift and impactful nature of the price decline. Who Are Long-Term Bitcoin Holders and Why Do They Matter? In the world of Bitcoin , market participants are often categorized based on how long they hold their coins. Short-term holders (STHs) typically hold for less than 155 days, often trading based on technical indicators, news, or short-term trends. Long-term holders (LTHs), on the other hand, are addresses that have held their Bitcoin for 155 days or longer. These are the participants with high conviction, often referred to as ‘HODLers’ (a term originating from a misspelling of ‘hold’). LTHs matter because their behavior can signal underlying market strength or weakness. They are less likely to sell during minor price fluctuations and their accumulation or distribution patterns can provide insights into the long-term outlook for Bitcoin. When LTHs are accumulating, it suggests strong belief in future price appreciation and removes supply from the active market. Why Do Long-Term Bitcoin Holders View Dips as Opportunity? Unlike short-term traders who might panic sell during a price drop, long-term Bitcoin holders often see Bitcoin market dip s as valuable buying opportunities. This strategy is rooted in several core beliefs and practices: High Conviction: LTHs typically have a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its scarcity, and its potential as a future global reserve asset or store of value. This conviction allows them to look past short-term volatility. Lowering Average Cost Basis: Buying during a dip allows LTHs to acquire more Bitcoin at a lower price, effectively reducing their overall average cost per coin. This can significantly enhance future profits if the price recovers and continues to rise. Accumulation Phase: Many LTHs are in an accumulation phase, regularly adding to their holdings regardless of short-term price movements. Dips simply present a chance to accelerate this accumulation at a discount. Focus on Long-Term Growth: Their investment horizon is years, if not decades. A 20% or 30% dip is seen as a minor blip on the path to much higher potential future values. This approach highlights a key benefit of long-term investing: the ability to leverage market downturns to acquire assets at a lower price, potentially leading to greater returns over time compared to trying to time the market perfectly. Unpacking the Long-Term Holder Realized Cap: A Key Bitcoin Analysis Metric One powerful tool for understanding the behavior of these seasoned investors is the Long-Term Holder Realized Cap. To understand this, we first need to touch upon the overall Realized Cap. The Realized Cap is a variation of market capitalization that values each unit of cryptocurrency at the price it last moved on-chain, rather than the current market price. It provides a more accurate reflection of the aggregate cost basis of all coins in circulation. The Long-Term Holder Realized Cap specifically tracks the aggregate cost basis of only those coins held by LTHs (coins that haven’t moved for 155+ days). When this metric rises significantly, it indicates that a substantial amount of Bitcoin is being acquired by LTHs at higher prices, or, as in the case highlighted by CryptoQuant’s Amr Taha, that LTHs are adding new coins to their holdings during price dips. Taha’s analysis pointed to a surge in the LTH realized cap to over $28 billion. This surge, occurring alongside a price dip and significant crypto liquidations , is highly significant. It suggests that despite the short-term pain experienced by leveraged traders, a large amount of capital from long-term investors flowed into the market to buy the dip. This accumulation by LTHs during periods of market stress is a classic pattern and is often interpreted as a sign of underlying market strength and conviction in Bitcoin’s future. This Bitcoin analysis metric provides tangible evidence of LTH behavior, moving beyond anecdotal observations. It shows that their accumulation strategy isn’t just theoretical; it’s actively happening on-chain, impacting the distribution of Bitcoin supply. Actionable Insights: Lessons from Long-Term Bitcoin Holders The behavior of long-term Bitcoin holders offers valuable lessons for any investor navigating the volatile crypto market: Develop Conviction: Understand the asset you are investing in. Research Bitcoin’s technology, economics, and philosophy. Strong conviction reduces the likelihood of making emotional decisions during market swings. Focus on the Long Term: Trying to predict short-term price movements is incredibly difficult. Adopting a longer investment horizon allows you to ride out volatility and focus on the asset’s potential growth over years. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This strategy automatically leads to buying more when prices are low and less when prices are high. Dips become opportunities to acquire coins at a discount through your regular purchases. Manage Risk: While LTHs buy dips, they typically do so with capital they can afford to lose and avoid excessive leverage, which is the primary cause of the crypto liquidations seen in the market. Ignore Short-Term Noise: The 24/7 news cycle and social media can amplify fear and greed. LTHs demonstrate the value of tuning out short-term noise and sticking to a well-thought-out plan. While the LTH strategy is not without its challenges (dips can deepen, and there’s always opportunity cost), their consistent behavior during market stress provides a compelling example of a disciplined investment approach in the volatile world of Bitcoin. Conclusion The recent Bitcoin market dip served as a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility, causing significant pain for leveraged traders through crypto liquidations . However, looking beneath the surface, long-term Bitcoin holders exhibited classic accumulation behavior. The surge in the LTH realized cap, highlighted by Bitcoin analysis from CryptoQuant, provides concrete evidence that these high-conviction investors were actively buying the dip, adding over $28 billion to their collective cost basis during this period of stress. This strategic accumulation by LTHs is a crucial dynamic in the Bitcoin market, suggesting underlying strength and a focus on the asset’s long-term potential, even as short-term price swings shake out less patient participants.

2025-05-26T22:23:50.000Z,"South Korea’s Crypto Future Will Be Decided in Upcoming Elections: Here’s the Latest","Cryptocurrency markets have taken center stage ahead of the upcoming early presidential elections in South Korea. The expanding cross-generational digital asset investor base across the country has pushed candidates to run with crypto-friendly policies. All three leading presidential candidates have made positive promises toward crypto, including legalizing spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and easing banking restrictions on fiat and crypto trading, which are limited to just five platforms. The June 3 elections come nearly two years early after former President Yoon Suk-yeol was ousted from office following a controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Although Yoon's sudden attempt to seize power was swiftly rebuffed by parliament, the move sparked a political crisis and resulted in his impeachment. Yoon had promised to reform crypto regulations in his 2022 election campaign, targeting young voters in particular. In the 2025 elections, digital assets have now become one of the main agendas, with older generations also investing significantly. All three main candidates running in this election are promising to grow the local crypto economy. Lee Jae-myung, the opposition Democratic Party candidate, is back on the scene with a crypto-friendly campaign after losing to Yoon in 2022. Kim Moon-soo, the candidate of the ruling People's Power Party (PPP), is trying to reshape the conservative base after the ousted Yoon left the party. Lee Jun-seok, former PPP leader and the youngest party leader in South Korean political history, is running as an independent candidate with the Reform Party, which he founded at the beginning of 2024. Related News: New Details Emerge from Developers of Altcoin Affected by Hack Worth Over $200 Million Lee Jae-myung, who also made pro-crypto promises in the 2022 election, did not take as aggressive a stance as Yoon at the time. Yoon's promises included steps such as lifting the ban on play-to-earn (P2E) games and allowing initial coin offerings (ICOs), but most of them were not implemented. Both Lee Jae-myung and Kim have included Bitcoin ETFs as campaign promises, a move seen as part of growing global momentum following the US approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Yoon’s failed coup attempt accelerated the election process and brought new attention to unresolved issues in the crypto industry. “In the 2022 elections, cryptocurrencies were seen as speculative and unreliable. But by 2025, it has become a mainstream issue with major candidates promising to institutionalize and financialize crypto in response to the investment reality of young voters,” said Dongguk University’s Park. South Korea remains one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In the first quarter of 2024, the Korean won was the most traded fiat currency against crypto. This is largely driven by individual investors, while institutional investors are waiting for the FSC to launch a pilot trading program for professional investors. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-26T22:10:25.000Z,"Bitcoin Price: Unstoppable Rise? Institutional Adoption Fuels BTC Above $95K","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Unstoppable Rise? Institutional Adoption Fuels BTC Above $95K The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing, and lately, all eyes have been firmly fixed on the Bitcoin price . After shaking off the doldrums of early January, BTC embarked on a truly impressive rally, soaring over 50% from its lows. This surge culminated in a peak near $111,880 before the market entered what many analysts are calling a ‘healthy consolidation’ phase. This period of stability, especially when holding crucial levels, speaks volumes about the underlying strength of Bitcoin right now. But what’s driving this resilience, particularly when global macroeconomic signals seem less than certain? Let’s dive deeper into the factors at play. Bitcoin Price: Riding the Wave of Resilience Bitcoin’s journey this year has been remarkable. From touching lows that worried many investors, the asset demonstrated its inherent volatility but also its powerful recovery potential. The rapid ascent to $111,880 wasn’t just a random spike; it was fueled by a confluence of positive developments that reinforced confidence in the asset’s future. The current consolidation phase, hovering significantly above key support levels, suggests that the market is digesting these gains and building a base for potential future moves. According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report, this holding pattern is a positive sign. It indicates that despite potential profit-taking and external market pressures, the conviction among holders remains strong. The ability of the Bitcoin price to maintain its value in this range is a testament to the evolving market dynamics. Institutional Adoption: The Driving Force Behind BTC One of the most significant narratives supporting the current strength of the BTC price is the accelerating pace of Institutional Adoption. It’s no longer just retail investors or early adopters driving the market; large corporations and traditional financial institutions are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate and strategic asset class. Recent reports highlight substantial corporate buys, collectively adding over 8,800 BTC to treasuries. These aren’t speculative short-term trades; they represent long-term commitments from sophisticated players who see Bitcoin as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, or simply a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio. Furthermore, favorable regulatory moves in various jurisdictions are lowering barriers and providing clearer guidelines, making it easier for institutions to enter the space. This growing institutional interest provides a significant demand floor and adds a layer of maturity to the Bitcoin market that wasn’t present in previous cycles. Navigating the Crypto Market Amidst Macro Headwinds It’s impossible to discuss the Crypto Market without acknowledging the broader macroeconomic landscape. Currently, the global economy faces several uncertainties, including rising U.S. tariffs, volatility in bond markets, and shifting monetary policies. Traditionally, risk assets like cryptocurrencies might be expected to falter under such pressure. However, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience. This suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed through a different lens by some investors – perhaps less as a purely speculative tech play and more as a potential safe haven or uncorrelated asset in times of traditional market stress. While not entirely immune to macro shocks, its ability to hold its ground demonstrates a growing confidence in its value proposition independent of traditional financial systems. Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Fueling Demand The launch of spot Bitcoin ETF products in major markets has been a game-changer. These vehicles provide traditional investors with easy, regulated access to Bitcoin exposure without the complexities of direct ownership. The result? Consistent and significant inflows into these ETFs. These inflows represent fresh capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem on a daily basis, absorbing supply and putting upward pressure on the price. Coupled with steady demand on the spot market from individual buyers and other institutions, the ETF channel has become a powerful engine for price support. The sustained nature of these inflows underscores the strong underlying demand from a broad base of investors who previously found it difficult to access Bitcoin. Here are some key factors supporting Bitcoin’s current strength: Strong Institutional Adoption: Corporations and institutions adding BTC to balance sheets. Consistent Bitcoin ETF Inflows: New capital entering the market via regulated products. Resilience to Macro Headwinds: Holding ground despite global economic uncertainty. Favorable Regulatory Signals: Increasing clarity and acceptance in key markets. Healthy Consolidation: Price stabilizing after a significant rally, building a base. Steady Spot Market Demand: Continued buying interest from various investor types. Key Levels for Bitcoin Price: Why $95K Matters In technical analysis and market structure, certain price levels hold significant psychological and fundamental importance. For the current Bitcoin price , the $95,000 level is particularly crucial. According to the Bitfinex report, this level represents the aggregate cost basis for short-term holders. What does this mean? It’s the average price at which investors who bought BTC relatively recently acquired their coins. Holding above this level is vital because it means most recent buyers are still in profit, reducing the likelihood of panic selling and maintaining positive market sentiment. A sustained drop below $95,000 could flip this dynamic, potentially leading to increased selling pressure as short-term holders look to exit at breakeven or a small loss. Therefore, monitoring how the BTC price interacts with this level in the coming weeks will be essential. Looking ahead, the third quarter of the year is often a period where market trends become clearer. Will the current consolidation serve as a springboard for the next leg of the rally, pushing the Crypto Market higher? Or will macro pressures and profit-taking lead to a more significant retracement? The ability of the Bitcoin price to defend key support levels like $95,000, coupled with continued Institutional Adoption and Bitcoin ETF inflows, will likely dictate the direction. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Steadfast Position Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable strength and resilience in recent months, rebounding significantly and consolidating healthily above crucial support levels. This performance is not happening in a vacuum; it’s underpinned by fundamental shifts in the market, most notably the increasing pace of Institutional Adoption and the consistent demand generated by Bitcoin ETF inflows. While the broader macroeconomic environment presents challenges for the entire Crypto Market , Bitcoin’s ability to hold strong suggests a growing maturity and acceptance as a valuable asset. Keeping a close watch on the $95,000 level for the Bitcoin price and observing the trends in Q3 will provide further clarity on whether this period of consolidation is merely a pause before the next surge or a sign of potential headwinds ahead. Regardless, the narrative for BTC remains compelling, driven by solid demand and increasing mainstream integration.

Meanwhile, a crypto investor lost $2.6 million after falling victim to two phishing scams. In US politics, House Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed concerns over President Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner. Dubai launches first licensed tokenized real estate project in MENA region Dubai has launched the first licensed tokenized real estate project in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, previewing appetite for real-world tokenization in one of the world’s burgeoning crypto hubs. Partners in the project include the Dubai Land Department (DLD), the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Dubai Future Foundation, according to an announcement from the Dubai government. The tokens will be tradeable on the newly launched “Prypco Mint” platform, with Zand Digital Bank appointed as the bank for the project’s pilot phase. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) updated its rules to include real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, allowing such tokens to be traded on secondary markets. The project will allow individual investors to buy tokenized shares in “ready-to-own properties in Dubai,” with investments starting at 2,000 Emirate dirham ($545). During the pilot phase, all transactions will be carried out in the dirham (AED), with no cryptocurrency to be used. Although the pilot program will be limited to those with UAE ID holders, there are plans to expand it globally. In April, the DLD and VARA agreed to link Dubai’s real estate registry with the tokenization of property . The stated goal was to attract global investors and enhance liquidity in Dubai’s real estate market. The project was initially announced in March . Crypto investor loses $2.6 million in stablecoins in double phishing scam A single victim was scammed two times within three hours , losing a total of $2.6 million in stablecoins. According to data shared on May 26 by crypto compliance firm Cyvers, the victim sent 843,000 worth of USDt ( USDT ), followed by another 1.75 million USDt around three hours later. Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer , a sophisticated form of onchain phishing. Source: Cyvers Alert Zero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address. Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history. The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023. Speaker Johnson shrugs off Trump crypto dinner concerns US House Speaker Mike Johnson brushed off concerns on President Donald Trump’s dinner for the top holders of his memecoin when speaking to CNN on May 25 and dodged answering whether the attendees should be made public for transparency. “We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn't be outraged.” “Look, I don't know anything about the dinner,” Johnson answered, claiming he “was a little busy this past week,” focusing on passing a $1.6 trillion federal budget funding bill.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , CoinShares finds that institutional investors have set a new record for inflows. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows of US$3.3bn last week, extending the six-week streak to US$10.5bn. Year-to-date (YTD) inflows have now reached a new record of US$10.8bn, while total assets under management (AuM) briefly peaked at an all-time high of US$187.5bn earlier in the week.

2025-05-26T22:00:25.000Z,"MicroStrategy Bitcoin: Astonishing Acquisition Boosts Holdings Past 580K BTC","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Bitcoin: Astonishing Acquisition Boosts Holdings Past 580K BTC MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin powerhouse, continues its relentless pursuit of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. In a move that underscores their unwavering conviction, the company recently announced yet another significant Bitcoin acquisition , further solidifying its position as the largest corporate holder of BTC globally. This latest purchase pushes their total MSTR Bitcoin holdings well past the half-million mark, a milestone that highlights the sheer scale of their digital asset strategy. What Was MicroStrategy’s Latest Bitcoin Acquisition? According to a recent announcement from Chairman Michael Saylor on platform X, MicroStrategy added a substantial amount of Bitcoin to its treasury. The company acquired an additional 4,020 BTC. This latest purchase came at a considerable cost, totaling approximately $427.1 million. Breaking down the numbers, this means the average price paid for this specific batch was around $106,237 per coin. This figure is notably higher than their overall average purchase price, reflecting the market conditions during the acquisition period. This continuous buying activity is not just about adding more coins; it’s a clear signal of MicroStrategy’s long-term belief in Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. The strategy, heavily influenced by Michael Saylor ‘s bullish stance, involves leveraging various financial instruments, including debt and equity offerings, to fund these large-scale purchases. This approach differentiates MicroStrategy from most other public companies and has made it a unique proxy for investing in Bitcoin. How Large Are MSTR Bitcoin Holdings Now? Following this latest acquisition, MicroStrategy’s total MSTR Bitcoin holdings have reached an impressive 580,250 BTC as of May 25. To put this into perspective, this vast accumulation represents a significant portion of the total circulating Bitcoin supply held by public companies. The aggregate cost of these holdings is staggering, totaling around $40.61 billion. What’s particularly interesting is the average price at which these coins were acquired over time. MicroStrategy’s overall average purchase price for its total holdings stands at $69,979 per coin. This demonstrates a substantial unrealized gain based on the current market value of Bitcoin, although it’s crucial to remember that these gains are only realized if the company were to sell. Here’s a snapshot of their holdings: Metric Value Latest BTC Acquired 4,020 BTC Cost of Latest Acquisition ~$427.1 million Average Price (Latest Purchase) ~$106,237 per BTC Total BTC Holdings (as of May 25) 580,250 BTC Total Cost of Holdings ~$40.61 billion Average Price (Total Holdings) ~$69,979 per BTC The company’s year-to-date (YTD) yield on its Bitcoin holdings is reported at 16.8%. This metric likely reflects the appreciation in the market value of their holdings relative to the average cost basis within the current year, showcasing the profitability of their investment during this period. Who is Michael Saylor and Why is He So Bullish? At the heart of MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy is its co-founder and Chairman, Michael Saylor . Saylor is arguably one of the most vocal and prominent corporate advocates for Bitcoin globally. His conviction stems from a deep understanding of monetary history, economics, and technology. Saylor views Bitcoin as a superior store of value compared to traditional assets like gold or fiat currency, particularly in an era of increasing inflation and monetary expansion. Saylor has consistently articulated his belief that Bitcoin is digital property with unique characteristics: It is scarce, with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. It is decentralized, not controlled by any single government or entity. It is immutable and censorship-resistant. It is portable and divisible. He sees Bitcoin as the ideal treasury reserve asset for corporations looking to preserve capital over the long term in a world where fiat currencies are constantly losing purchasing power. His public endorsements, interviews, and presentations have played a significant role in educating institutions and the public about Bitcoin, making him a key figure in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. What Drives MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy? MicroStrategy’s approach to Bitcoin acquisition is multifaceted and driven by several factors: Inflation Hedge: A primary motivation is to protect the company’s treasury from the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. Saylor believes Bitcoin offers a superior hedge compared to holding cash or traditional low-yield assets. Store of Value: Bitcoin is seen as a long-term store of value, capable of appreciating significantly over time as adoption grows and its scarcity becomes more pronounced. Capital Allocation: The company views allocating capital to Bitcoin as a better use of funds than reinvesting in its core business beyond a certain point, or holding depreciating cash assets. Shareholder Value: By acquiring Bitcoin, MicroStrategy aims to increase shareholder value by exposing investors to the potential upside of Bitcoin’s price appreciation, effectively turning MSTR stock into a leveraged Bitcoin play. Market Leadership: Their early and aggressive move into Bitcoin has given them a unique position in the market and significant attention. This strategy is not without its risks, notably the volatility of the Bitcoin price and the leverage used to finance some of the purchases. However, the company has maintained its conviction through market cycles. What Does This Mean for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? MicroStrategy’s actions are a significant indicator of growing Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . While they were an early and aggressive mover, their continued purchases, coupled with the recent approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the US, signal a broader trend. More institutions are exploring ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin, whether directly, through ETFs, or by investing in companies like MicroStrategy. The scale of MicroStrategy’s holdings provides a case study for other corporate treasuries considering similar moves, albeit perhaps on a smaller or less leveraged scale. Their experience highlights both the potential rewards and the challenges, particularly around volatility and accounting treatment. Benefits of this trend include increased market liquidity, greater legitimacy for Bitcoin as an asset class, and potentially reduced price volatility over the long term as more stable, large-scale holders enter the market. However, challenges remain, such as regulatory clarity, custodial solutions, and the inherent risks associated with a nascent asset class. Actionable Insights from MicroStrategy’s Strategy: Conviction Pays (But Comes with Risk): MicroStrategy’s commitment through bear markets has positioned them well for bull runs, but their leveraged strategy also amplifies potential losses during downturns. Long-Term Perspective: Their focus is clearly on the long-term value of Bitcoin, looking past short-term price fluctuations. Innovative Financing: Using debt and equity to buy assets is a powerful tool, but requires careful management and understanding of associated risks. Compelling Summary: MicroStrategy’s Unwavering Commitment MicroStrategy’s latest acquisition of 4,020 BTC is more than just another transaction; it’s a testament to their deep-seated belief in Bitcoin’s future. Under the leadership of Michael Saylor , the company has amassed an extraordinary total of 580,250 BTC, making their MSTR Bitcoin holdings a dominant force in the corporate treasury landscape. This continuous Bitcoin acquisition strategy positions MicroStrategy as a unique player in the market and serves as a significant data point for observing the trajectory of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . While the strategy carries inherent risks, MicroStrategy’s commitment remains firm, signaling confidence in Bitcoin as a generational asset.

2025-05-26T21:51:35.000Z,"Crypto Market Cycle: Unlocking the Institutional Drive for the Next Mania","BitcoinWorld Crypto Market Cycle: Unlocking the Institutional Drive for the Next Mania Are we on the cusp of the next major surge in the crypto market? If you’ve been following the space, you know that anticipating the drivers of the next bull run is a hot topic. Historically, much of the explosive growth and subsequent ‘mania’ has been attributed to the wave of retail crypto investors entering the market, fueled by hype and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). The Shifting Landscape of the Crypto Market Cycle However, a compelling new perspective is emerging from within the industry. According to Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, the script for the next crypto market cycle might be flipping. Moreno recently shared insights on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that the upcoming market mania won’t be primarily driven by the individual retail trader logging in from their living room. Instead, he posits that the significant momentum will come from a different class of participants: smaller companies, startups, and various types of investment funds. This forecast marks a potential evolution in how market dynamics play out. While retail enthusiasm has undoubtedly been a powerful force in past cycles, the increasing maturity of the crypto ecosystem, coupled with clearer regulatory landscapes in some regions and the development of institutional-grade products, is paving the way for more sophisticated players to take center stage in institutional crypto adoption . The idea is that these entities, armed with larger capital pools, different investment mandates, and perhaps a longer-term view (or at least a different kind of short-term view than day-trading retail), could exert a more profound influence on price action and overall market sentiment during a bullish phase. Why the Shift Towards Institutional Crypto Adoption? Several factors contribute to the growing expectation of increased institutional crypto adoption driving the next cycle: Increased Accessibility: Products like Bitcoin ETFs in major markets provide traditional investors with easier, regulated access to digital assets without the complexities of direct ownership and custody. Regulatory Clarity (Emerging): While still fragmented globally, there’s a trend towards establishing clearer rules for digital assets, reducing uncertainty for corporate treasuries and funds. Maturity of Infrastructure: Custodial solutions, trading platforms, and other services tailored for institutional needs have significantly improved. Macroeconomic Environment: Persistent inflation concerns and a search for uncorrelated assets or alternative growth opportunities make digital assets more attractive to portfolio managers. Corporate Interest: Beyond just investment funds, some companies are exploring holding digital assets on their balance sheets or integrating blockchain technology into their operations, leading to potential asset accumulation. This isn’t to say that retail will be absent, but their role might shift from being the primary spark to perhaps amplifying trends already set in motion by larger capital flows. What Role Will Retail Crypto Investors Play? The prediction doesn’t necessarily sideline retail crypto investors entirely, but it re-evaluates their potential influence on the peak ‘mania’ phase. In previous cycles (like 2017 or 2021), widespread public awareness, social media hype, and easy access via user-friendly apps led to a flood of individual investors, many of whom were new to the space. This collective action created immense buying pressure, driving prices to sometimes unsustainable highs. In the potential scenario outlined by CryptoQuant, retail participation will likely still be significant, but perhaps more as participants riding a wave initiated by institutional activity rather than being the wave’s primary engine. They might be quicker to take profits or more cautious after experiencing previous market volatility. Consider the differences in approach: Characteristic Traditional Retail Investor (Past Cycles) Predicted Institutional/Company Driver (Next Cycle) Capital Source Personal savings, disposable income Corporate treasuries, fund capital, venture funding Investment Horizon Often short-term, driven by quick gains/FOMO Potentially longer-term strategic allocation, though fund mandates vary Risk Management Highly variable, often less sophisticated Structured risk frameworks, compliance requirements Decision Making Individual, often emotionally influenced Committee-based, research-driven, less susceptible to individual emotional swings Market Impact Collective small buys/sells creating large volume Potentially larger block trades, structured products influencing price discovery This table highlights why a shift towards institutional drivers could fundamentally alter the texture and speed of a market surge compared to a purely retail-driven one. Are Institutional Investors Prepared for a 90% Drawdown? This is the critical question posed by Julio Moreno. Past crypto market trends have shown just how volatile digital assets can be. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have historically experienced drawdowns of 70%, 80%, or even 90% from their peaks during bear markets. While institutions are often perceived as more sophisticated and less prone to panic selling than individual retail investors, they operate under different pressures. Moreno ponders whether these companies and funds will be prepared to hold onto their digital asset investment positions if their core business or fund performance faces a similar, drastic decline (like a 90% drawdown in their company stock or primary fund value). Here’s why this is a valid concern: Liquidity Needs: Companies or funds facing significant losses elsewhere might be forced to sell profitable or less correlated assets (like crypto) to meet liquidity requirements or cover losses. Shareholder/LP Pressure: Public companies or funds with limited partners face pressure to manage risk and deliver returns. Holding onto highly volatile, underwater crypto assets during a broader financial crisis could be politically difficult or even violate mandates. Correlation Risk: While crypto is often touted as uncorrelated, extreme market stress events can see all asset classes sell off together as investors rush to cash. Institutional portfolios are often diversified, and decisions might be made at the total portfolio level, not just the crypto allocation level. Structured Products: Some institutional involvement might be through leveraged products or complex derivatives, which could exacerbate selling pressure during downturns due to margin calls or liquidation triggers. Therefore, while institutions might bring more stability during accumulation phases, their reaction during a severe downturn remains a significant unknown and a potential source of sharp selling pressure, perhaps different in nature but equally impactful as retail panic. Navigating the Predicted Crypto Market Trends If the next cycle is indeed driven more by institutional capital, what does this mean for those participating in the market? For Investors: Focus on Fundamentals: Institutional investors often conduct deep due diligence. Assets with strong use cases, robust technology, clear roadmaps, and good governance might attract more institutional capital. Track Institutional Activity: Pay attention to news regarding fund allocations, corporate balance sheet holdings, and product launches (like new ETFs or institutional funds). Data from platforms like CryptoQuant that track large flows can be valuable. Understand Correlation: Be aware that increased institutional involvement might lead to higher correlation between crypto and traditional markets, especially during times of stress. Prepare for Volatility: While the *drivers* might change, the inherent volatility of digital asset investment is unlikely to disappear entirely. Position sizing and risk management remain crucial. Long-Term View: Institutional participation often implies a longer-term perspective on the asset class, which might encourage retail investors to also adopt a less speculative, more patient approach. For Projects/Protocols: Build Institutional-Grade Solutions: Focus on security, scalability, compliance, and robust APIs that meet the needs of larger players. Improve Governance: Clear and transparent governance structures can be appealing to institutions. Enhance Communication: Provide clear, professional information and engage with institutional research desks and analysts. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Asset Investment? The prediction from CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno about companies and funds driving the next crypto market cycle mania, rather than solely retail crypto investors , signals a potentially significant evolution in the market’s structure. Increased institutional crypto adoption is a trend that has been building for years, facilitated by improving infrastructure and regulatory clarity. While this shift could bring larger capital flows and potentially different market dynamics, it also introduces new questions, particularly regarding how these larger players will react during inevitable market downturns. The preparedness of these entities to withstand massive drawdowns, as highlighted by Moreno, remains a key factor to watch. Understanding these changing crypto market trends is vital for anyone involved in digital asset investment . Whether you are a seasoned trader or new to the space, recognizing the potential influence of institutional capital and its unique characteristics will be crucial for navigating the opportunities and challenges of the next market cycle. It appears the era of institutional influence is not just coming, but may be set to define the next wave of market excitement.

Right now, a crucial threshold is coming into view, one that could have dramatic consequences for traders holding leveraged positions. We’re talking about potential crypto liquidations on a massive scale, particularly if the Bitcoin price continues its upward trajectory. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? Before diving into the specific numbers, it’s essential to understand what a liquidation is in the context of leveraged crypto trading . Imagine you want to trade Bitcoin but only have a small amount of capital. Exchanges allow you to borrow funds to open a larger position than your initial capital would normally permit. This is called trading with leverage. Long Position: You borrow money betting that the Bitcoin price will increase . Short Position: You borrow Bitcoin (or its value equivalent) and sell it, betting that the Bitcoin price will decrease , allowing you to buy it back cheaper later and return the borrowed amount, keeping the difference. Leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses. Exchanges require you to maintain a certain amount of collateral (margin) to keep your leveraged position open. If the market moves against your position to a point where your collateral is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses, the exchange will automatically close your position to prevent your losses from exceeding your collateral and potentially dipping into the exchange’s funds. This forced closure is called a liquidation. For a long position, liquidation happens when the price drops significantly. For a short position, liquidation happens when the price rises significantly. The $111K Trigger: A Looming Bitcoin Short Squeeze? Data from analytics platforms like CoinGlass provides valuable insight into where these potential liquidation levels are clustered on major centralized exchanges. This data is crucial for understanding potential market dynamics. According to recent CoinGlass data, a substantial cluster of short positions faces liquidation risk if the Bitcoin price pushes above the $111,000 mark. The data indicates that breaking this level could trigger the automatic closure of approximately $1.13 billion worth of short positions across these exchanges. This is a staggering amount and represents a significant concentration of bearish bets at that price point. Why is this significant? When a large number of short positions are liquidated, the exchange automatically buys Bitcoin on the market to close those positions. This sudden surge in buying pressure can act as fuel, pushing the price even higher, which in turn can trigger more short liquidations at slightly higher prices. This cascading effect is often referred to as a short squeeze . Historically, short squeezes have been powerful catalysts for rapid upward price movements in volatile markets like crypto. The potential for a $1.13 billion trigger event suggests that if Bitcoin approaches and surpasses $111,000, the subsequent forced buying could accelerate the rally significantly. What About the Downside? The $109K Long Liquidation Risk While the focus is often on potential upward movements and short squeezes, it’s equally important to look at the downside risks, particularly for those holding leveraged long positions. CoinGlass data also highlights a notable cluster of long positions that would be at risk if the Bitcoin price were to drop. Specifically, a fall below the $109,000 level could trigger the liquidation of approximately $243 million in long positions. While this amount is considerably smaller than the potential short liquidation cluster at $111K, it is still a significant sum. A cascade of long liquidations can also amplify price movements, but in the opposite direction. As long positions are closed, the selling pressure increases, potentially driving the price down further and triggering more long liquidations. Understanding both the upside and downside liquidation levels provides a more complete picture of potential volatility triggers in the market. The area between $109,000 and $111,000 appears to be a zone of heightened sensitivity based on the current positioning of leveraged traders. How Does This Data Influence Crypto Trading Strategies? For experienced participants in crypto trading , data on liquidation levels is just one piece of the puzzle, but a potentially important one. Here’s how traders might interpret and use this information: Identifying Potential Volatility Zones: The areas around $109K and $111K are marked as zones where price action could become particularly volatile due to potential cascading liquidations. Anticipating Short Squeeze Potential: The large cluster of shorts above $111K signals the potential for a powerful upward acceleration if that level is breached. Traders might watch for signs of strength approaching this level. Understanding Downside Risks: The $109K long liquidation level highlights the risk of a sharp downturn if support in that area fails. Informing Entry and Exit Points: Some traders might use these levels to inform where they place stop-losses, take profit orders, or even initiate new positions, anticipating reactions around these price points. Risk Management: Perhaps most importantly, this data underscores the inherent risks of using high leverage. Traders holding positions near these liquidation levels are exposed to significant risk. It’s crucial to remember that liquidation data from centralized exchanges doesn’t represent the entire market (decentralized exchanges and over-the-counter trades are not included), and market dynamics are influenced by many factors beyond just leveraged positions. However, these concentrated clusters represent potential flashpoints. The Mechanics Behind a Bitcoin Short Squeeze Let’s delve a little deeper into the mechanics of a short squeeze , specifically for Bitcoin . When a trader opens a short position, they are essentially selling borrowed Bitcoin. They hope to buy it back cheaper later. If the price starts rising rapidly instead, their position loses money. As the loss grows, their margin level on the exchange decreases. The exchange monitors this margin level. If it falls below a certain threshold (the maintenance margin), the exchange issues a margin call, often automatically, notifying the trader that they need to add more funds to their account to keep the position open. If the trader fails to add funds quickly, or if the price moves too fast, the exchange will forcefully close the position. To close a short position, the exchange must buy Bitcoin on the open market. This forced buying adds upward pressure to the price. Now, imagine $1.13 billion worth of short positions needing to be closed almost simultaneously as the price crosses $111K. The aggregate demand created by the exchange’s automatic buying can be immense. This sudden spike in demand, without a corresponding immediate increase in sell orders, causes the price to jump. This jump then puts pressure on short positions at slightly higher prices, triggering their liquidation, leading to more buying, and the cycle continues. This is the essence of a powerful short squeeze . This phenomenon isn’t unique to crypto; it’s been observed in traditional markets as well (like the GameStop event in 2021, though that involved different market structures). However, the 24/7 nature and high leverage available in crypto exchanges can make these events particularly fast and volatile. Challenges and Caveats When Using Liquidation Data While liquidation data from CoinGlass and similar platforms is a valuable tool, it’s not a crystal ball. Several challenges and caveats must be considered: Data Source Limitations: This data typically only covers major centralized exchanges. Significant trading volume and leveraged positions also exist on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and through over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which are not reflected in this data. The true total liquidation risk might be higher or distributed differently. Dynamic Nature: Liquidation levels change constantly as traders open, close, and adjust their leveraged positions. The $1.13 billion figure is a snapshot and can shift rapidly. Market Manipulation: Knowing where large clusters of liquidations lie can, in theory, incentivize large players (whales) to try and push the price towards those levels to trigger cascades and profit from the resulting volatility. Other Market Factors: News events, macroeconomic data, regulatory changes, and overall market sentiment can easily override the influence of liquidation levels. Exact Price vs. Zone: While data points to specific levels like $111K, liquidations occur across a range, and the exact trigger price varies slightly between exchanges based on their specific margin requirements and liquidation engines. It’s better to think of these as sensitive zones rather than precise lines in the sand. Therefore, while the potential for a significant event around $111K is real based on current positioning, it’s not a guarantee. Traders should use this information as supplementary insight alongside other forms of analysis (technical analysis, fundamental analysis, on-chain data, etc.). Examples from Bitcoin’s Past Bitcoin’s history is dotted with examples of significant liquidation events amplifying price moves. For instance, during major price crashes, rapid declines are often exacerbated by cascades of long liquidations. Conversely, sharp pumps can be fueled by short squeezes. While specific historical dollar figures at precise price points from past cycles might differ due to market size, the underlying mechanism of leveraged positions amplifying volatility upon liquidation is a consistent feature of the market. These past events serve as a reminder of the power of these mechanisms and why paying attention to data like potential liquidation clusters is relevant for anyone involved in crypto trading , especially with leverage. Actionable Insights for Navigating Potential Volatility Given the potential for increased volatility around the $109K and $111K levels, what can traders and investors do? Exercise Caution with Leverage: If you are using leverage, be acutely aware of your liquidation price. Consider reducing leverage if your liquidation price is close to these highlighted zones. High leverage increases risk significantly. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to manage risk and limit potential losses, especially if trading leveraged positions near volatile zones. Understand Your Strategy: Are you a long-term investor, a swing trader, or a high-frequency trader? Your approach to this data should align with your overall strategy and risk tolerance. Long-term investors may view this as short-term noise, while active traders might see opportunities or risks. Diversify Your Analysis: Don’t rely solely on liquidation data. Combine it with technical indicators, chart patterns, volume analysis, and market news to form a more robust trading plan. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on updated liquidation data from reputable sources as market conditions evolve. The clusters can shift. Consider the Broader Market Context: Is the overall market sentiment bullish or bearish? What are the macroeconomic factors at play? These broader forces can either reinforce or counteract the potential impact of liquidation levels. Navigating the crypto market requires a multi-faceted approach, and understanding where significant pools of leveraged positions are positioned is a valuable piece of information for anticipating potential volatility and managing risk. Concluding Thoughts: The High-Stakes Game Around Bitcoin’s Price The data indicating a massive $1.13 billion in short positions vulnerable above $111,000 and $243 million in long positions vulnerable below $109,000 paints a clear picture: the current Bitcoin price range is a battleground for leveraged traders. Breaking out of this zone, particularly to the upside above $111K, carries the potential for a significant short squeeze , accelerating price discovery rapidly. Conversely, a breakdown below $109K could trigger a long liquidation cascade, adding selling pressure. This analysis underscores the inherent volatility amplified by leverage in the crypto market. While these figures highlight potential flashpoints, they are not destiny. Market outcomes are influenced by a complex interplay of factors. However, for those engaged in crypto trading , being aware of these significant liquidation clusters provides critical context for risk management and strategic decision-making. Approach the market with caution, use data wisely, and prioritize protecting your capital.

2025-05-26T21:48:18.000Z,"Astonishing Bitcoin Price Prediction: Indicators Point to Massive Upside Potential","BitcoinWorld Astonishing Bitcoin Price Prediction: Indicators Point to Massive Upside Potential The cryptocurrency world is buzzing! Bitcoin (BTC) recently shattered its previous all-time high, sending waves of excitement through the market. But is this the peak? Or is there still significant room for growth? Many analysts are looking at key Bitcoin technical analysis indicators, and the picture they paint is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting this bull run might be far from over. Unpacking Key Bitcoin Indicators Signaling Further Growth According to observations shared by Lookonchain on X, several well-respected technical indicators are flashing signals that the current crypto market cycle peak has not yet been reached. Let’s dive into some of these crucial indicators and what they tell us about Bitcoin’s potential future price action. Understanding these tools can provide valuable context for navigating the current market landscape. The Rainbow Chart: Often viewed as a long-term valuation tool, the Rainbow Chart overlays colored bands onto Bitcoin’s logarithmic price scale. Historically, when Bitcoin’s price is in the upper, hotter colors (like red or dark red), it suggests the market is nearing a peak. Currently, Bitcoin is situated in the lower to mid-range colors, historically indicating significant Bitcoin upside potential remains before reaching overheated territory. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100, with readings above 70 typically considered overbought and below 30 considered oversold. While Bitcoin’s price has risen dramatically, the RSI on longer timeframes (like the weekly or monthly) has not yet reached levels seen at previous cycle tops. This suggests that the buying pressure, while strong, hasn’t hit the historical exhaustion points, leaving room for the price to climb higher. 200-week Moving Average Heatmap: The 200-week Moving Average is a widely watched long-term support level for Bitcoin. The heatmap visualizes the price’s distance from this average. During previous bull market peaks, the price has been significantly extended above the 200-week MA, appearing in the ‘hot’ zones of the heatmap. The current position on the heatmap, while showing strength, indicates less extreme deviation compared to prior cycle tops, implying the rally still has legs. 2-Year MA Multiplier: This indicator uses a multiplier of the 2-year moving average to identify potential tops and bottoms. The 2-year MA Multiplier has historically provided accurate signals for cycle peaks when the price interacts with the upper band (typically the 5x multiplier). Similar to the other indicators, the current price action relative to this multiplier suggests the market has not yet reached the historical saturation point seen at prior tops. What Do These Bitcoin Indicators Suggest for the Price? The convergence of signals from these diverse Bitcoin indicators is compelling. They collectively point towards a market structure that, while having achieved new highs, doesn’t exhibit the classic characteristics of a cycle top based on historical data. This doesn’t guarantee future price movements, but it provides a strong probabilistic argument for continued upward momentum. Some interpretations of these indicators, particularly certain models based on historical cycle behavior relative to these metrics, even suggest ambitious targets. The mention of a possible target above $200,000, while speculative and dependent on numerous factors, stems from projections derived from how far the price extended beyond these long-term averages and indicators in previous bull runs. It’s crucial to remember that these are models based on past performance and should not be treated as financial advice or guaranteed outcomes. The crypto market is inherently volatile and subject to rapid changes based on macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and market sentiment. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Cycle Understanding where we might be in the crypto market cycle is vital for investors and traders. If these indicators are correct, we could be in a phase where significant gains are still possible, but also where volatility is likely to increase as the market approaches potential peak territory. Key Considerations: Risk Management: Even with bullish indicators, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Volatility is a constant companion in the crypto space. Indicator Limitations: Technical indicators are tools, not crystal balls. They provide probabilities based on historical data but cannot predict unforeseen events. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: These specific indicators are generally more useful for identifying potential long-term cycle tops rather than short-term price swings. Market Psychology: Bull markets are often fueled by euphoria. While indicators can flag potential exhaustion, market sentiment can sometimes push prices beyond what technicals initially suggest. The current confluence of bullish signals from multiple, respected Bitcoin indicators presents a compelling case for continued Bitcoin upside potential . While reaching a Bitcoin price prediction target above $200,000 is an exciting prospect, it’s essential to approach the market with caution, conduct your own research, and utilize sound risk management strategies. The journey through the crypto market cycle is always dynamic. Keeping an eye on these and other technical and fundamental factors will be key to navigating the path ahead for Bitcoin.

(France: ALTBG), the first European-based company to implement a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury management, completed a significant fundraising to strengthen its Bitcoin position. The company announced on Monday, May 26, that it successfully raised around €63.3 million through a convertible bond issuance to primarily purchase more Bitcoins. Consequently, The Blockchain Group acquired an additional 590 BTCs, which increased its net Bitcoin holdings to about 1,437 coins. Notably, the company raised about €5 million from Moonlight Capital, €55.3 million from Fulgur Ventures, and €3 million from OCA Tranche 2 by UTXO Management. The company highlighted that the bonds have a five-year maturity timeline, and Swissquote Bank Europe has held the acquired Bitcoins. Bitcoin Price Rebounds on Immense Support from Institutional Investors Led By The Blockchain Group According to market data from CoinShares, Bitcoin led the wider altcoin market with a cash inflow of about $2.97 billion last week, hence increasing its net Assets Under Management (AUM) to about $158.3 billion. As Coinpedia reported , Strategy has played a crucial role in the net cash inflow through its weekly Bitcoin acquisitions. However, the majority of Bitcoin’s net cash inflow came from the spot BTC ETF issuers, which posted a total cash inflow of about $2.75 billion last week. The notable Bitcoin demand from institutional investors played a significant role in its ongoing bullish sentiment. For the first time in its history, BTC price recorded a weekly close of above $109k last week.

2025-05-26T21:30:25.000Z,"Unveiling the Truth: Why Bitcoin’s Astonishing Cycle Top Might Still Be Ahead","BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Truth: Why Bitcoin’s Astonishing Cycle Top Might Still Be Ahead Are we there yet? It’s the question on every crypto investor’s mind as Bitcoin continues its exhilarating climb. While prices have reached impressive levels, a growing analysis suggests the peak of this Bitcoin cycle might still be a distant horizon, not a point in the rearview mirror. This perspective, highlighted by on-chain analytics platform LookOnChain, is based on the behavior of several key technical indicators that have historically signaled market tops. If these indicators are correct, the current Bitcoin bull run still has room to mature, potentially leading to significantly higher price points than we’ve seen so far. Decoding the Signals: Which Bitcoin Indicators Are We Watching? Understanding where we are in the Bitcoin cycle requires looking beyond just the daily price movements. Experienced analysts often turn to time-tested technical indicators that provide context within Bitcoin’s unique four-year halving cycle structure. LookOnChain specifically pointed to four prominent tools: The Rainbow Log Chart: A long-term valuation tool that uses logarithmic regression bands to visualize Bitcoin’s potential price range over time, suggesting whether BTC is undervalued (blue bands) or in bubble territory (red bands). Relative Strength Index (RSI): A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions. 200-Week Moving Average (200W MA): A widely followed long-term moving average that has historically served as a strong support level during bear market bottoms. While not a direct top indicator, its relationship to the current price provides cyclical context. 2-Year MA Multiplier: An indicator that uses a multiple (often 5x) of the 2-year moving average, which has historically aligned closely with major cycle tops. According to the analysis, none of these indicators have yet flashed the kind of definitive ‘top is in’ signals seen at the peak of previous Bitcoin bull run phases. This lack of confluence across multiple, historically significant metrics is a crucial part of the argument that there’s still significant upside potential. The Rainbow Chart: Is Bitcoin Still in the ‘Hold’ Zone? The Bitcoin Rainbow Price Chart is a fascinating visual tool for understanding long-term price trends and potential investment zones. It overlays colored bands onto a logarithmic price chart, with each band representing a different sentiment zone, from ‘Buy’ (blue) to ‘Bubble – SELL!!!’ (red). Historically, Bitcoin cycle tops have coincided with the price entering or touching the upper red bands. Currently, while Bitcoin’s price has risen significantly, it resides somewhere in the upper yellow or lower orange bands, often labeled as ‘Hold’ or ‘FOMO’ territory. This position is notably lower than where the price was situated during the peaks of the 2013, 2017, and even 2021 cycles, all of which pushed deep into the red ‘Bubble’ zone. The fact that BTC hasn’t reached these upper extremes on the Rainbow Chart is a key piece of evidence suggesting that the market exuberance typical of a cycle top hasn’t fully materialized yet. What is the RSI Telling Us About This Bitcoin Cycle? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a staple in Bitcoin technical analysis . It oscillates between 0 and 100, with readings typically above 70 indicating overbought conditions and below 30 suggesting oversold conditions. In strong bull markets, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods, but cycle tops are often accompanied by RSI readings pushing into extreme levels (e.g., 90+) or showing bearish divergence (price makes a higher high, but RSI makes a lower high). During the peaks of previous cycles, Bitcoin’s weekly or monthly RSI often reached levels indicative of extreme overbought conditions. In contrast, the current RSI, while strong, has not yet hit those historical extremes. This suggests that the buying pressure, while significant, hasn’t reached the fever pitch characteristic of previous cycle climaxes. Analysts using Bitcoin indicators like the RSI are looking for that final surge in momentum that typically marks the blow-off top phase. The 200-Week MA and 2-Year MA Multiplier: Long-Term Cycle Confirmation While the 200-Week Moving Average is more commonly associated with identifying bear market bottoms (price typically finds strong support around it), its position relative to the current price offers context about the market phase. At cycle tops, the price is usually trading at a significant multiple above the 200W MA, reflecting the massive growth experienced during the bull run. The 2-Year MA Multiplier takes this concept further by using a multiple (historically around 5x) of the 2-year moving average as a potential cycle top signal. This specific multiplier band has proven remarkably accurate in past cycles, acting as a strong resistance zone where the price often peaks before a significant correction. The analysis suggesting the top is not in implies that Bitcoin’s price has not yet touched or convincingly broken above this critical 2-Year MA Multiplier band, unlike in previous peak moments. These long-term Bitcoin indicators provide a broader view, suggesting that the market structure is still conducive to further upside. Historical Context: How Did Past Bitcoin Cycles Peak? Examining previous Bitcoin cycle tops provides valuable context for interpreting the current market. Let’s look at a simplified comparison: Indicator Behavior at 2017 Peak Behavior at 2021 Peak (April/November) Current Behavior (Mid-2024) Rainbow Chart Deep into Red ‘Bubble’ zone Touched Red ‘Bubble’ zone In Yellow/Orange ‘Hold/FOMO’ zone RSI (Weekly) Reached extreme overbought levels (e.g., >90) Reached high overbought levels (e.g., >80) Strong, but not yet at historical extremes 2-Year MA Multiplier (5x) Touched/Briefly Exceeded Touched/Briefly Exceeded Has not yet touched/exceeded This comparison highlights why analysts argue that the current phase, while impressive, lacks the extreme readings seen at the final blow-off tops of prior cycles. It reinforces the idea that the market may still be building towards its ultimate peak in this Bitcoin bull run . Exploring the $200,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction Based on the potential room for growth indicated by these metrics, some analysts, including LookOnChain, are speculating on a significantly higher price target for this cycle, with $200,000 being a figure mentioned. Is this target realistic? A Bitcoin price prediction of $200,000 would represent a market capitalization well into the trillions of dollars. Achieving this would likely require a confluence of factors: Continued strong institutional demand, potentially driven by spot ETFs and corporate adoption. Significant influx of retail investment, fueled by FOMO as prices rise. The ongoing supply shock from the Bitcoin halving, reducing the amount of new Bitcoin entering circulation. A favorable macroeconomic environment, potentially involving continued inflation concerns or accommodative monetary policies. While $200,000 might seem ambitious, it’s within the realm of possibility if the market enters a true euphoric, parabolic phase akin to previous cycle tops. However, it’s crucial to remember that price predictions are speculative and subject to numerous unpredictable variables. Navigating the Excitement: Benefits and Challenges The potential for further upside in this Bitcoin cycle presents exciting opportunities but also significant risks. Potential Benefits: Substantial profit potential for those holding Bitcoin or investing during this phase. Validation of Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative if it reaches new all-time highs significantly above previous peaks. Increased mainstream attention and adoption as price milestones are reached. Potential Challenges: Extreme volatility: Prices can drop sharply and unexpectedly, even during a bull run. Risk of mistiming the market: Predicting the exact top is notoriously difficult. Indicator limitations: Technical indicators are tools, not crystal balls, and can give false signals. External factors: Regulatory crackdowns, global economic crises, or black swan events could derail the bull run. Psychological pressure: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) can lead to poor investment decisions. Understanding these benefits and challenges is crucial for anyone participating in the market during this potentially volatile but rewarding phase of the Bitcoin bull run . Actionable Insights for the Road Ahead Based on the analysis suggesting the Bitcoin cycle top is not yet in, what should investors consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor key Bitcoin indicators , market news, and on-chain data. Don’t rely on just one source or one indicator. Define Your Strategy: Decide whether you are a long-term holder (HODLer) or looking to potentially take profits near a perceived top. Having a plan before the market gets parabolic can help avoid emotional decisions. Risk Management is Key: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders or having an exit strategy for a portion of your holdings as prices climb. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): While DCA is often used for accumulating, some investors also use a form of DCA in reverse, gradually selling small portions as the price rises towards perceived top zones. Be Wary of Euphoria: When mainstream media is filled with extreme price targets and everyone is talking about getting rich quick, it might be a sign that the market is nearing a peak. Navigating a potential blow-off top requires discipline and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance and financial goals. This period presents both significant opportunity and considerable risk. Conclusion: The Journey Continues for the Bitcoin Cycle While Bitcoin has already achieved remarkable milestones in this market cycle, the analysis based on historically significant Bitcoin indicators like the Rainbow Chart, RSI, and MA Multipliers suggests that the ultimate peak may still be ahead. The speculative target of $200,000, while ambitious, highlights the potential upside if the market follows historical patterns and benefits from current tailwinds like institutional adoption and the halving’s supply impact. However, investors must remain aware of the inherent volatility and risks associated with the crypto market. This phase of the Bitcoin bull run promises to be exciting, demanding both patience and vigilance as the market potentially builds towards its final crescendo.

2025-05-26T21:20:25.000Z,"Massive MicroStrategy Bitcoin Purchase Fuels Institutional Confidence","BitcoinWorld Massive MicroStrategy Bitcoin Purchase Fuels Institutional Confidence MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin accumulation powerhouse, has once again made headlines with another significant Bitcoin purchase. This move underscores the company’s unwavering commitment to its unique corporate treasury strategy, centered around the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Another Major MicroStrategy Bitcoin Purchase The latest announcement came directly from Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s founder and executive chairman, via a post on X (formerly Twitter). Saylor revealed that the company, through its subsidiary MacroStrategy, acquired an additional 4,020 Bitcoin (BTC). This substantial acquisition came at an approximate cost of $427.1 million, indicating an average purchase price of roughly $106,237 per Bitcoin. This latest buy adds significantly to MicroStrategy’s already industry-leading corporate Bitcoin treasury. The purchase was made using proceeds from a recent offering of convertible senior notes, a common financing method MicroStrategy has employed to fund its Bitcoin strategy without depleting operational capital. Why Does MicroStrategy Keep Buying Bitcoin? MicroStrategy’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset back in August 2020 was groundbreaking for a publicly traded company. Led by Michael Saylor’s strong conviction, the company has consistently argued that holding Bitcoin is a superior long-term strategy compared to traditional fiat currencies, which are subject to inflation and devaluation. Their core thesis rests on several beliefs: Bitcoin as a Store of Value: Bitcoin’s fixed supply (21 million coins) makes it a scarce asset, potentially preserving value better over time than inflationary fiat currencies. Hedge Against Inflation: In an era of quantitative easing and increased government spending, Bitcoin is seen as a potential hedge against the erosion of purchasing power. Long-Term Appreciation Potential: Saylor and MicroStrategy believe Bitcoin’s adoption curve and network effects position it for significant long-term price appreciation. Alternative to Low-Yield Assets: With interest rates on traditional treasury assets often low, Bitcoin offers potential for higher returns, albeit with significantly higher volatility. This strategy isn’t just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about integrating it into the company’s financial structure and operations. They view Bitcoin as a strategic asset that can enhance shareholder value over the long term. Tracking MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Holdings: The Growing Stack With this latest purchase, MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached an astonishing figure. While the exact cumulative total needs to be confirmed with the company’s next official filing, this purchase brings their reported stack well over the 200,000 BTC mark. Let’s look at a simplified representation of their growing position: Approximate Date BTC Acquired (This Period) Approximate Total BTC Approximate Total Cost Approximate Average Price Aug 2020 (Initial) ~21,454 ~21,454 ~$250M ~$11,653 Dec 2020 ~29,646 ~70,470 ~$650M ~$16,000 Later 2021 ~50,000+ ~122,478 ~$3.66B ~$29,861 Late 2022 – Early 2023 ~10,000+ ~152,333 ~$4.69B ~$30,639 Mid-Late 2023 ~30,000+ ~189,150 ~$5.89B ~$31,164 Early 2024 ~15,000+ ~205,000+ ~$6.9B+ ~$33,706 Most Recent (4,020 BTC) 4,020 ~209,000+ ~$427.1M (this buy) ~$106,237 (this buy) (Note: The exact total cost and average price for the cumulative stack are updated periodically in MicroStrategy’s financial reports. The table above provides a simplified view of their accumulation journey, with the latest purchase added based on the announcement details). This consistent accumulation, regardless of Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, highlights the conviction behind MicroStrategy’s approach. They are long-term holders, seemingly unfazed by short-term volatility. Michael Saylor’s Vision and Influence Michael Saylor is arguably the most prominent corporate advocate for Bitcoin globally. His transformation from a traditional tech CEO to a vocal Bitcoin maximalist has been widely followed. Saylor’s public appearances, interviews, and social media activity are a significant driver of attention to MicroStrategy’s strategy and to Bitcoin itself. He articulates the case for Bitcoin with clarity and passion, often framing it as the future of digital property and a necessary evolution for corporate treasuries in a digital age. His influence extends beyond just his company; he has inspired other corporations and investors to consider Bitcoin seriously. What Does This Institutional Bitcoin Purchase Signal? MicroStrategy’s continued buying spree sends several strong signals to the market: Unwavering Institutional Confidence: It reinforces the idea that at least one major publicly traded company has deep, long-term conviction in Bitcoin as an asset class. Validation for Corporate Treasuries: While not every company will follow suit, MicroStrategy provides a high-profile example of how a corporation can integrate Bitcoin into its financial strategy. Demand Driver: Each large purchase by MicroStrategy removes a significant amount of Bitcoin from the available market supply, adding consistent buying pressure. Benchmark for Investors: Many investors, both retail and institutional, watch MicroStrategy’s moves as a proxy for institutional sentiment and a potential indicator of future price trends (though past performance is not indicative of future results). This recent purchase, especially at a price point significantly higher than some of their earlier buys, demonstrates that MicroStrategy is willing to acquire Bitcoin even during periods of high valuation, suggesting they see substantial upside remaining. Are There Challenges or Risks to MicroStrategy’s Strategy? While MicroStrategy’s strategy has been profitable for the company and its shareholders during Bitcoin bull runs, it is not without risks: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The value of MicroStrategy’s holdings is directly tied to Bitcoin’s notoriously volatile price. Significant downturns can impact the company’s balance sheet and stock price (MSTR). Debt Financing Risks: Using convertible notes to buy Bitcoin adds leverage. If Bitcoin’s price falls drastically, the company could face challenges related to the value of the collateral or the ability to repay/refinance the debt. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which could potentially impact companies holding large amounts of Bitcoin. Opportunity Cost: Capital allocated to Bitcoin is not available for other business investments, acquisitions, or returning value to shareholders through dividends or buybacks (though MicroStrategy’s primary goal seems to be maximizing shareholder value through Bitcoin exposure). Despite these risks, MicroStrategy has continued to execute its strategy, suggesting they believe the potential long-term rewards outweigh the challenges. Actionable Insights: What Can Investors Learn from MSTR? While MicroStrategy’s strategy of leveraging debt to acquire Bitcoin is unique and carries significant risk, individual investors can draw insights: Conviction in Long-Term Holdings: MicroStrategy exemplifies a high-conviction, long-term holding strategy for Bitcoin. This contrasts with short-term trading approaches. Understanding Bitcoin’s Role: Their rationale for using Bitcoin as a treasury asset encourages investors to think about Bitcoin’s potential role in a diversified portfolio as a store of value or growth asset. MSTR as a Proxy: For investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin through traditional equity markets, MSTR stock is often viewed as a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin’s price movements, though it also carries business-specific risks. It’s crucial for individual investors to conduct their own research and consider their own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions, and not simply replicate MicroStrategy’s highly leveraged approach. The Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy was a pioneer, and while the wave of corporate treasury adoption hasn’t been as rapid as some early proponents hoped, the landscape is changing. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has opened a new, regulated avenue for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure. MicroStrategy’s continued large purchases, even after the ETF approvals, demonstrate that their direct-holding strategy remains intact and is not necessarily replaced by the existence of ETFs. They seem committed to owning the underlying asset directly. Their actions serve as a constant reminder to the market that significant capital is willing to flow into Bitcoin, reinforcing its position as a legitimate and increasingly accepted asset class among sophisticated investors. Conclusion: MicroStrategy’s Unwavering Commitment to Bitcoin MicroStrategy’s latest $427.1 million Bitcoin purchase is more than just another transaction; it’s a powerful reaffirmation of their long-term, high-conviction strategy. Led by Michael Saylor, the company continues to build the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, viewing the cryptocurrency as a vital component of its financial future. This move highlights the growing trend of institutional interest in Bitcoin, even if MicroStrategy remains the most prominent and aggressive player in this space. As the crypto market matures, MicroStrategy’s journey will likely continue to be a closely watched case study for corporations and investors alike, signaling confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition.

2025-05-26T21:00:14.000Z,"Bitcoin stalls at $110K but institutional investors continue gobbling up BTC","Key takeaways: Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and Nvidia's earnings cap risk appetite. Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs. Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin ( BTC ) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach. Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.ch Demand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time. Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA) May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs. Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement. This suggests that whales and market makers remain confident, even with BTC trading just 2.6% below its record high of $111,957. Bitcoin options 30-day delta skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: laevitas.ch The negative 6% Bitcoin options delta skew indicates that put (sell) options are trading at a discount, a typical characteristic of bullish markets. Readings closer to zero reflect a more balanced demand between put and call (buy) options—a trend observed on May 25. It’s likely that the persistent institutional demand for Bitcoin is gradually shifting the risk perception among the world’s largest investment firms. Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, acquired $427 million worth of Bitcoin between May 19 and May 25, at an average price of $106,237. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw another $2.75 billion in inflows during the same period. During JPMorgan’s Annual Investor Day on May 19, CEO Jamie Dimon announced that the bank would finally allow clients to purchase spot Bitcoin ETFs. While the move does not include custody or official recommendations of cryptocurrencies, it opens the door to indirect Bitcoin exposure for the bank’s $6 trillion in customer deposits. Related: Bitcoin’s new highs may have been driven by Japan bond market crisis US markets are closed on May 26 in observance of the Memorial Day holiday. As a result, any optimism stemming from the delayed US–EU tariffs may be tempered by ongoing concerns surrounding US government debt and the threat of a potential economic recession. The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance. While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment. Investors are closely watching the Richmond Fed manufacturing index due on May 28, followed by the PCE inflation data on May 30. These indicators will likely influence risk appetite and the chances of Bitcoin breaking above the $112,000 mark in the short term.

2025-05-26T20:40:24.000Z,"Bitcoin Analysis: Breakthrough On-Chain Data Signals Decoupling","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Analysis: Breakthrough On-Chain Data Signals Decoupling Are you watching the crypto market wondering what’s driving Bitcoin’s recent moves? For years, the price of Bitcoin seemed heavily influenced by global macro economics, mirroring trends in traditional finance. But a significant shift is underway, suggesting Bitcoin is building its own independent movement. Understanding the Shift in Bitcoin Analysis Cryptocurrency data analytics firm Swissblock recently shared a compelling insight via X: Bitcoin is preparing to decouple from broader market forces. This is a notable change from periods where Bitcoin’s price action seemed tightly correlated with indices like the S&P 500 or reactions to central bank policies. The core of Swissblock’s finding lies in the increasing dominance of on-chain data as the primary driver for Bitcoin’s value. While macro economics and traditional finance news aren’t entirely irrelevant, their influence is reportedly waning compared to what’s happening directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This doesn’t mean ignoring the outside world entirely. Global economic health, inflation rates, and regulatory news still play a role. However, the analysis suggests that the internal mechanics and fundamental activity within the Bitcoin network itself are becoming the more critical factors for price discovery. What is On-Chain Data and Why Does it Matter for Bitcoin Price? On-chain data refers to all transactions and activity recorded directly on the public ledger of the Bitcoin blockchain. Think of it as a transparent look into the network’s real-time usage and investor behavior. Unlike traditional market analysis which relies on company earnings or economic reports, on-chain data provides insights into the fundamental health and adoption of the network. Key types of on-chain data include: Transaction Volume: How much value is being moved on the network. Active Addresses: The number of unique wallets sending or receiving Bitcoin, indicating network usage. Miner Activity: Data related to mining difficulty, hash rate, and miner revenue, reflecting network security and sentiment. Holder Behavior: Tracking movements of Bitcoin held by long-term investors vs. short-term speculators. Exchange Flows: Monitoring Bitcoin moving onto or off exchanges, which can signal selling or buying pressure. According to the recent Bitcoin analysis, metrics like these are now providing stronger signals about future price movements than external macro factors. This suggests that the market is maturing, and participants are increasingly looking inward at the network’s organic growth and investor conviction rather than outward at traditional financial market sentiment. The Decoupling Phenomenon: Is Bitcoin Truly Independent? The idea of Bitcoin decoupling from traditional markets has been discussed for years, often surfacing during times when Bitcoin’s price action diverges significantly from stocks or other assets. This analysis from Swissblock provides recent evidence that this decoupling is not just a temporary blip but potentially a more sustained trend driven by fundamental on-chain strength. Why might this decoupling be happening now? Several factors could contribute: Increased Adoption: More institutions and retail investors are holding Bitcoin for its unique properties (store of value, decentralized). Network Maturity: The network is robust and battle-tested, increasing confidence in its long-term viability. Halving Cycles: The programmed supply shocks (like the recent Halving) are internal events that have historically driven price independent of external markets. Dedicated Investor Base: A growing segment of Bitcoin holders are less reactive to short-term macro news and more focused on long-term fundamentals. While complete independence is unlikely – global liquidity and major economic crises will always have some impact – the analysis points to a significant reduction in the day-to-day correlation that once existed. This is a crucial development for the crypto market as it implies Bitcoin’s value is increasingly tied to its own ecosystem dynamics. How Do Macro Economics Still Fit Into the Picture? Swissblock’s analysis explicitly states that macro economics and traditional finance are still important. This isn’t a complete dismissal of external factors, but rather a recalibration of their weight in the overall analysis. Think of it this way: macro factors might provide the broad economic backdrop, but on-chain fundamentals are painting the detailed picture of Bitcoin’s specific trajectory. For example: High inflation could still drive interest in Bitcoin as a hedge. Major recessions could still cause deleveraging across all asset classes, including crypto. Regulatory clarity or uncertainty from governments can still significantly impact sentiment. The key takeaway is that while these external forces create the environment, the internal health and activity measured by on-chain data are becoming the primary determinants of whether Bitcoin thrives or struggles within that environment. Investors need to monitor both, but perhaps with a renewed focus on the signals emanating directly from the blockchain. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Crypto Market Given this potential shift towards on-chain dominance, what does this mean for investors and market participants? 1. Deepen Your Understanding of On-Chain Data: If you previously focused only on price charts and news headlines, it’s time to learn about key on-chain metrics. Platforms offer tools to track active addresses, exchange balances, and long-term holder behavior. These can provide early signals not visible in traditional analysis. 2. Re-evaluate Macro vs. Fundamental Signals: When analyzing Bitcoin price movements, ask yourself: Is this move driven by a broad market sentiment shift (macro) or by specific activity on the network (on-chain)? The latter might now be a more reliable indicator for sustained trends. 3. Focus on Network Health: Metrics indicating network usage, security (hash rate), and adoption are becoming more crucial indicators of fundamental value than simply reacting to interest rate announcements. 4. Recognize Potential Challenges: While decoupling sounds positive, it also means Bitcoin’s price might become less predictable based on familiar macro patterns. It requires a deeper dive into crypto-native analysis. This shift highlights the increasing maturity and unique nature of Bitcoin as an asset class. Its value is becoming less about its place within traditional finance and more about the strength and activity of its own decentralized network. Conclusion: Bitcoin Forging Its Own Path The analysis from Swissblock provides compelling evidence that Bitcoin is indeed building its own movement, increasingly independent of traditional macro economics. While external factors still play a role, the signals from on-chain data are becoming the dominant force driving Bitcoin price action. This represents a significant evolution for the crypto market, underscoring the growing importance of understanding the fundamental activity occurring directly on the blockchain. For investors, adapting to this shift means prioritizing on-chain analysis alongside traditional market monitoring to gain a clearer picture of Bitcoin’s trajectory.

2025-05-26T20:30:58.000Z,"Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight?","Solana is trading at critical levels after weeks of strong price action and tight consolidation around current prices. Following an impressive 80% rally from its April lows, SOL is now testing a key horizontal resistance zone that could decide whether the uptrend continues or stalls in the short term. The recent consolidation has allowed the market to cool off while keeping the bullish structure intact—an encouraging sign for traders watching for a continuation move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis highlighting that Solana is now retesting a significant horizontal level that previously acted as resistance. A successful flip of this level into support could provide the momentum needed to push toward new local highs and potentially open the door to a full recovery rally. While overall market sentiment remains cautious amid broader macro uncertainty, Solana’s recent strength stands out among altcoins. Its ability to hold above key support during periods of volatility has positioned it as one of the better-performing assets in the current market cycle. If bulls maintain control and volume returns on the next breakout attempt, Solana could be gearing up for another leg higher in the days ahead. Solana Consolidates As Market Eyes Bullish Expansion Solana is currently consolidating just below a critical resistance level—the last major barrier before a potential breakout toward the weekly range highs. After gaining over 80% since its April lows, SOL is showing remarkable strength compared to most altcoins. However, the broader market remains on edge, as Bitcoin continues to trade just below its all-time highs, leaving investors uncertain about the potential for a correction. Despite this uncertainty, momentum across the crypto market suggests that the recent rally may be more than just a short-term bounce. Many analysts believe this could be the beginning of a larger bullish phase, one that carries significant upside if key resistance levels are cleared. Solana’s current consolidation is taking place directly under a major technical ceiling—if bulls can reclaim this zone, the path toward much higher prices opens quickly. Jelle echoed this view in a recent post, highlighting the importance of the $190 level. According to his analysis, “Above $190, all bets are off.” Reclaiming that resistance would likely confirm a breakout and shift sentiment decisively in favor of the bulls. It would also place Solana back on track to retest its all-time highs. For now, SOL is holding its ground while the market waits for Bitcoin’s next move. If BTC confirms strength and Solana breaks above $190, it could mark the beginning of a new wave of bullish price action, not just for SOL, but for the broader altcoin market as well. The coming days may be pivotal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Healthy – Data Shows No Signs Of Overheating Technical Details: Price Testing Key Moving Average Solana (SOL) is trading at $177.30, consolidating just below a key resistance level around $181, marked by the 200-day SMA. The daily chart shows that after a strong impulse rally from the April lows, SOL has entered a tight consolidation phase, forming a potential base for the next leg higher. The 34 EMA ($162.95), along with the 50 and 100 SMAs, are all trending upward and stacked in bullish alignment below the price, supporting the overall bullish structure. This indicates that the recent move is supported by strong trend momentum and healthy pullback dynamics. Volume has decreased slightly during the consolidation, which is typical during a pause before a potential breakout. However, the 200-day SMA continues to act as resistance, capping price advances multiple times over the last few days. A clean break and daily close above $181 could confirm the continuation of the uptrend and open the path toward the $200–$220 range, which aligns with the weekly range highs.

2025-05-26T20:30:03.000Z,"Bitcoin Shorts Getting Squeezed – Taker Buy Volume Signals Explosive Momentum","After a quiet weekend of consolidation just below its all-time high, Bitcoin is setting the stage for what could be a pivotal week. Trading around $109,000, BTC remains less than 3% below its record high near $112,000, and momentum is clearly building. With bullish structure intact and volatility tightening, analysts are increasingly confident that a breakout is imminent. Several high-conviction analysts are now calling for a major price surge, citing both strong price action and bullish on-chain signals. The market appears to be coiling for a move, and historical patterns suggest that such periods of tight range-bound trading near highs often precede sharp upward impulses. Supporting this outlook, data from CryptoQuant reveals that shorts are getting squeezed across major exchanges. Taker Buy Volume has spiked, indicating that aggressive buyers are stepping in while overleveraged short positions are being forced to exit. This dynamic often leads to rapid price expansions as liquidity dries up on the sell side. Bitcoin Flirts With Price Discovery As Shorts Get Squeezed Bitcoin is trading just below its all-time high near $112,000, hovering around $109,000–$110,000 as the market enters a critical phase. The coming days could prove decisive in confirming whether BTC continues its upward trajectory or pauses to consolidate further. While the technical structure remains bullish, external factors—particularly rising global tensions and escalating trade conflicts between the U.S. and other nations—are expected to influence sentiment and market direction. Despite this uncertainty, many high-conviction analysts believe a breakout is near. On-chain and derivatives data continue to support this view, indicating strong underlying momentum. One of the clearest signals comes from top analyst Maartunn, who shared recent data showing Bitcoin’s Taker Buy Volume has surged past $110.7 million across all major exchanges. This metric tracks aggressive market buys and highlights growing bullish pressure. The spike in Taker Buy Volume suggests that shorts are now being squeezed out of the market. As overleveraged short positions are liquidated, prices are pushed higher, creating a feedback loop that accelerates upward movement. This dynamic is often seen ahead of major price expansions. With BTC holding just under its all-time high and short sellers under pressure, momentum appears to be favoring the bulls. If Bitcoin breaks above $112K with volume confirmation, it could quickly extend into price discovery with targets ranging from $120K to $140K in the near term. Weekly Close At Record Highs Bitcoin is trading at $109,742 on the weekly chart, holding just below its all-time high after an impressive multi-week rally. Price action shows strong continuation, with BTC now posting its eighth consecutive green weekly candle—a clear sign of bullish momentum and sustained buying interest. The $103,600 level, previously a multi-month resistance, has been cleanly flipped into support and now anchors the current leg of the uptrend. The 34-week EMA, currently at $89,265, is rising steeply and remains well below the current price, reinforcing the strength of the ongoing move. All major moving averages (50, 100, and 200-week SMAs) are trending upward and widely separated, reflecting a healthy long-term trend structure. What’s particularly notable in this chart is the lack of major resistance above current levels. With BTC pushing into price discovery, the next moves will likely be driven by momentum and market sentiment rather than predefined technical barriers. Volume has remained consistent, showing no signs of distribution. If Bitcoin can close the week above $110K, it would mark the highest weekly close in history, adding further confidence to the bullish thesis and possibly attracting more institutional capital. The stage is set for potential continuation toward $120K and beyond.

2025-05-26T20:20:24.000Z,"Australian Senator Bitcoin Attack: Why Industry Calls “Ponzi” Claim Misinformed","BitcoinWorld Australian Senator Bitcoin Attack: Why Industry Calls “Ponzi” Claim Misinformed A recent comment by an Australian Senator has ignited a fiery debate within the nation’s growing cryptocurrency community. The statement, labeling Bitcoin a “Ponzi scheme,” came from Senator Gerard Rennick and was delivered via a sarcastic post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). This immediately drew sharp criticism and highlighted the ongoing tension between traditional political views and the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. For anyone following the world of crypto or interested in the future of Australia crypto regulation , this incident is a significant talking point. What Did the Australian Senator Bitcoin Comment Entail? Senator Gerard Rennick’s comment was part of a broader critique, seemingly aimed at major asset managers like BlackRock, who have recently embraced Bitcoin through investment products like spot ETFs. His sarcastic tone suggested that these institutions were driving the price of Bitcoin in what he perceived as a manipulative or fraudulent manner, equating it to a “Ponzi scheme.” While delivered with apparent sarcasm, the weight of such a statement coming from a public official carries significant implications. The context of the comment is crucial. The past year has seen unprecedented interest from institutional finance in Bitcoin . The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, particularly those launched by financial giants like BlackRock, has been seen by many in the crypto space as a major step towards mainstream adoption and legitimacy. Senator Rennick’s view appears to stand in stark contrast to this trend, viewing institutional involvement not as validation, but as complicity in a scheme he fundamentally distrusts. Why is the “Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme” Label So Contentious? Calling Bitcoin a “Ponzi scheme” is one of the most common, yet frequently debunked, criticisms leveled against the cryptocurrency. Understanding why this label is inaccurate is key to navigating the debate: What is a Ponzi Scheme? A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where early investors are paid with money from later investors, rather than from actual profits. They require a constant flow of new money to survive and inevitably collapse when recruitment slows. They are characterized by a central operator, promises of high, guaranteed returns with little risk, and a lack of legitimate business activity. How Bitcoin Differs: Decentralization: Bitcoin has no central operator or administrator. It runs on a distributed network of computers. Transparency: All transactions are recorded on a public, transparent ledger (the blockchain). No Guaranteed Returns: Bitcoin’s price is volatile and determined by market supply and demand, not by a central party promising fixed returns. Investors understand they can lose money. Finite Supply: Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, unlike Ponzi schemes which rely on an infinite supply of new victims. Utility: Beyond speculation, Bitcoin functions as a decentralized digital currency and a store of value, with a verifiable history and mechanism (mining) for creation and transfer. The fundamental structure and operation of Bitcoin are antithetical to the definition of a Ponzi scheme. While like any asset, it can be used *within* a fraudulent scheme, Bitcoin itself is not inherently one. How Did the Bitcoin Industry Body Respond? The reaction from the Australian cryptocurrency sector was swift and strong. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB), representing various stakeholders in the nation’s crypto ecosystem, publicly condemned Senator Rennick’s comments. According to reports, the ABIB labeled his remarks as “misinformed.” The core of the Bitcoin industry body ‘s concern wasn’t just the insult to Bitcoin itself, but the potential negative consequences for policy-making. They warned that such misinformed views from public officials could lead to poor or detrimental policy decisions regarding cryptocurrencies in Australia. This highlights a critical challenge for the crypto industry globally: educating policymakers and the public about the technology to ensure fair and effective regulation. The ABIB’s stance underscores the industry’s desire to be taken seriously and to participate constructively in discussions about its future within the established financial and regulatory frameworks. Dismissive labels from influential figures are seen as counterproductive to achieving this. What Are the Implications for Australia Crypto Regulation? Statements like that made by Gerard Rennick Bitcoin comments underscore the challenges facing Australia crypto regulation . The regulatory landscape for digital assets in Australia, much like in many other countries, is still evolving. Policymakers are grappling with how to classify, tax, and oversee cryptocurrencies and related businesses. The debate involves balancing innovation and consumer protection. On one hand, the government wants to foster technological advancement and potentially harness the economic benefits of the crypto sector. On the other hand, there are concerns about volatility, scams, money laundering, and investor risks. When influential politicians publicly express views based on what the industry considers misinformation, it can: Create public distrust in cryptocurrencies. Potentially sway policy decisions towards overly restrictive or inappropriate measures. Signal to businesses and investors that Australia might not be a welcoming environment for crypto innovation. Accurate understanding among legislators is paramount for developing regulations that are proportionate, effective, and foster a healthy ecosystem rather than stifling it. The ABIB’s warning about “poor policy decisions” is a direct reflection of this concern. Beyond the Headlines: Understanding the Broader Debate The exchange between Senator Rennick and the Bitcoin industry body is symptomatic of a larger global debate about the role and nature of cryptocurrencies. Skepticism from traditional finance and political circles is not uncommon. Concerns often revolve around: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings can be dramatic, posing risks to investors. Illicit Use: While a small percentage, cryptocurrencies have been used in illicit activities, a concern for regulators. Environmental Impact: The energy consumption of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is a point of criticism. Investor Protection: The decentralized and often pseudonymous nature can make recovering funds lost to scams difficult. However, proponents highlight: Decentralization: Removing control from central authorities. Store of Value: Its potential as digital gold, a hedge against inflation and economic instability. Financial Inclusion: Providing access to financial services for the unbanked. Technological Innovation: The underlying blockchain technology has applications far beyond currency. Navigating this complex landscape requires nuanced understanding, not simplistic labels like “Ponzi scheme.” Actionable Insights for Readers In light of such controversies, what should individuals interested in or invested in cryptocurrencies do? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on headlines or soundbites from politicians or industry bodies. Invest time in understanding how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies actually work. Understand the Risks: Be aware that cryptocurrency investments are highly volatile and speculative. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Follow Regulatory Developments: Stay informed about proposed changes to Australia crypto regulation and how they might impact your ability to buy, sell, or hold digital assets. Look for Reputable Sources: Seek information from diverse and credible sources, including academic papers, reputable news outlets, and official regulatory announcements. Engaging with the topic thoughtfully is the best way to form your own informed opinion, rather than being swayed by potentially misinformed statements. Conclusion: The Need for Informed Dialogue on Australia Crypto Regulation Senator Gerard Rennick’s characterization of Bitcoin as a “Ponzi scheme,” while perhaps intended sarcastically, has served as a stark reminder of the educational gap that still exists regarding digital assets, even among policymakers. The swift and strong reaction from the Bitcoin industry body underscores the industry’s commitment to correcting misinformation and advocating for sensible Australia crypto regulation . As institutional adoption grows and cryptocurrencies become more integrated into the global financial system, accurate understanding among those who shape policy is more critical than ever. Incidents like this highlight the ongoing need for open dialogue, education, and collaboration between government, industry, and the public to ensure that future regulations are based on fact, not fear or misunderstanding. The debate over Gerard Rennick Bitcoin comments is likely just one chapter in the larger story of how Australia, and the world, comes to terms with this transformative technology.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) ended the U.S. trading session virtually where it began despite some intra-day swings. The leading cryptocurrency by market cap pushed above the $110,000 mark around midday, but the gains were erased by the afternoon. Trading volume was lower than usual, as one would expect during a U.S. holiday session. Still, the intraday range of around 1.6% from Bitcoin’s daily low of $108,706 to a high of $110,474 might indicate traders are stuck in a wait-and-see approach. The bullish case for Bitcoin technically remains unchanged. As noted by crypto.news analyst Aziz Zamani , technical analysis still points to a move towards the $120,000 level. He writes: The bullish market structure remains intact. From the key swing low at $91,500, Bitcoin has consistently carved out higher lows and higher highs which represents signs of a strong trend. As long as $106,500 continues to hold, momentum remains with the bulls. The current pause in the market appears to be a consolidation within an uptrend rather than a reversal or topping pattern. Several macroeconomic and news factors that may have played a role had Monday not been a holiday could set the tone for the rest of the week. Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a delay in imposing a planned 50% tariff on European Union imports, pushing the deadline from June 1 to July 9.

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

Investors in their 30s saw the biggest growth, up 29%, followed by those in their 40s (27%), while investors over 50 increased by 25%.The FIU’s findings show that older investors have larger holdings. By year-end, 221,000 investors held at least 100 million won (about $73,000) in crypto.

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ETFs under its dedicated crypto committee.Lee ahead in presidential election voter surveyYoon’s failed coup accelerated the presidential election and brought renewed urgency to unresolved issues in the local crypto industry.“In the 2022 presidential election, cryptocurrency was viewed as speculative and untrustworthy. But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said.South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets. In Q1 2024, the Korean won ranked as the most-traded fiat currency against crypto, driven largely by retail investors. Institutional players remain on the sidelines, awaiting their turn as the FSC prepares to launch pilot trading for professional investors.FSC’s planned schedule for a phased introduction of institutional crypto investment in 2025.Crypto policies were once seen as campaign strategies to sway younger voters, but this year, they’re seen as an economic and social issue that impacts multiple generations. In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs.“Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active. In the past, people looked at it with skepticism, but now it feels like the public is approaching it more neutrally and making their own judgments,” Cho said.Lee Jae-myung leads the latest voter survey by local media and Next Research.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services.

He cited Hedera’s partnership with Orange, a telecommunications operator, to launch digital empowerment programs across 16 African countries — initiatives that “include training, certification and the establishment of incubation and accelerator centers”.“Africa brings a unique advantage to Web3: a demographic edge and a proven capacity for digital adoption,” said Paolo Tasca, executive chairman of the Exponential Science Foundation. “Yet barriers remain, particularly in foundational infrastructure and education.”Governments are also ramping up talent development.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it’s easier and more practical.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alternative-sweden-cashless-plans?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.Source: Cyvers AlertZero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction.

The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto.

After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research“Researchers have previously observed AI models preventing shutdown in order to pursue a goal,” Palisade said.“But as far as we know this is the first time AI models have been observed preventing themselves from being shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary.”Training to blame for AI defiance Palisade Research speculated that the training behind the AI language models might be to blame for evading the shutdown scripts. Text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It’s not taking place here at the White House.”Related: Pictures give glimpse inside Trump’s memecoin holder dinnerTrump features presidential seal at private propertiesThis isn’t the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties.

This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.May 30 Bitcoin options open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.chThe open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.Conversely, the open interest in Bitcoin call (buy) options up to $109,000 totals $3.8 billion. Still, this imbalance does not mean every call option holder was betting on Bitcoin’s rise. Some traders may have sold these options as a way to hedge their exposure above certain price levels.Top BTC option strategies at Deribit past two weeks. Source: Laevitas.chAmong the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price.Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price declineIf Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry. However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches.The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for short (sell) positions. Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions.Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust. Ultimately, bears’ main hope lies in a weaker macroeconomic environment, which could increase risk aversion and reduce demand for Bitcoin.Related: Bitcoin hits new highs in the absence of ‘unhealthy’ leverage use — Will the rally continue?Bitcoin bulls aim for $110,000 by May 30Below are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $102k and $105k: $2.75 billion in calls (buy) vs. $900 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $1.85 billion.Between $105k and $107k: $3.3 billion calls vs. $650 million puts, favoring calls by $2.65 billion.Between $107k and $110k: $3.7 billion calls vs. $350 million puts. favoring calls by $3.35 billion.Between $110k and $114k: $4.8 billion calls vs. $120 million puts, favoring calls by $4.7 billion.Bulls can maximize their gains by driving BTC above $110,000, which could help set a new all-time high.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.In the Solana ecosystem, the \""Non-Chief Marketing Officer\"" (nCMO) is a role within the Solana Foundation that focuses on supporting the Solana community's marketing efforts.Related: Fractionalization of real world assets: Is this the holy grail of blockchain tech?Markets remain above historical averagesPublic equity markets in the US have been trading above their historical valuation norms for a long time.

Source: MultiplAccording to Akshay, a way to combat this overheating is to open up certain markets to retail investors, a lofty goal that some sectors of crypto, like RWA tokenization, aim to facilitate. Akshay noted that some entrepreneurs had tried this before, but the available technology didn’t support this view. “[Crypto] starts with the game, and very quickly becomes profound.”“What it gives you is the ability for you to financialize all the productive assets in an economy, so you can have anybody who participates in that economy be an owner of that economy,” he said.Magazine: Ethereum is destroying the competition in the $16.1T TradFi tokenization race",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-will-make-everyone-an-investor-or-a-dreamer-over-time-solana-exec?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
