2025-05-27T10:00:08.000Z,"Donald Trump’s Firm Sets Ambitious $3 Billion Fund To Buy Bitcoin And Other Cryptos","Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind the social media platform Truth Social, is reportedly planning to raise around $3 billion to invest in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC). This move, highlighted in a recent Financial Times report, aims to secure $2 billion in fresh equity and an additional $1 billion through a convertible bond . However, the details surrounding this capital raise, including its timing and size, may still be subject to change. Trump Media Dismisses Reports As ‘Fake News’ In response to inquiries regarding the report, the President’s media company dismissed both Reuters and the Financial Times as “fake news” outlets, while the White House has not yet commented on the matter. The company has been actively exploring potential mergers and acquisitions to diversify its offerings into financial services, signaling a strategic shift beyond its original social media focus. Last month, Trump Media reached a binding agreement to launch various retail investment products, aligning with Trump’s America First policies. These products are expected to include cryptocurrency investments and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), although the initiative has drawn scrutiny from government ethics and regulatory authorities. The anticipated capital raise, yet to be publicly confirmed by the President’s working group, is set to coincide with a major meeting for cryptocurrency investors and advocates this week, where figures such as Vice President JD Vance and Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, are expected to speak. Critics Slam The President’s Cryptocurrency Dinner This meeting follows an exclusive dinner hosted by President Trump for top investors in his cryptocurrency memecoin, TRUMP, held at his golf club outside Washington, D.C. This event attracted approximately 220 of the largest purchasers of the TRUMP memecoin, which was launched just days before Trump’s inauguration. Critics have labeled the dinner as a glaring example of corruption and conflict of interest, with protesters gathering outside the venue holding signs that read “stop crypto corruption” and “no kings.” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and other opponents condemned the dinner during a press conference, branding it an “orgy of corruption.” The ethical implications of Trump’s ventures into the cryptocurrency space have raised significant concerns among critics, particularly regarding the intersection of politics and personal profit. Beyond his personal investments, Trump’s family is also heavily involved in the cryptocurrency sector . Donald Jr. and Eric Trump have been engaged in various ventures, including American Bitcoin, a new Bitcoin mining company in collaboration with Hut 8. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, trades just above the $109,400 mark, registering a notable 15% surge in the monthly time frame. The President’s official memecoin, on the other hand, records a 19% drop toward $12.71 in the same period, as the exclusive dinner party failed to boost the token’s price.

2025-05-27T09:53:16.000Z,"Ripple CTO’s Statement Suggests XRP’s Path to Adoption Has Begun","In a detailed thread on X, Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp) presented a focused analysis of Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s recent comments on the evolving path of XRP and crypto adoption. Schwartz’s remarks, shared through multiple clips of a recent stage talk, emphasized the challenges Ripple has faced and the foundation now being laid for a more viable and institutionally integrated crypto ecosystem. Schwartz clarified that the route for Ripple and XRP has been indirect and complex. He explained that while Ripple committed to payments in 2014, the process has not followed a linear path. Schwartz emphasized that for global adoption to materialize, users must be able to access their funds instantly, especially for essential expenses. His statements suggest that while the journey has been long, adoption has begun, and the path is becoming clearer. This wasn’t a roadmap. It was a confession. Ripple’s CTO just admitted that crypto’s path to adoption won’t be clean or direct, but it’s already begun. And for the first time in years, XRP is in position to lead. Here’s what David Schwartz just revealed and why it matters now… pic.twitter.com/We71vwlugV — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) May 23, 2025 Functional Balance and Ledger Evolution Discussing the XRP Ledger (XRPL), Schwartz positioned it between Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of capability. Bitcoin offers limited functions, and Ethereum is broadly programmable, but the XRPL is designed for fixed functions, covering most financial use cases without the unpredictability of custom smart contracts. The XRPL’s fixed function design lets users engage with the blockchain without the uncertainty they would have on Ethereum’s network, where they cannot verify the functions of smart contracts or audit them. He also pointed to recent advancements, including the addition of decentralized identity features and automated market makers (AMMs), decentralized ID, lending protocols, and more. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 U.S. Market Reentry and Regulatory Clarity One of the most notable admissions in Schwartz’s remarks involved Ripple’s strategic shift away from the U.S. due to unclear regulatory pressures. He explained that Ripple had to move hiring, development, and customer acquisition overseas. However, the climate is beginning to shift . Ripple’s licensed payment product, Ripple Payments, now operates within the U.S., and Schwartz expressed optimism that soft regulatory barriers are starting to ease. Schwartz highlighted the need for “predictability,” stressing that Ripple will comply with regulations as long as they are clearly defined. Liquidity, Rational Markets, and the Path Forward Schwartz noted that crypto markets behave rationally with sufficient liquidity and access, with prices reflecting adoption odds. Applying this rationale to XRP, Jungle Inc. emphasized that recent gains are not driven by speculation, but by increasing institutional access and improved infrastructure. Schwartz highlighted increasing ties between traditional finance and crypto, expecting tokenized real-world assets to boost DeFi. According to Jungle Inc., XRP is now positioned to lead in this emerging phase, having navigated years of regulatory uncertainty and infrastructure development.

2025-05-27T09:52:13.000Z,"The Quiet Collapse: Why Japan’s Bond Sell-Off Shakes the Whole World","A major financial change is starting quietly in Japan, and it could affect the entire global economy. Life insurance companies in Japan—known for holding long-term government bonds—are now selling off these assets. They’re not doing it to make profits or to react to short-term market trends. They’re doing it because they have no choice. These insurers have long been seen as reliable holders of government debt , often ignoring price swings because they invest for the long haul. But rising interest rates and changing financial conditions have made that strategy too risky. They are now being forced to sell, not out of strategy, but out of necessity. Understanding the Duration Gap Problem This crisis starts with something called the “duration gap.” Simply put, this is the mismatch between how long insurers expect to hold assets like bonds and how quickly they may need to pay out liabilities. Japanese insurers typically hold long-term bonds—some lasting 10 to 30 years—but now, rising interest rates are making these holdings too dangerous. The value of long-term bonds drops sharply when interest rates rise, leaving insurers exposed to sudden losses. They’re being margin-wrecked —meaning their losses are so big they’re being forced to sell to protect their capital. Why Japan’s Bond Market Matters to the World This is not just a Japan issue. Japan is a major player in global finance , holding large amounts of U.S. and European government debt. Its institutions also play a big role in currency markets, especially in how they use Japanese yen (JPY) to invest in other countries. When they start pulling back, the effects are global: Yields (interest rates) on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) rise The Bank of Japan may have to act, or risk losing control The yen weakens, while the U.S. dollar strengthens Risky assets worldwide start to drop in value as money moves to safety The Last Safety Net Is Breaking For years, the world believed that government bonds were “safe” assets—things that never lose value and always have a buyer. That belief is now under pressure. Japanese life insurers were the last big investors who didn’t care about short-term losses , and now they do. Their sudden exit is a sign that even the most trusted part of the financial system is no longer stable. This is causing reactions like: Bigger price swings in U.S. government bonds More investment in gold and Bitcoin Less money flowing into riskier emerging markets Bitcoin’s Moment in the Spotlight When trusted financial systems start to show cracks, people look for alternatives. Assets like Bitcoin and gold—things that don’t rely on governments or interest rates—become attractive . Not because the world is ending, but because the idea of “safe” government bonds is being questioned. This is one of those rare moments when the financial world wakes up and realizes: what we believed to be stable may not be so after all.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/japanese-corporations-sell-bonds,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T09:51:08.000Z,"Is a Correction Coming for Bitcoin (BTC)? Here Are Analyst Views and Technical Data","Bitcoin Could Retreat to $100K, Technical Signals: Sign of Weakening Momentum According to technical analyst Omkar Godbole, the BTC price could rally outside the ascending channel and test the key support level at $100,000. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with the highest market value, was trading at $109,500 at the time of writing, according to Binance TR data, testing the ascending trend line stretching from $75,000 to above $110,000. According to TradingView data, price action has struggled to gain upward momentum over the past 24 hours. Despite reports that the Trump family-owned media company was planning to buy $3 billion worth of crypto, the market did not react strongly to this development. What Do Technical Indicators Say? Godbole noted that the 30-day rate of change (ROC), a key indicator measuring Bitcoin’s momentum, is showing a “distinctive negative divergence.” This indicator is indicating weakening momentum, with Bitcoin price forming lower highs, although it is still within an ascending channel. Another noteworthy signal is the MACD histogram. The transition of this indicator into the negative territory indicates a decrease in trend strength and that the upward movement may slow down. The combination of these technical developments means that Bitcoin could break out of the current ascending channel and retest the $100,000 psychological support level. Long-Term Outlook Still Positive Despite all these short-term risks, the overall outlook remains positive. In particular, the “golden cross” formed by the intersection of the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) indicates that the long-term uptrend continues. According to analysts, this short-term correction can be considered a healthy consolidation process and will not shake the foundations of the bull market. However, investors are advised to closely monitor technical indicators. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is a Correction Coming for Bitcoin (BTC)?

2025-05-27T09:48:12.000Z,"Michael Saylor Warns Against Institutional Proof-of-Reserves, Community Reacts","Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Bitcoin-focused firm Strategy, has raised serious concerns about the practice of institutions publicly sharing their crypto proof-of-reserves. Speaking at a side event during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 26, Saylor called the widely adopted transparency method “a bad idea.” Saylor was responding to a question from Blockware Solutions’ lead analyst Mitchell Askew, who asked whether Strategy would consider publishing its own proof-of-reserves . While Saylor did not provide a direct answer, he made it clear that he believes the practice is fundamentally flawed. “The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” he stated, adding that it weakens the overall security framework by making wallet addresses traceable. A Growing Industry Trend Post-FTX The push for proof-of-reserves gained momentum after the high-profile collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. In the wake of that event, many crypto firms — including Binance, Kraken, OKX, and Bitwise — began publishing cryptographic proof that they held enough assets to back customer deposits. The goal was to restore trust in the industry and assure users their funds were safe. But Saylor remains unconvinced. He pointed out that these proofs often only demonstrate what a company owns, not what it owes, offering an incomplete picture of its financial health. He also emphasized that publicizing wallet addresses opens the door to serious vulnerabilities. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses,” he said. “Go to AI, put it in deep think mode… it would write 50 pages of security problems.” Saylor: A Bitcoin Maximalist Saylor’s Strategy is currently the largest corporate Bitcoin holder , with 576,230 BTC worth around $62.6 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. The company is followed by MARA Holdings, which holds over 48,000 BTC. Globally, more than 110 publicly listed companies have Bitcoin on their balance sheets. While the crypto community continues to debate the merits of transparency versus security, Saylor’s stance signals a cautionary approach. For him, safeguarding digital assets means more than public accountability — it means keeping critical data private.

The altcoins are slightly in the red on a daily scale, including the recent high-flyer HYPE, which has lost some steam after the latest ATH. BTC Back to $109.5K History was made last Wednesday when, after a few days of substantial volatility and rejection below the $107,000 level, the primary cryptocurrency managed to break through and shot past its January 2025 all-time high of around $109,100. The asset flew to $109,800 that day but was quickly stopped and driven south by around three grand. However, that correction was short-lived as the bulls resumed control of the market and initiated an even more impressive leg up on Thursday – the so-called Bitcoin Pizza Day. Back then, BTC skyrocketed to almost $112,000 to chart a fresh all-time high. Trump’s tariff recommendations against the EU on Friday brought some pain and uncertainty to the market, as BTC slipped back down to $107,500. However, it defended that level and stood just above it during the weekend. Bitcoin started to gain traction again on Monday and jumped to a daily high of $110,500 before it slumped to $107,500 later in the evening. As of now, though, it has recovered most losses and stands around $109,500. Its market cap has remained close to $2.180 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 61%. BTCUSD.

SUI has slipped by a similar percentage, while XRM and PI are down by 5.5% and 4.3%, respectively. Ethereum has maintained the $2,600 level after a near 2% increase since yesterday. BNB and TRX are also slightly in the green. QNT is the only double-digit price gainer from the top 100 alts, followed by TKX (7%), VIRTUAL (7%), and INJ (6%).

The material is suspected to be KYC images, which raised questions about whether the source may be linked to a recent Coinbase data breach. The caption accompanying the doxxed information read, “You should’ve paid the 40 BTC,” suggesting an extortion attempt. The bio was also changed to “CHECK BIO FOR MEMECOIN” after the hack.

On May 27, hackers hijacked the Migos Instagram account, which has over 13 million followers, and leaked personal information about Solana co-founder and his wife in a blackmail attempt. The attackers demanded a ransom of 40 BTC (~$4.4 million) through posts that remained live for roughly 90 minutes, gaining thousands of interactions before being deleted. Experts like online sleuth ZachXBT believe phishing and social engineering were used in the breach and highlighted persistent security flaws on Instagram, mainly affecting inactive celebrity accounts.

Coinbase discloses a months-long breach of data affecting 69.46K customers Coinbase disclosed last week that a months-long data breach resulted in the theft of personal and financial information from at least 69,461 customers, less than 1% of Coinbase’s monthly transacting users. The US-based crypto company’s filing said the breach dated back to December 26, 2024, and continued until earlier this month. Coinbase also faces an action lawsuit after its stock prices dipped because of the disclosure of data breaches. Plaintiffs claimed that Coinbase failed to disclose the breach on time, leading to a stock price dip. The breach occurred when cybercriminals used social engineering to bribe overseas customer support agents into stealing sensitive data from Coinbase systems. The company received an anonymous email from the hackers on May 11, which included a ransom demand for $20 million in exchange for not releasing the stolen information. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, responded to the incident by stating that the company had notified the DOJ and was working with other U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to pursue criminal charges against these bad actors. The U.S. Justice Department has since opened an investigation into the security breach. Coinbase clarified that some personal information was compromised, including names, contact details, masked Social Security numbers, and bank account information. However, no customer funds, passwords, private keys, or wallet access were affected. Additionally, the attackers did not gain access to hot or cold wallets.

George started by saying it’s not realistic to expect a 100x return overnight. Trying too hard to turn $1,000 into $100,000 quickly often leads people into bad trades. Instead of gambling, he recommends aiming for steady gains and keeping your expectations in check. Don’t Ignore Bitcoin For someone just starting, George believes the best place to put most of your money is in pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin . While many skip Bitcoin because it looks “too expensive,” to make real money, he sees it differently. He points out that even a 10x or 20x return is possible over a full cycle—which still turns $1K into $10K or $20K. Compared to traditional investments like stocks or bonds, crypto still wins on speed and return. Look Out for Meme Coins—but Be Smart George doesn’t dismiss meme coins. In fact, in previous cycles, he mentioned coins like Pepe that saw massive growth, 20x to 50x in some cases. However, he stresses that this space is tricky. Thousands of new meme coins launch daily, but only a tiny few go viral. Even popular ones like WIF, Bonk, or Pepe are currently down 50% or more from their peaks. His advice? Don’t jump into every new coin blindly. Instead, watch the market, look for momentum, and if the meme coin trend heats up again, then it might be time to take a chance. Strategy Over Hype In the end, George suggests a simple plan: put a good portion into reliable names, likely Bitcoin and a few strong altcoins, and keep an eye on the market. If conditions improve and memes regain strength, shift some money into trending tokens. “$1,000 might not become $100K fast,” he said, “but turning it into $10K or $20K? That’s very possible—if you play it smart.”",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-coming-heres-how-to-turn-1k-to-20k/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|ZRX|WIF","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T09:18:49.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Consolidates: Is $106,000 about to become strong horizontal support?","Bitcoin (BTC) is back above the $109,300 previous all-time high, which it surpassed on its way to the new all-time high of $112,000. After going back down as far as $106,600 over the last few days, Bitcoin is now consolidating above this level. Is this about to become good horizontal support and a springboard into the next stage of this bull market? Bond market under severe duress Cracks are opening in the global monetary system. Bond markets across the world are in disarray. In the US, buyers just cannot be found for longer duration bonds, and this is revealed in constantly rising 10, 20, and 30 year yields that just can’t seem to be kept down no matter what the US treasury does about it. The 10 year yield has dropped over the last few days from over 4.6% to 4.45%, but a higher high was put in, and this could be followed by a higher low, meaning that the trend could continue to go up. It might be argued that trust is the main element that is lacking in government bonds in these incredibly uncertain times, as more people begin to realise that governments are being forced to debase their currencies, thereby stealing the purchasing power of citizens, in order to be able to roll over the debt and keep the system going - albeit on life support. Bitcoin becoming more attractive It’s in this world that the Bitcoin life raft is floating. It has just surpassed both Amazon and Google to become the 5th biggest asset by market capitalization , at around $2.17 trillion. That said, there are still many across social and mainstream media platforms that would have us think that Bitcoin has made a market cycle top and that it’s generally downhill from here. With the greatest respect to many of these detractors who undoubtedly do have sound economic credentials, why would investors sell their Bitcoin now into fiat currency? Fiat is the problem - not Bitcoin. Fiat can be magicked into existence in the blink of an eye - Bitcoin cannot. This gives Bitcoin an attraction that puts it in the same category as gold, although more gold can be dug out of the ground to boost its supply. $BTC short-term chart Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows that the $106,000 horizontal support (orange line) has been well respected. The previous all-time high resistance (blue line) is now in the process of being flipped into support. If the bulls are successful in doing this it would likely only be a matter of time before a new all-time high is made, and a more sustained surge takes the price to higher levels. The importance of the $106,000 horizontal support Source: TradingView The daily chart shows just how important the $106,000 horizontal level has become. It rests on some of the daily candle tops of the big bull flag, and this support is also noticeable in recent price action. It may be that the bulls aren’t ready to make their move higher yet, and there could be some more sideways price action that tests this strong support base. Having said that, if the current resistance does become support, we would perhaps be more likely to see upwards price action from here. Of course, there is also the possibility of a negative or positive catalyst that spurs the price in one direction or the other. Bitcoin is the life raft out of the system Nevertheless, asset prices are imaginably going to rise from here, benefitting from the amount of money printing or other methods that introduce more liquidity into the system. Ready to climb higher into the final stage of a cycle that could be about to increase in duration, Bitcoin is the soundest money out there. If central banks are buying gold, it means that trust in the monetary system is dwindling. Buying Bitcoin is your life raft out of this system.

In a post on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author tells his 2.7 million followers that a sudden lack of demand for US bonds is resulting in money printing, which debases the dollar. “The end is here: what if you threw a party and no one showed up? That is what happened [May 20th]. The Fed held an auction for US Bonds and no one showed up. So the Fed quietly bought $50 billion of its own fake money with fake money. The party is over. Hyperinflation is here. Millions, young and old to be wiped out financially.” Kiyosaki also says that silver, gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ) are a hedge against rising inflation, and he predicts massive price targets for the assets as a result. “Good news. Gold will go to $25,000. Silver to $70. Bitcoin to $500,000 to $1 million… The end I have been warning the world about is here. May God have mercy on our souls.” Lastly, he says that the dwindling supply of available BTC for sale will drive the flagship crypto asset’s price higher. “I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich, so easy.

2025-05-27T09:12:25.000Z,"Metaplanet: A Possible Meme-Powered Bitcoin Bet","Summary Metaplanet writes put options to buy Bitcoin, in addition to raising considerable cash from equity and debt sources - Japanese debt is cheap. The stock has surged due to short squeezes and meme-stock dynamics in the latest days as the company continues to \""aggressively\"" accumulate Bitcoin and adopt a meme-stock character. Ultimately, it's a public listing that could be enhanced by short squeezes as it's heavily shorted, but Bitcoin underlies it, and it is already extremely volatile. Discussing a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) levered play like Tokyo-based Metaplanet Inc. ( MTPLF ) is not in the norm for us, but it has been hit by some interesting dynamics a little bit unique to a Japanese issue. There has been a short squeeze as the company adopts some meme-stock trading characteristics, and its exceptional short selling ratios has meant a squeeze has been in with a major scarcity of stocks available across the illiquid US listing and the Japanese listing that further rocketed the shares. It gained almost 200% since late April, moving up by a multiple of BTC's rise in that period, prior to that mostly trading in line with BTC. The company pivoted into this Bitcoin strategy recently, and we will say right away we have no interest in the company. They are raising major funds to speculate on Bitcoin, and their income generating strategies will to a significant degree be driven by selling put options. They may be hedging, but we couldn't find any disclosure to that effect. They did say they were cash collateralised in their option writing strategy at least. Of course, they hold massive amounts of Bitcoin, an asset whose long-term viability we seriously question, and their operating business also depends on Bitcoin going up it would seem, something we aren't going to bet on. Breakdown As far as we understood, the company is employing an all in strategy on Bitcoin. Initially, the business was focused on a hotel location in central Tokyo and also something in Hiroshima, doing hospitality, but then one day they decided that on the conviction that Bitcoin is somehow going to be the future, they would raise considerable amounts of cash, around 40 billion JPY it would seem in equity based on the balance sheet , and also some debt it would seem though they've repaid some of it, cumulatively raising around 80 billion JPY, with a plan of putting it into Bitcoin. Additionally, they have a \"" treasury management \"" business which is basically dominated by selling put options that are \""cash collateralised\"" also on Bitcoin. They hold around 51 billion JPY in Bitcoin as of the quarterly figures, around 90% of the company's total assets. Though now it would seem that have over 100 billion JPY in Bitcoin . They seem to have gotten into this already from the beginning of 2024 when they started to purchase Bitcoin. Segment Results (Q1 Earnings) The majority of their earnings at this point at the operating level, before accounting for the impact of gains on Bitcoin, are now from the Bitcoin income generation strategy. The ordinary income contains the gains they are making on Bitcoin, which they are accumulating \""aggressively\"" and as a long-term investment. In other words, Metaplanet is a Bitcoin bet, a bit like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). Metaplanet is one of the largest public holders of Bitcoin in the world. Comments There are some advantages to Metaplanet: There are some tax advantages in investing in Metaplanet as opposed to directly in Bitcoin, but this only seems to apply to Japanese tax residents. The fact that they can raise capital, particularly from debtors but also from shareholders despite the NAV premium, is very good for prior shareholders. Debt capital is also very cheap in Japan. Despite Metaplanet's employment of leverage, investors in Metaplanet are limited in liability by virtue of it being a public limited company, provided investors aren't using leverage to invest in the stock. It is highly shorted , meaning short squeezes are possible with stock to cover shorts possibly becoming suddenly very scarce, and this could become a new majorly followed meme stock. With the TSE circuit breakers kicking in frequently with it is also causes covering to be harassed. It is the most shorted stock in Japan as of a few days ago. But then there are clearly some major questions: There is no track record, yet the company is filling their presentations with data about how they're the best performing stock in the Japanese market, dominated mainly by industrial auto names and other slow movers (not as big of an accomplishment). Similarly, we don't really have much information on their income generating strategy other than that they are writing put options, which of course could one day go very badly for them. At least it's cash collateralised, which we'll take to mean they are not employing a lot of leverage. We entirely question the viability of Bitcoin. Other than the obvious, which is that it's very volatile (not a good store of value), mining is very energy and relatively time intensive, and it's not a practical currency especially compared to more reasonably managed fiat currencies, we also doubt the validity of the decentralisation principle which is at the centre of Bitcoin. In short, pool mining is the only logical way to go about finding nonces in a proof of work system. This means that coordinated miners are essentially causing centralisation , and pool mining has to be administrated by some entity. These could be compromised or may already be compromised. It's a vulnerability, and the more threatening Bitcoin becomes as an alternative to fiat, the more likely this vulnerability will be exploited if possible - though this risk is remote. It trades above NAV consistently. Currently, it is trading at multiples of its approximate NAV (around 100 billion JPY in Bitcoin, but market CAP is around 580 bn) Bottom Line As far as Metaplanet is concerned, while it may be interesting as an enhanced Bitcoin play in the event of a short squeeze, also because if it becomes used as a speculative tool to trade Bitcoin on the public markets at key moments shares will become especially scarce and buyers can also worsen squeezes by competing for shares looking to be used for cover, it is ultimately a newfangled Bitcoin play. You have to want to own Bitcoin to be interested in Metaplanet. If it becomes a meme stock, it may rocket, but it will also become incredibly volatile. We're not touching it.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790038-metaplanet-a-possible-meme-powered-bitcoin-bet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","MTPLF",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T09:09:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Supporter Michael Saylor Says Publishing Proof of Reserves Could Be Risky for Investors! Here Are the Details","Bitcoin advocate and Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) executive chairman Michael Saylor called the approach “a bad idea” because publishing institutional-grade on-chain proofs of reserves could pose serious security risks. Michael Saylor: “Proof-of-Reserve Chain Threatens Corporate Security” “The conventional way of issuing proof of reserves today is actually insecure,” Saylor said at a side event at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. “This method undermines the security of the issuer, the custodian, the exchanges and the investors. This is not a good idea, on the contrary, it is a bad idea,” he said. Saylor declined to directly respond to Blockware Solutions principal analyst Mitchell Askew’s question about whether Strategy would publish its own proof of reserves. “Publishing Wallet Addresses Puts Company Security at Risk” Cryptocurrency exchanges and ETF issuers have started publishing proof of reserves to ensure transparency and show that user assets are actually available, especially after the collapse of FTX in 2022. Major players such as Binance, Kraken, OKX, and Bitwise have adopted this method. However, Saylor argued that this practice offered one-way transparency, emphasizing that it only showed the assets held by the company and not its liabilities, that is, its debts. Saylor also noted that publishing wallet addresses openly would leave organizations open to cyberattacks, adding, “Ask an AI, ‘How would publishing all wallet addresses compromise company security over time?’ It will give you 50 pages of security risks.” Strategy is currently the world’s largest institutional Bitcoin holder with 576,230 Bitcoins. The company’s reserves are worth around $62.6 billion. It is followed by mining company MARA Holdings with 48,137 Bitcoins. Today, more than 110 publicly traded companies around the world hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. But according to Saylor, not every practice implemented in the name of transparency, especially methods such as onchain proof of reserve, aligns with the basic principles of corporate security. *This is not investment advice.

According to Lookonchain , a trader identified by the wallet address 0x2258 has recently netted $5.6 million in just three days by taking the opposite side of James Wynn ’s positions — shorting when Wynn went long, and longing when Wynn shorted. On May 24, 0x2258 began shorting both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) just as Wynn opened a long position on BTC. The next day, when Wynn closed his BTC long, 0x2258 closed his short for a $1.36 million profit. Later on May 25, as Wynn flipped from long to short, opening a BTC short position, 0x2258 reversed his stance again and opened long positions in BTC and ETH. On May 26, when Wynn exited his short position, the counter-trader closed his long, netting an additional $2.54 million. That same day, Wynn re-entered a long position on BTC, prompting 0x2258 to short BTC and ETH again, accumulating an unrealized profit of $1.7 million at the time of reporting by Lookonchain. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1927212551009398999 You might also like: From PEPE to Billions: meet crypto’s boldest whale James Wynn 0x2258’s trading behavior has sparked speculation on X that the wallet could somehow be linked to Wynn himself.

Several users suggested Wynn might be hedging through a second wallet. One user said , “Hedging his own trades?

2025-05-27T09:04:03.000Z,"Here’s What Could Send Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price to $0.01","Shiba Inu continues to generate attention in the cryptocurrency space, especially with growing speculation that the token could eventually reach a price of $0.01. While this goal remains controversial, a combination of strategic factors may support its long-term potential. Can SHIB Realistically Reach $0.01? The debate over SHIB hitting the $0.01 mark has divided analysts and investors. The token’s massive supply, currently around 589.5 trillion, poses a significant hurdle. If SHIB were to reach $0.01 with this supply intact, it would result in a market capitalization close to $5.89 trillion, far exceeding Bitcoin’s current valuation and surpassing the market cap of many global assets. Despite this, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, Lucie, has suggested the target is not impossible, though she cautioned that reaching it will take time. Similarly, community figure Luis Delgado (known as Del Crxpto) argued that the unpredictability of the crypto market makes such outcomes feasible. Changelly analysts have also weighed in, predicting that the $0.01 milestone could be achieved by 2040. What Could Help SHIB Reach This Target? Achieving a $0.01 price point would require major shifts across various dimensions, including token supply, market demand, and adoption. Supply Reduction Through Token Burns One of the most practical strategies involves lowering the circulating supply through token burns. This means sending tokens to addresses where they can no longer be accessed or used. These burns can be driven by the SHIB community, the Shibarium network, or cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase using transaction fees. A significant decrease in supply would reduce the market cap needed to hit higher price points. For instance, if SHIB’s total supply were cut to 50 trillion, a price of $0.01 would imply a $500 billion market cap, and more attainable compared to its current scenario. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin and Market-Wide Growth Shiba Inu’s performance has historically mirrored Bitcoin’s trends. Data shows that SHIB’s price has tracked closely with BTC over the past few months, reflecting an 87% correlation rate. If Bitcoin reaches $1 million in the future, it would likely lead to a sharp rise in overall market capitalization, lifting altcoins like SHIB higher. SHIB has also demonstrated a tendency to outperform BTC during strong market rallies. Utility Expansion and Ecosystem Development Wider adoption of SHIB as a payment method could also fuel demand. Integration with global platforms such as Amazon, Shopify, Uber, and Netflix would create real-world use cases, improving the token’s long-term prospects. Additionally, the growth of the ecosystem through DeFi usage, gaming projects, Web3 tools, and Shibarium transaction activity may support upward price pressure by increasing utility and driving token burns. Influence of Social and Media Momentum Public figures and media exposure continue to help the trajectory of meme coins. Although Elon Musk has not endorsed SHIB, a change in stance from influential personalities could rapidly increase interest. Furthermore, media attention during bullish phases has historically contributed to large inflows into speculative assets like SHIB. While the token reaching $0.01 remains uncertain and would require major structural shifts, it is not entirely impossible.

2025-05-27T09:03:47.000Z,"Crypto-linked kidnapping cases in France lead to arrests of over 12, including minors","Over 12 suspects, including minors, have been taken into custody by French police in connection with recent crypto-related kidnapping cases in Paris. A report from local media claims that the arrests were carried out on the morning of 27 May by the Brigade de Répression du Banditisme (BRB), France’s specialised anti-gang unit. The suspects, including several minors, were detained in coordinated operations across Île-de-France and Loire-Atlantique with assistance from other police units. Authorities believe the two high-profile kidnapping attempts , one involving the father of a crypto entrepreneur and another targeting the daughter of a crypto exchange CEO, are linked. Investigators suspect the involvement of a larger criminal organisation that allegedly recruited operatives via social media platforms to execute the abductions. The first case, which occurred on 1 May, involved the kidnapping of the father of a wealthy poker streamer and cryptocurrency investor. The victim was abducted by four masked men using a stolen van disguised with a fake UPS logo. The kidnappers reportedly demanded a ransom of €5 to €7 million in cryptocurrency. To pressure the victim’s son, they mutilated the father by severing a finger and filming the act. He was eventually rescued by police during a raid in Palaiseau, south of Paris.

The assailants fled the scene in a van branded with Chronopost markings. So far, six individuals have been charged and remanded in custody in connection with the first case. Those arrested are reportedly young and were recruited specifically for the operation. In the second case, arrests had not been made until this latest sweep. As previously reported by crypto.news, the French Interior Ministry has since stepped up protection measures for prominent crypto executives and their families. France has become the epicentre of a growing wave of crypto-targeted violence, with at least six such incidents recorded this year alone.

Related Reading: Avalanche Slides Off The Edge – What Comes After The 4H Trendline Snap? Bitcoin Starts Second Price Discovery Uptrend Last week, Bitcoin’s momentum propelled its price to its new all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 before retracing to its current range. Over the weekend, Bitcoin confirmed its breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend, following its successful retest of the $104,500 mark as support. The cryptocurrency has been in a significant market recovery for over a month, rallying nearly 50% from April lows. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that BTC ended its downside deviation period and positioned itself for a retest of its key re-accumulation range during early May’s surge, which was successfully reclaimed and surpassed. The analyst considers that its new Price Discovery Uptrend has “only just begun,” as Bitcoin starts Week 2 of this phase. Rekt Capital highlighted that this cycle has been “a story of Re-Accumulation Ranges,” which signals that a new range will likely form after this Price Discovery. Meanwhile, history suggests a second Price Discovery Correction is ahead as Bitcoin transitions into its new Price Discovery Uptrend. During its future correction, BTC will likely retrace between 25%-35% “to produce yet another Downside Deviation below the Re-Accumulation Range Low (future orange circle) before resuming upside into a likely Price Discovery Uptrend 3.” In the meantime, “All Bitcoin needs to do is hold above the Re-accumulation Range High of $104,500” to continue its price discovery rally. $110,000 Breakout Next? Notably, the flagship crypto has been retesting the range high as support over the past two weeks, confirming the breakout. As such, dipping into the previous $92,000-$104,500 range’s upper zone could happen as “part of normal volatility.” Moreover, it turned another key resistance, the $102,500 mark, into support during this period, which it had previously been rejected from in January 2025. With these levels as support, Rekt Capital considers that only the December 2024 and January 2025 upwicks, at $108,353 and $109,588, stand in the way of additional Price Discovery. Trader Daan Crypto Trades noted that Bitcoin is “still strong but fighting around its previous all-time high from earlier this year.” He pointed out that price action looks “very choppy” in the lower timeframes, but it shouldn’t be concerning for investors if the price remains within its current range. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip? Analyst MacroCRG affirmed that Bitcoin must officially reclaim the $110,000 level to continue its rally, as it marks the previous ATH and the Value Area High (VAH) from last week. “Acceptance above and we likely squeeze straight into price discovery again,” CRG stated. Currently, Bitcoin is retesting its Weekly opening of $109,004 as support, which could set the stage for a breakout above the $110,000 mark if held. Meanwhile, rejection from this area could send BTC price to the $106,000-$108,000 area. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $109,181, a 1.4% increase in the daily timeframe.

The company has drawn comparisons to MicroStrategy, which used a similar strategy of leveraging capital to accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin. TMTG’s shares closed last week at $25.72, giving it a market cap close to $6 billion. Like MicroStrategy, the media group plans to use at-the-market pricing for its share offering. The increased offering size is reportedly due to high investor interest. Beyond Bitcoin, the Trump family has launched NFT trading cards, backed memecoins, and invested in ventures like American Bitcoin (a crypto miner) and World Liberty Financial (a stablecoin platform). There are also plans to launch a crypto-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) . Just last week, Trump hosted a private dinner for top investors in his memecoin at his resort near Washington. The move follows Trump’s decision to transfer his majority stake in TMTG—valued at around $3 billion—into a trust controlled by his son Donald Jr., giving him full control over investment decisions. The crypto sector has seen rising momentum, with Bitcoin recently surpassing $109,000 , and other major deals like Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage Hidden Road. Industry insiders predict a wave of new crypto deals as Trump’s influence over the sector grows. ClearStreet and BTIG are expected to be among the underwriters for TMTG’s fundraising round.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-to-buy-crypto-for-3b,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T08:41:15.000Z,"Bitcoin up over 580% since Joe Rogan guest claimed it had ‘no intrinsic value’","When geopolitical analyst Peter Zeihan appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience , he made headlines for calling Bitcoin fundamentally worthless, stating that it had “no intrinsic value” and was “actually worth negative $1,000.” At the time, Bitcoin was trading at around $16,000 on January 7, 2023. “It has another $17,000 to go down,” Zeihan said during the podcast. “There’s no intrinsic value to this product.” He argued that the rise of crypto was more ideological than financial. “Whenever you invest based on an ideology, you’re going to make some decisions that are a little divorced from math,” he added. Zeihan described the crypto movement as a belief system rooted in decentralization: “The people who really like crypto are convinced that it’s the currency of the future, that a decentralized ledger is the way to go, and that anything controlled by a government entity is by definition negative. And if it’s done by the private sector freely, it will be better. That’s just not how currency works.” Bitcoin hits all-time high since Zeihan’s comments Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin has defied that forecast. As of May 2025, it’s now trading at $109,449—up more than 580% since Zeihan’s comments. The narrative around BTC has dramatically shifted, with institutional adoption now driving a new wave of momentum. Bitcoin’s rise has coincided with a string of historic milestones. In early 2025, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked the most successful ETF debut in U.S. history, pulling in billions of dollars from retail and institutional investors. Sovereign wealth funds, once cautious on digital assets, are now entering the market, using BTC as a macro hedge alongside traditional reserve assets. Meanwhile, the idea of Strategic Bitcoin Reserves is gaining traction. Corporations and even some governments are beginning to treat Bitcoin not just as a speculative investment, but as a critical layer of financial resilience, especially in a world increasingly shaped by currency debasement, inflation, and geopolitical fragmentation. Zeihan’s critique was based on a moment of industry chaos, with FTX’s collapse still fresh in the headlines. But Bitcoin’s current performance, alongside rising institutional confidence, suggests the asset has evolved far beyond its ideological roots.

2025-05-27T08:40:30.000Z,"BTC Long Short Ratio: Critical Insight into Crypto Market Sentiment","BitcoinWorld BTC Long Short Ratio: Critical Insight into Crypto Market Sentiment Understanding the pulse of the crypto market sentiment is crucial for anyone involved in trading or investing. One powerful tool traders use to gauge this sentiment is the BTC long short ratio , particularly for perpetual futures contracts. This ratio provides a snapshot of whether market participants holding open positions are predominantly betting on Bitcoin’s price going up (long) or down (short). Decoding the BTC Long Short Ratio So, what exactly is the BTC long short ratio ? In simple terms, it’s the ratio of open long positions to open short positions on a given exchange or across multiple exchanges for a specific asset, like Bitcoin perpetual futures. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, making them very popular in the crypto space. The ratio is often calculated based on the open interest, which represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. A ratio above 1.0 suggests that there are more long positions than short positions, indicating a generally bullish sentiment among futures traders. Conversely, a ratio below 1.0 suggests more short positions, pointing towards a bearish sentiment. Current Snapshot: Analyzing the Latest BTC Long Short Ratio Data Let’s dive into the recent data for Bitcoin perpetual futures across some of the leading crypto derivatives exchanges. The following figures represent the 24-hour long-short ratios based on open interest: Exchange/Total Long (%) Short (%) Ratio (Long/Short) Total (Aggregated) 47.3% 52.7% ~0.90 Binance 46.46% 53.54% ~0.87 OKX 47.33% 52.67% ~0.90 Bybit 48.91% 51.09% ~0.96 Looking at the aggregated data, we see that short positions slightly outweigh long positions, resulting in a ratio below 1.0 (approximately 0.90). This suggests a marginally bearish bias in the market sentiment among perpetual futures traders over the past 24 hours, based on open interest. Breaking Down Exchange-Specific BTC Long Short Ratios While the aggregate number gives us a general idea, examining individual exchanges provides more granular insights: Binance: With 46.46% Long and 53.54% Short, Binance shows the strongest short bias among the top three exchanges listed. This indicates that traders on Binance are slightly more bearish in their positioning compared to the average. OKX: OKX mirrors the overall market sentiment very closely, with 47.33% Long and 52.67% Short. Its ratio of ~0.90 aligns perfectly with the aggregated figure. Bybit: Bybit presents the least bearish picture among the three, with 48.91% Long and 51.09% Short. While still showing slightly more shorts than longs, the difference is smaller than on Binance and OKX, resulting in a ratio closer to 1.0 (~0.96). These variations can be due to different trader demographics, regional preferences, or even specific promotions on the exchanges. Why Pay Attention to Trading Sentiment? Understanding the prevailing trading sentiment is vital because it reflects the collective expectations of a large segment of the market. Extreme ratios can sometimes act as contrarian indicators. For example, if the ratio shows an overwhelming number of long positions (very high ratio), it might suggest the market is becoming overleveraged on the bullish side, potentially setting the stage for a cascade of liquidations if the price moves against them (a ‘long squeeze’). Conversely, an extremely low ratio (too many shorts) could precede a ‘short squeeze’. While the current ratio (around 0.90) isn’t indicative of an extreme imbalance, it confirms that futures traders are currently leaning slightly towards expecting a price decrease or are hedging existing spot positions with shorts. Factors Influencing Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Ratios Several factors can influence the balance between long and short positions on crypto derivatives platforms: Price Action: Sustained upward trends tend to encourage more long positions, while downward trends lead to increased shorting. Funding Rates: Perpetual futures have a mechanism called the funding rate, which is paid between long and short position holders. Positive funding rates (longs pay shorts) incentivize shorting, while negative funding rates (shorts pay longs) incentivize longing. These rates can influence positioning. News and Events: Macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, or significant events within the crypto ecosystem can quickly shift sentiment. Technical Analysis: Traders often open positions based on technical indicators, support/resistance levels, and chart patterns. Liquidations: Large liquidation events can dramatically alter the ratio as positions are forcibly closed. Actionable Insights from the BTC Long Short Ratio How can you use this data? It’s best viewed as one tool among many. Here are some actionable insights: Sentiment Confirmation: Use the ratio to confirm sentiment derived from other sources like social media analysis or fundamental news. Identifying Divergences: Look for divergences between the ratio and price action. If the price is rising but the ratio shows increasing short interest, it might signal potential resistance or a short squeeze setup. If the price is falling but the ratio shows increasing long interest, it might indicate potential support or a long squeeze setup. Understanding Exchange Differences: Recognize that sentiment can vary between platforms. This might inform your choice of exchange or highlight potential arbitrage opportunities if significant price differences emerge. Risk Awareness: A highly skewed ratio (very high or very low) suggests a potentially crowded trade, which can increase the risk of sharp reversals due to liquidations. Challenges and Limitations It’s important to remember the limitations of relying solely on the BTC long short ratio : Not a Crystal Ball: The ratio reflects *current* positioning, not future price movements. A high long ratio doesn’t guarantee a price drop, nor does a low ratio guarantee a rise. Open Interest vs. Volume: Open interest measures outstanding contracts, not the volume of trading activity. High open interest with low volume might indicate fewer new positions being opened. Data Sources: Ensure the data source is reputable and aggregates data accurately across exchanges. Context is Key: The ratio must be analyzed in the context of overall market conditions, price trends, funding rates, and other relevant data. Conclusion: What Does the Current Ratio Tell Us? The latest 24-hour BTC long short ratio data, showing a slight bias towards short positions across major exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit, indicates a cautious or slightly bearish sentiment among Bitcoin perpetual futures traders based on open interest. While not extreme, this positioning is a valuable piece of information for understanding the current mood in the crypto market sentiment . Remember, this ratio is just one indicator, and a comprehensive trading strategy requires analyzing multiple factors and managing risk effectively when trading crypto derivatives .

2025-05-27T08:33:38.000Z,"Risky trader James Wynn linked to Alameda Research?","The unique trading style of James Wynn keeps gaining attention. Wallet history may also link the trader to Alameda Research. The recent risky trading moves of James Wynn attracted more attention to his wallet history. Wynn has previously taken both risky long and short positions, with early investments in meme tokens. The trading patterns suggested that Wynn may be linked to Alameda Research, exaggerating the fund’s risky strategies even more with his independent reserves. The FTX creditor activist Sunil Kavuri noticed Wynn’s choice of assets. He added that Wynn’s early wallets also received funds from Alameda Research, and there was other evidence of insider tips and a connection as one of the fund’s traders. James Wynn trades like Alameda on steroids because he probably was a trader there Dec 2020: Alameda sent James Wynn around $6,000 in ETH $1bn (40x leverage) position: Flipped long short long BTC in last 2days PnL: $87m to $10m in 4days Bought PEPE when market cap was $600k… pic.twitter.com/VzFoQoT9sY — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) May 27, 2025 The main connection to Alameda is that Wynn received 6,000 ETH in 2020, later allowing him to make high-profile trades and discover meme tokens early. Alameda Research was also known for allocating funds to any and all new assets that appeared during the 2021 boom, including memes and NFTs. Wynn extended his streak of meme token investments even during the bear market after the FTX crash, getting involved with BabyPepe and ELON. Wynn later rebranded as a Hyperliquid trader, raising the platform’s profile, while also taking multiple high-risk positions. The trader is not a Bitcoin maximalist, and in fact was recently involved with another meme token, MoonPig. He showed true belief in the token, suggesting its price could run into the billions. MoonPig rallied from May 22 onward, right after Wynn mentioned the token. The asset peaked above $0.10, later erasing its gains to $0.06. Wynn reportedly acquired 3% of the token’s supply, shilled the asset, then locked in gains by selling at the top. On-chain data shows selling from Wynn’s wallets put downward pressure on MoonPig. James Wynn is now in the red The attention on James Wynn increased as the Bitcoin (BTC) rally stalled in the past day. BTC traded around $109,007, but even that price drop was enough to erase Wynn’s gains. Previously, Wynn had closed a position with a $25M gain, but then reopened a 40X leveraged long. The position of James Wynn was underwater with unrealized losses, though the trader still waits for a market reversal. | Source: Hyperliquid The position is now marking a $2.4M unrealized loss, and may be liquidated if BTC does not recover. Wynn, however, is still confident in the performance of BTC, as the coin reversed still above his liquidation price. Wynn believed the trading activity in the past day was deliberate, an attempt to liquidate his position, which still holds for now. The past two days even spawned reverse traders, who took short positions when Wynn went long. According to on-chain data, one trader spent the past three days with a reverse-Wynn strategy. The end result was $5.6M in realized gains. The whale retains reverse positions, which are still in the green with $445K in gains. Wynn, on the other hand, is more than $13.2M in unrealized losses for the past 24 hour period. The end result may reverse if BTC resumes its rally. Wynn continues to keep a high profile on social media, while drawing attention to Hyperliquid. One of the theories for Wynn’s high-risk trades is that he was deliberately showing the capabilities of Hyperliquid, pushing its token to new peaks. After the recent trades, HYPE stalled just under $40. The token traded at $37.64, with no significant gains in the past day. Hyperliquid expanded its open interest to over $8.9B, aiming to compete with the top centralized derivative exchanges.

2025-05-27T08:32:03.000Z,"Bitcoin Price to Hit $135K by July 2025","The post Bitcoin Price to Hit $135K by July 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the last 30 days, Bitcoin has seen a growth of at least 16% , with a 3.3% surge in just the past seven days. Currently, Bitcoin’s price sits at $109,031 . A new research-based analysis predicts that Bitcoin could reach $135K by July 2025 , driven by its correlation with the US M2 money supply . Bitcoin & M2 Correlation Explained The analysis, shared by crypto analyst Wise Advice , highlights the strong connection between Bitcoin’s price action and the US M2 money supply. M2 includes physical currency, checking deposits, saving accounts, and money market funds. When M2 increases, it signals more liquidity in the financial system, which often flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin typically mirrors the movement of M2 with a 10-12 week lag . Recently, the M2 money supply saw a 2.7% rise , increasing from $107.5 trillion to $110.72 trillion .

April 2025 : After M2’s January drop , Bitcoin dropped to a low of $74K by April 7, 2025 . These instances demonstrate that Bitcoin’s price generally follows the M2 movement with a 10-12 week lag . BTC Price Prediction Currently sitting at $109K , Wise Advice predicts that if this pattern repeats, Bitcoin could grow by at least 24% , reaching $135K by July . The analysis also suggests that this surge in Bitcoin’s price could trigger a rally in altcoins as well. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-27T08:24:37.000Z,"MSTY: Harnessing Strategy's Bitcoin-Driven Volatility For High-Yield Income","Summary Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF offers a way for income investors to gain exposure to the volatility of Bitcoin and MSTR using advanced options trading strategies to generate a 140% TTM yield. MSTR's business as both an AI analytics leader and the largest Bitcoin treasury, adds layers to future growth prospects of the company and underlying Bitcoin asset, driving substantial speculation and volatility. NAV erosion should be monitored carefully, but new changes to the prospectus should help mitigate this risk further. I recommend keeping MSTY as a small portion of your portfolio, aiming to recoup your investment quickly and not relying on it for core income. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), recently renamed \""Strategy\"", and YieldMax ETFs have carried immense volatility and speculation in their own rights over the past year. Put all three together and that's where Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) comes into play. If you're on the fence about Bitcoin, MSTR, and trading high-risk, high-reward options strategies to hedge uncertainty, I believe MSTY offers a compelling investment choice to income investors seeking high, monthly income by trading options on MSTR stock. Bitcoin Ownership Understanding (X) Let's get one thing straight. Most retail investors, myself included, do not fully understand Bitcoins applications potential, had no idea what Strategy did other than buy Bitcoin beyond a year ago, and we all mostly suck at trading options. Yet the beautiful thing with equity investing is we don't need to know much beyond this to make money like in real estate or private business, people smarter than us, like the veteran fund managers of MSTY, will take our capital and do the work for us to make this play. About MSTR Before we delve into the strategy behind MSTY, it's important to understand the underlying company the fund is trading options on. Strategy has been around since 1989 and is first and foremost, a global leader in enterprise analytics in the AI-powered business intelligence solutions space, empowering users with advanced data insights and decision-making tools. Strategy's products can be found in the US government, retail, banking, manufacturing, healthcare, and telecom industries. The company competes with other major players like IBM Corporation ( IBM ), Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ), and Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ). In its own right, AI-powered software and it affects on how every company on Earth will do business in the future is of substantial interest, driving speculation in the market. Since 2020, the company began accumulating substantial amounts of Bitcoin through equity and debt issuance, making it the largest Bitcoin Treasury in the world. The value proposition for investors is exposure to Bitcoin for its inflation protection/store of value and exploring innovations in Bitcoin applications such as financial applications, blockchain analytics, and identity/security systems. However, currently the company is focused since late October 2024 on its 21/21 plan to raise $42B and in order to acquire more Bitcoin on top of the companies over half a million BTC, currently worth around $57B. MSTY Mechanics MSTY was launched on February 21, 2024 with the primary objective to generating high levels of monthly income by using synthetic covered call strategy \""poor man's covered calls\"" as the fund does not directly own MSTR shares. The fund buys long call and put options to mimic MSTRs price movements, then sells monthly call options using purchased contracts to collect premiums. As always, covered call ETFs like MSTY hold US treasury bills and cash to cover these positions. We can actually see some of these positions, for example, like the $390 and $420 calls for June 20th expiry. MSTY Holdings (Seeking Alpha) Amassing $3.76B AUM with a TTM yield of 140.55%, the fund has largely taken advantage of both MSTRs price appreciation and underlying stock volatility driven by the overlying Bitcoin. The last 12 months the fund has paid out $30.25/share or about $2.52/month. The fund is currently trading at $21.52. During this timeframe and still at-large today, MSTY does not own any MSTR shares however a recent change to the prospectus, driven by the size of the ETF, now allows the fund managers to incorporate Swap contracts Purchasing call options \""deep in the money\"" Purchasing equity securities like the underlying MSTR itself The hope here is to be able to stabilize the NAV and capture more upside of the MSTR price action. For a more detailed breakdown of MSTY, I recommend this interview with the fund managers of MSTY Jay Pestrichelli & Scott Snyder . MSTY Performance Below we see MSTY has done a nice job of capturing the gains from MSTR with less volatility with an impressive 272% total return compared to MSTRs 418% total return while Bitcoin doubled in price. This is one of the reasons investors interested in selling options themselves to capitalize on this volatility would buy MSTY, as selling one contract on MSTR requires around $40,000 or managing the cheaper, but more complex synthetic covered call strategy. Data by YCharts The high income MSTY is able to generate is driven by MSTRs extremely high volatility, which has come down to a 30-Day Rolling 56.63% volatility. For reference, the broader S&P 500 market is at around 20% while Bitcoin itself is around 32.60%. A pure play on Bitcoin's volatility is something like NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) which has a distribution rate of almost 28% currently. Data by YCharts Risk Analysis The key risks with MSTY, like all options ETFs, is NAV erosion. This would stem from a significant, sharp drops in the price of Bitcoin and/or MSTR stock itself, reducing the synthetic long positions. Even if the call premiums are generating income as shares slide, the distributions would quickly turn into the \""bad\"" kind of return of capital to investors, eroding the NAV further. In addition, as MSTR is using leverage like convertible notes and preferred shares to buy Bitcoin, price swings of either Bitcoin or MSTR stock will further amplify losses. As mentioned earlier, the changes to the prospectus should hopefully hedge NAV erosion as well. To manage this risk, I'd do a few things. First, DCA into MSTY as the price fluctuates plenty. I do think buys below $20/share are less risky than buys above $30/share. We've seen a full cycle and clearly, investors have been loading up below $25/share. The original NAV also started at $20/share, so that's something to keep in mind. Next, I would manage the risk by managing your greed in this trade. Obviously, income investors are drooling over this high yield and the prospect of getting all your money back in ~9 months and having a \""free\"" asset to print money for you forever, regardless of the NAV or distribution amounts. However, even if this is achieved, I would not want to rely on the income of this fund to pay all my bills as if the volatility of Bitcoin and MSTR come down significantly, your income will drop proportionally. The Bitcoin Trinity (Reddit) My Strategy I recently started a small position in MSTY. With the institutional adoption and speculative applications, I believe the volatility around Bitcoin and by default it's largest holder, MSTR, will continue to be much higher than the broader market. This is necessary to keep the options premium high and should be desired by investors of MSTY. I would prefer the position make up no more than 5% of my income targets. For my $3,000/month financial security goal to cover my fixed expenses, that's about $150/month. Long-term, I wouldn't want it to produce more than $500/month of my passive income goal of $10,000/month. I plan to maintain an average below $25/share and hope to recoup all my money in one year or less. The reason I don't suggest whaling this ETF as a significant income strategy is even if you recoup all your money, if you start relying on that income and there is a major correction reducing the premiums, you will not have the financial security you set out to buy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790021-msty-harnessing-strategys-bitcoin-driven-volatility-for-high-yield-income?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","BTC-USD|MSTR|BTCI|MSTY",cryptocompare

The appointment comes as Sygnum continues to scale its presence in jurisdictions such as Singapore and the UAE, where digital asset frameworks are evolving rapidly. However, Sygnum CEO Matthias Imbach recently cautioned that Switzerland, long considered a crypto-friendly hub, risks falling behind if it doesn’t maintain its regulatory edge.

2025-05-27T08:20:50.000Z,"Warning: Bitcoin Momentum Weakens, Crucial $100K Retest Possible","BitcoinWorld Warning: Bitcoin Momentum Weakens, Crucial $100K Retest Possible Are you watching the charts wondering what’s next for Bitcoin ? Despite a recent positive run, the flagship cryptocurrency, BTC , might be showing subtle signs of fatigue. Understanding these potential shifts in market trends is crucial for navigating the volatile world of digital assets. Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin Signals Recent analysis points to some potential headwinds for Bitcoin . While the price has moved upwards, certain technical indicators suggest the underlying strength might not be keeping pace. Let’s break down what analysts are seeing: Bearish Divergence in ROC: The 30-day Rate of Change (ROC) is a momentum oscillator that measures the percentage change in price over a specific period. A ‘bearish divergence’ occurs when the price makes higher highs, but the ROC makes lower highs. This divergence signals that the buying pressure is weakening, even as the price continues to climb. Think of it like a car going uphill – the speed (price) is increasing, but the engine’s power (momentum) is dropping. MACD Histogram Turns Negative: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is another popular momentum indicator. The MACD histogram represents the distance between the MACD line and the signal line. When the histogram turns negative, it typically suggests that the short-term momentum is slowing down relative to the longer-term momentum, often seen as a bearish signal in the short term. These signals, when viewed together, paint a picture of potentially fading bullish enthusiasm, raising questions about the sustainability of the current upward move for BTC . What Does This Mean for the BTC Price Prediction ? The potential weakening momentum has direct implications for short-term Bitcoin price prediction . Analysts suggest that if these bearish signals persist, BTC could be at risk of falling out of its current bullish ascending channel. An ascending channel is formed by drawing two parallel trend lines that contain the price action as it moves upwards. The lower line acts as support, and the upper line acts as resistance. A break below the lower trend line of an ascending channel is often considered a bearish technical event, suggesting a potential trend reversal or a significant pullback. If Bitcoin were to break below this channel, the next significant area to watch would be the psychological and potentially technical support level around $100,000 . Retesting this level would represent a notable correction from recent highs but is not uncommon during strong bull markets as price seeks out solid support zones. Is the Broader Trend Still Bullish? Analyzing Market Trends While the short-term signals warrant caution, it’s crucial to look at the bigger picture and longer-term market trends . The report highlights a significant long-term bullish signal: the recent ‘golden cross’. A golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average. In this case, the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossed above the 200-day SMA. This event is widely interpreted by traders as a strong indicator of a potential long-term bull market commencing or continuing. It suggests that the average price over the last 50 days is now higher than the average price over the last 200 days, indicating sustained upward price action. So, while short-term momentum indicators flash yellow, the golden cross suggests that the foundational trend for Bitcoin remains positive. This creates a complex picture where short-term volatility and potential pullbacks are possible within a broader bullish context. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Holders and Traders Given these conflicting signals, what should you consider? Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close eye on the lower boundary of the ascending channel and the $100,000 level. A break below these could signal further downside. Watch Momentum Indicators: Continue to track the ROC and MACD. A turn back positive in the MACD histogram or a reversal in the ROC divergence could signal renewed strength. Understand the Long vs. Short Term: Recognize that short-term pullbacks are normal, even in a bull market. The golden cross provides a longer-term bullish outlook, but doesn’t negate the possibility of temporary dips. Risk Management: As always, employ sound risk management strategies. Volatility is inherent in the crypto market. This is not financial advice, but rather an analysis of current technical signals impacting the potential Bitcoin price prediction . Always do your own research and consult with a financial advisor. Conclusion: Navigating the Crosscurrents for BTC The current landscape for Bitcoin presents a fascinating technical puzzle. Short-term momentum indicators like the ROC and MACD suggest potential weakness and raise the possibility of a retest of the significant $100,000 support level. However, the overarching long-term trend, supported by the recent golden cross, remains positive. This means that while caution is warranted regarding potential short-term pullbacks, the broader outlook for BTC continues to lean bullish according to this particular analysis. Staying informed about these technical signals and broader market trends is key to navigating the path ahead for Bitcoin .

On May 27, an Instagram account belonging to American rap trio, Migos, was reportedly compromised by hackers who gained access to Gokal’s personal information and used it to dox him and his wife. The now-deleted Instagram posts featured pictures of the Solana ( SOL ) Labs President holding his driver’s license and passport, both unredacted. Another post featured a woman, claimed by the hackers to be Gokal’s wife, holding her driver’s license. The seven pictures were shared to the 13 million followers on Migos’ Instagram account. One of the posts shared Gokal’s personal contact information, including his phone number. The poster then urged people to “spam” the Solana co-founder, effectively doxxing him. A caption written on the post that showed Gokal holding his driver’s license seemingly implied that he was initially blackmailed before his personal information was leaked on social media. Tagging Gokal’s Instagram account, the hacker wrote: “you should’ve paid the 40 BTC.” At current prices, 40 Bitcoin ( BTC ) would be equal to around $4.3 million.

2025-05-27T08:17:37.000Z,"Quantum Computing Could Break Bitcoin-Like Encryption Far Easier Than Intially Thought, Google Researcher Says","A new research paper by Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney shows that breaking widely used RSA encryption may require 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously believed. The finding did not specifically mention bitcoin BTC or other cryptocurrencies, but took aim at the encryption methods that form the technical backbone used to secure crypto wallets and, in some cases, transactions. RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt data. It relies on two different but linked keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Bitcoin doesn’t use RSA, but relies on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). However, ECC can also be broken by Shor’s algorithm, a quantum algorithm designed to factor large numbers or solve logarithm problems — which form the heart of public key cryptography. ECC is a way to lock and unlock digital data using mathematical calculations called curves (which compute only in one direction) instead of big numbers. Think of it as a smaller key that’s just as strong as a larger one. While 256-bit ECC keys are significantly more secure than 2048-bit RSA keys, quantum threats scale nonlinearly, and research like Gidney’s compresses the timeline by which such attacks become feasible. “I estimate that a 2048-bit RSA integer could be factored in under a week by a quantum computer with fewer than one million noisy qubits,” Gidney wrote. This was a stark revision from his 2019 paper, which estimated such a feat would require 20 million qubits and take eight hours. To be clear: no such machine exists yet. IBM’s most powerful quantum processor to date, Condor, clocks in at just over 1,100 qubits, and Google’s Sycamore has 53. Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, using quantum bits or qubits instead of traditional bits. Unlike bits, which represent either a 0 or a 1, qubits can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement. This allows quantum computers to perform multiple calculations at once, potentially solving problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. “This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Gidney said in a post. Researchers, such as the quantum research group Project 11, are actively exploring whether even weakened versions of Bitcoin’s encryption can be broken by today’s quantum hardware. The group earlier this year launched a public bounty offering 1 BTC (~$85,000) to anyone able to break tiny ECC key sizes — between 1 and 25 bits — using a quantum computer. The goal isn't to break Bitcoin today, but to measure how close current systems can be.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/05/27/quantum-computing-could-break-bitcoin-like-encryption-far-easier-than-intially-thought-google-researcher-says,"BTC|TRADING|RESEARCH","Tech|Encryption|quantum computing|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T08:16:49.000Z,"Michael Saylor Says Proof-of-Reserves Is a Bad Idea","The post Michael Saylor Says Proof-of-Reserves Is a Bad Idea appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin 2025 just got a shock of controversy, Michael Saylor made waves by calling proof-of-reserves “a bad idea,” as highlighted by analyst Mitchell. The bold remark has reignited debate around transparency and trust in crypto. In a recent interview, Saylor outright rejected the idea of publishing on-chain proof of reserves, a practice seen by many in the crypto space as essential for transparency and trust. Saylor’s Security Concerns Saylor argued that current PoR methods weaken security by exposing sensitive data. He likened it to publishing bank account details and insisted AI analysis would reveal dozens of ways such disclosures could compromise long-term safety. Drawing from the FTX and Mt. Gox disasters, Saylor suggested that blindly chasing transparency without secure methods could do more harm than good. Analysts and Bitcoin Veterans Push Back i suspected @saylor holding paper bitcoin now everyone knows he cant back up his btc claims. everything he said is a lie. proof of reserve can easily be done with zero security risks. sell @Strategy as long as you can https://t.co/Inmecnaahc — bitcoin pirate I I ∞/21M (@ob_hodl) May 27, 2025 The crypto community didn’t take his comments lightly. Notably, Bitcoin veteran Whale Panda (Stefan Jespers) called it a “major red flag,” stressing that Bitcoin’s core value lies in its transparency. Critics argue that there are ways to verify holdings securely, without compromising asset safety. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : New MicroStrategy Bitcoin Acquisition Pushes Holdings Past 580K BTC Mark , For example, Bitwise uses a “proof of holdings” method for its crypto products, and many crypto exchanges regularly publish audit reports to prove solvency. These examples contradict Saylor’s claim that such actions are inherently risky. Old Wounds and New Doubts Resurface The backlash has even reignited old doubts. Some critics pointed to Saylor’s infamous $6 billion loss in 2000 due to an accounting scandal, suggesting a pattern of avoiding transparency. Others are reviving conspiracy theories that MicroStrategy may not hold actual Bitcoin, but instead, paper-based derivatives. While Saylor remains a central figure in Bitcoin advocacy , this latest remark has cast a shadow over his approach to transparency, raising new questions about how institutional players should handle crypto accountability . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-27T08:15:18.000Z,"Pakistan Goes All In on Bitcoin Mining With 2,000MW Energy Move","The post Pakistan Goes All In on Bitcoin Mining With 2,000MW Energy Move appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pakistan has allocated 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity to fuel Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure , marking a major leap toward becoming a digital-first economy. On May 25, 2025, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced the bold strategy, stating, “This strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.” Here’s why Pakistan is taking this high-voltage leap into the digital future: Driving Digital Growth Through Surplus Power Pakistan has experienced an electricity surplus due to heavy investment in power infrastructure and reduced industrial activity. Instead of wasting this power, the government plans to repurpose it for Bitcoin mining operations and AI data centers, enabling economic returns from otherwise idle resources. Attracting Investment and Revenue By legalizing and promoting Bitcoin mining, Pakistan aims to: Attract foreign and local investors Generate new streams of tax revenue Earn foreign exchange reserves Position itself as a sovereign digital economy in the global crypto space With crypto assets and AI technologies booming worldwide, this move could help Pakistan ride the next big digital wave. Building Tech Infrastructure and Jobs This initiative is not just about mining Bitcoin—it’s about building a digital ecosystem. By powering AI infrastructure: Pakistan boosts its domestic AI capabilities Creates high-skilled job opportunities for youth Encourages growth in fields like blockchain, data science, and cloud computing It’s a strategic approach to tackle unemployment and prepare the workforce for the future of tech. Clear Regulations, Real Impact Bilal Bin Saqib, Head of Crypto Council, called the move a “turning point” for Pakistan’s economy. He emphasized the need for transparent regulations and proper systems to fully unlock the potential of this transition. “With clear guidelines and secure systems, Pakistan can be a major player in the global crypto economy.” Joining Asia’s Crypto-Forward League Pakistan is now following in the footsteps of Kazakhstan, Japan, Malaysia, and Bhutan, all of which have embraced legal Bitcoin mining to fuel their economies. These countries have already cracked down on illicit mining and established regulated environments for digital growth. Final Take As Bitcoin prices continue to surge and AI becomes a cornerstone of global tech, Pakistan’s 2,000MW commitment signals a forward-thinking strategy. It’s not just an energy allocation—it’s a vision for a modern, digital, and self-reliant Pakistan.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pakistan-crypto-strategy-powers-up-with-2000mw-for-bitcoin-and-ai/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION","News|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T08:10:45.000Z,"Shocking Solana Co-Founder Raj Gokal’s Personal Data Leaked Via Migos Instagram Hack","BitcoinWorld Shocking Solana Co-Founder Raj Gokal’s Personal Data Leaked Via Migos Instagram Hack In a bizarre and concerning incident that highlights the ever-present risks in the digital age, particularly for high-profile individuals in the cryptocurrency space, personal information belonging to Solana co-founder Raj Gokal was reportedly leaked online. The unexpected conduit for this sensitive information? The official Instagram account of the popular American hip-hop group, Migos. What Happened: The Raj Gokal Personal Data Leak Reports emerged detailing a significant Personal Data Leak affecting Raj Gokal, one of the key figures behind the Solana blockchain. According to news outlet The Block, the Instagram account associated with the group Migos briefly posted highly sensitive personal documents belonging to Gokal. This included images of his driver’s license and passport. While the posts were quickly deleted, the fact that they appeared on a widely followed celebrity account adds an unusual twist to what appears to be a targeted cyberattack. The posts reportedly contained a stark message: “You should’ve paid the 40 BTC.” This specific phrase strongly suggests that Gokal may have been subjected to extortion attempts or threats prior to this public leak. The demand for 40 Bitcoin (BTC) is a substantial amount, underscoring the severity of the alleged ransom request. The Celebrity Connection: Migos Instagram Involved The involvement of the Migos Instagram account in this incident is particularly perplexing and attention-grabbing. It raises questions about how the attackers gained access to such a prominent social media profile. Was the Migos account itself compromised? Was it used as a staging ground or a means to amplify the pressure on Raj Gokal? While the exact connection and mechanism remain unclear based on the initial reports, the use of a celebrity platform adds a layer of public spectacle to the privacy violation. It’s crucial to understand that the appearance of Gokal’s data on the Migos account does not imply any involvement or culpability from the music group themselves. It points more towards the sophisticated and often unpredictable tactics employed by cybercriminals who exploit various digital pathways to achieve their goals. Understanding Crypto Security Risks in the Digital Age This incident serves as a stark reminder of the pervasive nature of digital threats, especially for individuals associated with valuable digital assets and prominent projects like Solana . While Raj Gokal is a public figure, the attack vector highlights vulnerabilities that can affect anyone. Key risks demonstrated by this event include: Social Engineering: Attackers often use psychological manipulation to gain access to accounts or information. Account Takeovers: Compromising email, social media, or other online accounts can provide pathways to more sensitive data. Data Exploitation: Once personal information is obtained, it can be used for identity theft, further extortion, or targeted attacks. Interconnected Vulnerabilities: A weakness in one service (like email or social media) can be leveraged to compromise accounts on other, seemingly unrelated, platforms (like crypto accounts or financial services). Raj Gokal himself had previously warned about attempts to compromise his digital life. Just last week, he posted on his X account (formerly Twitter) detailing how exploiters were actively trying to take control of his email, social media, Google, Apple, and other critical online accounts. This indicates he was already under siege, and the Migos Instagram leak appears to be a potentially escalated tactic by the attackers after their initial attempts may have failed or were detected. Protecting Your Personal Data: Actionable Insights While this specific incident involved a high-profile individual, the tactics used underscore the importance of robust Crypto Security practices for everyone interacting with digital assets. Protecting your Personal Data Leak is paramount. Here are some actionable steps you can take: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Everywhere: Use strong 2FA methods (like hardware keys or authenticator apps) on all critical accounts, including email, social media, crypto exchanges, wallets, and cloud services (Google, Apple, etc.). Avoid SMS-based 2FA if possible, as it can be vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Use Unique, Strong Passwords: Never reuse passwords. Use a password manager to create and store complex, unique passwords for each account. Be Wary of Phishing Attempts: Be extremely cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or calls asking for personal information or login credentials. Always verify the source. Separate Sensitive Accounts: Consider using dedicated email addresses and devices for your most sensitive activities, like managing cryptocurrency holdings. Regularly Review Account Activity: Check your account logs and linked devices regularly for any suspicious activity. Limit Public Information: Be mindful of the personal information you share publicly online, especially on social media. The challenge lies in the interconnectedness of our digital lives. A compromise on a seemingly innocuous platform can have cascading effects, potentially impacting financial security or access to valuable digital assets like those on the Solana network. The Solana Angle: Implications Beyond the Individual? While this attack targeted an individual associated with Solana , it’s important to clarify that there is no indication that the Solana blockchain itself was compromised. The attack vector appears to be centered around Raj Gokal’s personal digital footprint and associated accounts, including the bizarre link to the Migos Instagram . However, incidents involving prominent figures in the crypto space naturally draw attention and can raise questions about the broader ecosystem’s resilience. It underscores the fact that human and operational security surrounding key personnel is just as vital as the technical security of the blockchain protocol itself. Summary: A Wake-Up Call for Digital Vigilance The unprecedented incident involving the Migos Instagram account leaking Solana co-founder Raj Gokal’s personal data serves as a dramatic illustration of the lengths cybercriminals will go to. The alleged 40 BTC ransom demand highlights the financial motivation behind such attacks. Coming on the heels of Gokal’s own warnings about attempted account takeovers, this event reinforces the critical need for robust Crypto Security and vigilance in protecting one’s Personal Data Leak across all online platforms, not just those directly related to crypto. This story is a powerful reminder that in the digital world, our security is interconnected. A breach on a social media account, even one as unexpected as the Migos Instagram , can be part of a larger, targeted effort to compromise individuals involved in valuable sectors like cryptocurrency. Staying informed and implementing strong security practices is no longer optional – it’s essential.

He also told them to ask the AI how it might undermine the security of someone’s company over time. According to Saylor, the AI would write 50 pages of security problems. “No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.” -Michael Saylor, Co-founder of Strategy. Saylor made global headlines in 2020 when he announced that Strategy would convert its treasury holding into BTC. At the time of publication, Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth around $63 billion. BitcoinTreasuries showed that Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings follows with 48,137 Bitcoin. Crypto exchanges use proof-of-reserves to verify that the company holds sufficient crypto reserves to cover customer deposits. Saylor believes the crypto industry has much to learn from the collapse of FTX and Mt. Gox crypto exchanges. He says proof of reserve isn’t the correct measure for institutions. Cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians began publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022. The move was to establish transparency and prove they hold enough digital assets to back customer deposits. Exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, and OKX, have adopted the transparency measure. Saylor also argued that proof-of-reserves often only shows one side of the picture — what the firm holds — and not what they owe. Powell says proof-of-reserves is pointless without including liabilities Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell noted that exchanges began sharing wallet addresses to prove the existence of users’ funds following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. He argued that a complete proof-of-reserve audit must include the sum of client liabilities; otherwise, it would be “pointless .” According to Powell, a complete proof of reserve audit must include user-verifiable cryptographic proof that each account was included in the sum and signatures proving the custodian’s control over the wallets. He called out industry players who have missed out on including accounts with negative balances. Kraken’s co-founder previously called out CoinMarketCap for sharing incomplete proof of reserves, as it lacked cryptographic proof of client balances and wallet control. Powell mentioned that reserves are not the list of wallets but assets minus liabilities. Powell also asked the media to refrain from overselling and misleading consumers with the transparency measures. He recommended they take time to understand the motive behind proof-of-reserves.

2025-05-27T08:03:33.000Z,"Whales Selling, Retail Buying: Is Bitcoin Price at $109k on Crossroads?","The post Whales Selling, Retail Buying: Is Bitcoin Price at $109k on Crossroads? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has made it to the center stage of the crypto market again, not just for its price hovering around the all-time high, but also for the strategic moves happening behind the scenes. Strategy recently purchased 4,020 BTC at an estimated cost of $427 million, fueling speculation about a potential leg up. However, the market seems divided by views. While price holds above $109k, investors are now eyeing the on-chain trends, liquidation data, and whale moves for clues on the next move. Smart Money vs. Retail Money? Recent insights from Glassnode reveal a crucial shift, where the greater than 10k BTC cohort (the market’s largest players) have moved into a net distribution zone with a score around 0.3. This is an obvious reversal from earlier in the year, when whales were leading accumulation during price rallies. Other cohorts like the 1k to 10k holders and the 100 to 1k BTC holders are also slowing down. While wallets with 10 to 100 BTC and sub-1 BTC continue their shopping spree. Further suggesting that leadership is moving downward on the wallet-size curve. This implies that the retail is buying the dip, while whales may be booking profits or analysing an incoming volatility. What Does the Liquidation Heat Map Say? The liquidation map by Kingfisher gives another layer of insight. With Bitcoin currently priced around $109k, there’s a significant buildup of long liquidation just below the $109k, $108.5k, and $107k mark. This indicates a potential liquidity grab to the downside that could be in the works, which could be driven by leveraged long positions at a risk of being wiped out. It is to note that, above the present BTC price, short liquidation levels seem to be weak, indicating less momentum for an upward squeeze. Correlating this with the distribution by large holders paints a picture where short-term downside volatility is not just possible, but is statistically favored. However, it is worth citing that such moves often reset leverage and provide stronger bases for continuation. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: Bitcoin price today is down 0.40% at $109,222.37, but still holding a 3.37% gain over the past week. The market cap sits at $2.17 trillion, slightly lower day-over-day, while 24-hour trading volume surged to $50.45 billion. The price ranged between $107,609.56 and $110,376.88, showing short-term volatility. We can expect a pullback before the next ATH, which could be around $113k.

2025-05-27T08:03:03.000Z,"Crypto Regulations in India 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in India 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News India’s cryptocurrency landscape in 2025 remains a mix of cautious regulation and rapid adoption. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not recognized as legal tender, they operate in a regulatory grey area with evolving tax and compliance frameworks. Over 107 million Indians now engage with crypto assets. Below is a timeline of key crypto regulation updates in India during 2025, Crypto Regulation India Timeline – 2025 May 22, 2025 : FSB Peer Review Preparation India gears up for the Financial Stability Board (FSB) review in October , aiming to align local crypto regulation with global regulatory standards . April 1, 2025 : SEBI Oversight Begins SEBI starts monitoring crypto tokens that resemble securities . A multi-agency regulatory model is proposed, including RBI, SEBI, and the Finance Ministry. February 13, 2025 : VDA Income Tax Amendment Bill Introduced The bill expands the scope of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) to include NFTs and undisclosed income . However, the 30% tax rate remains unchanged . February 10, 2025 : Crypto Exchanges Declared Reporting Entities Exchanges, wallets, and even mining pools are categorized as “reporting entities.” They must report all transactions to tax authorities under the new AML guidelines. February 1, 2025 : Union Budget 2025-26 Highlights FM Nirmala Sitharaman mandates crypto exchanges to report buyer/seller details under Section 285BAA of the Income Tax Act, enhancing transaction transparency. Crypto Tax in India – 2025 (Fact-Checked) As of now, no official reduction has been made to the 30% tax on crypto gains or the 1% TDS , despite industry demands. 1. For Investors and Traders Flat 30% Tax on gains from crypto sales, swaps, or gifts. No deductions allowed except for cost of acquisition. 1% TDS on transfers above ₹10,000 (buyer deducts and remits). No loss set-off or carry-forward permitted. Example: Buy BTC at ₹2.72 lakh → Sell at ₹8.72 lakh → ₹6 lakh profit → Tax = ₹1.8 lakh + TDS = ₹6,000 2. For Crypto Companies & Exchanges KYC/AML compliance is mandatory. 1% TDS to be collected and remitted on every qualifying user transaction. Transaction reporting to tax authorities under PMLA and IT laws. Category Tax Rate TDS Example Investors 30% 1% if >₹10k ₹50k profit → ₹15k tax + ₹500 TDS Traders 30% 1% if >₹10k Taxed as business income Companies NA 1% collected ₹10L transaction → ₹10k TDS Crypto Adoption in India (2025 Snapshot) Active Users : Over 107.3 million Indians (7.37% of population) hold or trade crypto. Revenue Forecast : India’s crypto market is projected to hit $6.4 billion by year-end. Exchanges : Platforms like CoinDCX, CoinSwitch, and Mudrex offer access to over 500 tokens. Growth Drivers : Rising financial inclusion, smartphone penetration, and blockchain innovation. Government Holdings : No official disclosure yet; policies prioritize transparency and user safety. Conclusion India’s crypto regulation in 2025 reflects a delicate balance between enabling innovation and enforcing oversight. With strict taxes (30% + 1% TDS) and real-time transaction reporting, the government is creating a compliant ecosystem without enforcing an outright ban. As the FSB review nears, clarity in crypto regulation India could open new doors for mass adoption and position the country at the forefront of the $7 trillion global digital economy . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-27T08:00:42.000Z,"Ethereum Above $2,500: Here’s Why Analysts Think $3,000 May Be Next","Ethereum has maintained a position above $2,500 following a mild retracement from its recent high above $2,700 last week. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,564, reflecting a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours. While the broader crypto market remains in a bullish structure, largely driven by Bitcoin’s sharp upward movement, Ethereum’s relative momentum appears more tempered, raising questions among traders and analysts about its current positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Its Footing: Bulls Prepare for Another Push Retail Quiet, Institutions Watchful Despite the price remaining above key levels, some analysts believe Ethereum has yet to fully capture the broader market’s enthusiasm. One such observation was presented by CryptoQuant’s analyst Burak Kesmeci, who noted that retail activity around Ethereum remains low compared to previous cycles. This could suggest that Ethereum’s rally is still in its early stages, with potential upside left unpriced by the market. The absence of retail enthusiasm, which historically coincided with local tops, may signal that Ethereum has not yet reached a peak for this cycle. Kesmeci’s analysis highlighted a notable shift in retail engagement around Ethereum. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 bull run, the analyst pointed out that earlier rallies were often accompanied by sharp spikes in retail trading frequency. However, during the current cycle, retail interest has been largely muted, even as Bitcoin surged from $16,000 to over $111,000. While ETH saw a brief uptick in retail activity in December 2024, that momentum faded quickly amid broader market reactions to geopolitical developments, including renewed tariff tensions. The analyst concluded that the market may still be in a phase of accumulation, as the typical retail-driven euphoria has yet to materialize. In this scenario, Ethereum could benefit from increased participation in the coming months, particularly if macroeconomic sentiment stabilizes. The potential for delayed retail entry suggests that Ethereum’s current rally might only be at its midpoint rather than nearing a local top. Ethereum Technical Setups Suggest Bullish Continuation On the technical front, several market analysts continue to hold a positive outlook for ETH. A pseudonymous analyst known as Crypto Busy posted on X that the asset’s monthly chart remains structurally intact, referencing a previous key resistance level near $1,410. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout? According to the post, Ethereum’s breakout above this long-standing barrier has turned it into support, replicating a setup that historically preceded major rallies. Further reinforcing this perspective, analyst Michaël van de Poppe emphasized the importance of Ethereum’s price action near the $2,400 level. He noted that this zone offered a strong buying opportunity and believes that if Ethereum can successfully retest and hold above this threshold, a move toward $3,000 could follow. According to van de Poppe, such a breakout would signal the beginning of a new bullish phase for ETH.

2025-05-27T08:00:40.000Z,"Bitcoin Security: Michael Saylor Issues Dangerous Warning on Proof-of-Reserves for Institutional Crypto","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Security: Michael Saylor Issues Dangerous Warning on Proof-of-Reserves for Institutional Crypto In the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, few voices carry as much weight as Michael Saylor, the executive chair of MicroStrategy (now Strategy). Known for his unwavering bullish stance on Bitcoin, Saylor often sparks significant discussion with his views. His latest comments, delivered at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, have once again grabbed headlines, this time focusing on a controversial topic: on-chain proof-of-reserves for institutional players. And his take? It’s a “bad idea” that introduces significant Crypto Security Risks . Why Michael Saylor Calls On-Chain Proof-of-Reserves a “Bad Idea” Michael Saylor didn’t mince words when discussing the practice of institutions publicly disclosing their wallet addresses as a form of Proof-of-Reserves . While the concept of PoR gained traction after events like the FTX collapse to foster transparency and trust, Saylor argues that the on-chain method, specifically for large entities holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin , creates more problems than it solves. According to reports from the conference, Saylor highlighted several key concerns: Increased Attack Surface: Publicly known wallet addresses become prime targets for malicious actors. Knowing where significant reserves are held provides hackers with a clear target, potentially increasing the risk of sophisticated attacks. Privacy Concerns: While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, linking a large, known institution to specific wallet addresses can compromise operational privacy and potentially reveal strategic movements or holdings. Vulnerability for All Parties: Saylor suggested that this exposure isn’t just risky for the institution publishing the data. It could also make their custodians, exchanges they interact with, and even their investors more vulnerable indirectly. Limited True Proof: Saylor has argued in the past that simply showing assets in a wallet isn’t sufficient proof without simultaneously proving liabilities. An institution could show large holdings but have even larger debts against them. This stance positions Saylor against a trend some in the industry see as essential for rebuilding trust, particularly among users interacting with centralized exchanges and custodians handling significant Institutional Crypto holdings. Understanding Proof-of-Reserves: The Goal vs. The Method Let’s take a step back. What is Proof-of-Reserves , and why did it become a hot topic? In essence, PoR is an audit method to verify that a custodian (like an exchange or financial institution) holds the assets they claim to hold on behalf of their customers. The goal is transparency and solvency assurance. Following major collapses in the crypto space, many called for mandatory PoR audits. The idea was simple: if platforms could definitively prove they held user funds 1:1, confidence would be restored. However, there are different ways to implement PoR: On-Chain Proof (Saylor’s Critique): Publishing a list of wallet addresses and signing messages from those wallets to prove ownership, coupled with a list of user balances (often anonymized using Merkle Trees). Third-Party Audits: Engaging an independent accounting firm to verify holdings and liabilities off-chain. Hybrid Approaches: Combining some level of on-chain verification with traditional auditing methods. Saylor’s criticism specifically targets the *on-chain publication* aspect, particularly for large, visible entities like those involved in Institutional Crypto . He’s not necessarily against proving reserves in principle, but the method of doing so by exposing addresses is where he sees significant Crypto Security Risks . Institutional Crypto and Unique Challenges Why might on-chain PoR be different for an individual user holding Bitcoin versus a large institution or custodian managing billions? The scale and complexity are vastly different. Institutions: Hold much larger amounts, making them bigger targets. Often use complex custody solutions, potentially involving multiple addresses, cold storage, and hot wallets. Face stricter regulatory scrutiny, and revealing too much operational detail could be problematic. Manage significant liabilities that aren’t easily verifiable on-chain. For Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy, managing a large corporate treasury holding like theirs requires a high level of security discretion. Exposing their entire wallet structure could be seen as irresponsible from a security standpoint. Is There a Safer Way to Achieve Transparency for Institutional Crypto? Saylor’s warning raises a critical question: how can institutions provide assurance to their users and the market without exposing themselves to undue Crypto Security Risks ? The industry is still grappling with the best practices. Possible alternatives or complementary methods include: Regular, Independent Audits: Engaging reputable accounting firms to conduct comprehensive audits of both assets and liabilities. While not real-time on-chain proof, this is a standard financial practice. Attestations: Less formal than a full audit, an attestation confirms the accuracy of management’s assertions about their reserves at a specific point in time. Enhanced Internal Controls: Focusing on robust internal security measures and compliance frameworks that reduce the risk of mismanagement or loss of funds. Selective Proofs: Perhaps proving ownership of a *portion* of reserves or using more sophisticated cryptographic methods that don’t require revealing all addresses. The debate highlights the tension between the crypto ethos of radical transparency and the practical realities of managing large-scale, secure operations in a high-value target environment. For Bitcoin holders and those interacting with Institutional Crypto platforms, understanding these nuances is key. Conclusion: Balancing Transparency and Security in the Age of Bitcoin Michael Saylor ‘s recent comments serve as a potent reminder that while transparency is vital in the crypto space, the method matters, especially for large institutions. He argues that blindly pursuing on-chain Proof-of-Reserves for entities holding significant amounts of Bitcoin introduces unacceptable Crypto Security Risks that could harm the very users it aims to protect. The industry must continue to explore secure and effective ways for Institutional Crypto players to demonstrate solvency and build trust, perhaps leaning more towards robust independent audits and advanced cryptographic techniques rather than simply publishing wallet addresses for the world to see. Saylor’s warning encourages a more cautious and strategic approach to transparency in the face of evolving digital threats.

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.I asked @saylor if @MicroStrategy has any plans to publish on-chain proof of reservesHis answer will SHOCK you“It’s a bad idea.”- Security Risk- Irrelevant without also having Big 4-audited liabilitiesCheck it out ? pic.twitter.com/tIxUckgbEp— Mitchell ✝️??

They can also confirm that other entities, such as crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds, hold the required amount of crypto for the funds.Saylor acknowledged the industry had a lot to learn from the collapses of crypto exchanges FTX and Mt. Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions.“No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.”“Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.”Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapseMany crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110KCrypto exchanges Binance, Kraken and OKX and crypto asset manager Bitwise are among the industry players that have adopted the transparency measure.However, Saylor noted that proof-of-reserves often only show one side of the picture — what the company holds — and not what they owe.Source: Mitchell AskewSaylor’s Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 576,230 Bitcoin worth $62.6 million on its balance sheet, followed by Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings, which holds 48,137 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.More than 110 publicly traded companies worldwide have purchased and hold Bitcoin.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-says-proof-of-reserves-bad-idea?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world.Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added. On May 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta was delaying the rollout of its flagship AI LLM, Llama 4 “Behemoth.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-ai-boss-ai-lacks-intelligent-behavior-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days.Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her.The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.”CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit.Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer.Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody.He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28.Alleged victim shares ordealTeofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.”Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector.

You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe.

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC.

However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea’s biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

But by the 2025 election, it had emerged as a key policy issue, with major candidates pushing for institutionalization and financial productization in response to the investment realities faced by young people,” Park from Blockchain Research Center said.South Korea is one of the world’s largest crypto markets.

In this election, older generations are entering the digital sphere, accelerating calls for regulated investment vehicles, such as ETFs.“Things have changed a lot. There were even questions and answers about virtual assets during the presidential debates, and related discussions seem to be much more active.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption.

In May, such tokens totaled $4.9 billion.  Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures. The data shows that $1.4 billion in tokens will be released through a “cliff unlock,” while $1.9 billion will be emitted through a “linear unlock.” Cliff unlocks release a large portion or all of the vested tokens simultaneously, while linear unlocks emit crypto assets gradually. Largest crypto token unlocks in JuneAmong the largest token unlocks in June is Metars Genesis (MRS), a non-fungible token (NFT) project that will release $193 million worth of tokens on June 21 to fund an artificial intelligence partnership. Since March, MRS has released 10 million tokens per month, with nearly $1 billion in tokens unlocked so far.Sui (SUI) is scheduled to unlock 44 million tokens worth about $160 million on June 1. The tokens will go to the Mysten Labs treasury, early contributors and the community reserve. The largest portion, valued at more than $70 million, is allocated to Series B investors.To date, Sui has unlocked 3.3 billion tokens valued at over $12 billion, roughly 33% of its total supply.

Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.Source: Cyvers AlertZero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023.Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain cryptoAdvanced form of address poisoningA zero-value transfer is considered an evolution of address poisoning, a tactic where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that resembles a victim’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. Custom addresses with similar starting and ending characters can also be combined with zero-value transfers.Related: Industry exec sounds alarm on Ledger phishing letter delivered by USPSThreat growing across blockchainsA January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024.

After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-24T20:26:01.000Z,"Bitcoin inflows projected to reach $420B in 2026 — Bitwise","Key takeaways:Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
