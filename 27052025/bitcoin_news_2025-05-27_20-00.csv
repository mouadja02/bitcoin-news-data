Bitcoin ETF demand continues to rise among institutional investors US spot Bitcoin ETFs shattered records in their debut year, and 2025 is shaping up to deliver a similar performance. As reported by Cointelegraph , May is shaping up to be a record month for spot ETFs, which saw more than $1.5 billion in net inflows over just two days. BlackRock’s IBIT has driven much of that growth, posting consistent inflows since April 9 , including multiple days with net buys topping $500 million. Net inflows indicate that asset managers are buying shares of the Bitcoin ETFs to meet growing investor demand. Using the early success of gold ETFs as a benchmark, asset manager Bitwise recently projected that Bitcoin fund inflows could reach $120 billion this year and more than double to $300 billion by 2026. In terms of net inflows, Bitcoin ETFs vastly outperformed gold ETFs in their debut year. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years.

Onchain indicators enter overheated territory, suggesting prolonged profit-taking from BTC investors. Bitcoin (BTC) showed strength on May 27, briefly tagging $110,700 after a strong US equities market open and the Trump Media and Technology Group’s announcement that it would raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets. US National Financial Conditions Index. Source: Ecoinometrics Ecoinometrics mentioned that within four weeks, liquidity has returned, creating a supportive macroeconomic environment for risk assets like Bitcoin. The newsletter noted, “That’s the kind of macro backdrop where Bitcoin thrives. Bitcoin’s rally to new highs didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.” With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity. As illustrated below, if Bitcoin breaches $115,000, over $7 billion in short positions could get liquidated, triggering a cascading effect that pushes prices higher. Bitcoin liquidation map.

The Supply in Profit Market Bands metric tracks how much of the circulating BTC supply is currently in profit. As of late May 2025, this figure has surged to 19.4 million BTC, nearing historical extremes and entering the “Overheated Zone.” Previously, BTC prices tested this zone on Dec. 17, 2025, which was followed by a price correction to $93,000 from $107,000.

Table of Contents Hyperliquid crypto enters price discovery as HYPE outpaces major altcoins What drives the Hyperliquid price? James Wynn’s $1.25B position boosts trust in Hyperliquid wallet Hyperliquid price prediction: Hyperliquid token may face resistance Hyperliquid crypto enters price discovery as HYPE outpaces major altcoins In a market where major altcoins have largely traded sideways through most of May, Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) has quietly built its own bullish momentum. HYPE reached an all-time high of $39.93 on May 26, rising more than 326% from its Apr. 7 low of $9.36. The climb unfolded gradually, with the price crossing $28 by May 21 and pushing past $30 during the final stretch of the month. As of May 27, HYPE is trading around $38.5. While that reflects a 4.5% dip from the recent peak, it still marks a 47% gain over the past seven days. HYPE crypto price chart | Source: crypto.news Trading activity has remained strong, with 24-hour volume hovering around $345 million. Hyperliquid’s market cap now stands at approximately $12.5 billion, placing it as the 11th largest crypto asset by market value. Fueling this rally is a noticeable improvement in key on-chain metrics. Open interest hit a record high of $10.1 billion, and daily trading fees reached $5.6 million on May 26, highlighting increased usage and engagement. Hyperliquid reached new all-time highs again: + Open interest: $10.1B + 24h fees: $5.6M + USDC TVL: $3.5B Welcome to all new members of the ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/AoWVPRINGA — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) May 26, 2025 The recent integration of USD Coin ( USDC ) as the main settlement asset has also added more depth to the ecosystem. With $3.5 billion now locked on the platform, confidence appears to be growing among both institutional participants and retail users. Let’s look at what Hyperliquid does, why it’s gaining traction among users, and what current price predictions suggest about its potential path forward. What drives the Hyperliquid price? Hyperliquid, launched in November 2024, runs on a custom layer 1 blockchain architecture designed to support fully on-chain trading of perpetual futures. Unlike many decentralized exchanges that rely on off-chain order matching and on-chain settlement, Hyperliquid processes all transactions, orders, and trades directly on-chain. The system is anchored by two main components: HyperBFT and HyperEVM. HyperBFT, a consensus protocol influenced by Meta’s LibraBFT, is built to handle throughput of up to 2 million transactions per second. It finalizes blocks in under a second and can process as many as 100,000 orders per second. HyperEVM ensures compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine , giving developers the ability to deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts while benefiting from faster execution and lower transaction fees. The platform offers perpetual futures trading across several major crypto assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), Solana ( SOL ), and Sui ( SUI ). Traders can use up to 50x leverage and are not required to hold the underlying asset to open a position. New users onboard through wallet-based login, and the exchange does not conduct know-your-customer checks. This model stands in contrast to most centralized platforms and may raise regulatory questions in certain jurisdictions. In addition to derivatives, Hyperliquid enables spot trading through its HIP-1 token standard, which is structurally similar to Ethereum’s ERC-20 . Token listings come with relatively high costs, a measure aimed at reducing spam and filtering out low-quality projects. The protocol also includes a Vaults feature that allows users to allocate capital to traders or algorithmic strategies in a non-custodial way. All vault performance data is public, and fund movements occur entirely on-chain. Hyperliquid has stated that it has not taken any venture capital funding. Positioning the absence of VC involvement as a strategic choice, the team says it is focused on building long-term infrastructure rather than chasing short-term token performance. James Wynn’s $1.25B position boosts trust in Hyperliquid wallet Hyperliquid’s growing presence in the DeFi space is backed by a series of tangible developments that have unfolded over the past few months. On May 23, Hyperliquid Labs submitted two public comment letters to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in response to the agency’s request for feedback on the future of perpetual futures and 24/7 crypto markets. The letters called for regulatory approaches that support decentralized infrastructure while maintaining financial safeguards, marking the first time Hyperliquid participated in policy discussions at this level. The market reacted swiftly. HYPE rose 15% that day, according to CoinMarketCap data, signaling investor confidence in the platform’s long-term regulatory position. Infrastructure has also remained central to Hyperliquid’s momentum. The February rollout of HyperEVM introduced Ethereum compatibility, enabling smart contracts from the Ethereum ecosystem to run natively on Hyperliquid. This upgrade paved the way for new integrations, including support for Tether ( USDT ), expanding the platform’s stablecoin functionality. As a result, the ecosystem now allows for more flexible trading strategies, smoother interoperability, and easier capital movement across networks. High-volume traders have taken notice. Earlier last week, derivatives trader James Wynn opened a $1.25 billion Bitcoin long position on Hyperliquid, one of the largest on-chain derivatives trades recorded to date, showing that the network can handle institutional-scale activity without performance issues. You might also like: The full breakdown of James Wynn’s $1B Bitcoin positions — and how it all fell apart Retail interest has picked up as well. Throughout May, social media posts have speculated about a second token airdrop. With 38% of the HYPE supply still unallocated, users have begun tracking on-chain signals for eligibility. The speculation builds on the original airdrop from November 2024, which distributed HYPE to early users. Rising wallet activity and cross-chain transactions this month suggest renewed engagement from both first-time participants and returning users. Hyperliquid price prediction: Hyperliquid token may face resistance Hyperliquid’s strong momentum in May has pushed the token into price discovery territory. On the HYPE/BTC weekly chart, the asset is now trading at all-time highs relative to Bitcoin — a rare position for any altcoin during a period when many others are still struggling to break through resistance. https://twitter.com/MetamateDaz/status/1926792832863379662 Pushing higher from this point presents more complexity. One perspective, shared by Defi Monk, a researcher at Messari, suggests that Hyperliquid may be approaching saturation in terms of retail trading activity. There’s actually one $HYPE bear case I see very few people mention. The idea that Hyperliquid is close to maxing out retail taker flow onchain and that getting from 20% of Binance’s volume share to 50% will be a much harder path than getting from 0 to 20%. This is because… https://t.co/Iw4c7akhxb — MONK (@defi_monk) May 18, 2025 According to him, the platform’s growth from zero to capturing 20% of Binance’s volume share happened during a unique window in the market. Expanding further into high-frequency and institutional territory, however, may prove slower. “Getting from 20% of Binance’s volume share to 50% will be a much harder path,” he explains, pointing to latency requirements and the challenges of attracting professional trading flow. At the same time, he notes that Hyperliquid’s current position is difficult to displace. Early on, competition was limited. Now, any new entrant must compete directly with Hyperliquid’s infrastructure, depth of liquidity, and established user base. As he puts it, “Now the bar is Hyperliquid itself.” Going forward, the protocol’s trajectory may depend less on rapid growth and more on how effectively it defends its position against emerging platforms like GTE_XYZ and others. In terms of price action, near-term technical models offer a more cautious view. Forecasts from Coincodex suggest HYPE could decline more than 22% over the next 30 days, targeting a price of $28.50 by June 26. Despite the projected correction, broader sentiment remains positive. The Fear & Greed Index is holding at 74, indicating elevated market appetite, while the sentiment indicator stays in bullish territory. On a longer time frame, projections from Coincodex outline a wider range of outcomes. For 2025, the model places HYPE’s maximum price at $36.86, which sits near current levels and implies limited upside in the short term. For 2026, the model projects a potential high of $94.85, which would represent a gain of over 150%. Estimates continue to climb through 2029, with the upper bound reaching $145.28. Price forecasts, regardless of how data-driven they appear, always involve a degree of uncertainty. The DeFi space moves quickly, and changes in regulation, platform security, or user behavior can shift token performance without warning. Traders considering exposure to HYPE should treat it like any other high-volatility digital asset. As always, trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Mara Holdings produces up to 10% of blocks due to the high efficiency of its mining operations. The corporate miner is among the top 10 pools and the second-largest US-based mining pool following Foundry Digital. Mara Holdings produces new BTC both through its native pool, and through Foundry.USA, receiving regular inflows of BTC. The corporate miner holds 10,765 BTC in its mining-connected wallet for a constantly growing treasury. The mining operations were also the basis of Mara Holding’s leveraged buying. Mara is the second-biggest BTC holder after Strategy (MSTR), with a total of 48,137 BTC . The fund has an extremely low-cost basis for its BTC treasury, fulfilling the purpose of tapping value. The company increased its holdings by 174% in the past five quarters on a mix of mining and sporadic acquisitions. The success of Mara showed miners were now immune to panic-based capitulation, even during BTC downturns. Miners continue to produce BTC under stressful conditions but retain most of the coins. BTC miners hold over 1.8M coins, some of which have been used as the basis for corporate treasuries. MARA shares reach a one-month peak MARA shares recovered to a one-month peak, gaining more rapidly in the past day. MARA traded at $16.34, tracking the BTC expansion in May. Interest in MARA also increased as traders focused on companies carrying Bitcoin treasuries. MARA increased its mindshare on social media, for its unique position as a scalable block producer and direct BTC buyer. The companies also gained exposure during the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas. MARA also achieved the biggest daily gains, though other corporate miner stocks were in the green. Most corporate miner stocks tracked the BTC market, with net gains for the past month. US-based mining corporations were among the big winners in the past month, as BTC recovered above $100,000. | Source: CompaniesMarketCap The shares of Mara Holdings have reflected both its mining results and the robust BTC treasury. However, Mara Holdings has not announced new acquisitions and has not competed with Strategy to acquire more BTC through leveraged instruments. Despite this, the holding’s approach is more sustainable, supported by its mining operations, locations, and the ability to pivot to data centers. The company expanded to a total of 17 data centers as of May 2025. The company has highly efficient mining operations, accessing 1.1 GW in energy, with the option to expand to 1.7 GW. BTC mining costs are estimated at $91,950 per coin, though Mara Holdings has achieved a lower production price due to its early investment and access to cheap energy.

2025-05-27T17:30:17.000Z,"Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin’s Rise From $77,000 To $110,000 Reveals Why The Rally Is Not Over","A prominent crypto analyst who accurately forecasted the Bitcoin (BTC) surge from $77,000 to over $110,000 has shared a renewed analysis, declaring that the flagship cryptocurrency’s bull rally is far from over. Backed by technical analysis and macroeconomic fundamentals, the analyst claims that Bitcoin is poised for a further breakout , potentially reaching $117,000 to $120,000 in the coming weeks. The Bitcoin Bull Run Is Far From Over At the heart of crypto analyst Doctor Profit’s renewed bullish outlook is the emergence of a Golden Cross on the Bitcoin chart . The market expert disclosed that the Golden Cross pattern, a rare and powerful bullish signal, has an accuracy rate of approximately 87.8% when it occurs on higher time frames. According to the Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything , historically, this technical pattern is a reliable indicator that has only appeared twice in the past 24 months, and each time it has preceded massive price rallies . In October 2023, a Golden Cross preceded a 170% surge from $27,000 to $73,000. Then again, in October 2024, it signaled a move from $63,000 to $109,000, delivering an impressive 73% gain. Now, in May 2025, the chart pattern has appeared once more, but this time when Bitcoin was priced just above $110,000. Doctor Profit emphasized that these past rallies did not take months to materialize. Rather, they began almost immediately after the Golden Cross signal appeared and then accelerated over to a 3-5 month window. Historically, during such periods, BTC has delivered gains of about 70% and 170%, which is approximately between 3.5% to 8.5% per week. If this bullish trend repeats, it could push the cryptocurrency well beyond current price levels. Notably, the emergence of this Golden Cross pattern is the primary reason why Doctor Profit believes that the Bitcoin bull rally is far from over . With this technical formation, the analyst has boldly forecasted that BTC will reach $113,000 this week, representing a 3.71% gain from its current price of around $108,954. ETFs, Liquidity Clusters, And Institutional Demand To Fuel Bitcoin’s Rise On a structural level, Doctor Profit highlights a major liquidity cluster at $113,000. With Bitcoin already approaching this level and with strong momentum , the analyst expects this target to be hit within days. However, this isn’t the final stop. Since Bitcoin was trading at $77,000, Doctor Profit revealed that he has consistently held a target of $117,000 to $120,000. Now, with the Golden Cross confirmed and market conditions reinforcing the move, he is doubling down on this forecast. Behind chart patterns, Doctor Profit also believes that Bitcoin ETFs and the broader macro environment are playing a key role in shaping this cryptocurrency’s bullish thesis. The analyst points to an overwhelming surge in demand through Spot Bitcoin ETFs, noting that inflows are now 9X higher than the daily amount of BTC being mined . Notably, this imbalance between supply and demand is creating powerful upward pressure on the price. Adding further weight to the bullish case is the continued accumulation by MicroStrategy and other institutional players. These entities are not only buying BTC in bulk but also reducing the amount circulating on exchanges.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rally-is-not-over/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Doctor Profit|golden cross|Spot Bitcoin ETFs",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T17:02:47.000Z,"Bitcoin price lags Stock-to-Flow as $260K BTC prediction holds firm","Despite a steady climb past $110,000, Bitcoin ( BTC ) remains meaningfully below its projected valuation according to the long-term Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model popularized by pseudonymous analyst PlanB. The model’s latest 463-day forecast suggests Bitcoin should currently be trading at approximately $260,031, a more than 130% premium over its current price. Current Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model. Source. Bitbo For those unfamiliar, stock-to-flow is a ratio derived from the total existing supply of Bitcoin (stock) divided by the new issuance (flow) entering circulation through mining. It is, in essence, a measure of absolute scarcity. The orange trajectory on the model indicates that Bitcoin’s price historically gravitates toward the S2F curve over time, albeit with volatility. The closer Bitcoin tracks to this model, the more confidently one might view BTC as behaving like a commodity with predictable scarcity-driven value appreciation, akin to gold or silver. Yet at the moment, Bitcoin is trailing the model’s predicted path. This divergence has raised eyebrows but is not unprecedented. Historically, periods of underperformance versus the S2F baseline have often preceded parabolic surges, as seen during the 2013 and 2020 bull runs. Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model. Source. Bitbo The current discrepancy between the S2F model and actual price suggests a significant asymmetry in sentiment versus on-chain fundamentals. While skeptics might argue that Bitcoin is overheating, proponents of S2F view this lag as latent potential, evidence that the market has yet to fully price in the asset’s post-halving supply dynamics. https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1925464216175087957 Why does this matter for BTC? Because stock-to-flow is not only a technical model, but a proxy for behavioral dynamics. When Bitcoin trades below its modeled valuation, it often signals a period of consolidation, disbelief, or macro headwinds. But in the past, such gaps have presaged major upside moves. In psychological terms, these dislocations can be seen as moments of latent potential energy, times when market participants are failing to fully integrate the implications of emergent scarcity. This is especially relevant in a world where sovereign actors, institutions, and public companies are rapidly acquiring Bitcoin, not merely as an asset, but as a hedge against systemic fragility. Trump Media’s $2.5 billion Bitcoin treasury announcement is only the most recent example of this structural rotation.

2025-05-27T17:00:21.000Z,"Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone — Chartist Predicts Sharp Drop Ahead","Dogecoin slipped toward the lower end of its month-long range on Tuesday as independent chartist Quantum Ascent delivered a granular breakdown of why he believes the meme-coin is part-way through a corrective cascade that could end in the high-teen-cent zone. At mid-afternoon in Europe the token hovered at $0.228, nearly 12% below its May 11 peak and nursing modest intraday losses. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone Reviewing the daily chart, the analyst rewound to the explosive move that began on May 8 and produced a 50% three-session surge: “Last time we checked in over here on May 8, when we got this big green candle, we said, guys, looks like we’re kicking off our fifth microwave here,” he reminded viewers. His initial upside projection had been a modest 2.36 Fibonacci extension, yet Dogecoin “actually went up much higher,” a sign, he added, of strong retail momentum but also of a pattern that now looks finished. Quantum Ascent has since migrated his wave counts to show that the thrust was merely the fifth sub-wave inside a larger first-wave advance. “We’re in the middle of an ABC as we speak… these blue waves are going to move over to here,” he said, redrawing the labels to mark the ongoing retracement. In Elliott-wave parlance the C-leg must at least equal the A-leg, and the presenter converted that rule into arithmetic: “Eighteen-point-eight per cent from there… that’s one of our targets, right around 20.5 cents.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic Deeper penetration is not only possible but statistically common, he argued, because “oftentimes it makes it down into this third or fourth wave.” Measuring from the early-May low to the mid-May top, he plotted the 0.500, 0.618 and 0.702 retracements — a band stretching roughly from 19.5 cents to 17 cents — and called it “the logical zone for a first-and-second-wave reset.” A shallower halt at the 0.382, around 21.8 cents, would in his view be “a pretty shallow correction.” One attempt to break higher has already stalled in what he labelled the “danger zone” between the 0.618 and 0.786 retracements: “We took a stab to break through, but we didn’t close… we wicked above it, ended up right there at the 702, the rejection, and now it’s kind of rolling over again.” That failure leaves a nearby trigger level: “We break this low here at 21 cents, then we’re for sure seeing 20.5 cents.” The tape action, he added, resembles a Wyckoff re-accumulation structure: “Looks like honestly a form of Wyckoff and we’re building the sign of strength right here before we take off.” Yet the bullish pay-off, if it comes, likely lies several weeks ahead. The correction underway marks “a macro two that we’re working on right now,” he said, emphasising that the subsequent third wave would be decisive: “Macro wave threes — those are the daddies. Those are the big ones. That’s where we’re really going to get some juice.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens Macro context tempers any near-term enthusiasm. Bitcoin — whose own fifth-wave top arrived sooner and overshot its prior cycle high — has already rolled into an ABC of its own, and Quantum Ascent expects altcoins to “settle down” alongside the bellwether. “Whether it goes quickly in a C-wave or we just kind of keep meandering, we’re going to have to wait and see,” he concluded, urging followers to watch volume profiles and closing levels rather than intraday wicks. As always, Elliott-wave counts remain interpretative rather than predictive, and traders should align any positioning with their personal risk limits. Dogecoin retains the eighth-largest market capitalisation in crypto, but elevated volatility means even minor price gaps can translate into double-digit percentage swings. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

2025-05-27T16:55:41.000Z,"Coinbase Faces Class Action Lawsuit Over COIN Stock Drop Linked to Data and Regulatory Breaches","An investor is suing Coinbase, accusing the US-based crypto exchange of violating securities laws and causing its stock to drop as a result. Brady Nessler filed a class action lawsuit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on behalf of any individuals and entities who acquired publicly traded Coinbase securities between April 14th, 2021 and May 14th, 2025. Nessler’s legal team alleges the exchange made materially false and misleading statements regarding its subsidiary CB Payments Limited (CBPL). Last year, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed a £3.5 million fine ($4.5 million) on CBPL for allegedly onboarding and providing e-money services to 13,416 high-risk customers. News of the fine caused the price of Coinbase’s common stock to fall by $13.52 per share, or 5.52%, according to the lawsuit. Nessler’s suit also points to the exchange’s recent data breach. Coinbase says criminals bribed a small group of overseas customer support agents to copy the data of less than 1% of the firm’s monthly transacting users. A recent filing with the Maine Attorney General’s Office indicates the breach impacted 69,461 people. The exchange notes that hacked information includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, masked social security numbers (the last 4 digits only), masked bank-account numbers, some bank account identifiers, government-ID images, account data and limited corporate data. Coinbase learned about the hack after receiving an email earlier this month demanding a $20 million BTC payoff in exchange for not releasing the illegally obtained info. The company refused to give in to the hackers’ demand and estimates it will pay $180 million to $400 million in remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements. Coinbase’s stock fell by more than 7% on the day the news of the breach broke, but it quickly recovered later that week. Nessler’s suit also names Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong and Alesia Haas, the firm’s chief financial officer, as defendants. Nessler is asking the court to award damages to class members and further relief as deemed appropriate.

2025-05-27T16:22:15.000Z,"Trump Coin Price Prediction: Post-Dinner Silence Has Traders on Edge – Is Something Brewing?","The Trump Coin price has held steady in the past 24 hours, keeping to $12.82 as the cryptocurrency market loses by 1.5% today. TRUMP has been on a downwards curve since President Donald Trump hosted a dinner for the coin’s 220 biggest holders on May 22, with the meme token down by 2% in a week and by 13.5%. In fact, the Trump Coin price has suffered an 82.5% decline since reaching an ATH of $73.43 on January 19, the day before Trump’s inauguration. But given the President’s taste for self-promotion, there remains every chance that the coin could witness numerous more pumps in the coming months, even if its long-term trajectory isn’t promising. Trump Coin Price Prediction: Post-Dinner Silence Has Traders on Edge – Is Something Brewing? Looking at TRUMP’s chart today, we see that it’s not too far away from hitting a bottom. For example, its 30-period average (orange) is about to drop below the 200-period (blue), signalling a selloff that should then clear the way for renewed gains. Source: TradingView Likewise, TRUMP’s relative strength index (purple) has fallen below 50 in recent days and looks like it’s on its way to 30, or lower. Again, this indicates further losses in next few days, while also hinting that a rebound is on the horizon. Trump Coin’s trading volume has declined considerably in recent days, with today’s reading of $560 million representing its lowest level since mid-April. This suggests that interest in the token has waned since the conclusion of the aforementioned dinner on May 22, which included such attendees as Tron’s Justin Sun and former NBA player Lamar Odom . Trump Crypto Dinner！ #TrumpCoin @GetTrumpMemes pic.twitter.com/9ZredNjOEu — Sheldon (@sheldonbitmart) May 23, 2025 It’s likely that the next few days could see the Trump Coin price drop as low as $12, yet the fact that it has Donald Trump backing should help it to rise again. While Trump’s involvement in a meme coin has attracted vociferous criticism from his opponents , it also means that it can probably look forward to other future pumps. So in the medium-term, we can expect more rallies, with the Trump Coin price potentially on course to reach $20 by the end of Q3. Another Altcoin with Huge Potential in 2025 Of course, skeptics may suggest that TRUMP won’t have much of a life when Donald Trump leaves office, in which case traders may prefer to look at alternatives already. While finding new tokens before they surge can be tricky, looking at successful presales can be one way of narrowing the field. This is because presales with strong enough momentum can lead to big rallies when the corresponding tokens list. And one presale coin with good momentum right now is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL), an ERC-20 token that bases its deflationary tokenomics on Bitcoin’s growth. At $125K BTC, BTCBULL will trigger its first token burn. Less supply. Same hype. The charge is on! pic.twitter.com/O218IzuwsE — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 27, 2025 BTCBULL has now raised $6.4 million in its increasingly popular sale, with investors seemingly bullish about the coin’s future potential. The token will have a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, with the coin set to burn a portion of its supply whenever Bitcoin (BTC) itself reaches price milestones. This will begin when BTC touches $125,000 for the first time, and will continue with each additional $25,000. Not only that, but the Bitcoin Bull protocol will host airdrops whenever Bitcoin itself reaches a new $50,000 milestone, beginning with $150,000. And what’s exciting about this is that the airdrops will provide BTCBULL holders with Bitcoin. This could make Bitcoin Bull a very profitable token to hold, particularly when owners can stake the coin. Investors can join its sale at the Bitcoin Bull website , where BTCBULL costs $0.002535. This price will rise every few days until the sale ends, at which point BTCBULL will list on exchanges.

2025-05-27T16:13:03.000Z,"Strive secures $750M PIPE funding to launch Bitcoin treasury","Strive Asset Management has secured $750 million in PIPE funding to launch its Bitcoin treasury strategy, with an option to raise an additional $750 million through warrants. According to a May 27 announcement , the financing was arranged in partnership with Asset Entities as part of an ongoing merger deal. The proposed merger, first announced in early May 2025, would create the first publicly traded Bitcoin treasury asset manager focused on long-term outperformance. Strive doubles down on Bitcoin strategy The combined entity will operate under the Strive brand and remain listed on Nasdaq. The proceeds are expected to support Strive’s first wave of Bitcoin acquisitions and accelerate its efforts to establish itself as a new kind of publicly traded Bitcoin treasury asset manager. The PIPE deal was priced at $1.35 per share, representing a 121% premium over ASST’s closing price prior to the merger announcement. The same price applies to the warrants tied to the financing. No debt was raised in the transaction, with Strive opting to preserve future leverage capacity to optimise equity returns. CEO Matt Cole said the company’s strategy focuses on outperforming Bitcoin rather than simply tracking its price. To achieve this, Strive plans to deploy capital across a range of alpha-generating strategies, including acquisitions of undervalued biotech companies, purchases of distressed Bitcoin claims such as those linked to Mt. Gox, and investments in discounted tranches of structured Bitcoin credit vehicles. Strive has already signalled interest in acquiring as much as $7.9 billion worth of Mt. Gox-related Bitcoin claims through its strategic partnership with 117 Partners LLC. These claims represent approximately 75,000 BTC from the long-running bankruptcy proceedings of the defunct exchange and are being positioned as a cost-effective means of gaining discounted Bitcoin exposure. In addition to the PIPE, Strive recently unveiled a unique offering that allows accredited investors to exchange Bitcoin for equity in the public company. The transaction could potentially qualify as tax-free under Section 351 of the US tax code. The firm also intends to use fixed-income and derivatives strategies to hedge risk and enhance returns. Strive gains immediate access to public capital markets and a $1 billion shelf registration through its merger with Asset Entities. The merger also strengthens its retail and influencer outreach capabilities, enabling broader investor participation. Founded by Vivek Ramaswamy in 2022, Strive initially gained attention for its anti-ESG investment stance and activist strategies. Matt Cole took over as CEO in 2023 following Ramaswamy’s departure and broadened the firm’s focus to include Bitcoin as a long-term capital allocation benchmark. Bitcoin continues to draw institutional interest What initially began as cautious exposure via exchange-traded products and indirect investment vehicles has evolved into a more assertive strategy, with public companies directly acquiring Bitcoin for their treasuries. Strive Asset Management is among several firms leading this trend. In May 2025 alone, multiple companies announced significant Bitcoin acquisitions. These include firms like Strategy, Metaplanet , KindlyMD, and H100 Group, which are anchoring corporate balance sheets around Bitcoin as the asset trades near $108,759, close to its recent all-time high.

2025-05-27T16:08:22.000Z,"Ethereum price coiling under resistance: Is a breakout toward $4,000 imminent?","Ethereum is consolidating under a critical resistance level with its bullish structure intact. If volume supports the breakout, ETH could rally toward $4,000 in the next impulsive move. Ethereum’s ( ETH ) current price action is forming a bullish continuation pattern just below the $2,700 resistance level. The market has shown strength following a recent swing low, and price is compressing into a high-conviction breakout setup. The structure suggests growing momentum, but confirmation will depend on how price reacts at this major level. Key technical points $2,700 Resistance Level: ETH is consolidating just beneath this horizontal resistance, which has held for weeks. Ascending Triangle Formation: Bullish pattern formed by higher lows pushing into a flat resistance line. Bullish Market Structure: Consecutive higher highs and higher lows remain intact, signaling strength. ETHUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Ethereum’s price action has been consolidating under the $2,700 mark for the past few weeks. This zone is significant because there is limited historical resistance above it, opening the door for a swift expansion toward the $4,000 region. The current ascending triangle pattern, formed by rising lows pushing into a flat resistance, is typically associated with bullish continuation. This structure echoes previous Ethereum breakout setups, where prolonged compression under key resistance levels preceded sharp directional moves. Historically, ETH tends to build pressure over time before releasing it in high-momentum breakouts. Notably, sellers have repeatedly failed to drive price below the trendline, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Ongoing accumulation near resistance often signals that smart money is positioning ahead of a larger move. You might also like: Trump Media to buy $2.5b Bitcoin, creating one of crypto’s largest corporate treasuries A critical signal to monitor is volume. The declining volume during consolidation suggests the market is coiling, preparing for expansion. However, volume must return at the breakout to validate the move. A breakout attempt on weak volume would raise the risk of a fakeout or bull trap. That said, the strength of the recent impulse from the swing low supports the view that a significant bottom has been set. Structurally, Ethereum remains bullish. Price continues to make consistent higher lows, with no signs of a bearish reversal. The trend is intact, and the longer ETH holds this ascending formation, the greater the probability of a breakout. What to expect in the coming price action If ETH maintains its ascending structure and breaks above $2,700 with strong volume, it could trigger a sharp move toward $4,000. Until then, the ongoing consolidation remains bullish and constructive, signaling strength, not weakness.

2025-05-27T16:08:17.000Z,"Crypto Regulations in El-Salvador 2025 : First Country to Use Bitcoin as Legal Tender","The post Crypto Regulations in El-Salvador 2025 : First Country to Use Bitcoin as Legal Tender appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News El Salvador made history in 2021 as the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. By 2025, the country has shifted toward a more regulated and voluntary framework for cryptocurrency , balancing innovation with international financial obligations and domestic realities. Table of contents El Salvador Crypto Regulation 2025: Major Developments Timeline March 2025: New Regulatory Framework Comes Into Effect February 2025: New Amendments Rolled Out January 2025: Bitcoin Legal Tender Status Revoked Key Crypto Regulation Milestones in El Salvador What the Government and Regulators Are Saying Crypto Tax 2025 Crypto Adoption Rate in El Salvador Country’s Government Crypto Holdings Crypto Mining in El Salvador Conclusion FAQs El Salvador Crypto Regulation 2025: Major Developments Timeline March 2025: New Regulatory Framework Comes Into Effect Marks the official beginning of El Salvador’s regulated crypto era . The focus shifts from mandated usage to voluntary adoption and compliance . February 2025: New Amendments Rolled Out Bitcoin use in paying taxes and government fees was banned. The state is no longer obligated to support Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin remains voluntary legal tender, i.e., permitted but not mandatory. January 2025: Bitcoin Legal Tender Status Revoked The Legislative Assembly voted to substantially rescind the Bitcoin Law . Businesses are no longer legally required to accept Bitcoin. Government’s official Bitcoin wallet, Chivo , was phased out. Key Crypto Regulation Milestones in El Salvador Date Event/Update June 2021 Bitcoin Law announced and passed, making BTC legal tender September 2021 Bitcoin Law takes effect; Chivo wallet launched 2021–2024 Continued government promotion, mining initiatives, and international criticism December 2024 IMF loan deal agreed, requiring rollback of Bitcoin’s legal tender status What the Government and Regulators Are Saying National Commission for Digital Assets (CNAD): The main regulatory authority, CNAD oversees licensing, compliance, and enforcement for digital assets, aiming to foster innovation while ensuring financial integrity. Central Reserve Bank (BCR): Supervises crypto activities, enforces anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards, and registers Bitcoin service providers. Government Position: President Bukele and regulators emphasize building a transparent, compliant, and internationally connected crypto ecosystem, even as direct state involvement in Bitcoin is reduced. Crypto Tax 2025 For Investors/Traders: No capital gains tax on Bitcoin transactions, making El Salvador highly attractive for individual crypto investors. For Crypto Companies: Firms benefit from substantial tax exemptions, especially if revenue is generated outside El Salvador. However, compliance with AML, KYC, and reporting standards is mandatory. Reporting: Both individuals and companies must maintain records and report to CNAD and the Ministry of Finance as part of annual financial statements 1 . Crypto Adoption Rate in El Salvador Public adoption remains low, with user penetration at 3.34% in early 2025. The number of active users is expected to reach over 214,000 by year-end, but most Salvadorans do not use Bitcoin for daily transactions. The government is working on new initiatives to boost crypto utility and public perception. Country’s Government Crypto Holdings As of 2025, the Salvadoran government holds approximately 6,100 Bitcoins, valued at over $639 million, with continued purchases planned despite the policy rollback. These holdings are managed as part of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund. Crypto Mining in El Salvador El Salvador has promoted Bitcoin mining using geothermal energy from volcanoes, positioning itself as a pioneer in sustainable crypto mining 5 . The state-owned geothermal company LaGeo operates mining facilities powered by 100% clean, emission-free volcanic energy, with a capacity of up to 95 MW5. In Q1 2025, Bitfinex Securities announced plans to launch the Blockstream Mining Note 2 (BMN2) in El Salvador, further expanding institutional mining activities in the country 7 . The government continues to support mining as part of its broader digital assets strategy, leveraging renewable resources to attract global investment and innovation. Conclusion El Salvador’s approach to cryptocurrency in 2025 is defined by regulatory maturity and strategic adaptation. While Bitcoin is no longer mandatory as legal tender, the government maintains a crypto-friendly, tax-exempt environment and continues to invest in both Bitcoin holdings and sustainable mining initiatives. The regulatory focus has shifted to compliance, transparency, and international cooperation, positioning El Salvador as a unique hub for digital asset innovation in Latin America. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-27T16:07:39.000Z,"MetaMask extension now supports Solana, mobile app integration weeks away","MetaMask, the most popular hot crypto wallet, has added support for the Solana network, ending years of EVM exclusivity. MetaMask users are finally able to transfer to keep their Solana (SOL) assets in their wallet. On Tuesday, May 27, MetaMask officially added support for the Solana network on its web browser extension. This means that users will be able to hold SOL and Solana-based tokens in the wallet. While the Solana network is not yet available on the MetaMask mobile app, mobile support is expected “in a few weeks,” according to the company. MetaMask also announced plans to expand support for additional networks not powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine. “Solana is just the start. We’ll be adding more non-EVM networks over the coming months, to make wallet juggling a thing of the past. One wallet, one interface, every network,” MetaMask. You might also like: MetaMask is ‘maybe’ considering a native token launch MetaMask hopes to improve UX with Solana integration According to the company, integrating Solana and other non-EVM chains is part of a broader effort to streamline the user experience. Previously, users holding assets across multiple networks, such as Ethereum and Solana, had to manage separate wallets. With this update, they can now access and manage all supported assets from MetaMask. That said, not all Solana users are expected to immediately switch to MetaMask. Phantom, the leading Solana-native wallet, already supports multiple networks, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Base, Polygon, and others. However, MetaMask is betting that its security architecture will help it gain traction among multi-chain users.

MetaMask also notes that it has never experienced a protocol-level hack affecting its browser extension or mobile app. Still, several users have suffered losses due to social engineering, phishing, and other types of exploits. For instance, in 2023, MetaMask users were targeted with phishing emails after attackers managed to hack Namecheap.

2025-05-27T16:05:36.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: is BTC About to Challenge $120K Next?","Bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase just below the $111K level, showing signs of exhaustion in its upward momentum. The market is currently in a state of anticipation, waiting for fresh demand or supply to define the next major move. Despite the pause, the broader outlook continues to favour a bullish continuation. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Bitcoin is currently navigating through a consolidation phase beneath its recently established all-time high of $111K, indicating a slowdown in bullish momentum following the breakout above the former ATH at $109K. The market is showing signs of indecision, awaiting a fresh wave of demand to reignite the uptrend. Despite the modest pullback to the $109K region, now acting as support, the lack of strong buying activity suggests that the bulls are cautious. For BTC’s price to resume its upward trajectory and reach the critical psychological level of $120K, increased participation from buyers is essential. Conversely, if the price fails to hold above the $109K breakout level, it may trigger a more significant correction, potentially targeting the $100K support zone. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin continues to respect an ascending channel structure, consistently forming higher lows and higher highs. Following its rejection from the $111K resistance zone, the price retreated to the lower boundary of the channel near $106K, where it found temporary support and rebounded slightly. The market currently reflects a state of balance between bulls and bears, suggesting that further consolidation may occur in the short term. A breakdown below the channel support could open the door for a sharper decline toward the $100K range. However, as long as the structure remains intact, BTC is more likely to oscillate between the lower trendline and the $111K resistance, building pressure for an eventual decisive breakout that will define the next major move. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis Despite reaching a new all-time high at $111K, a wave of profit-taking is typically expected. Particularly if long-term holders start to sell, it could trigger a significant correction. To evaluate whether this cohort is distributing, the Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric serves as a key indicator. Historically, each major peak in Bitcoin’s price during previous bullish cycles has been accompanied by sharp spikes in this metric, reflecting the movement of long-dormant coins to exchanges, often signaling that long-term holders are offloading their assets. However, this current rally paints a different picture. Despite the price climbing to a new high, the Exchange Inflow CDD has remained subdued. This lack of activity from seasoned holders suggests that they are not yet participating in profit-taking and instead continue to hold their coins with conviction. This behavior underscores strong confidence in the continuation of the uptrend, with expectations for even higher price targets in this cycle. As long as this group remains inactive and does not exert significant sell pressure, the path remains open for Bitcoin to push toward new highs in the mid-term.

2025-05-27T16:00:56.000Z,"Forecast Models Show 12,500% Growth Potential — MAGACOIN FINANCE Now a High-Conviction Buy","Introduction MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming a high-conviction opportunity for crypto investors, with forecast models projecting up to 12,500% growth potential. Alongside MAGACOIN, market leaders like Solana (SOL), Bitcoin (BTC), and TRUMP (Trump Media and Technology Group) are making headlines—but none offer the explosive presale upside that MAGACOIN FINANCE does, combining audited contracts, a hyper-engaged community, and clear tokenomics for maximum growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Explosive Growth and Community Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised over $8 million in presale, with analysts projecting up to 18,500% ROI in some models—though a conservative consensus points to 12,500% growth potential. Its scarcity-driven model, audited smart contracts, and strong community engagement are fueling investor confidence and positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as the breakout altcoin of 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Solana (SOL): Ecosystem Strength and Upcoming Integrations SOL is trading around $172, with new integrations and rising DeFi volume signaling continued momentum. Analysts suggest SOL could outperform rivals like BNB and XRP, with a potential 90% rally as adoption and staking surge. While SOL offers robust upside, its growth is more gradual compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale projections. Bitcoin (BTC): Record Highs and Institutional Demand BTC recently smashed past $111,000, setting a new all-time high and confirming the bull market. Analysts expect BTC to test $112,000–$115,000, but further gains from current levels would represent only a 10–35% upside—far below MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale return potential. TRUMP (Trump Media and Technology Group): Major Crypto Ambitions Trump Media is seeking to raise $3 billion to invest in crypto assets, with plans to launch a financial services platform focused on crypto and exchange-traded funds.

2025-05-27T16:00:43.000Z,"Bitcoin Retraces Below $109,000: Analysts Split on Future Outlook","The market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), has experienced a retracement below the $109,000 mark on Monday, following its recent surge to an all-time high (ATH) of $111,800 last week. As the cryptocurrency market reacts to these fluctuations, analysts find themselves divided on BTC’s price future trajectory. Bitcoin Could Hit New ATH Of $113,000 This Week Market expert Doctor Profit took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to reaffirm his bullish stance, citing the recent occurrence of a “Golden Cross”—a technical indicator that has historically signaled significant price increases. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic With an accuracy rate of 87.8% on higher time frames, the Golden Cross has flashed only twice in the past two years and has now reappeared. Doctor Profit emphasized its rarity, stating, “This is a rare and powerful signal that deserves serious attention.” The expert pointed out during his analysis that the previous instances when the Golden Cross appeared resulted in remarkable price surges: in October 2023, Bitcoin jumped from $27,000 to $73,000, representing a 170% gain, and in October 2024, it rose from $63,000 to $109,000, marking a 73% increase. The expert now anticipates that the Bitcoin price could reach a new all-time high of $113,000 this very same week, citing substantial liquidity in that area and robust momentum in the market. Potential Bull Trap In BTC Additionally, Doctor Profit highlighted the significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are nine times greater than the amount of Bitcoin being mined. He also pointed to Strategy’s (previously MicroStrategy) ongoing accumulation of Bitcoin with a new purchase made on Monday by the company, suggesting that this trend is constraining supply and creating opportunities for further price appreciation. In contrast, fellow analyst Cameron Fous expressed a more cautious outlook on X, suggesting that the current price may represent the peak of the 2025 bull run. He referenced historical price patterns from the previous bull market, asserting that Bitcoin’s recent performance could resemble a “bull trap,” where prices see a sharp decline after reaching a peak. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip? Fous indicated that signs of a potential reversal could be forming, especially if Bitcoin breaks below the 50-day moving average (MA). Despite his caution, he acknowledged that Bitcoin could still rally to between $130,000 and $200,000 in the short term. He emphasized that while the market remains bullish, top signals often precede trend reversals and cautioned that past behavior should inform present decisions, as market dynamics can shift rapidly. When writing, the market’s largest cryptocurrency is trading at approximately $108,739, registering a slight 0.6% retrace in the 24-hour time frame. In total, BTC has retraced little over 3% from its all-time high reached last week.

2025-05-27T16:00:38.000Z,"Michael Saylor won’t publish Strategy’s proof of reserves: “It’s a bad idea”","A flagship corporate Bitcoin holder, Strategy, has never disclosed its Bitcoin addresses, which has led many people to wonder if the company actually owns the amount it claims to hold. On May 26, 2025, Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor explained why the company would not disclose its addresses. As of May 27, after the latest $427 million purchase, Strategy claims to hold 580,250 bitcoins. On several occasions, Michael Saylor suggested that Strategy would not sell any of its bitcoins. The lack of full disclosure of Strategy’s addresses raises doubts among skeptics about whether the company fully adheres to Saylor’s words and holds the exact amount it claims to own. Some of them repeatedly demanded that Saylor show the addresses, but he never did. Finally, he took eight minutes to explain why Strategy wouldn’t do that. Aren’t Strategy’s addresses already well-known? Arkham Intelligence reported in January 2025 that it had identified 96% of Strategy’s Bitcoin addresses and published them. The company didn’t confirm if these addresses actually belong to it. Approximately 4% of the BTC funds in Strategy are not located at any of these addresses. Given the BTC price, this tiny particle is a multi-billion-dollar loophole that raises concerns among strategy skeptics who want Strategy to make a full disclosure of addresses. Read more: Will Michael Saylor pull the rug? How does Saylor explain the reluctance to show Strategy’s addresses? In a speech published on X on May 27, Saylor admits that Mt. Gox and FTX were the hard lessons, but he believes that “the current conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves.” According to Saylor, disclosure of public addresses simultaneously jeopardizes several groups of stakeholders: the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges, and the investors. “It’s like publishing the address and the bank accounts of all your kids and [the] phone numbers of all your kids and then thinking somehow that makes your family better.” While Strategy’s holdings, one’s kids are not subjected to investments by third parties, Saylor continued to elaborate on why he sees publishing proof of reserves as not secure. It’s safe to say that in his speech, Saylor distanced Strategy from Bitcoin purists, emphasizing that Strategy is a publicly traded company and its investors are institutional investors while the demand to reveal the wallets is rather something dictated by a Bitcoin maximalist logic. The Strategy chair says that in contrast to proof of liabilities, safe proof of reserves is simply impossible. He recommended all the Bitcoin maxis to hold bitcoins in self-custody instead of relying on Strategy. For securities investors, he says, it’s safer to rely on proof of assets and proof of liabilities, and “the best practice is not to publish the wallet.” It is the responsibility of the Big Four auditors to ensure the solvency and soundness of the company. The data should be confirmed on multiple levels, including by the custodians and the exchanges. In the case of Strategy, the audits are conducted by KPMG LLP , a Big Four audit company. Furthermore, he emphasized that as an American company, Strategy cannot lie about its finances, as its personnel would face jail time due to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which protects investors from inaccurate disclosures and statements. Saylor added that in the future, he may implement zero-knowledge proof of reserves that would not reveal the wallet addresses publicly. However, this possibility won’t free Strategy from confirming all the data independently by the involved parties and Big Four auditors. According to Saylor, the lesson learned from the failures of FTX and Mt. Gox was not that the missing proof of reserves is bad, but rather not to do business with “shaky offshore exchanges run by juvenile tweakers.” Saylor finished his speech by saying that the wallets, once they are published, are “the intact vector for hackers, nation-state actors, every type of troll imaginable. It creates so much liability that you should think twice before you do it.” However, Saylor admitted that there is nothing wrong with publishing addresses at a small level. It is unclear whether Bitwise, whose BTC addresses are disclosed, is on a small scale, according to Saylor’s opinion. Somehow, Bitwise manages to maintain transparency and safety simultaneously. However, there is no other such big company holding bitcoins. In this regard, Bitwise is the only corporation to do so, and others don’t follow in its footsteps. Public reaction Some found Saylor’s speech convincing, while others saw it as just a baseless excuse to hide the shady operations. Seemingly responding to Saylor’s speech, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao jokingly tweeted, “he probably sold bitcoins.” CZ is too scared to tag the @, but we all know he's subtweeting @saylor https://t.co/s98EFov6tB — Pledditor (@Pledditor) May 27, 2025 The skeptics believe that Bitcoin wallets are unhackable. Therefore, Saylor has no good excuse for not publishing proof of reserves. People who defend the Strategy chair’s stance claim that, as the disclosure involves several parties, there is a risk of key leaks at some level, so disclosing the wallets is not secure. It’s the same process that all of the Coinbase info leaks follow: 1) identify owner of address 2) dust attack and track address movements 3) correlate address to individuals 4) social engineering attack and/or wrench attack Nobody who’s lost coin to theft actually had Bitcoin… — William Graham (@williamgrahamiv) May 27, 2025 If hackers associate the addresses of Strategy with certain institutions, they may use social engineering or other sophisticated tactics to obtain private keys. Trust in Strategy continues to an extent to which we can trust public companies. As Saylor puts it, if you like to have full control over addresses, it is vital to hold bitcoins yourself.

Strive Asset Management and Asset Entities said in an announcement that the $750 million private investment in public equity round will increase to $1.5 billion amid the execution of warrants. The company, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, plans to use the proceeds of this offering to fund its wave of Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases. In an update on May 27, 2025, Strive noted that the PIPE round will be priced at $1.35 per share, representing a 121% premium over the company’s pre-announcement closing price. According to details of the raise, the transaction involves no debt financing, a structure Strive says will preserve maximum leverage capacity for future strategic initiatives.

While the company also intends to implement beta strategies commonly deployed by incumbent BTC treasury firms, its primary focus will be alpha generation. Strive’s approach includes acquiring undervalued biotech companies, purchasing distressed Bitcoin claims, and scooping up discounted structured BTC credit. One of these strategies has already seen Strive target Mt. Gox claims BTC , with the firm revealing plans to get $7.9 billion of the defunct crypto exchange’s Bitcoin claims. The company said it was eyeing the stash in partnership with 117 Partners LLC. The Strive announcement comes on the same day as Trump Media and Technology Group’s press release about the raising of $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin. Reports that Trump Media was looking to raise funds to add BTC to its balance sheet emerged Monday, with the company confirming this a day later.

The move comes amid heightened regulatory enforcement under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets framework, which has led to the delisting of USDT ( USDT ) by major exchanges such as Binance and Kraken in the European Economic Area. StablR, a stablecoin issuer focusing on regulatory alignment, will issue the EURR (euro-backed) and USDR (USD-backed) stablecoins. These assets will be tokenized via Tether’s new Hadron platform and are designed to meet MiCA’s requirements, including full asset backing and regular audits, according to a release shared with crypto.news. Oobit, which recently secured $25 million in Series A funding, will integrate these stablecoins into its crypto payments platform. To encourage adoption, Oobit is offering 5% cashback on transactions made with either EURR or USDR. The company reports that 70% of crypto payments in the EU are now being used for everyday goods such as food and basic commodities.

The launch addresses the gap left by the USDT delisting and reflects the increasing demand for compliant alternatives in a stablecoin market valued at over $400 million for euro-backed assets alone as of late 2024.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine? Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset. As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin ( BTC ) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply . That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly. The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving . When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%. According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction. This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap , is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining. Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued. Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again. Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto , which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC. This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time. Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost. This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks. As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable. This may lead to several outcomes: Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demand Higher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key management A premium on liquidity , where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply. In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress. What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined? There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that. Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits . The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing. So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives. This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021 , Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations. Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network. In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does. Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees , base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design. Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue. The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone. As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe , where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy. According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations. Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-27T15:34:12.000Z,"Here’s Why Florida’s Bombshell Is a Big Move For Crypto and XRP Holders","In a stunning development that has electrified the crypto community, Florida has unveiled a groundbreaking proposal: a new bill aiming to eliminate capital gains tax on assets like XRP , Bitcoin, and stocks. The news was highlighted by prominent community member Parrot, who shared an excited thread on X outlining the massive implications this could have for investors, businesses, and the broader digital asset space. If passed, Florida would become the first U.S. state to offer zero state-level capital gains tax on profits from cryptocurrencies like XRP. While federal taxes would still apply, the removal of state taxes could create an unprecedented advantage for Floridian investors and entrepreneurs. This is no small shift — it signals a bold step by Florida to position itself as a national and global hub for crypto innovation and wealth generation. BREAKING: BOOOOOOM Florida just dropped a BOMBSHELL! A new bill proposes ELIMINATING capital gains tax on #XRP , Bitcoin, & stocks! Here’s why this is a JOY MOVE for crypto HODLers and investors! #CryptoNews #Florida pic.twitter.com/YMSkN1NYuN — Parrot ︎ ︎ (@ParrotXrp) May 27, 2025 A Crypto Paradise in the Making At the heart of this legislative push is a desire to turn the Sunshine State into a crypto-friendly paradise. With no capital gains tax at the state level, investors would be able to retain significantly more of their profits, whether they are actively trading, holding long-term, or reinvesting in the market. For XRP holders in particular, this could be transformative. XRP’s appeal already stems from its fast, low-cost transactions and it’s expanding real-world use cases, such as Wellgistics’ recent $50 million treasury investment. A state-level tax exemption would amplify these benefits, boosting investor confidence and potentially attracting major new players to Florida’s crypto ecosystem. As Parrot noted, this could supercharge portfolios by allowing HODLers to reinvest more capital into their holdings, leading to bigger potential wins and long-term growth. The Domino Effect: Could Other States Follow? Florida’s bold move doesn’t exist in a vacuum. If the bill is passed, it could ignite a domino effect across the United States, as other states scramble to stay competitive in the battle for crypto talent, investment, and innovation. Crypto advocates have long argued that regulatory clarity and favorable tax conditions are key to unlocking widespread adoption, and Florida’s leadership on this front could set off a race among states to create similar tax havens for digital assets. This is particularly relevant as U.S. crypto policy remains fragmented, with states holding significant leeway in shaping their own tax and business environments. By moving first, Florida positions itself at the forefront of a national conversation that could eventually reshape how cryptocurrencies are treated across America. Governor DeSantis’ Vision for a Blockchain Hub Backing this proposal is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and blockchain innovation. DeSantis has repeatedly emphasized his vision of transforming Florida into a global leader in decentralized technologies, and this bill fits squarely within that ambition. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While some political leaders have taken a cautious or even hostile approach toward crypto, DeSantis has charted a different course, championing policies that invite blockchain developers, crypto entrepreneurs, and investors to set up shop in Florida. By offering clear, pro-innovation rules and a welcoming tax environment, Florida is sending a clear message: come build here. For XRP enthusiasts, that means being part of a fast-growing ecosystem where the potential for innovation, investment, and profit is unmatched. Why This Matters for XRP’s Future The timing of Florida’s move could not be more critical. XRP’s profile has been rising steadily, bolstered by increasing institutional adoption, landmark partnerships, and a series of legal victories that have clarified its regulatory standing in the U.S. Analysts are already forecasting ambitious price targets for leading cryptocurrencies — some projecting Bitcoin could hit $135,000 — and XRP, with its unique position in cross-border payments and liquidity solutions, stands poised to capture significant upside. A tax break at the state level could amplify XRP’s momentum, making it even more attractive to investors and businesses looking for cost-efficient, high-speed settlement solutions. Parrot’s post underscores how Florida’s policy could not only benefit existing HODLers but also draw in fresh capital and talent, helping XRP’s value proposition soar to new heights. While the bill is still under review, the excitement in the crypto community is palpable. Florida’s proposal represents more than just a tax change — it’s a strategic play to reshape the landscape for digital assets, pushing the U.S. toward greater crypto adoption and innovation. For XRP holders and the broader crypto community, this could be a historic turning point. As Parrot urged in his thread, now is the time to engage and support pro-crypto policies and HODL for the long game. Florida is lighting the way — and if the momentum continues, it could redefine the future of crypto across the nation.

2025-05-27T15:33:20.000Z,"MARA Holdings: An Intriguing Combination Of Bitcoin Treasury And Efficient Mining","Summary MARA first seems like a lite version of Strategy (MSTR)… because MARA also buys bitcoin to hold rather than trade. But that view shortchanges MARA. That said, there is a value-added MSTR analogy here. I like MSTR because of how its “intelligent leverage” adds value. MARA’s value-add is very different; it’s a big-time bitcoin miner. To many (including me before I looked deeply into MARA), bitcoin mining sounds obscure, exotic, and even a bit scary (think monstrous energy costs). Upon further review, and mastery of some new jargon, mining actually makes sense to me. And so, too, does MARA’s vertical integration and energy focused approach to it. MARA stock trades at a slight 2.73% discount to the market value of its bitcoin holdings. Adding-in the benefits of its approach to mining, I consider the stock a “Buy.”. Sometimes I scare myself. Some say I do that every morning when I first look in the mirror. I won’t argue. But that’s not what I mean now. I think, and I say this with great trepidation… I believe I’m starting to… drum roll… understand bitcoin! I’m sure there’s a segment of the Seeking Alpha community that reads this and yawns. “Well duh…” they (or you) may think. “What took you so long!” I don’t have an easy or self-flattering answer. All I can say is that some of us traditionalists catch on slowly. I started in the market in 1979 working for Value Line. Its founder, the late Arnold Bernhard, began his investment career in the 1920s. I’ve long been attached to value investing. I brought Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ) into Value Line coverage in the mid-1990s. I’m not sure if Warren Buffett was blowing smoke or not, but he did tell me I was the first analyst to actually start covering the company regularly. Even after having moved on from Value Line, I retained enough of my fundamental training to have recognized that the many turn-of-the century dot-com high-fliers were cash-burning dregs. So I sat out that boom… and bust . In fact, in 2000 and 2002, I published books very tethered to basic fundamentals. These were, respectively, Screening the Market and The Value Connection . But underneath, I always had an affinity for Wall Street’s wild side. For a while, I covered gold-and silver-mining stocks. I even got a trip to a gold mine in Canada’s Northwest Territories near the Arctic Circle. And in the mid-1980s, I launched and managed a Value Line high yield (“junk”) bond mutual fund. (We called it “Aggressive Income.”) Now, after having retired from corporate life and working for myself rather than chasing down somebody else’s strategies and agendas, I find my taste for adventure returning. Many of the stocks you’ll find in the Analysis portion of my Profile may strike you as 180-degrees apart from Buffett-world and what you’d expect form a guy who wrote books about fundamentals. And then, on 12/20/24 , I wrote up Strategy ( MSTR ). That company is about buying and holding bitcoin. I recognizing that bitcoin is an asset. It has a price. MSTR has a quantity of it. So I could compute an asset value. Value investors love doing that! But I needed two more steps before I said “Hold” rather than “Sell.’ First, I had to understand MSTR’s “intelligent leverage” strategy. I needed that to understand why MSTR was more than just a guess on bitcoin’s next pricing move. And I had to figure out why bitcoin is not really, as Buffett famously said , “rat poison squared.” I needed to understand why sane persons would want to own it. By the time I wrote up MSTR again on 5/9/25, felt comfortable enough to say “Buy.” MARA Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) , a partially MSTR-like company, brings my crypto self-education to the next level. I had to study up on bitcoin mining. That’s as important to MARA as intelligent leverage is to MSTR. Mining is why MARA is, like MSTR, more than just another play on bitcoin price gyrations. In One Sense, its Bitcoin “Full HODL” Strategy, We Can Think of MARA as MSTR-Lite MSTR speaks in terms of a bitcoin treasury strategy. MARA uses a different label for it… “Full HODL .” The odd acronym originated from a 2013 post in a bitcoin forum. Specifically, it was a typo committed by a user who meant to type HOLD. Since then, HODL got its own informal meaning… “Hold On for Dear Life.” As of 3/31/25, the end of the first quarter, MARA owned 47,531 coins. As of this writing, Bitcoin last traded at about $109,620 per coin. MARA’s Q1 weighted average number of diluted shares was 344.1 million. That values MARA’s holdings at $5.15 billion. Let’s now hypothetically assume MARA added no more coins since 3/31/25. In such a case, MARA’s bitcoin holdings would be worth nearly $15.14 per share. The means MARA, last (as of this writing) priced at about $14.73 per share, trades at a 2.73% discount to its bitcoin ownership. (The true discount is probably more since the company likely obtained more coins since 3/31/24.) My 5/9/25 MSTR writeup put that stock price at an approximately 116% premium to its bitcoin holdings. So, we can start out by suggesting that MARA, at a 2.73% discount, is very attractively priced relative to MSTR. But as discussed on 5/9/25, there was a lot more to the MSTR story (its intelligent leverage strategy). There’s a different sort of play with MARA. It lends out some of its bitcoin to others who sell short… and earns fee income for doing so. But there’s another much bigger aspect of the story here… MARA Doesn’t Just Own Bitcoin – It’s Also a Major Bitcoin Miner MARA separates from MSTR based on how each company gets its bitcoin. MSTR buys using its intelligent leverage financing protocol. MARA buys too. It also finances purchases. But it’s capital-raising approach isn’t as systemic as that of MSTR (at least not yet). The big differentiator is that MARA also mines its own bitcoin. I’m going to offer a little mining primer here. Just saying this company mines bitcoin, and even providing some numbers, won’t fully support an investment case for MARA. I’ll need to discuss what specialness (equivalent to MSTR’s intelligent leverage) MARA brings to this table making it more (better) than a one-to-one bitcoin play. A rudimentary understanding of mining will help you appreciate that…. Bitcoin and Mining Simplified (i.e., For People Who Still Carry Paper Currency) In the beginning (actually, on 1/3/09), Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin . More specifically, he launched the blockchain by creating Block 0. This is also known as the Genesis Block. He created the Genesis Block by solving a complex cryptographic puzzle. The process by which he did this is known as Proof-of-Work (PoW). Nakamoto expressed his solution a unique 64-character alphanumeric identifier (also known as a “hash”)… 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f He also embedded a message: The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks (That supposedly showed Nakamoto’s motive for creating bitcoin... lack of trust in the monetary establishment). The Genesis Block awarded 50 coins (the first ones ever) to Nakamoto. And with that, bitcoin was off and running. The 50 Genesis coins can’t be spent. But new coins created by others can be and are spent, transferred, etc. Information about each new bitcoin transaction is added to something called a block. Then there’s another transaction that’s also added to the same block. Then, there’s another, and another, and another… until the block fills to capacity. (This happens on average, once every 10 minutes.) The full block closes when it fills up. And then, the race is on… Modern Bitcoin Miners in Action – Lots of Math but Only One “Eureka” Moment Bitcoin “miners” compete to add this new block to the existing “blockchain.” The latter is the official bitcoin public ledger. Miners get busy at their “rigs.” Those are super powerful computers that use ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). They’re optimized for use as mining rigs. (When connected to the bitcoin network, they’re called nodes.) Gold miners used muscle-power to find and extract gold. Bitcoin miners use brainpower to solve an insanely complex mathematical puzzle. A solution, once they come up with one, is called a “nonce.” Next, the nonce is run through a block function that leads to a “hash.” Think of a hash as the modern equivalent of a gold prospector’s choice of a spot in which to prospect. A gold miner wins by seeing gold in the rocks he brings up or in water he sifts. A bitcoin miner with a fresh new hash gets to shout “Eureka” if the hash comes in lower than a target set by the bitcoin network. Most hashes fail. They don’t meet the network’s test. To get one that works takes a lot of trial and error… and I mean A LOT ! (Shades of 19 th century gold prospectors… and then some.) With all the miners producing and trying a lot of hash solutions, here’s the challenge. In contrast to gold, there can be only one bitcoin mining winner. But suppose two, or 10, or 3,486 miners all create valid hashes? The first one to prove the validity of its solution (Proof of Work) is the sole winner. As to the other one, or nine, or 3,485 miners… tough luck, they lose… They have to try again with a new puzzle relating to the next block created by new transactions. Running Harder and Harder and Needing More and More Sustenance Are you out of breath yet? I am… just thinking about this. Imagine how much power bitcoin rigs need! That’s why these rigs, with their powerful ASIC innards, use a monstrous amount of electricity. As time passes and more coins are created, the final hash-matching challenges get increasingly harder. And the coins per win decrease due to halving events… These events keep bitcoin from reaching its hard-coded maximum circulation (21 million coins) for a long time. There are now about 19,868,488 coins . (If you click the link and see a different number, don’t tell me I messed up. The actual number changes every 10 minutes.) On day one, each winning miner got 50 new coins. Then, after issuance of every 210,000 coins, the reward per win is halved. The last such halving event happened on 4/9/24. The victory prize shrank from 6.25 coins per win to 3.125. The next halving event will cut the reward to 1.5625 coins. The upshot: We’re not going to max out tomorrow. Bitbo.io estimates that’ll happen at some time in 2040. (It estimates that by then, the reward per win will be 0.000000011641532 coins! Obviously the reward-to-effort ratio is shrinking. So expect only the fittest among the approximately 1 million unique miners to survive long term. And expect those increasingly fit miners to keep pushing their rigs harder, and for the rigs to inhale more power. MARA is The Biggest Public Bitcoin Miner Here I go again… I already bombarded you with jargon like nonce, rig, node and hash. And now, I’ll need to give you a few more terms. Hashrate tells us how much computational power a miner brings to the puzzle-solving competition. Specifically ... Hashrate is a measure of the computational power per second used when mining. More simply, it is the speed of mining. It is measured in units of hash/second, meaning how many calculations per second can be performed. Machines with a high hash power are highly efficient and can process a lot of data in a single second. Exahash means 1 quintillion hashes per second. That’s 1 followed by 18 zeros! (I’ll be you thought 1 trillion was a big number. Welcome to the bitcoin world!) We can compare miners based on EH/s… Exahash per second. Here is how MARA fares relative to the other public miners. Analyst compilation based on data from stocktitan.net and cointelegraph.com (EH/s data is the latest reported for each company on stocktitan.net , specifically here for MARA, here for CleanSpark ( CLSK ), here for IREN ( IREN ), and here for Riot ( RIOT ). All numbers of bitcoins produced comes from cointelegraph.com ) As I said MARA is the biggest. MARA is a Low Cost Miner Aside from buying bitcoins in the open market and periodically raising capital to finance its transactions, the forgoing describes what MARA does for a day-to-day living. It’s hard. So, why on earth should MARA bother mining? Couldn’t MARA just as easily buy more coins, and ask its CFO to work harder to keep finding ways to pay for them? In fact, mined coins are only small part of MARA’s total portfolio. The image below shows, for MARA, trends in blocks won and coins produced, relative to total coins owned (the holding balance). MARA IR Actually, there is a huge benefit to mining coins… despite all the virtual huffing and puffing. Typical of business in general, making something on one’s own (assuming any tolerable level of competence) will be cheaper than buying it at retail. You get to eliminate manufacturer’s margins, distribution costs, retailers’ margins. You would, of course, have your own production and capital costs. But at least you would have the power to improve your outcomes… You can manage your processes and costs. This is especially critical given halving and increases in network difficulty. This is a big deal, not just for MARA but for everybody. You see, the race to submit the winning hash differs from other races. In most contests, the finish line is fixed. A 100-yard dash is always 100 yards. That’s not so for bitcoin. Here, a 100-yard dash can turn into a 105-yard dash, and then a 110-year dash, etc. This happens because the bitcoin network adjusts the difficulty of the solution target. It does this after every 2,016 blocks (about 2 weeks). The idea here is to keep the number of winning blocks more or less constant even as more miners keep joining the network. (This is why the above mining trends chart shows, for MARA, fewer blocks won in the latest quarter.) This is why every miner, to succeed over time, must continually strive to become more operationally efficient. MARA started with an asset-lite mining model. It owned its rigs. But it paid others for hosting and infrastructure. At the peak of this phase of MARA’s history, it owned only 3% of its mining sites. That minimized capital outlays. It helped MARA achieve strong early growth in mining. Now, however, cost control is becoming more important. That’s why in 2023, MARA changed its strategy. MARA’s Pivot from its Traditional Asset Lite Approach to Pursuit of Vertical Integration The idea, here, is for MARA to own the entire bitcoin-producing chain. MARA IR Toward that end, the company made three acquisitions in 2024. These brought seven mining sites under MARA’s fold. MARA IR As a result, MARA now operates 617 Megawatts (MW) at fully-owned or controlled mining sites. That’s 55% of the 1,118 MW (1.1 Gigawatts) it now uses. The rest (501 MW) remains at hosted sites. (The latter refers to sites MARA leases from others.) MARA IR Note, however, the right column of the table… If all sites become fully optimized to their respective maximum capacities, MARA would wind up with 1.7 GW of power, and own about 70% of that total. This is already enabling MARA to slash costs. The following table shows trends in MARA’s mining cost per petahash per day. (I’m sure I made your head spin when I discussed above exahash based on 1 quintillion hashes, 1 followed by 18 zeros. Now, to stay in line with how MARA reports data, I have to introduce petahash… based on 1 quadrillion, 1 followed by 15 zeros.) Analyst compilation based on MARA data Don’t worry about variation on zeros and “…illion.” I added the percent change columns to illustrate what’s really important… the trends. Q125 is where we really start seeing what vertical integration does to costs. MARA decided to vertically integrate in late 2023. It made its acquisitions at various times during 2024. So Q125 is the first to reflect the benefits of all of last year’s purchases. Electricity Generation Looms Large in MARA’s Plans to Benefit Even More from Vertical Integration Electricity is, perhaps, THE major cost for bitcoin mining. Digioconomis.com estimates electricity cost as being 48.9% of miner income. Over the course of 2024, MARA came in well below that at its owned sites. Page 36 of its latest 10-K tells us electricity… represented 40.8%, as a percentage of our owned mining revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. This excludes energy costs from third party hosted sites…. The average price for direct energy we paid in our owned facilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.04 per KWh. That $.04 figure refers to the 139 MW MARA-owned capacity. MARA IR MARA IR In contrast, industrial-use electricity per KWh cost averaged $0.0815 in 2024 . Helping MARA achieve its cost advantage are its behind-the-grid mining locations. At these sites, MARA can buy power directly from the source-producer. It thusly bypasses the utility ecosystem. MARA generally locates near renewable power generators, like wind farms. And looking ahead, there’s… Considerable Room for MARA to Benefit Even More from Electricity Production The idea is to capture and use what CEO Fred Thiel refers to as underutilized or stranded electrons. A lot of this relates to behind-the-grid mining sites. Often, much generated power goes to waste – is abandoned – because it can’t all be economically transported to other places, e.g., the main grid. So MARA can get this very cheaply. Besides wind, flared gas is another example. This refers to natural gas that is burned off (flared) at oil-gas production site. MARA locates modular data centers at wellheads. These are powered by gas that would be otherwise wastefully flared. MARA IR In a different sort of cooperative arrangement, MARA is a source rather than a mere user of energy. For example, in a pilot project in Finland , MARA transfers excess heat from its mining operations to a district heating system. The latter uses it to heat buildings in the community. MARA IR Meanwhile, MARA is locating in places that foster cooperation with the grid to foster load balancing . For as much of an electricity hog as mining is, it can be shut down or ramped up almost instantaneously. That opens opportunities for MARA to work with the grid to power down when it encounters peak loads. And of, course, MARA turns it up when the grid can comfortably accommodate mining. It’s now time to add another well-known power-hog, AI, to the discussion. MARA is looking to work with AI and other types of HPC (High Performance Computing). It plans to use its mining data centers to co-host for such operations. Don’t assume MARA’s data centers will have to become mega-facilities filled with the latest and greatest chips — GPUs — from Nvidia ( NVDA ). Those are most badly needed for AI training… building the models. A use of a model, (an inference event), requires much less power than a training event. Inference power demand comes from volume… many more events. The doesn’t detract from the amount of power inference needs. It’s still a lot. But there’s no need to concentrate a lot of it in a super-duper hyperscaler-friendly data center. That means AI companies can do inference from locations such as the ones MARA uses to mine bitcoin. Are visions of a new MARA revenue (hosting for AI inference) stream dancing in you mind? They should be! They are for MARA . All this should help make this stock much more than a mere speculation on bitcoin prices. (And if you’re a VERY forward thinker, you can get a sense of how MARA’s infrastructure can continue making money after bitcoin maxes out around 2040!) Risk Obviously, the future price of bitcoin is a key source of risk. If you are among those who think it and crypto in general are nonsense, you should not be in this stock. (For reasons I discussed in my 5/9/25 MSTR writeup, I disagree with that view.) Financially speaking, most of the data tables I usually show won’t be helpful. Acquisitions in pursuit of vertical integration cause unconventional revenue comparisons. And you’d likely get a mega-migraine evaluating EPS comparisons. That’s because recently-revised accounting standards let bitcoin holders record holdings at the latest market value of the coins. In the past, miners had to write them down when bitcoin fell. But they couldn’t write them up when the price recovered. That was a big headache for EPS-focused analysis. The new rule still requires holders to write down when coin prices fall. But now, they also get to write them back up when prices recover. This does better reflect the economic value of the companies. But for EPS fans, this is “OY” raised exponentially! Here is a version of my usual Financial Strength Highlights table modified to help you get a sense of MARA’s financial viability. Analyst Compilation based on Data from Seeking Alpha Financial Presentations I’ve already explained the soaring revenue. I’ve adjusted the operating margin to exclude the impact of non-cash employee stock compensation costs. (If you can’t handle dilution from employee stock options, MARA and many others among today’s growth companies aren’t for you. Employees have to be incentivized and for many such firms, cash isn’t the best way to do that right now.) I also excluded the impact of changes in the value of digital assets. These are income statement items that reflect the write-downs and write-ups I discussed based on changes in the value of bitcoin holdings. The main takeaway here is that although debt and equity soared recently (due to vertical integration), MARA is clearly solvent. I do want to mention another unusual risk source. You can see it in the recently diminished gross margin. Remember I spoke above about bitcoin halving events and increasing puzzle difficulties. As noted, these make MARA (and miners in general) work harder for rewards that shrink in relation to work done. Think of it as a business hard-wired for margins to decline. This isn’t the end of the world for MARA. It’s a fact of life. And I discussed how MARA is coping… vertical integration, cost control, digital infrastructure endeavors. These are sound moves for this business. Think of them as analogous to a company facing hard-wired industry margin erosion switching to volume-boosting strategies and cost cuts. So the halving events, etc. don’t faze me. But they might jolt investors who aren’t familiar with the dynamics of bitcoin mining… those who just look at comparisons and don’t understand what’s really going on. What to do About MARA Stock Let’s look at the price chart I usually show. StockCharts.com Frankly, I'm having trouble relating the price trends and the indicators I typically monitor (the 10- and 50-day exponential moving averages, Chaikin Money Flow, and the Chaikin Oscillator (CO), to what I see for MARA's fundamentals. Then, I decided to compare MARA prices to trends in bitcoin. Seeking Alpha Bingo! Now I get it. MARA had previously moved more or less in line with bitcoin. But that changed as 2024 progressed. MARA started to underperform bitcoin. And we know what happened in 2024... MARA changed its strategy from asset-lite to vertical integration. And that entailed huge changes in its capital structure. Add in the bitcoin halving event and the generally increasing puzzle difficulty levels. As suggested in the Risk section above, it looks to me like the Street still hasn't yet fully grasped what MARA today is truly about. It should over the long term outperform bitcoin! That’s interesting. It looks like the Street is not yet seeing all relevant aspects of MARA. That – i.e., that investors are missing important issues – is a classic example of what value investors hope to find. The value ideal is a stock with a low P/E because they don’t get it . We don’t often see that any more, in today’s information-intense world. But we do for MARA. (Maybe this investing adventure is closer to my fundamental value roots than I first realized.) I understand that nobody would actually call MARA a value stock. But can I interest anybody in creating a new word… cryptoval! Regardless… When it comes to rating stocks, I think in terms of probable future stock performance relative to the market, rather than literally buying, holding or selling. And since I’m not rating based on a quant model, I’ll eschew “Strong …” extremes. Absent an exceptional degree of conviction, I think “Buy,” Hold,” or “Sell” are enough. Over time, as the Street better understands MARA and its relationship to bitcoin prices, I see the stock as likely outperforming the broader market. I translate that to the Seeking Alpha rating taxonomy by rating MARA as a “Buy.”",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790162-mara-holdings-an-intriguing-combination-of-bitcoin-treasury-and-efficient-mining?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","MSTR|MARA",cryptocompare

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets.US National Financial Conditions Index.

The newsletter noted, “That’s the kind of macro backdrop where Bitcoin thrives. Bitcoin’s rally to new highs didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.”With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

With thousands of projects emerging or disappearing, you need innovative ways to separate signal from noise. AI solutions such as ChatGPT and Grok could benefit you as your research assistant, reducing research time and delivering actionable information. This article discusses how to use both platforms to make better decisions regarding investment in altcoins.How to share content with ChatGPT and GrokBoth ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 allow you to share content in three ways. You can simply paste content in the text box with inverted commas and write your prompt. Alternatively, you can upload a document from your local drive or Google Drive on ChatGPT 4o. If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to analyze complex data and draw quick conclusionsChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project’s breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.Ask for competitive comparisons on ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:And this is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: “Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.Did you know? Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot was built with a rebellious tone. It excels at quickly pulling crypto insights directly from social chatter, perfect for memecoin hunters.Find info about developer activityDeveloper traction is a dependable indicator of an altcoin’s long-term potential. Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to find information about overall growth in development activity, surges after certain upgrades, developer count and contributions, commit activity, network upgrades and challenges before developers.You could use prompts like:“What has been the developer activity trend on [Project ] over the last 6 months?”You can also request ecosystem breakdowns with prompts like:“List top DeFi projects built on Arbitrum with TVL over $10 million.”ChatGPT 4o generated the following response for this prompt:Here is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can synthesize data points from multiple sources and give you a cleaner picture faster than manual web browsing. You could track sudden price spikes with a prompt like:“In 100 words, write why is $RNDR trending right now?”Here is ChatGPT 4o’s response for this prompt:This is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:Grok 3 is particularly useful for monitoring real-time sentiment and news. Grok 3 is ideal for real-time analysis of trends, especially on X, where crypto narratives form quickly. Grok 3 will pull recent posts, mentions and news threads to explain the momentum. It can monitor influencer sentiment.For deeper and quicker research, you can use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 together.Don’t just trust the bots — verify the alphaAI tools like ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 offer powerful support in the altcoin research process, enabling faster analysis, broader comparisons and streamlined access to information. However, even advanced AI models can occasionally misinterpret data or miss contextual nuances. As such, it is essential to treat their responses as a starting point — not a final answer.When using these tools, take the time to compare outputs, evaluate the sources referenced, and cross-check insights against real-world data. Discrepancies between ChatGPT and Grok responses should prompt further investigation, not automatic preference.Ultimately, these platforms are most effective when used to enhance critical thinking and research efficiency rather than replace human judgment.In a fast-moving industry like Web3, effective research requires diligence, curiosity and verification. By applying these principles, you can make more confident and informed investment decisions in the altcoin space.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy. On April 11, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a roadmap that addressed privacy enhancements for wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and infrastructure. Buterin advocated implementing privacy-enhancing norms and features across the Ethereum ecosystem, including adding privacy tools in ETH wallets. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/starkware-unveils-s-two-client-side-zk-prover?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-enters-real-world-asset-race-with-yield-bearing-bgusd-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.“This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai, noting that the model avoids using the Thai baht directly, reducing risks to the domestic currency.Related: Crypto exchange KuCoin enters crowded Thailand marketCapital markets regulation under reviewBeyond enabling crypto use for tourism, Thailand is also planning a reform of its financial laws.

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions.“No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.”“Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.”Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapseMany crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110KCrypto exchanges Binance, Kraken and OKX and crypto asset manager Bitwise are among the industry players that have adopted the transparency measure.However, Saylor noted that proof-of-reserves often only show one side of the picture — what the company holds — and not what they owe.Source: Mitchell AskewSaylor’s Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 576,230 Bitcoin worth $62.6 million on its balance sheet, followed by Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings, which holds 48,137 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.More than 110 publicly traded companies worldwide have purchased and hold Bitcoin.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-says-proof-of-reserves-bad-idea?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world.Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added. On May 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta was delaying the rollout of its flagship AI LLM, Llama 4 “Behemoth.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-ai-boss-ai-lacks-intelligent-behavior-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days.Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her.The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.”CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit.Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer.Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody.He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28.Alleged victim shares ordealTeofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.”Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption.

However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures. The data shows that $1.4 billion in tokens will be released through a “cliff unlock,” while $1.9 billion will be emitted through a “linear unlock.” Cliff unlocks release a large portion or all of the vested tokens simultaneously, while linear unlocks emit crypto assets gradually. Largest crypto token unlocks in JuneAmong the largest token unlocks in June is Metars Genesis (MRS), a non-fungible token (NFT) project that will release $193 million worth of tokens on June 21 to fund an artificial intelligence partnership. Since March, MRS has released 10 million tokens per month, with nearly $1 billion in tokens unlocked so far.Sui (SUI) is scheduled to unlock 44 million tokens worth about $160 million on June 1. The tokens will go to the Mysten Labs treasury, early contributors and the community reserve. The largest portion, valued at more than $70 million, is allocated to Series B investors.To date, Sui has unlocked 3.3 billion tokens valued at over $12 billion, roughly 33% of its total supply. Tokenomist data shows another 5.22 billion tokens worth nearly $20 billion remain without a scheduled release date.Tokenomist data showing Sui’s vesting schedule.

2025-05-26T09:09:34.000Z,"Crypto investor loses $2.6M in stablecoins in double phishing scam","A single victim was scammed two times within three hours, losing a total of $2.6 million in stablecoins.According to data shared on May 26 by crypto compliance firm Cyvers, the victim sent 843,000 worth of USDt (USDT), followed by another 1.75 million USDt around three hours later. Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.Source: Cyvers AlertZero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023.Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain cryptoAdvanced form of address poisoningA zero-value transfer is considered an evolution of address poisoning, a tactic where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that resembles a victim’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. Custom addresses with similar starting and ending characters can also be combined with zero-value transfers.Related: Industry exec sounds alarm on Ledger phishing letter delivered by USPSThreat growing across blockchainsA January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.The report followed crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy announcing an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.
