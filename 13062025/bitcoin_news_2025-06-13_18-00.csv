2025-06-13T15:48:29,"Ripple’s XRP Crazy Explosion to $10 Price In The Cards As Metrics Show Insane XRP Momentum","XRP, one of the most recognized names in the digital asset space, may be approaching a decisive moment. Recent technical analysis suggests that XRP’s six-year consolidation period mirrors the pattern that led to its dramatic surge in 2017. Could this setup ignite another breakout? XRP Six Years of Compression: A Setup or a Stall? Since 2018, XRP price has traded within a compressed range, fluctuating between $0.20 and $0.60 for long periods. At the time of writing, XRP was priced at around $2.14. This prolonged stagnation has frustrated investors waiting for a decisive move. However, analysts on X argue that extended consolidation phases often precede explosive moves to the long-awaited $10 price. Amelie noted on May 25 that XRP’s chart setup closely mirrors its 2017 breakout pattern. In 2017, XRP skyrocketed from under $0.30 to above $3.30 within weeks, delivering one of crypto’s most dramatic rallies. The principle of “the longer the consolidation, the stronger the breakout” underpins this comparison. XRP’s current consolidation began around early 2018, following the broader crypto market’s correction from its 2017 highs. Unlike then, today’s environment features matured infrastructure, greater regulatory clarity, and expanding use cases for XRP . As noted in the U.S. Faster Payments Council’s 2025 report, Ripple’s partnerships with global financial institutions signal that XRP is not just riding technical patterns but also benefiting from real-world adoption. According to CoinShares’ recent fund flows report (May 20), XRP witnessed $37.2 million in outflows, ending an 80-week inflow streak. This shift in sentiment underscores how external factors, including legal decisions and regulatory actions, continue to impact XRP’s price dynamics . These outflows occurred against a backdrop of consolidation and building momentum, suggesting the market may be repositioning. Key Levels and Market Sentiment XRP’s trading volume jumped 18% over the past week, reflecting growing trader interest. Meanwhile, open interest in XRP futures contracts on major exchanges has risen to $1.5 billion, signaling that leveraged traders are preparing for a potential move. While the echoes of 2017 are undeniable, today’s market is far from identical. Regulatory pressures remain a wildcard, with Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC last year providing some relief but leaving uncertainties unresolved. XRP/USDT| Source: TradingView The broader macroeconomic environment, including U.S. interest rates and Bitcoin’s movements, will also influence XRP’s trajectory. For traders watching XRP, the key lies in whether it can break through its resistance levels and sustain upward momentum. As Amelie’s analysis suggests, the long wait might finally be nearing an inflection point, but traders must remain cautious given the complex interplay of technical, regulatory, and macro factors.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-crazy-explosion-to-10-price-in-the-cards-as-metrics-show-insane-xrp-momentum/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T15:47:11,"Gold and Silver Gained Value While Risky Assets Including Crypto Market Dropped After Israel Attacked Iran! Here is All the Data","Cryptocurrency markets fell sharply after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear and missile infrastructure, sparking a broader sell-off in global risk assets. Crypto Markets Fall as Geopolitical Tensions Rise as Israel Attacks Iran While Bitcoin remained stable despite the decline in the overall crypto sector, the SOL ETF lost about 10% of its value despite expectations. Bitcoin (BTC) lost 2.9% and traded around $102,664. In contrast, gold, considered a traditional safe haven, rose 1.3% and approached an all-time high of $3,445 per ounce. The Israeli attack, which reportedly targeted senior Iranian military officials, came shortly after the International Atomic Energy Agency accused Iran of violating limits on uranium enrichment. Iran retaliated by launching 100 suicide drones into Israeli territory. Although the US denied involvement, the attack rattled markets and sent stocks plunging worldwide. Market Impact Across Asset Classes The ripple effect has spread far beyond cryptocurrencies: Japan's Nikkei index fell 0.89%. Euro Stoxx 50 lost 1.37%. U.S. futures were broadly lower, with the E-mini Nasdaq-100 down 1.42%. Oil prices rose and settled after Brent crude gained more than 14%. Gold and silver gained, reflecting the risk aversion trend. In the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) was more affected than Bitcoin and fell by 8.81% to $2,523. Solana ETF Momentum Overshadowed The SEC reportedly requested an update to the Solana ETF S-1 filing, causing a brief spike, according to Wintermute OTC trader Jake Ostrovskis. Bloomberg analysts rate the probability of approval by the end of the year at 90%. But the geopolitical shock quickly erased those gains. “Markets appear to be underexposed to SOL and related assets, which could create interesting opportunities once volatility subsides,” Ostrovskis said. Derivatives and the Liquidity Shake There was a significant easing in the derivatives markets: Total open interest (OI) fell from $55 billion to $49.3 billion. Binance alone lost $2.5 billion worth of OI overnight. Put/call ratios on Deribit have risen, indicating a defensive shift among investors (BTC: 1.28, ETH: 1.25) Funding rates turned negative and altcoins like DOT, LINK, and 1000SHIB showed sharp declines. Despite the sell-off, BTC leverage remains high, with $84 million of long-side open positions between $102,000 and $104,000 still at risk if downward pressure resumes. Spot ETF Flows Continue to Support Crypto As markets react to tensions in the Middle East, flows into crypto ETFs remain strong: BTC spot ETFs have seen inflows of $939 million since the beginning of the month. ETH spot ETFs recorded $811 million in inflows, including $112 million on June 12 alone, marking 19 consecutive days of positive flows. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T15:41:55,"SEC Leadership Shakeup: Brian Daly and Kurt Hohl Step Into Key Roles — What It Means for Crypto?","The Securities and Exchange Commission has announced two high-profile leadership appointments that could impact the regulatory tone for digital assets. Key Takeaways: Brian Daly’s appointment signals a more industry-savvy approach to fund and crypto regulation. Kurt Hohl returns to the SEC with a focus on strengthening financial reporting standards. The new leadership shift under Chairman Paul Atkins is seen as a positive for digital asset innovation. Brian T. Daly will take over as Director of the Division of Investment Management on July 8, while Kurt Hohl will assume the role of Chief Accountant on July 7. The new appointments come after crypto-friendly Paul Atkins was sworn in as Chairman of the SEC in April, marking a leadership shift that is being welcomed by the digital asset industry. SEC’s Brian Daly Brings Decades of Fund Advisory Experience to Top Role Daly, a seasoned figure in the investment management legal sphere, brings decades of experience advising hedge funds, asset managers, and private investment firms. His background includes senior roles at Akin Gump and Schulte Roth & Zabel, as well as in-house compliance leadership at top-tier funds like Millennium Partners and Raptor Capital. Daly’s appointment signals a potential shift toward rulemaking that is more attuned to industry dynamics, including evolving digital asset strategies within traditional fund structures. “Brian has deep familiarity with all levels of the investment management industry,” said Atkins. Daly added that he is eager to help tailor regulation “within statutory authority” while maintaining strong compliance expectations for advisers and fund managers. His track record suggests a regulatory approach grounded in legal precision and institutional pragmatism, qualities likely to influence how crypto-related fund products, like spot ETH or BTC ETFs, are evaluated moving forward. Alongside Daly, the return of Kurt Hohl as Chief Accountant brings added weight to the SEC’s oversight capabilities. It's personnel day at the SEC. – Jamie Selway has officially been named T&M director. – Akin Gump partner Brian Daly has been picked to lead the agency's Investment Management division. – Kurt Hohl is joining the agency as chief accountant. https://t.co/wu7RQLEAWl — Declan Harty (@declanharty) June 13, 2025 With nearly four decades of auditing experience, including a lengthy tenure as a partner at Ernst & Young, Hohl’s focus will be on strengthening accounting standards and transparency, key issues as more crypto firms seek to go public or comply with U.S. disclosure laws. Hohl previously served at the SEC in the 1990s, where he authored the foundational Financial Reporting Manual. His return signals a renewed focus on rigorous reporting and clarity in financial statements, especially relevant for crypto-native companies navigating IPOs or stablecoin disclosures. “At a time when capital markets are evolving rapidly, these appointments position the SEC to respond more effectively to both innovation and investor protection,” Atkins said. SEC Drops Biden-Era Lawsuits Under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC has already withdrawn or delayed several prominent cases against crypto firms. The agency dropped its lawsuits against Coinbase and Cumberland DRW earlier this year, and a separate investigation into Uniswap Labs closed in February without enforcement action. Last week, the agency also closed its investigation into CyberKongz , a prominent Ethereum-based NFT and gaming project, with no enforcement action taken. More recently, the SEC announced it would not pursue further legal action against Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, the founder of Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX.

2025-06-13T15:15:57,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Plunges After Major Escalation In Middle East Tensions","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses for a third consecutive day, plunging to a low of $102,832 as markets turned bearish thanks to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Tensions flared up after Israel conducted preemptive strikes on Iranian military facilities, worsening market sentiment. Traders hopeful of a move past $111,000 were stunned as geopolitical realities meant bullish sentiment around BTC evaporated. The flagship cryptocurrency has rebounded to reclaim $105,000 but remains trading in the red. Bitcoin (BTC) Traders Prepare For Volatility Bitcoin (BTC) traders and holders are bracing for increased volatility after on-chain data revealed a steady decline in exchange and OTC balances, indicating a tightening supply as traders begin accumulating the asset. Retail investor activity is also subdued, making it an unusual backdrop for an asset pushing towards all-time highs. As demand grows, centralized exchanges have reported substantial declines in their Bitcoin balance. Balances have plunged over 14% since the beginning of 2025 to 2.5 million BTC , a level last seen in August 2022. A declining supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges typically indicates growing investor confidence as they move their assets into cold storage. However, this also reduces the liquid supply of the asset, leading to a spike in prices. Over-the-counter (OTC) Bitcoin numbers are also showing a drop in supply. While OTC desks operate by matching buyers and sellers, they rely on BTC reserves to facilitate quick and credible transactions. However, these reserves are also at historic lows, with CryptoQuant data revealing OTC addresses associated with miners have reported a 19% drop in Bitcoin balances since January. With exchange and OTC reserves drying up, the supply is shrinking rapidly. This could amplify price movements as demand for an increasingly scarce asset rises. Liquidations Rattle Crypto Bitcoin (BTC) slumped below $106,000 on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. The decline continued on Friday, falling to an intraday low of $102,832 before rebounding. Bitcoin’s sudden decline sent alarm bells ringing across crypto, with the mood gloomy as sellers hold a distinct advantage. The drop dragged the crypto market down as well, with its market cap plummeting to $3.24 trillion. A total of $645 million in long and short positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours, with $297 million tied to Bitcoin longs alone. Data from Coinglass highlighted a massive $201 million liquidation on a BTC /USDT trade. GameStop’s Bitcoin Bid Sends Shares Into Freefall GameStop’s plan to add more Bitcoin to its balance sheet by boosting its private convertible note offering to $2.25 billion sent its share tanking 22%. The move by the video game and consumer electronics retailer indicates a firm commitment to building its corporate Bitcoin treasury. The sale of the boosted convertible note offering is expected to conclude on Tuesday. GameStop expects to raise $2.23 billion from the offering or $2.68 billion if the purchasers exercise their right to purchase additional notes in full. The boosted offering is a $500 million increase from the initial $1.75 billion announced on Wednesday. The funding round comes after the retailer announced the purchase of 4,710 BTC , valued at around $513 million. The purchase came two months after the company announced plans to build a Bitcoin treasury. GameStop plans to use the funds raised from the offering for general corporate purposes, including investments consistent with GameStop’s investment policy, hinting at more Bitcoin purchases in the future. The video game retailer is currently the 11th largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. However, the company's shareholders are unhappy with the pivot towards Bitcoin, with the share price plunging 22% following the announcement. The firm's share price has struggled to maintain its upside momentum since it announced mixed earnings for the first quarter of 2025. GameStop reported a revenue of $732.4 million, slightly lower than the expected $754.2 million. Czech Government Faces No-confidence Vote After Bitcoin Scandal The Czech Republic's main opposition party has called for a No-confidence Vote against the ruling party, accusing it of corruption over a $45 million Bitcoin payment from a convicted criminal. Alena Schillerova, Vice Chair of the right-wing ANO Party, stated on X that her party felt there was no choice but to submit the no-confidence motion scheduled for Tuesday. The country's Justice Ministry announced on May 28 that it had sold almost 500 Bitcoin for 1 billion Czech koruna ($45 million) in an auction after receiving it from Tomas Jirikovsky. Jirikovsky ran an online black market and was convicted of embezzlement, drug trafficking, and weapons violations in 2017. The opposition has demanded a probe into the auction and the ministry's conduct. It has also asked for information about who sanctioned the transaction. They also alleged that the winners of the Bitcoin auction were demanding their funds back and wanted to know how they would be compensated. The Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek was forced to resign because of the scandal. However, he denied any wrongdoing, adding that he resigned to protect the government's reputation in an election year. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses for a third consecutive day as escalating tensions in the Middle East plunged the markets into chaos. The flagship cryptocurrency surged past $110,000 at the beginning of the week, fueling speculations of a move past $111,000 and a new all-time high. However, global tensions flared after Israel launched preemptive strikes on Iran, targeting its military and nuclear facilities. As a result, BTC plunged below $105,000, falling to a low of $102,832. BTC’s sudden decline sent shockwaves through the market, dragging the broader crypto ecosystem down. As a result, the crypto market cap fell over 4% to $3.24 trillion. 10x Research discussed Bitcoin’s price action in a post on X, stating, “Bitcoin Just Lost Its Breakout — Here’s the Support Level That Matters Now. Bitcoin’s breakout above $106,000 didn’t hold, and that could mean more than just a failed rally. Bitcoin needed to hold above the $106,000 breakout level. Falling back below this threshold invalidates the Monday breakout signal and reinforces our cautious stance.” The decline caught an optimistic market, buoyed by recent positive price action, completely off guard. As a result, over $427 million in long positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. BTC was trading around $109,000-$110,000 a day prior, fueling speculations about a move to a new all-time high. While BTC has dropped substantially, gold and oil prices have surged. However, analysts believe this trend could reverse soon if historical trends are anything to go by. Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano highlighted the same in a post on X, stating that “Oil up. Gold up. Bitcoin down. The initial reaction follows exactly what happened when Iran shot 300 missiles at Israel. Bitcoin ended up outperforming the other two over the first 48 hours in that situation. Will be interesting to see what happens here.” BTC faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday (June 2), falling to an intraday low of $103,768 before recovering to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,902. The price fell back into the red on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $015,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. It recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $104,378. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged over 4%, crossing the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settling at $110,251. Bulls lost momentum after reaching this level, and the price fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday. However, it recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. Bearish sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42% to $108,687. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at 105,828. The price fell to a low of $102,832 during the ongoing session as markets turned bearish but has made a marginal recovery to move to $104,816.

2025-06-13T15:11:43,"Bitcoin slips 4% to $103K amid sell-offs","Bitcoin slipped to a low of $103,100 in the past 36 hours, a 4.0% decline from its weekly high. The downturn coincided with a 10-point drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, now sitting at 61, its lowest in the week. According to a poll conducted by market intelligence platform Santiment Feed on social platform X, more than 50% of respondents are in support of “buying the dip.” Meanwhile, 28% said they expect prices to fall further below $100,000 and are prepared to sell their holdings. Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is 61. Greed Current price: $104,493 pic.twitter.com/u3EeLb7fhN — Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (@BitcoinFear) June 13, 2025 Even after Friday’s sell-off, Bitcoin has recovered modestly to trade near $105,000, ahead of the expiration of roughly 28,000 Bitcoin options contracts, worth an estimated $3 billion. Similar expiries last week had minimal impact on the spot market, but BTC’s recent price action shows there could be a further pullback in prices. On-chain data mulls accumulation amid pullback On Tuesday, June 11, Bitcoin briefly surged back to $110,000, testing its all-time high last reached in late May. Yet, per CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan, whales refrained from profit-taking. On-chain data from the analytics platform showed that large holders added to their positions instead of exiting the market. That day alone, accumulation wallets received 30,784 BTC, worth approximately $3.3 billion, raising their collective holdings to 2.91 million BTC. The average entry price for these wallets now stands around $64,000. Amr Taha, an on-chain analyst, indicated a growing divergence between Bitcoin’s price and Binance’s Open Interest (OI). Although the price retested all-time highs on June 11, Binance’s OI failed to match levels seen during the previous peak in late May. This discrepancy hints at weakening participation in the futures market, often a precursor to short-term volatility. Stablecoin withdrawals and negative net taker volume spell red Over $750 million worth of stablecoins were removed in recent days, a move reminiscent of similar outflows on May 29. Analysts say such large-scale withdrawals often reflect de-risking behavior or capital rotation when they align with price highs. Binance’s Net Taker Volume, a measure of selling versus buying, spiked to -$197 million, the most negative reading since June 6. The metric shows traders could be dumping Bitcoin at market prices rather than placing passive orders, also deemed as panic-selling. BTC Net Taker Volume Chart | Source: CryptoQuant The seven-hour moving average of this indicator has remained negative since June 12. Still, looking at previous occurrences, such extreme net-taker sell-offs have also marked short-term bottoms. For instance, after a similar reading on June 6, Bitcoin rebounded by 4% within 24 hours. “ The net taker volume and geopolitical panic have created a high-risk, high-reward setup. While short-term volatility may persist, the conditions resemble past recovery scenarios ,” analyst Tah commented. Friday’s downturn was compounded by an early morning military strike by Israel on Iran, triggering sell-offs across global risk assets. Crypto markets were hit especially hard, with leveraged long positions unwound en masse as traders scrambled to exit positions. Analysts note that high-risk assets like Bitcoin are liquidity sources during times of crisis, which could be why exit positions and liquidations spiked during the early Asian trading sessions. The combination of fear and technical exhaustion may have driven Bitcoin’s drop from $110,000 to $103,000. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-13T15:00:30,"Bitcoin At $1 Million? CEO Says It’s The Price To Beat Gold","According to CNBC’s Power Lunch, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz thinks Bitcoin could climb all the way to $1 million per coin if big institutions keep piling in. The cryptocurrency hit a weekly peak of $110,290 on Tuesday. It slipped 4.5% to $104,300 by Thursday, but it’s still climbed 1.75% over the past seven days. Novogratz says this isn’t just hype. He points to firms moving cash from dollars and gold into crypto. Related Reading: BTC Is Just 0.2% Of Global Wealth — And That’s Why It’s Not Too Late: Analyst Institutional Moves Up Demand BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) went live in January 2024 after SEC approval. Based on reports, that fund now gives big investors a straightforward path to own Bitcoin without buying coins directly. BlackRock manages about $11.6 trillion in assets. When a player that size steps in, others notice. Novogratz says wealth managers and pension funds have started treating Bitcoin like a macro asset, on par with gold and the S&P 500. Growing Corporate Interest Treasury companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to follow suit. Retail investors keep buying, too, thanks to easier trading apps and ETFs like IBIT. A handful of public companies have raised millions to buy Bitcoin outright.

Their moves chip away at the 21 million-coin supply, making each remaining Bitcoin scarcer. Bitcoin Versus Gold Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is hard-wired into its code. Gold, by comparison, has a market worth north of $12 trillion and sees about 1–2% new supply each year through mining. Novogratz argues that younger investors will choose a capped digital asset over a metal bar. That switch isn’t guaranteed, but once people see Bitcoin as a store of value, its appeal could grow. At today’s $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin has room to expand many times over if it ever rivals gold. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Challenges Ahead Regulators remain a wildcard. The SEC green-lit IBIT, but future rules on taxes or derivatives could slow things down. Bitcoin’s price swings make it riskier than bonds or gold. Institutions often chase stable returns, and Bitcoin pays no dividends or interest. Finally, moving another $10 trillion into crypto would need a massive shift in asset allocations. That kind of inflow isn’t impossible, but it won’t happen overnight. Based on reports, Novogratz sees Bitcoin’s march toward gold’s market cap as a “ball rolling down a hill.” He predicts that, over time, Bitcoin will match gold and then outpace it.

2025-06-13T15:00:30,"Crypto Con: Aussie Adviser Banned 10 Years Over $9.6 Million Scam","Australia’s financial watchdog has slapped a decade-long ban on a Sydney-based adviser after she sent client funds into a crypto operation flagged as risky. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) says Glenda Maree Rogan moved A$14.8 million ($9.6 million) into a platform already marked as unlicensed. Clients, family and friends reportedly lost out when their money vanished into what ASIC calls a likely scam. Adviser Accused Of Misleading Clients According to ASIC , Rogan pitched a “high-yield fixed-interest account” between May 2014 and February 2024. She worked as an accountant and financial adviser at Fincare firms in Sutherland and Wollongong. But rather than place the funds in secure accounts, multiple transfers went into her personal and company bank records. Many of those funds then converted to crypto and sent on to Financial Centre, a platform ASIC warns “should not be trusted.” Funds Routed Through Personal Accounts Based on reports, Rogan moved money from March 2022 through June 2023. During that 16-month stretch, she sent A$14.8 million into personal and corporate accounts before pushing most of it into crypto . Investigators say she must have doubted the platform’s legitimacy by October 2022, yet went ahead anyway. Family members and close friends who invested under her advice are now caught up in an ongoing probe. 10-Year Ban Imposed ASIC announced the 10-year prohibition took effect on June 6, 2025. Under the ban, Rogan cannot provide or control any financial services business. The regulator said she is “not a fit and proper person” and likely to break financial services laws if allowed to continue. Her license expired on February 8, 2024, and she has been unlicensed since then. Rogan can appeal through the Administrative Review Tribunal, but for now her name sits on ASIC’s banned and disqualified register. Broader Crypto Crackdown This move comes amid a wider push against shady crypto operations in Australia. On June 3, AUSTRAC rolled out new rules and set transaction caps for crypto ATMs to stem scams. In April, inactive crypto exchanges were told to de-register or face cancellation. And in February, AUSTRAC took action against 13 remittance firms and exchanges, with more than 50 under review for potential breaches. Regulators are making clear that unlicensed services will face rapid enforcement. Investors are being urged to check ASIC’s register before handing over cash. High promised returns, especially in crypto, should raise red flags. Anyone hitting a supposed “guarantee” might be staring at an unregulated scheme. While ASIC continues its inquiry into Rogan, this case underlines just how careful people must be when a trusted adviser steers them toward something that sounds too good to be true.

2025-06-13T15:00:03,"SWC Bitcoin Holdings Soar: The Smarter Web Company Advances Ambitious Digital Asset Initiative","BitcoinWorld SWC Bitcoin Holdings Soar: The Smarter Web Company Advances Ambitious Digital Asset Initiative In a move signaling continued confidence in the digital asset space, The Smarter Web Company (SWC), a London-listed technology firm, recently announced a significant increase in its Bitcoin reserves. This strategic decision is part of the company’s long-term vision, dubbed “The 10 Year Plan,” which emphasizes the growing importance of digital assets in a modern corporate framework. For those tracking the intersection of traditional business and the evolving world of cryptocurrency, this development from The Smarter Web Company is a notable point of interest. What Does the Latest Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for SWC? On June 13, The Smarter Web Company confirmed it had acquired an additional 74.27 BTC. This latest Bitcoin acquisition is not an isolated event but rather a deliberate step within a predefined corporate strategy. The amount itself, while specific, adds substantially to their existing reserves, demonstrating a tangible commitment to their stated goals regarding digital assets. Understanding the context of this purchase requires looking at the company’s broader plan and their existing holdings. Understanding SWC Bitcoin Holdings: A Growing Stack Following this recent purchase, SWC Bitcoin holdings have reached a total of 242.34 BTC. This figure represents the cumulative result of their acquisitions under their digital asset initiative. To put this into perspective, while not on the scale of major corporate holders like MicroStrategy or Tesla, it positions The Smarter Web Company as a technology firm actively integrating Bitcoin into its treasury strategy. The increase from previous holdings indicates a consistent approach to accumulating this asset over time, aligning with a long-term investment horizon. Exploring The Smarter Web Company’s Corporate Bitcoin Strategy The rationale behind holding Bitcoin as part of a corporate Bitcoin strategy is multifaceted. For companies like The Smarter Web Company, it can serve several potential purposes: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential store of value in an environment of currency devaluation concerns. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset (potentially) to traditional cash or bond holdings. Exposure to a New Asset Class: Gaining direct exposure to the growth potential of the cryptocurrency market. Signal to Market: Demonstrating forward-thinking and an understanding of technological trends to investors and customers. SWC’s public announcement frames this within their “The 10 Year Plan,” suggesting a long-term commitment rather than short-term speculation. This indicates a belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value and role in the future economy. Why Are Companies Pursuing a Digital Asset Initiative? The trend of companies adopting a digital asset initiative is gaining momentum across various sectors, particularly in technology. Beyond the specific case of The Smarter Web Company, the broader movement reflects a shift in how corporate treasuries and strategic planners view non-traditional assets. Key drivers include: Belief in the underlying technology (blockchain). Potential for significant returns, despite volatility. Increasing institutional acceptance and infrastructure. Exploring use cases beyond investment, such as payments or decentralized finance (though SWC’s focus appears to be treasury). However, this strategy is not without its challenges, including regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, security risks, and accounting complexities. Companies undertaking such initiatives must carefully weigh these factors. The Implications for The Smarter Web Company and the Market For The Smarter Web Company , this continued accumulation reinforces their stated commitment to their “The 10 Year Plan” and its digital asset component. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the company sees long-term value in holding Bitcoin. For the wider market, such announcements from publicly listed technology firms contribute to the narrative of increasing corporate adoption, which is often viewed positively by crypto investors as it signals maturity and broader acceptance of the asset class. Key Takeaways: SWC made a notable Bitcoin acquisition of 74.27 BTC. Total SWC Bitcoin holdings now stand at 242.34 BTC. This is part of a defined corporate Bitcoin strategy under “The 10 Year Plan.” The move highlights the growing trend of companies pursuing a digital asset initiative . It signals The Smarter Web Company’s long-term view on Bitcoin’s role. Conclusion: A Strategic Step in a Digital Future The recent Bitcoin acquisition by The Smarter Web Company underscores a deliberate and ongoing strategic pivot towards integrating digital assets into its core financial planning. With SWC Bitcoin holdings growing, the company is actively pursuing its “The 10 Year Plan,” positioning itself within the evolving landscape where a robust digital asset initiative is seen as a potential driver of future value and stability. This move by The Smarter Web Company provides another data point in the broader trend of corporate adoption of Bitcoin, signaling a belief in its long-term potential despite the inherent volatility of the crypto market.

Will Altcoin Season Begin in H2,2025 or Differed to 2026? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum price is closely following the star token Bitcoin, which has been printing massive bearish candles for the past few days. The ETH price also dropped from $2800 once again; that has turned this level into a crucial barrier. With this, the price has confirmed a correction that may go deeper if the bulls fail to defend the local support below $2400. But why is the Ethereum price dropping? Will it ever reach $3000 in 2025? The crypto markets were hard hit by the ongoing geopolitical tensions between the middle-east nations, Israel and Iran. the markets experienced more than a billion liquidations in the past 24 hours, which compelled the top token to trigger an inverse v-shaped rejection. Currently, the ETH price has lost all the gains it incurred in the past couple of days and hence an invalidation of a bullish pattern is believed to adversely impact the Ethereum price rally. As seen in the above chart, the ETH price is still hopeful of a strong rebound as the levels remain within a parallel channel despite the rejection. On the other hand, the price continues to trade between 50 & 200 day MA that aim for a bullish crossover or the Golden cross. Meanwhile, the RSI remains stuck within a descending parallel channel, which could be a huge concern for the upcoming price action. Hence, the Ethereum price is now believed to test the lower support of the channel close to $2400, if the correction intensifies, followed by a strong rebound to the resistance. Will the Altsesason be Delayed Beyond 2025? Although the Ethereum bulls are defending the price from the critical support, the chart patterns have not yet confirmed the rise over the bearish trend. In the meantime, the Bitcoin dominance has begun to rise, which suggests the liquidity flow has yet again begun into the star token. The Altcoin season index had risen beyond Bitcoin, which was speculated to trigger an Altseason, but the levels have again dropped, hinting towards a BTC season. The current market conditions are not in favor of an Altseason as the altcoins do not show any major change in the short term. This suggests the Bitcoin price could remain at the centre stage and hence the other altcoins are expected to follow. Hence, the Altseason may not trigger in the short term but with the change in the market conditions, one can expect the rise of altcoins, provided Bitcoin dominance drops below 55.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/is-ethereum-really-going-to-3000-will-altcoin-season-begin-in-h22025-or-differed-to-2026/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum",cryptocompare

Fidelity Bitcoin holdings. Source: Bitbo FBTC vs IBIT The numbers put Fidelity’s fund among the largest institutional Bitcoin holders. To put this in perspective, with approximately 19.88 million BTC currently in circulation, Fidelity’s position represents roughly 0.947% of all existing Bitcoin. This wasn’t built overnight. Since launching in January 2024, FBTC has steadily attracted investor money, pulling in $12.1 billion in net inflows during its first year alone, according to ETF.com analysis . That made it the second-most successful Bitcoin ETF launch after BlackRock’s IBIT . Fidelity has been involved in digital assets longer than most traditional financial firms. The company began researching blockchain technology in 2014 , well before launching FBTC. Of course, Fidelity isn’t operating in a vacuum.

2025-06-13T14:43:00,"LATAM crypto news: Brazil moves to tax crypto assets, USDT gains in Bolivia","Latin America’s crypto scene continues to evolve, with new products and regional expansions highlighting its rapid growth. This week’s most notable news is that Brazil has proposed a new regulation to bring cryptocurrencies under financial market tax rules. On the other hand, stablecoins such as USDT are increasingly being used in Bolivia in daily transactions, with some stores now showing pricing in USDT rather than the local currency. Brazil moves to tax crypto assets On Wednesday, the Brazilian federal government proposed a temporary legislation that drastically alters taxation on financial investments by expressly bringing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and stablecoins under general financial market tax rules for the first time. The proposal replaces an unpopular IOF directive and seeks to increase public revenue without raising direct taxes on individuals, a policy supported by the Ministry of Finance. Under the new law, crypto assets will be taxed at a single rate of 17.5%, regardless of how long they are kept — a significant departure from the existing income tax scheme, which benefited long-term investors. The legislation also eliminates tax breaks for traditional assets such as LCIs and LCAs, raises corporate tax obligations for fintechs and crypto platforms, and permits profits and losses from all financial assets to be deducted in annual tax returns. USDT gains ground in Bolivia Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has noted the growing use of USDT in Bolivia , where economic insecurity and currency depreciation have prompted residents to seek more solid financial instruments. As a result, stablecoins such as USDT are increasingly being used in daily transactions, with some stores now showing pricing in USDT rather than bolivianos. Financial institutions, notably the Banco de Crédito de Bolivia, have begun to offer fee-free international USDT transfers, showing a growing acceptance of digital assets. The inclusion of USDT into Bolivia’s financial environment represents a subtle but significant shift. Businesses, such as candy and snack shops, now price items in USDT, while banks like Banco Bisa provide custody and transaction services for the stable token. Tether’s success in Bolivia is redefining financial behaviour. It may pave the path for future cryptocurrency adoption, including the possible establishment of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the “Boliviano Virtual.” Crypto remittances surge in Latin America According to a recent research by Chainalysis and AUSTRAC, crypto remittances in Latin America have increased by 40% in the last year. Argentina received the most cryptocurrency remittances in the region ($91 million) in 2024, followed by Mexico ($12 million). This trend demonstrates a shift toward speedier, lower-cost cross-border payments via cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and stablecoins, particularly in countries undergoing economic troubles. Latin America is now ranked 14th in the world for cryptocurrency ATM installations, with Mexico and Brazil adding 90 and 70 machines, respectively. El Salvador continues to have the lowest transaction fees, boosting cryptocurrency remittances, which account for approximately 24% of its GDP. Access to digital assets is becoming more popular, with platforms like CryptoMKT offering real-time conversion to local currency and CoinFlip’s new kiosks debuting in Mexico.

The registration, listed as “Invesco Galaxy Solana Trust,” does not guarantee a listing or approval but allows the firms to move forward with regulatory filings. The structure mirrors similar trusts filed by VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and others in recent months, as asset managers seek to expand crypto exchange-traded fund offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Delaware statutory trusts are commonly used for commodity and digital asset funds. The registration sets the stage for an eventual S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a 19b-4 submission through a national exchange.

The agency has historically denied crypto ETFs due to concerns about market surveillance and custody.

David Duong, the exchange’s global head of research, says in a new monthly outlook that the “specter of recession has diminished.” “A few months ago, we wrote that crypto performance would find its low in 1H25 and make new all-time highs in 2H25. We still believe this will be the case, despite the recent bounce for bitcoin prices in late May, which is to say that directionally, we think there could be more upside over the next 3-6 months. In our view, the peak of the macro disruption caused by the tariff saga is now behind us. Looking ahead, risk sentiment should broadly benefit from the US government’s pivot towards more market-friendly policies with a new legislative fiscal package likely to be completed by late summer.” Duong warns, however, that the US government’s spending bill could spike the US Treasury yield curve in the 10-30-year area. The analyst notes that deficit concerns already triggered the US 30Y bond yields to reach 5.15% in May, the highest level in two decades. “That could tighten financial conditions more than expected, raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers and potentially undermining the growth needed to justify our market optimism. If long-term yields rise too quickly, we think that this could trigger volatility in equities and credit markets, particularly if investors begin to doubt the US’s ability to sustain higher deficits without adverse consequences.” Duong argues that such a scenario could serve as a boon for the prospects of store-of-value assets like gold and Bitcoin over altcoins.

2025-06-13T14:24:44,"Pi Coin Price Prediction: Failed KYC? Broken Balances? Why This Mess Might Set Off a PI Supply Shock","The Pi Coin price has plunged by 12% today, with its drop to $0.5525 coming after Israel launched airstrikes against Iran overnight. PI’s issues don’t end there, however, since the alt is also down by 16% in a fortnight and 53% in a month, while also suffering an 81.5% drop since reaching an ATH of $2.99 in late February. It has suffered more than other alts during the past few weeks for various reasons, yet one of the most damaging is the fact that many PI holders are continuing to report issues with claiming their tokens. This ongoing concern continues to weaken faith in PI, and when coupled with the lack of major exchange listings, it potentially indicates a disappointing long-term Pi Coin price prediction . Pi Coin Price Prediction: Failed KYC? Broken Balances? Why This Mess Might Set Off a PI Supply Shock Despite completing the migration to its mainnet in February and March, Pi Network continues to face issues with complaints that users still can’t access their PI tokens, even after completing the necessary KYC steps. When will my mainnet migration happen? People who I referred are verified and I'm still stuck. My KYC has been passed, I keep pressing the mining button like a zombie everyday. To all the people who are in the same situation as me, Retweet this so that it reaches the leadership… — AK (@AKonchain) June 7, 2025 This has been an issue since the migration commenced in February, with the Pi Core Team receiving angry replies to almost every message and update they posted on X. Pi Network has been addressing these issues in several ways, including posting advice on the correct wallet address to use in transferring PI, yet issues and complaints persist. Recent days have also witnessed a large PI holder – possibly connected with the Pi Foundation – taking millions in the token out of exchanges , which has raised concerns of a supply squeeze. And if we look at PI’s chart today, we see that it has fallen sharply and arguably bottomed out, with its RSI (purple) plunging to 20 this morning, a strongly oversold position. Source: TradingView This would mean that the Pi Coin price is massively overdue a big rebound, although critics would argue that it has entered a death spiral and may never properly recover. Its trading volume had been reading below $100 million for a week prior to today’s selloff, indicating an alarming lack of wider interest in the token. And given that users continue to report problems in fully migrating and claiming tokens, the crypto may struggle to attract the major exchange listings (e.g. Binance, Coinbase) that could significantly boost its price. As such, we may see it drop below $0.50 in the next couple of weeks, although a market-wide recovery and good Pi Network news could see it return to $1 by the end of the summer. Bitcoin Hyper Raises $1.1 Million As Anticipation for Layer-Two Platform Intesifies Many traders may remain unconvinced as far as PI goes, in which case they may prefer to invest in alternatives, including newer tokens with more potential upside. Finding the most promising new tokens is difficult, however, but one way of making things easier is to look for popular presales, which can often end with big post-listing rallies. A strong example of a new presale coin is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a layer-two project that launched its ICO last month, and has already raised $1.1 million. Bitcoin Hyper is designed to break through Bitcoin’s core limitations. $HYPER is the ultimate evolution of the OG. https://t.co/VNG0P4FWNQ pic.twitter.com/SwzxaQN4En — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) May 22, 2025 Bitcoin Hyper is developing a layer-two network for Bitcoin, tapping into the immense value of the Bitcoin network but also providing the speed and scalability that the proof-of-work cryptocurrency lacks in relation to newer rivals. Bitcoin Hyper will launch on the Ethereum network, while later expanding to include a Solana-compatible version, giving it a wide reach within the crypto ecosystem. It will work by enabling Bitcoin holders to deposit and lock up their BTC, receiving an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Hyper-based BTC. Users will then be able to use their BTC with an expanding range of DeFi apps and protocols, putting their holdings to work. Assuming that Bitcoin Hyper will attract adoption and grow steadily, its native token HYPER could see lots of demand. It’s necessary to pay for gas fees, while it will also be usable with apps and as a governance token. Investors can buy it early by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website , where it costs $0.011875. This price will rise in just under two days, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later. The post Pi Coin Price Prediction: Failed KYC? Broken Balances?

A comprehensive bounce is now underway. Can this recovery continue? Israel/Iran conflict develops When looking at the potential for a big recovery for Bitcoin it must be borne in mind that the situation in the Israel/Iran conflict is extremely uncertain. The ‘preemptive’ attack by Israel on Iran is said to have inflicted much damage on Iran’s nuclear capabilities, and a “harsh response” has been promised by Tehran. A continuation of this conflict could have further repercussions for global markets. The S&P 500 Futures is down around -1% so far, and with the US stock market opening very shortly it is to be wondered just how far the major indices might fall. $BTC correction tests strong support Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows the extent of the correction, but also how a long wick down touched not only the horizontal support above $202,000, but in addition retested the descending trendline that comes from the all-time high. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI looks ready to turn positive once again, while the Relative Strength Index has just had its indicator bounce from the oversold level. Bulls set on regaining $107,000 as support Source: TradingView The daily chart for $BTC shows that the price is continuing to recover and that the candle wick to the downside is getting longer as the price climbs. Now above $105,000, the route back to $107,000, which has now become resistance, is not too far away. Regaining this level would be a triumph for the bulls and could augur a return to the heights of $110,000 and above. Weekly candle close above $105,000 would be a win for the bulls Source: TradingView The weekly chart reveals how the current candle is being pulled to and fro by the bulls and bears, with the prize at the end of the week a closure either above or below the $105,000 horizontal support level. As things stand, the bulls may be favourites to win, given that all the short-term Stochastic RSI momentum indicators have reset to the bottom.

2025-06-13T14:21:20,"Polkadot’s $50M Bitcoin Reserve Gamble: Community Clashes Over 500K DOT DCA Plan—Hedge or Risk?","A new proposal to convert 500,000 DOT, worth roughly $50 million, into Bitcoin has sparked debate within the Polkadot community. The plan, introduced by a community member known as hippiestank, seeks to diversify the Polkadot treasury and improve its long-term financial stability through the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Community Split Over Plan to Turn 500K DOT Into Bitcoin for Strategic Hedge Introduced in early June, the plan suggests using a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach to gradually accumulate Threshold Bitcoin (tBTC) over the course of one year. According to the proposal, BTC could act as a hedge during market downturns while deepening on-chain liquidity and boosting incentives for Polkadot’s DeFi ecosystem. However, not everyone is convinced. POLKADOT COMMUNITY EYES BITCOIN RESERVE USING 501,000 DOT – The Polkadot community floated a proposal to create a Bitcoin reserve using 501,000 $DOT . Key Details: – The proposal plans to convert 500,000 DOT into tBTC, a Bitcoin-backed token on Ethereum, using Hydration’s… pic.twitter.com/YXSQVhc9fE — BSCN (@BSCNews) June 13, 2025 The plan would use Hydration’s automated system to carry out the conversions. It involves topping up a proxy account that feeds into a rolling DCA schedule. A small amount, 0.005 tBTC, would also be added to the Hydration Omnipool, enabling liquidity provisioning through Threshold Network’s decentralized bridge. The projected rate sets 1 DOT at roughly 0.000041 tBTC. The idea has divided the Polkadot community. Supporters view Bitcoin as a hedge against market uncertainty and a way to preserve value. “This proposal is about risk management and operational continuity, not market timing or speculation,” the proposer wrote in the forum discussion. They argued that waiting for ideal market conditions would make diversification impossible and leave the treasury exposed. Critics, however, question the plan’s timing. DOT is currently trading near yearly lows, while Bitcoin is holding steady above $100,000. One community member commented, “I just don’t see how we can do this and for it to really provide any value, short or long term… it’s likely to do more harm than good with the additional downward pressure that we’re already contending with.” Despite the concerns, the proposal argues the move isn’t about timing the market but protecting the network’s future. “I believe the ‘DOT ATL, BTC ATH’ argument misframes the situation. This proposal is about risk management and operational continuity, not market timing or speculation.” the proposer wrote . Others expressed concerns about transparency and community outreach. One participant suggested the proposal should be shared with a broader audience on X (formerly Twitter) before advancing. The concern reflects a deeper tension within the ecosystem about how much authority should be granted to a smaller group of forum contributors versus wider community engagement. Discussions are still ongoing, but the author of the proposal says the vote could go on-chain as early as next week, depending on feedback. If passed, Polkadot would become one of the few blockchain ecosystems experimenting with a Bitcoin-backed treasury, an idea that could set precedent across the space. Whether the proposal is a safeguard or a risk remains a matter of heated debate. For now, the decision rests with the community. Corporate Bitcoin Reserves Surge as Polkadot Joins Institutional Trend Polkadot’s $50 million Bitcoin reserve move is part of a broader shift, as more companies look to Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Just yesterday, Nasdaq-listed fintech firm Mercurity announced plans to raise $800 million to establish a long-term Bitcoin reserve. Mercurity Fintech Holding, a digital finance firm traded on Nasdaq, has announced plans to raise $800 million to establish a Bitcoin reserve. #Bitcoin #Mercurity https://t.co/wW04xWFkRx — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 12, 2025 The company aims to integrate BTC into its blockchain-native reserve framework through custody, staking, and tokenized treasury management solutions. If completed, Mercurity’s reserve would place it among the world’s top corporate Bitcoin holders—just ahead of GameStop, according to data from Bitbo. This momentum reflects a sharp rise in institutional adoption. As of June 2025, at least 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up from 124 just a year ago. Collectively, these firms hold over 819,000 BTC, or roughly 3.9% of Bitcoin’s total supply, based on data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. Meanwhile, Polkadot is also doubling down on crypto-native tools. A community-approved launch of a non-custodial, Visa-compatible Polkadot payment card signals broader ambitions in crypto-finance, with Bitcoin now at the heart of that playbook. From fintech firms to blockchain ecosystems, corporate Bitcoin adoption is no longer the exception, it’s becoming the strategy.

2025-06-13T14:20:56,"CFTC: Caroline Pham Provides Crucial Clarity on US Crypto Enforcement","BitcoinWorld CFTC: Caroline Pham Provides Crucial Clarity on US Crypto Enforcement Are you keeping an eye on how regulators in the United States view the rapidly evolving world of digital assets? Specifically, what does the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ), a key player in the space, think about the balance between fostering innovation and cracking down on bad actors? If you’ve heard whispers about a potentially more favorable stance towards crypto from certain political corners, you might wonder if it signals a free pass. Well, CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham recently offered some crucial clarity on this very topic, directly addressing the landscape of Crypto Regulation US . What Does CFTC Crypto Enforcement Look Like Now? In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, as reported by Cointelegraph, Caroline Pham made it unequivocally clear: supporting the growth and innovation within the crypto sector does not equate to a green light for breaking the law. This is a vital distinction for anyone operating or investing in the US Crypto Market . For a while, there was a perception that regulators, including the CFTC , were relying heavily on ‘regulation by enforcement’ – essentially, setting precedents by suing companies after the fact, rather than providing clear rules upfront. Pham expressed approval of the CFTC ‘s move away from this approach. She indicated a strategic shift towards a more focused effort. So, what’s the priority now? According to Pham, the agency is zeroing in on addressing fraud and scams within the crypto market. This focus is intended to protect market participants and maintain integrity, ensuring that while innovation can thrive, it doesn’t do so on the backs of victims of illicit schemes. Think of it this way: Old Approach (Perceived): Less clear rules, more reactive lawsuits to define boundaries. New Approach (Described by Pham): Aiming for clearer guidance (though this is an ongoing process across agencies), with a sharp, proactive focus on identifying and prosecuting outright fraudulent activities and scams. This doesn’t mean legitimate businesses are off the hook for compliance, but it highlights where the CFTC is directing its most aggressive enforcement resources. Who is Caroline Pham and What’s Her Vision for Crypto? As the Acting Chair, Caroline Pham plays a significant role in shaping the CFTC ‘s approach to digital assets. Her background and statements offer insight into the potential direction of Crypto Regulation US . Her perspective seems to be one that acknowledges the transformative potential of crypto technology while emphasizing the fundamental need for market integrity and consumer protection. Her comments about the Trump administration’s previously stated pro-crypto stance are particularly interesting. She interpreted this not as a mandate for lax rules, but rather as support for allowing the industry to develop. However, this support comes with the crucial caveat that growth and innovation must happen within the confines of existing laws. Breaking the law, regardless of a supportive political climate, will still face CFTC Crypto Enforcement . Pham also clarified a previous remark where she used the phrase ‘uberizing crypto’. This wasn’t just a catchy term; she described it as a vision for the future where digital assets become so deeply integrated into our daily economic lives that attempting to ban them would be impractical, much like trying to ban ride-sharing apps after they became ubiquitous. This vision suggests a regulatory path focused on managing and overseeing an integrated technology, rather than attempting to suppress it entirely. It implies a need for regulatory frameworks that can accommodate widespread adoption while still safeguarding against risks in the US Crypto Market . Navigating the US Crypto Market : Key Considerations For participants in the US Crypto Market , Pham’s statements underscore the importance of understanding the regulatory landscape. While the vision of an ‘uberized’ crypto future is optimistic about integration, the immediate reality is that regulators like the CFTC and the SEC are actively scrutinizing the space. The focus on fraud and scams by the CFTC means that projects, platforms, and individuals must be scrupulous in their operations, particularly concerning how they handle customer funds and represent investment opportunities. Here are some key takeaways for navigating this environment: Compliance is Non-Negotiable: Do not assume that a ‘pro-crypto’ political stance removes the need to comply with existing securities, commodities, and anti-fraud laws. Focus on Transparency: Be clear and honest in all dealings, especially regarding risks associated with digital assets. Understand Jurisdiction: While the CFTC focuses on commodities and derivatives, other agencies like the SEC have jurisdiction over securities. Many crypto assets exist in a grey area, making understanding which rules apply crucial. Beware of Scams: As an investor, be extra vigilant about schemes promising unrealistic returns or pressuring quick decisions. The CFTC is watching, but prevention is the best defense. The complexity of Crypto Regulation US remains a challenge, but Pham’s comments provide a clearer picture of the CFTC ‘s current enforcement priorities. The Future of Crypto Regulation US : Balancing Innovation and Oversight The conversation around Crypto Regulation US is far from over. While the CFTC under Acting Chair Pham is signaling a focus on the most egregious misconduct, the broader regulatory picture involves multiple agencies and ongoing legislative discussions. The ‘uberization’ concept, while a future vision, highlights the need for regulators to think proactively about how digital assets will integrate into the economy. This means: Developing rules that are adaptable to rapidly changing technology. Fostering inter-agency cooperation (between CFTC , SEC, FinCEN, etc.) to avoid conflicting guidance. Educating both consumers and industry participants about risks and responsibilities. The goal, from a regulatory perspective, is to allow the benefits of blockchain technology and digital assets to flourish while mitigating systemic risks and protecting individuals from harm. CFTC Crypto Enforcement is a critical tool in achieving this balance, specifically targeting those who would exploit the technology for illicit gain. Why the CFTC ‘s Role in Crypto is Crucial The CFTC ‘s mandate covers commodity markets, and certain digital assets, like Bitcoin and potentially Ether, have been viewed as commodities. This places the agency squarely in the middle of crypto regulation. Their work in overseeing derivatives markets, like Bitcoin futures, gives them significant insight into the dynamics of crypto trading and potential areas for manipulation or fraud. Acting Chair Pham’s emphasis on moving away from ‘regulation by enforcement’ as a primary method, while sharpening the focus on fraud and scams, is a significant statement. It suggests a desire for more clarity and targeted action. For the US Crypto Market to mature and gain broader adoption, having regulatory bodies like the CFTC provide clear expectations and demonstrate effective, focused enforcement is essential. It builds confidence among institutional players and provides a layer of protection for retail investors. In conclusion, Caroline Pham ‘s remarks offer valuable insight into the current thinking at the CFTC regarding digital assets. Her message is one of balanced vigilance: embrace innovation, yes, but never at the expense of the law. The focus on rooting out fraud and scams is a clear signal to the market about where the enforcement priorities lie. As the US Crypto Market continues to evolve, staying informed about regulatory developments and prioritizing compliance will be paramount for all participants.

2025-06-13T14:19:53,"Bitcoin is oversold after Israeli strike on Iran: analyst","Analysts believe that Bitcoin will likely rebound after a notable drop due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The threat of a regional war in the Middle East is escalating, and crypto markets are feeling the pressure. On Friday, June 13, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped nearly 5% to a daily low of $102,822, as Israel’s early-morning strike on Iran created risk-off sentiment in the market. While Bitcoin declined on rising tensions, crude oil surged as much as 14%, a typical trend during Middle East crises. Gold also climbed 1.74% to $3,438.36 per ounce. Still, analysts believe that crypto markets may soon bounce back, either on de-escalation or a shift in the broader Bitcoin narrative. You might also like: Why is crypto down today? Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana sink as Israel strikes Iran The attack and the subsequent market sell-off caught traders off guard, said Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and chief operating officer at RedStone. He noted $427.84 million in liquidated long positions across Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) futures. “Bitcoin dropped as much as 5% to $102,900, falling below the psychologically important $103,000 level. Ethereum shed even more, declining up to 7.6% at its worst point,” said Kazmierczak in comments sent to crypto.news. Still, he emphasized that similar incidents in the past created “temporary dislocations,” often followed by price rebounds. Strikes in April 2024 led to a similar sell-off, which reversed after tensions eased. “Those moments turned out to be great buying opportunities,” said Kazmierczak. “However, the current situation carries higher stakes given Israel’s direct targeting of Iran’s nuclear program and vows to continue operations indefinitely.” In any case, Kazmierczak believes that an escalation of conflict will hurt risk assets, including Bitcoin. The recovery, he explained, will depend on how long it takes for tensions to subside. You might also like: Is the crypto bull run still possible after Israel bombed Iran? Bitunix analyst suggests investors may flee to Bitcoin Analysts at Bitunix take a different view. While they agree that risk assets are vulnerable to Middle East conflict, they believe Bitcoin may benefit. Specifically, investors may flee to Bitcoin as a safe haven. “The conflict between Israel and Iran has pushed up the demand for risk aversion, and short-term geopolitical conflict risk aversion capital may flow into the crypto asset market. If geopolitical conflicts continue to rise, we cannot rule out the possibility of Bitcoin challenging the $110,350 liquidity target,” Bitunix analyst explained in a note. Bitunix analysts caution against emotional trading and advise that traders monitor the U.S. stance on Iran. For now, the U.S. has distanced itself from the attack but did pre-emptively relocate some troops from bases near Iran.

NEAR PROTOCOL: NEAR","The crypto market was routed as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies plummeted after Israeli military strikes on Iranian cities sparked a global sell-off. The flagship cryptocurrency traded around $108,000-$109,000 on Thursday before plunging to a low of $103,053 on Friday as market sentiment worsened and bullishness evaporated. The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 3% in the past 24 hours, trading around $104,389. Ethereum (ETH) also plunged into the red, down over 9%, slipping below $2,600. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is struggling to stay above $2,500, with sellers in control. Ripple (XRP) is down over 5%, trading around $2.12, while Solana (SOL) fell below $150 after registering a decline of almost 10% in the past 24 hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down nearly 9%, while Chainlink (LINK) is down over 9%, trading around $13.25. Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON), Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines. Crypto Markets Plunge As Middle East Tensions Escalate Bitcoin (BTC) plunged into bearish territory late on Thursday/early Friday as Israeli airstrikes on major Iranian centers escalated tensions in the Middle East. Hopes of a move to a new all-time high were dashed as investors attempted to grapple with geopolitical realities, triggering a sharp retreat across the crypto market. The sell-off also led to the liquidation of over $427 million in long positions in the past 24 hours as bearish sentiment intensified. Israeli officials confirmed targeted airstrikes near Tehran and Tabriz, calling it a preemptive response to Iran’s nuclear threat. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s words offered little comfort to markets after he said the operation was a necessary step and would continue for as many days as it takes. Iran is yet to issue a response to the airstrikes. However, state media has reported airspace closures. CFTC Does Not Plan On Giving Industry Easy Ride Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) acting Chair Caroline Pham has said the Trump administration’s relaxed attitude toward crypto does not mean the industry gets a free pass. Pham stated that just because the administration is pro-innovation and pro-growth, companies cannot get away with breaking the law. “There is no easy street for anybody, and regulators aren’t easy. Just because we are pro-innovation and pro-growth does not mean that you’re going to be able to get away with breaking the law. And this is where I’m talking about not twisting the law to criminalize an asset class or a technology, but I’m talking about lying, cheating, and stealing.” Pham added that she was pleased the CFTC could end the “regulation by enforcement” approach to crypto and refocus its attention on catching fraudsters and scammers in our markets. According to Pham, the Biden administration went beyond what the law states, adding that its aggressive approach also harmed the traditional forex and derivatives market. “When we start to change the rules for [...] global derivatives markets because we’re trying to be creative and ‘flex it’ to go after what we perceive to be bad or evil — crypto or blockchain — that is really breaking the fabric of our global markets.” FSB Warns Crypto Is Nearing A Tipping Point The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has warned about growing risks from the crypto space and its deepening ties with the traditional markets. Outgoing FSB Chair Klaas Knot said that while crypto does not yet post a systemic risk to traditional finance, that may not be the case for long. Knot highlighted that entry barriers for retail investors dropped significantly after crypto ETFs. ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without the complexities of private keys, crypto wallets, and exchanges. Knot also flagged concerns about the stablecoin market, noting that issuers now hold large amounts of US Treasurys, increasing the association between crypto and traditional markets. He added that authorities must closely monitor the stablecoin space. Stablecoins have become increasingly embedded into the financial system, with their total market cap reaching $251 billion. Binance To Allow Syrian Users To Trade In Crypto Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, will allow users in Syria to trade in crypto after the US lifted sanctions on the country last month. Binance stated that Syrians will be granted full access to its offering of over 300 cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. The exchange also added support for the Syrian pound to buy and sell crypto on the platform. The Trump administration surprised many by announcing that it was lifting sanctions against Syria after a new government seized control after overthrowing former leader Bashar-al-Assad in December. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) downward slide gathered steam as markets plunged after a significant escalation in Middle East tensions following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian military installations. As a result, BTC and the broader crypto market fell, with the flagship cryptocurrency dropping to a low of $102,832 during the ongoing session. BTC traded around $109,000 until late Thursday, with investors and market watchers hopeful about a move past $111,000 to a new all-time high. However, geopolitical realities crushed market sentiment, which turned bearish as investors sold their positions and flocked to safer assets. BTC has slumped below $105,000, with traders attempting to prevent a further decline. However, bearish sentiment has the upper hand, with the sudden slump sending shockwaves through the crypto market. BTC’s decline dragged the entire market down, with the market cap plummeting nearly 5% to $3.24 trillion. 10x Research stated in a post on X, “Bitcoin Just Lost Its Breakout — Here’s the Support Level That Matters Now. Bitcoin’s breakout above $106,000 didn’t hold, and that could mean more than just a failed rally. Bitcoin needed to hold above the $106,000 breakout level. Falling back below this threshold invalidates the Monday breakout signal and reinforces our cautious stance.” Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano pointed out that while gold and oil prices are rising and BTC is falling, this trend could reverse, adding that the market reaction was similar to when Iran launched rockets at Israel in October. “Bitcoin ended up outperforming the other two over the first 48 hours in that situation. Will be interesting to see what happens here.” BTC started the previous week with a drop to $103,768 as buyers lost momentum. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. The price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The decline was short-lived as the price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and moving to $104,378. Source: TradingView BTC remained positive over the weekend, rising .15% on Saturday and registering a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week on a bullish note, rising over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,251. BTC fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday before recovering to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. However, price action turned negative on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42% to $108,687. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,828. Bearish sentiment intensified during the ongoing session as tensions in the Middle East escalated. As a result, BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,832 before reclaiming $105,000 and moving to its current level. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) plunged to a low of $2,440 during the ongoing session as the crypto markets turned bearish after a significant escalation in Middle East tensions. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency extended its losses for a third consecutive day, indicating waning bullish momentum after a rally that saw it surge to $2,878. Investors hoped for a move beyond $3,000 before bearish sentiment took over. However, despite the decline, on-chain data has shown that ETH witnessed its largest daily withdrawal in over a month, a development that could act as a catalyst for upward momentum in the asset’s price. According to DeFi solutions provider Sentora, significant numbers of ETH left exchanges. The post highlighted the “Exchange Netflow” indicator, which measures the net amount of ETH entering or exiting wallets associated with centralized exchanges. When this metric is positive, it indicates that exchanges are receiving deposits, potentially for selling. However, when the indicator is negative, it suggests fewer exchange deposits, a sign that investors may be holding their assets for the long term. ETH started the previous week positively, rising nearly 3% to cross the 20-day SMA and settle at $2,607. The price fell back on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline, but recovered on Wednesday to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,607. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH plunged over 7%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $2,500 to $2,415. However, it recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $2,479. Price action remained positive on Saturday as ETH rose almost 2% to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,525. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH fell on Sunday, ending the weekend at $2,511 after a marginal decline. Source: TradingView ETH started the current week on a bullish note, rising nearly 7% to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,680. Bullish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as the price rose over 5% to cross the 200-day SMA and $2,800 to settle at $2,816. ETH lost momentum on Wednesday after reaching an intraday high of $2,878, dropping nearly 2% to $2,772. Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price fell 4.57%, slipping below $2,700 and settling at 2,645. The current session has seen bearish sentiment intensify as ETH fell to a low of $2,440 before recovering to reclaim $2,500. Meanwhile, a leading Geth developer has accused the Ethereum Foundation (EF) of secretly creating and funding a second Geth team. Validators use the Geth client to execute transactions. The developer stated in an X post. “EF started and funded a second Geth team inside Nethermind. One '100% independent fork from us, with no intended collaboration,' according to Josh Stark, and they didn't tell either me, Felix, or Martin until I found out in November 2025.” Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) came dangerously close to slipping below $140 during the ongoing session as it plunged to $140. SOL had surged to an intraday high of $168 as its rally peaked on Wednesday before losing momentum and falling below $150. Bearish sentiment in crypto has intensified after tensions in the Middle East escalated, threatening to cascade into a wider conflict. SOL started the previous week in the red, registering a marginal decline to $156. It raced to an intraday high of $164 on Tuesday but lost momentum after reaching this level, falling 1.05% to $155. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.29% to $153. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price dropped almost 6%, plunging below $150 and settling at $144. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, SOL rebounded on Friday, rising 2.47% and settling at $147, but not before reaching an intraday high of $152. Source: TradingView The price remained positive over the weekend, rising 1.51% on Saturday and 1.56% on Sunday to reclaim $150 and settle at $152. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rose nearly 6%, crossing $160 and the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $161. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising 2.44% to $165. However, it was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 2.48% to $161. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL plunged over 5%, slipping below the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $152. SOL fell to an intraday low of $140 during the ongoing session before recovering and moving to its current level. Despite the recovery, SOL remains down by almost 5%. Toncoin (TON) Price Analysis Toncoin (TON) faced volatility and selling pressure at the beginning of the previous week, falling to a low of $3.10 before rebounding to register a marginal increase and settle at $3.20. The price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling almost 1% to $3.18. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as TON fell to $3.16.

""Four of the five operators in our coverage reported record revenue and profits,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. In aggregate, the miners earned gross profit of about $2.0 billion with gross margins of 53%. Those figures compare with $1.7 billion and 50% in the previous quarter, the bank said. MARA Holdings (MARA) mined the most bitcoin in the bank's coverage universe for the ninth quarter in a row, the report said. IREN (IREN) earned the most gross profit of the group for the first time, the bank noted. The miner also recorded the ""lowest all-in cash cost per coin at just ~$36,400."" Conversely, MARA posted the highest cost per coin of around $72,600, the bank said. The five mining companies that the bank tracks issued only $310 million of equity in the quarter, a drop of $1 billion from the fourth quarter last year. CleanSpark (CLSK) did not raise any equity in the period, the bank noted. The bank estimated the companies spent $1.8 billion in total on power, $50 million more than in the previous quarter.

2025-06-13T14:14:07,"Here’s XRP Price Target As Analyst Predicts 27% XRP Market Dominance","A bold projection by prominent crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto has reignited excitement within the XRP community. According to his analysis, XRP could soar to $27 per coin while capturing 27% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, placing its market cap around $1.5 trillion. This ambitious outlook is rooted in historical chart data and a technical pattern that suggests XRP is on the verge of a breakout. Historical Resistance: The Fibonacci 0.5 Level EGRAG’s analysis focuses on XRP’s dominance chart, particularly its interaction with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. Historically, this level has acted as a major resistance. In both October 2019 and November 2020, XRP dominance hit this barrier before retreating, signaling the start of bearish trends. The same resistance reappeared in January and March 2025, again halting upward momentum. #XRP Dominance 27%, $27 & $1.5 T MC ONLY FEW : Chart Insights & Resistance Levels: Men lie, women lie, but charts and numbers Do not lie. The Fib 0.5 level has historically acted as a major resistance for #XRP Dominance. In October 2019 and November 2020, it served as a… pic.twitter.com/xnpyswiJTC — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 13, 2025 EGRAG uses the metaphor of “knocking on a door” to describe XRP’s repeated attempts to break past this resistance. According to him, the more times an asset tests a key level, the more likely it is to eventually break through. XRP has already knocked on this “macro door” four times. A fifth attempt, he argues, could finally lead to a breakout, one that could send XRP dominance to 27%. The Bull Flag Structure and Breakout Potential EGRAG points to a bull flag pattern forming on the dominance chart. A bull flag is a technical continuation pattern, often appearing after a strong upward move, that indicates potential for further gains. In this case, a breakout from the flag could mark the beginning of a sharp rally in XRP’s share of the overall market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Achieving 27% dominance would be significant. It would signal that XRP holds more than a quarter of the total crypto market cap, an unprecedented level of influence for any asset outside of Bitcoin in recent years. For context, such dominance would place XRP at the forefront of a maturing market increasingly focused on real-world use cases and institutional-grade infrastructure. XRP at $27 and a $1.5 Trillion Market Cap If XRP reaches 27% dominance in a $5.5 trillion total crypto market, it would command a market capitalization of approximately $1.485 trillion. At that valuation, the price per XRP would be around $27 . While this may sound far-fetched to some, EGRAG argues that the projection is mathematically sound and backed by structural chart patterns. This scenario assumes continued growth in the overall crypto market, a likely outcome as tokenization of real-world assets accelerates and institutions increasingly adopt blockchain technologies. Ripple’s global expansion, integration with central banks, and support for stablecoins like RLUSD all add practical momentum to this outlook.
