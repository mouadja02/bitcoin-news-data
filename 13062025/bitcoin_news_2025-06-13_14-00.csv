2025-06-13T11:58:03,"BlackRock XRP ETF Is Coming. Here’s the Latest","Speculation surrounding a potential XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) surged this week after influential ETF analyst Nate Geraci suggested that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is likely to expand its crypto ETF portfolio to include XRP. In a post on X, Geraci asserted that he “fully expects BlackRock to file for spot Solana and XRP ETFs,” explaining that, as a market leader in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, it would make “zero sense to cede other top crypto asset ETF categories to competitors.” Shortly after Geraci’s post, Amonyx echoed the sentiment in a bold update: “BREAKING: BlackRock XRP ETF is coming.” Though no formal filing has been made public, the momentum building behind this possibility reflects broader industry expectations that XRP could soon join the ranks of institutionally traded digital assets. BREAKING: BlackRock #XRP ETF is coming. pic.twitter.com/ZL56tykoI0 — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 13, 2025 BlackRock’s Expansion Strategy and the XRP Advantage BlackRock’s interest in digital assets has moved far beyond exploratory. Since the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become a dominant force in crypto markets, drawing billions in institutional capital. In May 2024, the SEC also approved 19b-4 filings for spot Ethereum ETFs.. With these milestones achieved, the next logical step for BlackRock is expansion into other high-liquidity digital assets. XRP stands out as a prime candidate. It is one of the oldest and most actively traded cryptocurrencies, with a deep pool of liquidity, robust exchange listings, and a well-established infrastructure through Ripple and the XRP Ledger. Geraci also noted that he expects BlackRock to file for an index-based crypto ETF — a fund likely to include XRP among other top tokens. Such a move would not only expand investor access to diversified crypto exposure but also elevate XRP’s role in institutional portfolios. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Clarity Supporting ETF Possibility A crucial factor supporting an XRP ETF is the partial legal clarity secured in Ripple’s ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security in programmatic (exchange-based) sales, effectively giving the green light for its trading on secondary markets. While the case remains active, a final resolution is expected soon. Compared to many altcoins still clouded by regulatory ambiguity, XRP enjoys a legal advantage that makes it a feasible candidate for ETF structuring. With Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already approved and launched, XRP’s combination of legal clarity, market maturity, and infrastructure strength makes it a natural next step. Market Watching for BlackRock’s Next Move Amonyx’s declaration that a “BlackRock XRP ETF is coming” may not reflect an official filing, but it aligns with a growing consensus in the financial world. BlackRock has made no secret of its ambition to dominate the crypto ETF space. Failing to secure a position in the XRP market would leave room for rivals such as Fidelity or VanEck — a move that seems unlikely given BlackRock’s aggressive strategy to lead. As the regulatory environment evolves and demand for diverse crypto investment vehicles grows, the launch of a BlackRock XRP ETF appears increasingly inevitable.

Bitcoin has substantially added to the losses, now down over 3.7% over the past 24 hours, as Israeli forces bombed at the heart of Iran’s nuclear, missile, and military complex early Friday, in unprecedented strikes. In a press briefing on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Iran’s nuclear ambitions as a “clear and present danger,” saying the “preemptive strikes” would “continue for as many days as it takes to eliminate this threat.

At its current price of $103,980, BTC remains about 6.9% down from its all-time high mark of $111,814 set in May, per data from CoinGecko . Ethereum, the industry’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, declined by 9.8% at the time of publication. Nevertheless, spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking ETH recently pulled in approximately $240 million in investments, outperforming Bitcoin ETFs for a rare instance in the funds’ histories. Other popular alternative crypto assets, like Solana’s SOL and Dogecoin (DOGE), have fallen as well, dropping roughly 10.3% and 10% respectively in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin has historically seen short-term price drops during periods of geopolitical unrest, as investors tend to shift toward safer assets. Regardless, the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency has always rebounded swiftly, buoyed by its increasing adoption as a digital store of value. Meanwhile, President Trump has continued his crusade to push Fed Chairman Jerome Powell into a more dovish stance, calling him a “numbskull” for not slashing interest rates . “I may have to force something,” threatened Trump.

2025-06-13T11:50:42,"Iran Israel Strike: Urgent Update on Escalating Middle East Tensions","BitcoinWorld Iran Israel Strike: Urgent Update on Escalating Middle East Tensions Breaking news from the Middle East indicates a significant development: the Israeli Air Force has reportedly conducted a strike within Iran. This action, reported by Axios and shared widely via platforms like X by figures such as Walter Bloomberg, marks a critical moment in the ongoing regional tensions. For those following global events and their potential ripple effects on financial markets, including the often-sensitive cryptocurrency space, understanding the nuances of this situation is paramount. This event injects a new level of Geopolitical Risk into an already volatile global landscape. Understanding the Latest Iran Israel Strike The report of an Iran Israel Strike follows a period of heightened direct confrontation between the two nations. For years, the conflict has primarily unfolded through proxies and covert operations. However, recent events saw Iran launch an unprecedented direct missile and drone attack on Israel, which Iran stated was in retaliation for a strike on its consulate in Damascus. Israel had vowed to respond to Iran’s direct attack. The reported strike in Iran appears to be that response, bringing the long-simmering conflict into a more overt phase. While details are still emerging, initial reports suggest the strike targeted specific locations within Iran. The nature and extent of the damage, as well as Iran’s official response, are key factors that will determine the immediate trajectory of the situation. The world watches closely, assessing the potential for further escalation. Why Geopolitical Risk Matters for Global Markets Major geopolitical events inherently introduce uncertainty, which financial markets dislike. An increase in Geopolitical Risk can trigger significant reactions across various asset classes. Historically, conflicts in the Middle East, a region central to global energy supplies, have had pronounced effects on oil prices. Rising oil prices can contribute to inflation, impacting monetary policy decisions by central banks worldwide. This, in turn, influences everything from bond yields to stock valuations. Beyond energy, heightened tensions can disrupt supply chains, affect international trade, and dampen investor confidence. In times of uncertainty, investors often move towards assets traditionally considered ‘safe havens,’ such as gold or certain government bonds. However, the definition of a safe haven can shift, and the interconnectedness of modern markets means that even traditional safe havens can experience volatility during extreme stress events. Here are some potential ways geopolitical risk can ripple through markets: Energy Prices: Direct impact if conflict threatens production or transit routes. Investor Sentiment: Increased fear can lead to sell-offs in riskier assets. Supply Chains: Disruptions can affect global manufacturing and trade. Inflation: Higher energy or commodity prices can fuel inflationary pressures. Central Bank Policy: Geopolitical factors can influence decisions on interest rates. Navigating Escalating Middle East Tensions The current Middle East Tensions between Iran and Israel are particularly concerning due to the potential for a wider regional conflict involving other state and non-state actors. The involvement of proxies, the strategic importance of the region, and the complex web of alliances make de-escalation challenging. Any miscalculation could have severe consequences, extending beyond the immediate combatants. Understanding the historical context is crucial. The animosity between Iran and Israel dates back decades, rooted in political, religious, and strategic disagreements. Iran’s support for groups hostile to Israel and its nuclear program are central points of contention. Israel views Iran as an existential threat. This latest direct exchange marks a dangerous evolution in their rivalry. International reactions play a key role in shaping the narrative and potential outcomes. Calls for restraint from global powers are common, but the effectiveness of such calls depends on the willingness of the parties involved to step back. The position of major global players like the United States, European Union nations, Russia, and China will be critical in diplomatic efforts, or lack thereof. The Potential Global Market Impact The immediate Global Market Impact of the reported strike is likely to manifest as increased volatility. Futures markets often react quickly to such news, and the start of trading sessions will reveal how this development is being priced in by investors worldwide. Sectors most directly affected might include energy, defense, and potentially technology, given the reliance on global supply chains. However, the longer-term impact depends heavily on whether this event leads to further escalation or if diplomatic efforts manage to contain the situation. A prolonged or expanded conflict would likely have a more sustained negative impact on global economic growth prospects and market stability. Conversely, a swift de-escalation could see markets recover relatively quickly, having priced in the initial shock. Market participants will be closely monitoring official statements from Iran and Israel, as well as reactions from major international bodies and governments. The language used and the actions taken in the coming hours and days will be critical indicators of the potential trajectory of the conflict and, consequently, the markets. Considering Crypto Volatility in Times of Geopolitical Stress The relationship between geopolitical events and the cryptocurrency market is complex and not always straightforward. While Bitcoin was envisioned by some as a non-sovereign store of value, potentially acting as a safe haven during traditional financial system stress, its price often behaves like a risk asset, correlating with technology stocks. Crypto Volatility is already a defining characteristic of the market. Geopolitical events can exacerbate this volatility, though the direction isn’t always predictable. In some instances, initial news of conflict might lead to a sell-off in risk assets, including crypto. However, if the event is perceived as weakening traditional financial systems or increasing inflation fears (due to rising commodity prices, for example), some investors might theoretically turn to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value, potentially driving prices up. The crypto market is also influenced by global liquidity and macroeconomic factors, which are indirectly affected by geopolitical stability. Increased global uncertainty can lead to tighter financial conditions, which typically pressure risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, if central banks were to react to a geopolitical crisis with more accommodative monetary policy (though this is not the current trend), it could potentially provide tailwinds for crypto. Here’s a look at potential, though not guaranteed, impacts on crypto: Initial Sell-off: As part of a broader risk-off move across markets. Increased Correlation: May see crypto move in tandem with traditional indices like the S&P 500. Narrative Play: Renewed discussion around Bitcoin as a potential safe haven, though market action doesn’t always support this consistently. Heightened Volatility: Prices likely to swing more dramatically based on news flow. For cryptocurrency holders and traders, this period calls for increased vigilance. Monitoring global news alongside market data is essential. Understanding that external, non-crypto specific events can significantly impact digital asset prices is a crucial part of navigating this market. What Happens Next? Potential Scenarios Predicting the future in geopolitical situations is impossible, but analysts are considering several potential scenarios following the reported Iran Israel Strike : De-escalation: Both sides, having demonstrated capability and resolve, might choose to step back, possibly under international pressure. This is the most hopeful scenario for regional stability and markets. Limited, Tit-for-Tat Exchanges: The situation could devolve into a series of limited strikes and counter-strikes, potentially targeting military assets or infrastructure, but avoiding all-out war. This maintains high tension and market uncertainty. Wider Regional Conflict: The conflict could expand, drawing in proxies or even direct involvement from other regional powers or global players. This is the most dangerous scenario with severe humanitarian and economic consequences. The actions and rhetoric of leaders in Tehran, Tel Aviv, Washington D.C., and other capitals will provide clues about which path is most likely being taken. Diplomatic efforts, back-channel communications, and public statements will all be scrutinized. Actionable Insights for the Informed Reader Given the unfolding situation and its potential Global Market Impact , what should readers, especially those with exposure to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, consider? Stay Informed: Rely on reputable news sources for updates on the geopolitical situation. Understand the facts as they are reported and differentiate them from speculation. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical events are a reminder that external shocks can occur. Ensure your investment portfolio aligns with your comfort level regarding risk and volatility. Understand Market Correlations: Be aware that crypto prices can be influenced by broader market sentiment and macroeconomic factors tied to global stability. Avoid Panic Decisions: Volatility can trigger emotional responses. Make investment decisions based on your long-term strategy, not short-term news spikes. Diversification: Consider whether your portfolio is adequately diversified across different asset classes, which can help mitigate risks associated with specific market segments or events. While it’s impossible to perfectly predict how Middle East Tensions will specifically affect Crypto Volatility in the short term, being prepared for potential market reactions is prudent. This involves understanding the underlying factors at play and maintaining a rational approach to investing during uncertain times. Summary: A Critical Juncture The reported Iran Israel Strike marks a significant escalation in long-standing Middle East Tensions . This event immediately heightens Geopolitical Risk , with potentially far-reaching consequences for regional stability and the global economy. The Global Market Impact is likely to be characterized by increased uncertainty and Crypto Volatility , at least in the short term. While the exact trajectory of events remains uncertain, the coming days will be critical in determining whether this leads to further conflict or a path towards de-escalation. For investors and global citizens alike, staying informed and understanding the potential implications of this developing situation is essential.

Amidst all the hustle and bustle, analyst Cryptex Guy in an X post talks about whether we will see the altseason again. In this write-up, we take you through the proponent’s thesis, on the altcoin season, BTC dominance, stablecoins, Ethereum’s stance, and more. BTC Dominance + Stablecoin Mix: The BTC.D + USDT.D + USDC.D combo chart shared by the analyst highlights how much money sits outside altcoins. Historically, this metric approaching the 74–75% red zone has been a trigger point for sharp altcoin rallies due to rejection from that overhead resistance. Currently sitting at 70.87%, a final push into that zone, followed by rejection, as seen in the past, could mean a capital rotation into altcoins. Notably, a break below the ascending cyan trendline would confirm the end of Bitcoin’s capital dominance run, making way for a full-fledged Altseason, similar to the mini alt-run we’ve seen in Q4 2024. BTC Dominance on Lower Time Frame: On the 4H chart, BTC Dominance has broken out of a rising wedge, a classically bearish pattern for BTC.D. Since altcoins are inversely correlated to BTC.D, this breakout could lead to a short-term relief rally in altcoins. Now, BTC.D appears to be retesting the wedge’s upper boundary. Should this retest be rejected, we can expect a quick 5–10% upside candles on strong altcoins. This aligns with Ethereum’s recent $1000+ surge, which injected $138B into the altcoin ecosystem. Ethereum’s Retest & the Bigger Altseason Picture On higher time frames, Ethereum has reclaimed a significant multi-year trendline, known as the Bull-Bear boundary. A successful reclaim would boost investor confidence and could catalyze sustained inflows into altcoins. The altcoin market is also forming a bullish structure. If this pattern holds, it would set the stage for Altseason 2025, with many altcoins potentially seeing 2–3x gains from current levels. This scenario mirrors the patterns from 2023 and 2024, when capital rotation into alts delivered broad market upside. Also read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 FAQs When can we expect the next Altseason to begin? If BTC.D gets rejected from the 74–75% zone and breaks the trendline, Altseason could commence in late 2025, as historical patterns and technical structures align. What role does Ethereum play in triggering Altseason? Ethereum acts as a capital gateway. Its successful reclaim of major support boosts market-wide confidence, triggering rotations into other Layer 1s and alt sectors. Is it too early to enter altcoins now? Currently, altcoin prices are still suppressed, offering early entry opportunities. As BTC.D approaches resistance, the risk-to-reward ratio for alts becomes increasingly favorable.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/altcoin-season-2025-is-the-capital-rotation-already-underway/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T11:45:10,"Polkadot community members pitch Bitcoin as treasury stability strategy","Polkadot community members have proposed introducing a Bitcoin reserve for the Polkadot Treasury in response to the Wish-For-Change referendum. The proposal aims to convert 500,000 DOT into tBTC over the next year using Hydration’s rolling DCA feature. The community members want the capital to be provided as liquidity into the Hydration Omnipool to put the funds into use. They also added that an additional 1000 DOT is reserved for transaction fees. All-time average trade fees as of proposal submission are around 0.3%. Proposal aims to provide liquidity to Polkadot’s Treasury Polkadot Treasury Bitcoin Strategic Reserve polkassembly referenda 1394 & forum polkadot network bitcoin-reserve-for-the-polkadot-treasury/13221 Recently a Discussion has sparked among the Polkadot Community to add BTC into the Treasury of the Polkadot to diversify it and… pic.twitter.com/uY8K4YcENg — Quantum (@ItsMeQuantum) June 13, 2025 According to the proposers, BTC was mentioned in the original diversification proposal #457 and could help reduce volatility and preserve the value of the Polkadot Treasury, ensuring funds are available to support a given budget in the future. They chose Threshold BTC (tBTC), a non-custodial solution utilizing threshold-ECDSA wallets, for its decentralization, liquidity, and transparency. The proposal suggests selling a fixed amount of DOT per trade rather than acquiring a fixed amount of tBTC. The community members also stated that, for better capital efficiency, the full amount of DOT will be initially converted into a DOT (yield-bearing collateral token) and supplied into the Hydration Borrow feature. According to the proposers, the Polkadot Treasury will accumulate yield on the dormant DOT while substantially increasing the DOT supply available for borrowing, enabling more DeFi use cases. The proposal indicated that chunks of 0.005 tBTC will be provided as liquidity after a short accumulation period into the Hydration Omnipool. The community believes it will allow diversification of the Polkadot Treasury portfolio while also supporting ecosystem DeFi incentives. Polkadot community members argued that Bitcoin continues to perform among the strongest assets of the past decade. They also believe that it’s an opportunity for Polkadot to hedge against uncertainty while signaling to the broader industry that they do believe in and support a multi-chain future. One community member hopes to bring the proposal on-chain early next week following some discussion. One Polkadot community member reiterated that the goal of the proposal is to create a resilient treasury and ensure funding for ecosystem development through turbulent cycles, starting with a Bitcoin reserve. The individual also confirmed that the proposal is about risk management and operational continuity, not market timing or speculation. In the proposal, the community members noted that DOT has increased ~60% vs. Bitcoin since the WFC was first proposed in January. They argued that if the Bitcoin reserve proposal had been enacted, the net gain for the treasury would have been ~$1.5M, all else being equal. According to the individuals, it could give the treasury $124M in assets instead of $122.5M, a 2.46% annualized return. The community members believe a 2.46% annualized return during a 60% DOT decline vs BTC is a great risk-adjusted performance. They also argued that while the upside seems small now, if the decline continues, the difference compounds and the community continues to function. Proposal focuses on risk management and diversification The Polkadot members acknowledged that risk management is fundamental to every major institution. Nobody concentrates 100% of their operating capital on a single asset; even the Ethereum Foundation has diversified into other assets. They believe that by showing the ability to introduce risk management into their system, they’re signaling that Polkadot is maturing into a modern and resilient enterprise. One community member said if Polkadot wanted a resilient treasury, it would diversify into different asset classes and not sell one highly volatile asset for another. Another member also suggested that the Polkadot Community Foundation should open an investment account on behalf of the treasury. The member argued that PCF should roll funds over time from the treasury into investments with yield and use the yield to purchase DOT and top up the treasury regularly. Another Polkadot community member suggested using PCF as a holdings company that can issue tokens or NFTs representing the underlying asset and hold that underlying asset on behalf of the network. The individual argued that it could help the ecosystem because the treasury earns a fee for holding the assets and a premium for being the issuer.

But while that rocket may have taken off, 2025 has opened a new launchpad—and its name is Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). For anyone who missed Bitcoin’s first wave, this might just be the reset button they’ve been hoping for. What Makes Bitcoin Solaris Different? Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just another layer-1 chain trying to mimic the greats. It’s an entirely reimagined blockchain ecosystem, built for speed, fairness, and wealth creation. At its core lies a powerful dual-consensus mechanism, blending the rock-solid security of Proof-of-Work (PoW) with the blazing speed and efficiency of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). That combination enables BTC-S to hit over 10,000 transactions per second with a 2-second finality, while using 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin. More than just tech, Bitcoin Solaris has built its ecosystem to be inclusive. Through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine from smartphones, laptops, and everyday devices—no expensive rigs or technical knowledge required. Bitcoin Was the First Chance. BTC-S Could Be the Second. Ask anyone who bought Bitcoin under $1000 and held on—life was never the same. But what if you had missed that? For many, the answer has been regret. BTC-S aims to rewrite that script. The entry price is still low, and the potential is massive. It’s not a clone. It’s a next-gen system engineered from the ground up. From smart contract flexibility to cross-chain bridges and near-instant scalability, Bitcoin Solaris is positioning itself as a true backbone for Web3 finance and applications. Why Investors Are Flocking In A detailed review by Ben Crypto outlines why BTC-S is on the radar of top crypto voices. Influencers and DeFi enthusiasts are calling it “one of the most promising crypto ecosystems of the year.” Audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins confirm a secure and well-structured codebase that inspires trust. As of now, the presale is in Phase 7, with BTC-S priced at $7. With the launch price locked at $20, investors are looking at a 233% return if they hold until launch. And with only around 7 weeks left, time is tight. Over 11,000 users have already joined, making this one of the shortest and most explosive presales in recent memory. Bitcoin Solaris is now sitting at over $4.1 million raised, and momentum is still climbing. You can learn more and join the presale through Bitcoin Solaris. Technical Brilliance That Translates to Wealth BTC-S isn’t just fast—it’s precise. Behind the scenes, it operates using a hybrid chain architecture: The Base Layer runs PoW for uncompromising security. The Solaris Layer handles high-volume operations using DPoS for scalability. Validators rotate intelligently across both layers, ensuring decentralized consensus and resilience. Smart contracts on Bitcoin Solaris are Rust-based, enabling advanced DeFi features like atomic swaps, liquidity protocols, and cross-chain integration. All while maintaining ultra-low latency and stable execution. A Smarter, Faster, Fairer Bitcoin Is Here—Step Into BTC-S BTC-S also supports liquid staking , offering users the ability to stake without lockups. Tokens are converted 1:1 into sBTC-S, which can still be used across DeFi apps or traded freely. It’s part of the chain’s broader vision of accessible wealth-building. Mining for Everyone: The Heart of BTC-S Perhaps the most radical aspect of BTC-S is how it democratizes mining. Instead of making it exclusive to tech-savvy users with costly setups, the upcoming Solaris Nova App lets you start mining from your mobile or desktop with just a few taps. More than a convenience, it’s a revolution in participation. And thanks to the blockchain’s adaptive consensus design, it remains highly efficient regardless of device. You can even calculate your potential mining earnings here: Bitcoin Solaris Mining Calculator Tokenomics That Inspire Confidence Bitcoin Solaris embraces scarcity and strategic distribution through its structured tokenomics model: Total Supply: 21 million BTC-S 66.66% for mining (spanning 90 years) 20% allocated for presale Remaining split among liquidity, ecosystem, marketing, and rewards Conclusion: Why Bitcoin Solaris Is The Second Chance at Life-Changing Wealth Bitcoin Solaris isn’t chasing hype—it’s building quietly, with purpose. Its advanced tech, mobile mining, and efficient design give everyday users a real opportunity to grow with the network from day one. While headlines focus elsewhere, BTC-S is laying the foundation for something far bigger. For those paying attention, this could be the most important move they make in 2025.

2025-06-13T11:40:39,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index Dips to 61: A Cautionary Tale in the Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index Dips to 61: A Cautionary Tale in the Greed Zone Hey crypto enthusiasts! Let’s talk about market vibes. The latest reading from the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , a popular gauge for tracking Crypto Market Sentiment , shows a slight cooling. As of June 13th, the index registered 61, a noticeable dip of 10 points from the previous day’s reading. Despite this decline, the index remains firmly within the ‘Greed’ territory. But what exactly does this number tell us, and how should you interpret it in the context of the broader market? Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Think of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index as a thermometer for market psychology. Developed by Alternative.me, it aims to quantify the emotional state of cryptocurrency investors and traders. Emotions like fear and greed can heavily influence market movements, often leading to irrational decisions. Extreme fear can signal a potential buying opportunity for those brave enough, while extreme greed might suggest the market is due for a correction. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed A score closer to 0 indicates that investors are highly fearful, likely selling off assets. A score closer to 100 suggests investors are getting overly greedy, potentially buying aggressively and pushing prices unsustainably high. What Factors Influence Crypto Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from analyzing six key factors. Each factor is weighted differently to reflect its perceived impact on overall Crypto Market Sentiment . Understanding these components helps provide a clearer picture of why the index moves the way it does. Here’s a breakdown of the factors: Factor Weighting How it’s Measured Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies compared to their average values. High volatility often indicates increased fear or uncertainty. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and momentum of the market. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greed, while low volume on a dip might indicate fear or lack of interest. Social Media 15% Scans social media platforms (like Twitter) for relevant posts about cryptocurrencies, counting mentions and analyzing sentiment (positive vs. negative). Surveys 15% Gauges public opinion through weekly crypto polls (currently paused). This provides a direct look at investor sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Examines Bitcoin’s share of the total market capitalization. Increasing Bitcoin Dominance can sometimes indicate fear (investors fleeing altcoins for the relative safety of BTC), while decreasing dominance might suggest greed (investors rotating into riskier altcoins). Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google search data for cryptocurrency-related terms. Spikes in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto bubble” can indicate fear, while terms like “buy crypto” or specific altcoin names might signal greed. As noted, the surveys component is currently paused, meaning the index is calculated based on the remaining five factors. The Current State: Why 61 is Still ‘Greed’ The recent drop of 10 points to 61 is significant, indicating a measurable shift in sentiment over a short period. However, 61 still falls comfortably within the 50-74 range, classifying it as ‘Greed’. This suggests that while some of the recent bullish fervor might have subsided, the prevailing mood among investors is still one of optimism and willingness to buy. A reading of 61 could mean several things: Some profit-taking might be occurring after a period of price increases. Recent negative news or a slight market dip might have tempered extreme optimism. The market is still viewed positively, with many expecting further gains, but perhaps with less intensity than when the index was higher (e.g., in the 70s or 80s). It’s a point where the market isn’t overly euphoric (Extreme Greed) but is definitely not fearful. Investors are generally confident, which can keep buying pressure relatively strong. What Does ‘Greed’ Imply for Your Trading Strategy? Being in the ‘Greed’ zone has important implications, especially when developing or adjusting your Trading Strategy . Historically, periods of high greed have sometimes preceded market corrections. This is based on the idea that when everyone is overly optimistic and buying aggressively, the market can become overextended and vulnerable to a sharp downturn. Here’s how you might interpret the current ‘Greed’ reading for your Trading Strategy : Caution is Advised: A high greed score suggests the market might be getting warm. It’s generally not the ideal time for aggressive new long positions, especially for short-term trades. Consider Risk Management: If you have open positions, this might be a good time to tighten stop-losses, take some profits, or reduce position sizes. Look for Confirmation: Don’t rely solely on the index. Use it as one tool among many. Confirm the sentiment with technical analysis (like chart patterns, indicators) and fundamental analysis. Prepare for Volatility: High sentiment periods can often be accompanied by increased Crypto Volatility . Be prepared for potentially larger price swings. Some traders use the index as a contrarian indicator: buying when there is extreme fear and selling (or avoiding buying) when there is extreme greed. A reading of 61 isn’t ‘extreme’ greed, but it’s definitely on the side where caution becomes more important than chasing gains. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance and Crypto Volatility Two significant components of the index are Bitcoin Dominance and Crypto Volatility . Let’s briefly touch upon their influence. An increase in Bitcoin Dominance often happens when altcoins are bleeding value faster than Bitcoin, or when investors are consolidating their positions into the largest, most liquid cryptocurrency during uncertain times. While sometimes interpreted as fear, it can also reflect a strong run-up in Bitcoin itself, which then pulls the overall market sentiment up. Crypto Volatility is a constant factor in the market. High volatility can contribute to either fear (if prices are dropping fast) or greed (if prices are skyrocketing). The index measures this volatility relative to historical averages. If recent price swings have been larger than usual, this factor will likely contribute to a higher score if the movement is upwards (momentum is also strong) or push it towards fear if the movement is downwards. The index’s calculation of 61 incorporates the current state of both Bitcoin Dominance and Crypto Volatility , alongside market momentum, social sentiment, and Google Trends data, to arrive at the overall sentiment score. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights So, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index sitting at 61 in the ‘Greed’ zone, what are some actionable steps you can consider? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the index’s movement daily. A rapid change in either direction can be a strong signal. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current holdings. Are you comfortable with your exposure given the ‘Greed’ sentiment? Set Price Alerts: If you’re waiting for a dip, set alerts for key price levels you’d be interested in buying at. Avoid FOMO: The ‘Greed’ zone is where Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is highest. Stick to your pre-defined Trading Strategy and avoid making impulsive decisions based on hype. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re a long-term investor, DCA can help mitigate the risk of buying at a potential peak during a greed phase. Remember, the index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. It doesn’t predict future price movements with certainty but provides valuable insight into the market’s psychological state, which is a crucial driver of short-to-medium term trends. Conclusion The dip in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index from 71 to 61 signals a slight cooling in market enthusiasm, yet the persistent ‘Greed’ reading suggests investors remain largely optimistic. This current state highlights the ongoing positive sentiment but also serves as a cautionary signal that the market is not in ‘Fear’ territory, where historical opportunities for aggressive buying are often found. By understanding the factors like Bitcoin Dominance and Crypto Volatility that contribute to the index, and integrating this sentiment gauge into your overall Trading Strategy , you can make more informed decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

Through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), the asset management giant has quietly built one of the largest BTC positions in the world. According to fresh data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham Intel, BlackRock now controls 665,938 BTC, currently valued at approximately $69.83 billion as of Friday, June 13, 2025. BlackRock Bitcoin holdings. Source: Arkham That position makes up an estimated 94.8% of BlackRock’s $73.66 billion crypto portfolio, showing a clear focus on Bitcoin over other digital assets, despite the firm’s daily purchases of Ethereum in the last two weeks . BlackRock is now the second-largest holder of Bitcoin globally With this level of accumulation, BlackRock has moved ahead of major players such as Binance and MicroStrategy. Its IBIT fund is now the second-largest holder of Bitcoin globally. Only the legendary wallet linked to Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, holds more. BlackRock’s aggressive move into Bitcoin is part of a broader strategy. The company aims to become the world’s leading crypto asset manager by 2030. In a corporate presentation published Thursday, BlackRock stated its target of managing at least $50 billion in digital assets within the next five years. Bitcoin remains the foundation of this goal. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself continues to attract institutional interest. The cryptocurrency is trading above $104,000 at press time.

Per a June 13 WSJ report , the companies are said to be exploring how stablecoin launch and integration could help streamline payment systems, significantly cut processing fees, and reduce reliance on the traditional banking infrastructure. By issuing their own tokens, both firms could shift massive volumes of daily transactions onto the blockchain, offering more efficient payment flows. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report also noted that other major players, including Expedia Group Inc. and airlines in the United States, are considering similar stablecoin initiatives.

Leading stablecoins USDT ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) have already demonstrated strong utility in global payments. Tether’s USDT recently surpassed $155 billion in circulation and the surge in adoption highlights that the assets can serve as efficient, low-cost alternatives to traditional options. Meanwhile, ride-hailing company Uber also recently signaled interest in the use of stablecoins to streamline global payments. Earlier this month, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi revealed the company is in the “study phase” of evaluating stablecoins as a potential tool for international transactions.

Here Are the Details","Pakistan has unveiled an ambitious plan to use its 2,000 megawatts of excess electricity for bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers in a bid to reduce energy waste and accelerate the country’s digital transformation. Pakistan Uses 2,000 MW of Surplus Electric Power for Bitcoin Mining, Artificial Intelligence to Accelerate Technological Development As of March 2025, Pakistan's total electricity generation capacity will be 46,600 MW, a slight increase from the previous year. However, a significant portion of this capacity remains idle at 14%, especially during low demand periods in winter when national demand can drop to as low as 12,000 MW. To address this inefficiency, the Pakistani government plans to repurpose underutilized thermal power plants and aims to convert excess electricity into revenue-generating opportunities through high-value digital assets and computing power. In the first phase of the initiative, which is launched in 2025, 2,000 MW has been allocated to support the development of crypto mining facilities and AI infrastructure. Pakistan plans to integrate renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydropower into these activities in the future. This shift represents a long-term step towards sustainable energy use within its emerging digital economy. This strategy not only aims to ease the financial burden of capacity payments for idle facilities but also prepares Pakistan to join the global race for blockchain and AI innovation. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T11:30:40,"GameStop Boosts Convertible Note Offering to $2.25B After Strategic Bitcoin Buy","BitcoinWorld GameStop Boosts Convertible Note Offering to $2.25B After Strategic Bitcoin Buy In a significant financial maneuver, the popular American video game retailer GameStop has announced a substantial increase in its planned private offering of convertible senior notes. This move comes shortly after the company revealed a notable investment in the cryptocurrency market, specifically Bitcoin. GameStop’s Capital Raise: What Happened? According to reports, GameStop has raised the target amount for its planned private offering of convertible senior notes from an initial $1.75 billion to a striking $2.25 billion . This information, initially shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, signals GameStop’s intention to secure a considerable amount of capital through this debt instrument. But what exactly are convertible senior notes? Think of them as a type of debt that a company issues, similar to a bond. However, they come with a twist: the holder has the option to convert the debt into a predetermined number of the company’s shares (in this case, GME stock) under specific conditions, usually when the stock price reaches a certain level. They are ‘senior’ because they rank higher than some other types of debt in the event of bankruptcy. For GameStop, issuing convertible notes allows them to raise funds, potentially at a lower interest rate than traditional debt because of the conversion option’s value. It also provides a future possibility of converting debt into equity, which can clean up the balance sheet, although it dilutes existing shareholders if the conversion happens. Connecting the Dots: GME’s Bitcoin Acquisition This increased capital raise follows closely on the heels of another major financial decision by GameStop: a significant Bitcoin investment. The company recently disclosed that it purchased 4,710 BTC between May and early June. At current market prices, this represents a substantial allocation of capital into the cryptocurrency space. Why would a video game retailer like GameStop invest in Bitcoin? Several potential reasons could be at play: Treasury Management: Diversifying corporate cash reserves away from traditional low-yield assets. Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential store of value against inflation. Strategic Alignment: Signalling interest in blockchain technology and catering to a tech-savvy, potentially crypto-holding customer base. Future Integration: Exploring possibilities for accepting crypto payments or engaging with NFTs/Web3 initiatives (though no specific plans were announced with this purchase). This move places GameStop alongside a growing list of public companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, though it’s particularly notable for a company primarily known for brick-and-mortar retail. What Does This Mean for GameStop and Its Future? The decision to raise an additional $500 million through convertible notes, bringing the total offering to $2.25 billion, shortly after a major crypto investment , suggests GameStop is actively pursuing significant financial strategies. While the specific use of the funds from the note offering hasn’t been detailed, capital raises of this magnitude are typically for general corporate purposes, funding operations, potential acquisitions, or strategic investments. Here’s a look at potential implications: Increased Financial Flexibility: The capital provides GameStop with more resources to fund its ongoing transformation efforts, invest in e-commerce, or explore new business avenues. Investor Sentiment: The market reaction to both the Bitcoin purchase and the capital raise will be closely watched. Some investors may applaud the strategic diversification and capital strengthening, while others might be wary of the potential dilution from convertible notes or the volatility associated with crypto assets. Future Strategy: These moves could hint at GameStop’s long-term vision, potentially involving a deeper dive into digital assets or other initiatives requiring significant funding. The combination of a large Bitcoin buy and a boosted convertible note offering indicates GameStop is navigating a period of significant financial activity and strategic shifts. How these pieces fit together and impact the company’s performance and the value of GME stock remains a key question for investors and market observers. Conclusion: Navigating Change GameStop’s recent actions – a substantial Bitcoin investment and a significantly increased convertible note offering – underscore the company’s efforts to adapt and evolve. The $2.25 billion capital raise provides a war chest for future endeavors, while the crypto purchase signals a potential embrace of digital asset trends. These are bold steps that will likely shape GameStop’s trajectory in the coming months and years, making it a company to watch closely in both the retail and digital finance landscapes.

2025-06-13T11:00:54,"Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $103,000—What Triggered It?","After hitting $110,450 on Monday, the Bitcoin price is writing its third consecutive red day as the benchmark cryptocurrency fell 5.3% from an intra-day top of $108,450 to a trough of $102,664 before clawing back to about $104,456 by press time. The sell-off coincided, almost minute-for-minute, with confirmation that Israel had conducted large-scale air-strikes on Iranian nuclear installations, sending ripples through every major asset class. Why Is Bitcoin Going Down Today? Israel’s pre-dawn operation — its first overt attack on Iranian territory since the October-2024 raids — instantly repriced global risk. Oil futures jumped more than 10%, spot gold printed a fresh record high above $3,400 an ounce, and US equity futures slid roughly 1.5%. Bitcoin’s draw-down resembled its initial reaction to Iran’s failed missile barrage on Israel in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside “Oil up. Gold up. Bitcoin down,” Anthony Pompliano wrote on X, noting that the pattern echoes April’s missile incident, after which “Bitcoin ended up outperforming the other two over the first 48 hours.” Bitcoin educator Peter Duan argued in a separate post that “a dip in Bitcoin happens every time there is serious geopolitical [turmoil] … In the long run, this will only push more people to Bitcoin,” pointing to the 24/7 nature of crypto trading versus the still-closed equity cash markets. Macro strategist Joe Consorti drilled down on the mechanics: “Bitcoin, S&P and NDX are all being panic-sold. Crude oil, natural gas, gold and US Treasuries are all spiking higher. The flight to safety trade is here.” A fresh surge in crude is precisely what US policymakers did not need. West Texas Intermediate vaulted past $77 a barrel—its first visit to that level in four months—after Israel struck Iranian nuclear facilities, erasing much of the hard-won disinflation dividend and dragging energy back to centre stage. The contract is now more than $21 above its April trough, threatening to unwind the benign price trends that had been taking hold. This comes after US inflation data once again surprised to the upside this week. May’s Consumer Price Index rose just 0.1% on the month and 2.4% year-over-year, while core CPI matched that modest 0.1% gain and held at 2.8% on an annual basis. Producer prices told a similar tale on Thursday, with the headline PPI up only 0.1% month-over-month and 2.6% on the year, both below consensus expectations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: ‘Fair Price’ Today Is $230,000 Lower fuel costs had been a cornerstone of President Trump’s strategy for reining in inflation; the renewed march higher in oil now threatens that narrative. If energy continues to climb, markets will anticipate a rebound in headline inflation and the Federal Reserve may feel compelled to postpone the rate-cut cycle traders had pencilled in for September. Bitcoin, which is acutely sensitive to fluctuations in global liquidity, often underperforms when the policy outlook tilts toward tighter financial conditions—explaining its abrupt slide alongside the spike in crude. The newsflow triggered one of the heaviest forced-liquidation washes of 2025. CoinGlass data show that roughly $1.14 billion in crypto futures positions were wiped out over the past 24 hours, $1.04 billion of which were longs, as 236,788 traders were forced out of the market. The single-largest hit was a $201 million BTC-USDT long on Binance, the biggest one-ticket liquidation since January. For Bitcoin alone, long-side liquidations totalled $443 million. For the entire crypto market, this is the worst wipe-out since the post-tariff rout of February 3, when $1.25 billion was liquidated across the complex.

US Senators Question Meta’s Stablecoin Plan In New Letter","As crypto legislation advances through the US Congress, two senators have sent a letter to Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg inquiring about the company’s stablecoin strategy following recent reports alleging that the tech giant is planning to launch a private currency. Democrats Question Meta’s Stablecoin Plans On Wednesday, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal questioned Meta’s alleged plan to establish a private currency in a letter addressed to Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder and CEO. The Senators expressed concerns about the “troubling reports” of Meta’s plan to revive its private currency. As reported by Bitcoinist, Facebook’s parent company is allegedly in discussions with multiple crypto companies about potentially integrating a stablecoin into its platforms for payments. According to the report, Meta has reached out to crypto infrastructure companies, focusing on the “ability to pay individuals across different regions without the high fees associated with other forms of payments, such as wire transfers.” The lawmakers affirmed that Big Tech companies issuing or controlling private currencies, such as stablecoins, would “threaten competition across the economy, erode financial privacy, and cede control of the U.S. money supply to monopolistic platforms that have a history of abusing their power.” They also highlighted Meta’s previous failed attempt to launch its Libra project, which collapsed in 2022 under massive pressure from US regulators and politicians. Therefore, Senators Warren and Blumenthal requested information about Meta’s plans and deliberations regarding the potential resumption of a stablecoin venture before June 17, 2025. In the letter, the democratic lawmakers asked Zuckerberg to provide a list of the stablecoin companies Meta had consulted since January 2025. Additionally, they requested information on whether the company is considering owning, controlling, affiliating with, or forming a joint venture or partnership with an existing stablecoin company. They also inquired whether Meta is considering launching a stablecoin individually or in collaboration with another company. Big Tech Companies Awaiting Regulation It’s worth noting that multiple Big Tech companies, including Apple, Google, Airbnb, and X, are reportedly exploring the adoption of stablecoins to lower transaction costs and streamline cross-border payments since the beginning of the year, seemingly fueled by the Trump administration’s friendly approach toward the digital assets industry. The lawmakers highlighted that Meta’s renewed interest in a stablecoin project comes as the US Congress works on related bills. Notably, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the latest cloture motion, advancing to the next legislative stage after a 68-30 vote. The bipartisan bill, introduced by Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, aims to establish a “safe and pro-growth regulatory framework that will unleash innovation.” However, it has faced heavy backlash from Senate Democrats, including Warren, who have raised concerns about the president’s crypto ventures. The Wednesday letter affirmed that the legislation includes provisions that would enable the Trump administration to profit and allow Big Tech companies to issue a stablecoin, which makes it “more critical than ever that Congress and the public fully understand the extent of Meta’s plans.” Based on this, the lawmakers also asked Zuckerberg whether Meta or any of its affiliates lobbied Congress or federal agencies on crypto legislation pending before the 119th Congress, including the GENIUS Act and the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act. Lastly, they questioned the company’s CEO whether they would oppose an amendment that would prohibit Big Tech companies from owning, controlling, or affiliating with stablecoin issuers.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/a-threat-to-privacy-us-senators-question-metas-stablecoin-plan-in-new-letter/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CLARITY Act|Crypto legislation|GENIUS Act|mark zuckerberg|META|Senator elizabeth Warren|stablecoin|Stablecoin Legislation|Stablecoin regulation|Trump administration|US Congress|us lawmakers",cryptocompare

Is Bitcoin Eyeing the $115K to $200K Zone? With U.S. inflation falling lower than expected, Bitcoin has the potential of hitting $200,000 by year-end, says a 21Shares crypto strategist Matt Mena. He noted that a decisive breakout above the $105K–$110K range could propel BTC to $120K and fast-track the year-end target of $138.5K by late summer. Market analyst Crypto King was of a similar opinion that $120,000 was the next psychological price for Bitcoin, thanks to reduced selling activity by short-term holders. The analyst stated , “With $120K as the next key psychological level, Bitcoin appears to be steadily positioning for another upward move, though increased profit-taking may emerge as that milestone nears.” With the consumer price index (CPI) increasing by only 0.1% in May, which was way below expectations, this might be the stepping stone towards Bitcoin soaring to $200,000. Mena pointed out, “Today’s CPI print may serve as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin - and it may be the unlock that brings this target forward by several months. If momentum continues building, a $200K Bitcoin by year-end is now firmly in play.” A surge to $200,000 would validate the long-standing belief among Bitcoin advocates that it is a store of value, akin to digital gold. This price move signals deepening institutional adoption—from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to corporate treasuries—indicating that major players see Bitcoin as a credible, long-term investment rather than a speculative asset. Bitcoin Whales Remain Steadfast Bitcoin whales — the entities holding 1,000 BTC or more — have remained incredibly steadfast, thanks to various factors: Institutional conviction . Institutions and high-net-worth holders view every dip—from $110K to $104K—as an opportunity, not a threat. The U.S. macro backdrop (cooling inflation, positive CPI) further reinforces this conviction. Reducing visible supply . Whale inflows to exchanges have dropped to 7-year lows after declining to approximately 2.3 BTC, signalling a shift in market structure and investor behavior. Lower exchange supply tends to elevate price support. Bitcoin whales have doubled down in June 2025, with overall holdings and new whale cohorts hitting cycle‑highs. Their strategic accumulation—especially during sentiment‑driven dips—and reduced exchange deposits point to confidence about a new all-time high (ATH) being attained this cycle. Crypto King added , “Despite the recent dip, on-chain data shows large holders remain firm, with no significant profit-taking at current levels. This continued conviction suggests confidence in further upside and potential for new price discovery.” Whale holding has also been going through the roof with more than $3.3 billion being recently sent to BTC accumulation wallets. These addresses now hold 2.91 million BTC at an average entry of $64,000, underscoring strong long-term conviction amid market volatility. Therefore, the convergence of institutional capital, ETFs, and corporate treasury adoption is transforming Bitcoin’s demand profile. Conclusion Even though Bitcoin is witnessing a pullback to the $104K zone, the apex cryptocurrency continues to make history by trading above the psychological price of $100,000 for more than 30 consecutive days. With an intensified liquidity crunch and whale accumulation playing out, these bullish on-chain metrics might be the catapult needed to thrust BTC to new historic highs of $115K to $120K. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will shed off the present downward pressure with its ATH presently sitting at $111,814.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9558/bitcoin-liquidity-crunch-paves-way-for-115-k-breakout,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T10:40:34,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 13, 2025","Crypto saw a notable drop today. 98 of the top 100 coins have recorded decreases over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 6.1% to $3.38 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $168 billion, the highest it’s been in days. TLDR: The market has continued yesterday’s pullback, entering consolidation; A short-term correction may be underway; Crypto market sentiment moves towards the fear zone; Bitcoin drops below the $105,000 level; Another all-time high is possible; US spot ETH ETFs continue to outperform their BTC counterparts with 18 consecutive days of inflows; Additional drops are likely. Crypto Winners & Losers Continuing a decline that started yesterday, all top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices drop over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by another 2.7% to the current price of $104,694. Ethereum (ETH) recorded the second-highest fall on the list of 7.9% to the price of $2,529. The top loss is Solana (SOL)’s 8.7%, which now trades at $145. At the same time, the smallest decrease is Tron (TRX)’s 0.5% to the price of $0.2738. Moreover, only two of the top 100 coins have appreciated today. WhiteBIT Coin (WBT) is up 3.3% to $33.58, while LEO Token (LEO) increased by 2% to the price of $9.05. On the other hand, sixteen coins saw double-digit decreases. The highest among these is SPX6900 (SPX)’s 18.6%, currently trading at $1.38. Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler , highlighted that financial markets are hesitant, despite a mildly positive inflation print in the US and consumer prices rising slightly less than expected. “Ongoing geopolitical tensions and renewed tariff rhetoric from Donald Trump continue to weigh on investor sentiment, preventing a clear upward breakout,” Lienkha says. A Short-Term Correction May Be Underway James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , commented that we can’t say what is exactly happening at the moment. “Bitcoin seemed as if it were heading for a new all-time high before retreating,” he writes. “It is truly hard to know if a single factor or a confluence of factors is at play here.” Institutional inflows have been supporting the recent rally, and with BTC hovering just below its May peak, “another all-time high seems realistic if these trends persist.” Despite the recent pullback, #Bitcoin remains above most major short-term cost basis levels. As of June 11: 1w CB: $106.2K 1m CB: $105.2K 3m CB: $98.3K 6m CB: $97.0K As most short-term holders are still in profit, the top-heavy risk seems limited. pic.twitter.com/JDVmw0xOi2 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 12, 2025 Moreover, Ruslan Lienkha argues that BTC appears to be entering a consolidation phase. “From a technical standpoint, the asset has formed a potential double top on the chart, suggesting a short-term correction may be underway.” The coin has spent most of the year trading within the $90,000–$110,000 range, which may serve as a key support and accumulation zone before a new attempt at an ATH. Meanwhile, altcoins are showing signs of divergence, Lienkha says. ETH, SOL, and XRP have been trading sideways and remain significantly below their previous ATHs. “This subdued performance also reflects a declining short-term correlation with Bitcoin.” However, speculations around a forthcoming Solana ETF approval “translate into fresh capital inflows” for this coin. Source: YouHodler Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $104,694, falling below the $105,000 mark. This is up from the intraday low of $103,081 and down from the intraday high of $108,356, which the coin held very briefly. It’s currently down 6.3% from the all-time high of $111,814. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView In the same time period, Ethereum saw a notable plunge from its intraday high of $2,767 to the intraday low of $2,469, correcting slightly upwards since. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment keeps retreating into fear. It’s currently in the neutral zone, falling from 65 seen yesterday to 54 today . This suggests that the concerns over market overheating and heading for an additional correction are easing. “Encouragingly, the wave of fear in market sentiment did not translate into a meaningful shift in spending behavior,” Glassnode says. Moreover, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw another day of net inflows, though it’s nearly half of yesterday’s amount. It stood at $86.31 million on Thursday. BlackRock took in $288.33 million, but others ended the day with significant losses. At the same time, US ETH spot ETFs have recorded 19 consecutive days of inflows, surpassing the BTC counterparts again with $112.36 million in inflows on 12 June. BlackRock’s share here is $101.53 million, and Fidelity’s is $10.83 million. Meanwhile, stablecoins have been increasingly drawing investor attention . Total stablecoin market capitalization has reached a new all-time high of $250.949 billion, per DeFiLlama . According to Toledano, “the ease with which USDT and USDC can be converted into both digital assets and fiat currencies enhances their appeal, offering unmatched convenience and flexibility within a rapidly evolving financial landscape.” Monthly stablecoin flows reached $717 billion–$719 billion from February to April, and annual volumes topped $27.6 trillion, surpassing Visa and Mastercard. Therefore, “stablecoins appear increasingly unstoppable, cementing their role as a transformative force in global finance.” Stablecoins are booming again. Market cap hit a record $228B, up $33B (+17%) in 2025.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1?

Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.15461723 -7.52% Market Cap. $ 6,530,994,764.1923 Trading Volume. $ 254,488,703.8331 Circulating Supply. 0.00 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 Since peaking at $0.40 in mid-January 2025, HBAR price has been on a steady decline. External factors dragged it into a falling wedge pattern, reaching a low of $0.125 in early April. However, from April second week, a broader crypto rally lifted HBAR as well. It broke out of the wedge, rebounding from a strong support zone, the same area that fueled the Q4 2024 rally. This zone, confirmed by the FRVP indicator, showed high buying interest and supported a sharp rebound. HBAR surged nearly 80%, climbing from $0.125 to $0.228 in April to Mid-may. But the momentum didn’t hold. Over the last 30 days, HBAR dropped around 35%, with 17% of that loss occurring in just three days. Currently, HBAR is forming another falling wedge and is trading near its lower boundary. If bulls regain strength, a breakout above $0.22 could follow, potentially reaching $0.27 soon. Looking further ahead, a daily close above $0.27 could open the path to $0.40. If momentum continues, HBAR might even touch $0.75 by year-end. On the downside, failure to hold support may push the price down toward $0.072. Meanwhile, internal developments tell a different story. Hedera’s ecosystem continues to grow. In 2025, it launched its first native hardware wallet, Citadel, and an AI-based tool, the Hedera Agent Kit, making token creation more accessible. Another major project, HashSphere, is due in Q3 2025. It aims to offer a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. To streamline operations, Hedera also rebranded key entities on May 15. The HBAR Foundation is now the “Hedera Foundation,” and the Governing Council is the “Hedera Council.” In short, while external pressures weigh on price, Hedera’s internal progress remains strong. If macro conditions improve, 2025 could still bring a major turnaround.

After a two-week silence, SHIB lead developer Shytoshi Kusama is back online with a teaser that’s stirring up the ecosystem. In a post on X, he hinted at a long-in-the-works whitepaper focused on artificial intelligence, just hours before fellow developer Kaal Dhairya announced the beta launch of Shib Alpha Layer, a powerful new Layer 3 network built on Shibarium. The message is loud and clear: SHIB is done playing small. Kusama’s Comeback Signals Bigger Plans Kusama hasn’t posted since May 30. But when he finally returned, he made it count. Referencing the SHIB ecosystem’s partner TokenPlayAI (powered by Astra Nova), Kusama said it’s part of a larger strategy that’s been in the works for months. And it won’t stay under wraps for long. “This is part of a much larger AI strategy we have been developing for months,” he wrote. “I’ll speak more about my view on AI and our partners in an upcoming AI focused whitepaper.” He’s also updated his X bio to reflect this direction, stating that he’s working on “a final white paper exploring Ai, Shib, Shy.” While details are still limited, this marks a deliberate move toward positioning SHIB as a key player in tech-forward development. In case you missed this big news with @TokenplayAI (powered by @Astra__Nova ). This is part of a much larger AI strategy we have been developing for months. I'll speak more about my view on AI and our partners in an upcoming AI focused whitepaper. Stay tuned. https://t.co/soqnS5QT0B — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) June 12, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Anthony Pompliano to Lead $750M Bitcoin Acquisition Bid via Public Firm , Enter: Shib Alpha Layer (Beta) While Kusama was teasing vision, Dhairya delivered something more solid. In a post of his own, the developer revealed that Shib Alpha Layer, the project’s new Layer 3 rollup abstraction stack, is now live in beta. It’s built with ElderLabs and runs on Shibarium as its settlement layer. So what’s under the hood? Quite a bit: A single-chain experience that hides the complexity of rollups Lightning-fast transactions and near-instant confirmations The ability to pay gas fees not just in BONE, but in other tokens and stablecoins Enhanced privacy features, modular app support, and more Instant bridging and interoperability coming soon Dhairya summed it up with one statement that says it all: “Today we flip the script… Meme era ends here. The Shib Alpha era begins.” A New Chapter for SHIB What a shift in identity! The rollout of a high-speed Layer 3 network, paired with an upcoming whitepaper and long-term tech strategy, suggests SHIB’s developers are building for something much bigger than hype cycles. Dhairya even emphasized that this wasn’t backed by VC money or marketing machines – just a small team of engineers pushing out real products. Round of applause! SHIB seems to be busy writing its own playbook and leaving the meme coin era behind for good. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-13T10:30:33,"Huione darknet still raking in crypto as $81B flows despite shutdown","Chainalysis’ analysis reveals that Huione, one of the largest darknet marketplaces, continues to process massive volumes of cryptocurrency despite enforcement efforts. An estimated $81 billion has flowed through the platform, even after authorities targeted its Telegram channels and support infrastructure. On May 13, Haowang Guarantee, formerly Huione Guarantee , announced it closed after the Telegram messaging service blocked thousands of its connected accounts and channels. However, Chainalysis said activity connected to the illicit marketplace has not decreased since the so-called “shutdown,” according to an analysis released Thursday, June 12. The American blockchain analysis firm highlighted that their data indicates that the platform handles billions of dollars in transactions. According to the report, this demonstrates a strong system that works mostly independently without relying heavily on its public-facing setup. Huione defies US sanctions as crypto transactions surge The Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on May 1 proposed prohibiting the Huione Group from access to the US banking system. They alleged that the company assisted North Korea’s state-sponsored Lazarus Group in laundering cryptocurrency. Even though US banks usually act quickly and terminate relationships upon announcement to manage regulatory risk, Huione has proved resilient against officials, said Chainalysis. The blockchain analysis firm further stated that this de-risking effect suggests Huione probably lost access to US dollars starting from the day of the notice. Still, transaction data indicates that the operational impact was minimal. Following their explanation, the data reveals that transaction volume remained steady after the FinCEN announcement and may have even increased. Huione’s daily volume. Source: Chainalysis Apart from Chainalysis, TRM Labs also shared data concerning Huione’s operations. According to a May 30 report from crypto analytics company TRM Labs, the Huione Group continues to run channels for its VIP vendors and has taken at least $81 billion in crypto since 2021. This is more than $5 billion for the Hydra marketplace, a comparable Russian online black market. TRM Labs further illustrated that Huione is a key channel for cyber-related crimes, such as pig butchering scams, fraud, and cyber heists. Huione’s cryptocurrency exchange has also reappeared on the scene, now with its old logo and operating from a new domain, according to Chainalysis. The exchange also maintains a social media presence on other platforms, like its Telegram channels. Chainalysis reveals strategies to curb Huione’s illegal activities The Huione Group , a Cambodian company, manages a variety of businesses, including its payment service platform Huione Pay PLC, crypto exchange Huione Crypto, and Haowang Guarantee. The continued existence of the Huione Group and its subsidiaries is part of a larger challenge of responding to sophisticated organized criminal groups that can operate at scale. Still, Chainalysis said that it had not come to the attention of law enforcement. To curb this, Chainalysis suggested that they need an ecosystem-wide response, which means ongoing and varied enforcement strategies, to tackle illegal companies like Huione effectively. Chainalysis also mentioned that dealing with these networks might need new enforcement methods that look deeper than just shutting down surface operations and instead focus on the complicated systems that keep them running. The crypto ecosystem feels hopeful after the blockchain analysis company’s strategies to tackle Huione’s unlawful actions. Stopping cybercrimes is undoubtedly important, according to crypto analysts. This is because cybercrime poses a serious risk to people, companies, and governments, leading to monetary losses, harm to one’s reputation, and a decline in confidence in online systems.

2025-06-13T10:27:59,"Shopify Introduces USDC Stablecoin Payments via Coinbase’s Base Network","Shopify has launched early access to stablecoin payments using Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), in a strategic collaboration with U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The integration is currently being tested on Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain, Base, with a full rollout planned through Shopify Payments and Shop Pay later this year. Announcing the move on Thursday, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke called stablecoins a “natural way to transact on the internet,” adding that the company worked closely with Coinbase to develop the commerce-focused smart contract protocol behind the system. The new payment feature will also support future buyer incentives, including 1% cash back in local currency, enhancing the platform’s appeal for both customers and merchants. Why Shopify Chose Base for Its Stablecoin Integration Base, a Layer-2 network built by Coinbase, is the fourth-largest blockchain for USDC, accounting for 6% of the stablecoin’s $61 billion total supply, according to USDC Transparency and CoinGecko data. Known for its low-cost and high-speed transactions, Base offers Shopify a 24/7 global payment infrastructure, aligning with the company’s goals to streamline cross-border commerce. “Base is an ultra-fast and affordable network that has emerged as a great way for moving money,” Shopify said in a statement, citing its reliability and cost-efficiency. While the company has not disclosed plans to support USDC on other chains or additional crypto assets, the exclusive choice of Base has sparked debate online. Some users questioned the decision, suggesting that broader multi-chain support would have widened merchant access. Still, the Base integration signals Shopify’s broader intent to modernize online payments and explore blockchain-native solutions for faster, cheaper transactions. A Long Crypto History: From Bitcoin to Diem Shopify’s latest venture into stablecoins builds on more than a decade of crypto experimentation . The company enabled its merchants to accept Bitcoin as far back as 2013, partnering with third-party gateways like BitPay and Solana Pay. According to the Shopify Help Center, the platform now supports nine alternative crypto payment methods, although it notes that direct methods like Shopify Payments perform better during high-volume flash sales due to faster settlements.

2025-06-13T10:19:58,"How Low Can Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Prices Go?","The post How Low Can Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Prices Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has faced the wrath of geopolitical tensions and monetary policies. The recent Israel-Iran war news has led to the market cap of the business dropping by 2.51% to $3.37 trillion. This fall in numbers was catalyzed by $1.14 billion worth of liquidations. Amidst this downturn, the top-tier cryptos, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices have taken a substantial hit. In this price analysis, I will walk you through the plausible future of these cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: Bitcoin is currently priced at $104,777.84, down 2.79% on the day. With a massive surge in 24-hour volume by 28.85% to $69.67 billion, the rising sell volume signals a panic-induced liquidation. The daily chart shared by me highlights that the RSI hovers at 48.85, indicating waning bullish momentum. The price has slipped below the 20-day SMA at $106,454, and a rejection from the middle Bollinger Band confirms the dominance of bears. The support zone at $101,909 is critical. If breached, I believe BTC price could plunge to the psychological mark of $100,000, which also aligns with the lower Bollinger Band. That being said, the upside potential remains capped near $113,000, unless macro conditions improve significantly. Until then, traders may expect sideways to downward movement with a bearish bias. Also read: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: Ethereum price has faced a heavy correction, and is down 7.83% to $2,531.74. As a result, the market cap has shrunk to $305.38 billion. The 30.82% rise in volume at $39.09 billion hints at further short-term capitulation. The RSI has dropped to 49.43, nearing neutral but pointing downwards. It is worth noting that the ETH’s candle has decisively broken below the midline of the Bollinger Bands at $2,593, now testing the lower range at $2,404. I believe the last line of defense stands at $2,336, a key support level from the chart. A daily close below that could open room toward $2,200. Recovery will face resistance at $2,783, the upper Bollinger band. Until bulls regain strength above the 20-day SMA, the downside risk remains a concern. Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! Ripple XRP Price Analysis: XRP has been under my watch for quite some time now, and it has plunged by 5.08% to trade at $2.12, with its market cap now at $125.26 billion. It’s battling to hold above $2.09, the daily low, and sees its resistance at around $2.35. On the technical side, the RSI sits weak at 41.37, suggesting sellers are in control. The price has broken below the 20-day SMA of $2.22, with the next support at $1.9645, marked on the chart. Breaking this zone may bring further decline toward $1.85. That being said, for any notable rebound, XRP needs to reclaim the 20-day SMA and push toward $2.3496, but the current structure leans bearish. If you are an XRP hodler, you should not miss out on our Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Can Bitcoin fall below $100,000? Yes, if the market sentiment deteriorates and the $101,909 support fails, BTC price may revisit the $100k psychological level. Q2: What’s the downside target for Ethereum if the correction continues? If ETH breaks below $2,336, it could slide further toward $2,200, especially if broader market sentiment worsens. Q3: Should you buy XRP right now? Not yet. With the RSI under 45 and price nearing a key support at $1.96, it’s better to wait for confirmation of reversal before buying.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/how-low-can-bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-prices-go/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Price Analysis",cryptocompare

BTC’s price has already experienced substantial volatility after the initial Israeli missile strikes against Iran, but has recovered some ground and now stands close to $105,000. Trump said on his own social media platform that he “gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest words, to “just do it,” but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done.” The POTUS blamed it on a certain “Iranian hardliner” who spoke “bravely,” but noted that all of the top military personnel are now dead. Consequently, Trump urged the nation’s leaders to sign the nuclear deal once again, or the situation could worsen. “The United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come – And they know how to use it.” He warned that the next planned attacks will be even more brutal and Iran should make a deal before “there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.” Israel’s strike earlier this morning led to immediate price volatility across all financial sectors. While oil went up , the ever-volatile crypto market plunged, with BTC dumping below $103,000 for the first time since last Friday. However, the asset has recovered some ground and now stands close to $105,000. Investors should be aware that more volatility is likely to follow if the tension between the US, Iran, and Israel further escalates. BTCUSD.

The vote is scheduled for Tuesday, June 17, and could mark a turning point for crypto regulation in the country. The U.S. Treasury Secretary believes the stablecoin market cap could exceed $2 trillion in the next few years. What’s the GENIUS Act About? The full name of the bill is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act. Its goal is to bring legal clarity to stablecoins by setting specific rules for issuers. If passed, stablecoin providers would be required to fully back their tokens with U.S. dollars or other liquid assets. The bill also mandates yearly audits for companies that issue more than $50 billion worth of stablecoins, and it includes extra compliance measures for foreign issuers like Tether . The U.S. Senate will hold a final vote on the GENIUS Act—a major stablecoin regulation bill—on June 17. If passed, it moves to the House. pic.twitter.com/ZRmUqzqOpq — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) June 13, 2025 What Happens After the Senate Vote? If the Senate passes the GENIUS Act, the bill will move to the House of Representatives for further review and voting. The House already has its version of a stablecoin bill, called the STABLE Act, which was passed out of committee in May. However, the two bills differ in some key areas, especially in how they regulate state-based issuers and handle oversight for foreign stablecoin companies. For the legislation to become law, both the Senate and House must agree on a final version of the bill. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. May Issue Crypto Bonds Backed by Bitcoin and XRP, Says Ex-CFTC Chair , Why This Matters Now Stablecoin legislation has become a hot topic, especially after President Donald Trump voiced support for clearer crypto laws . Trump wants to see progress by August, adding urgency to the process. Earlier this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that passing such a law could open the door for massive growth in the stablecoin sector. He even predicted the market could explode to over $2 trillion by 2028. Right now, the USD stablecoin market stands at around $252 billion, according to CoinGecko. Tuesday’s vote could be the first major step toward building a clear and unified rulebook for stablecoins in the U.S. Whether the GENIUS Act becomes law or not, it’s clear that Washington is finally getting serious about crypto regulation . Globally, big investors are eyeing the stablecoin market, and if approved in the US, it will open the door for global investors to flood the US market. In parallel news, China’s largest fintech company, Ant Group, plans to launch stablecoin payments and is preparing to apply for licenses in Singapore and Hong Kong. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-13T10:09:17,"Anthony Pompliano to Lead $750M Bitcoin Acquisition Bid via Public Firm","The post Anthony Pompliano to Lead $750M Bitcoin Acquisition Bid via Public Firm appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano is stepping into the spotlight again – this time to lead a public company planning to raise $750 million to buy Bitcoin. The move comes as investor confidence in crypto is rebounding, helped by pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration. The deal involves a potential merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1, a SPAC backed by Cohen & Company, and signals a major shift toward growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Here’s how Pompliano is positioning himself at the heart of this renewed momentum. Crypto’s New CEO: Pompliano Takes Charge Pompliano is reportedly in talks to lead ProCapBTC, a new group aiming to raise $500 million in equity and $250 million in convertible debt, according to a Financial Times report. The plan is to use this capital to directly purchase Bitcoin – similar to the aggressive strategies of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy and Japan’s Metaplanet . The funding would come through a planned merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1, which went public on Nasdaq last month with a $250 million upsized IPO. The merger is expected to be announced soon, though discussions are still ongoing. Pompliano already has experience in this space. Just last month, he launched ProCap Acquisition Corp, another SPAC, through a $220 million IPO. It’s not yet clear how the two ProCap entities are connected, based on public info. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Polices Make an Impact Under Trump’s second term, crypto is making a comeback with support from the top. His administration’s pro-crypto outlook is helping to bring back big money, and big players, into the space. ProCapBTC’s focus on acquiring Bitcoin fits right into this larger trend. IPOs from crypto firms like Bullish and Gemini are gaining traction, and Circle’s stock initially jumped 170%, reflecting growing demand for exposure to digital assets. If the deal goes through, Pompliano could play a key role in what may become the administration’s broader push for crypto adoption. Why Anthony Pompliano is a Perfect Choice? Pompliano has been in crypto since 2013, has over 1.7 million X followers, and holds deep market understanding. His influence, podcast success, and $220 million blank-cheque experience make him a top contender to lead ProCapBTC’s $750 million Bitcoin investment goal. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and growing institutional demand further facilitate this move, making Pompliano at the forefront of Bitcoin’s institutional revolution.

Here Are the Details","Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued their strong momentum on June 12, recording a total net inflow of $112 million and recording positive flows for 19 consecutive days. Ethereum Spot ETFs Record $112 Million Inflows on June 12, Outperforming Bitcoin for 19th Day in a Row On the same day, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $86.31 million, extending their streak for four consecutive days. The latest figures show continued investor interest in Ethereum-based products, which have consistently outpaced Bitcoin ETFs in net inflows in recent weeks. Analysts cite growing optimism about Ethereum’s role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, positive regulatory signals, and expectations for future network upgrades as the drivers behind this trend. The strong inflows also reflect a broader revival of institutional crypto interest, with both BTC and ETH ETFs continuing to attract capital amid relatively stable market conditions. It is eagerly awaited how the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets will be affected following today's Israel-Iran tensions. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T10:00:30,"Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next?","The Bitcoin price has suffered a violent rejection after hitting the $110,000 level, showing a clear intention of the bears to keep the digital asset from hitting new all-time highs. So far, the rejections from $110,000 have been swift and have put the bears back in control. This has given credence to calls that the Bitcoin price will fall back below the psychological level of $100,000, something that could trigger another wave of declines in the crypto market. Bitcoin Rejection At $110,000 Part Of The Plan? The Bitcoin price rejection has no doubt triggered a wave of panic among investors, many of whom believe that this is the end of the cycle. However, a crypto analyst has suggested that the pullback is part of the larger plan as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap moves on its way to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000 In the analysis, they explain that the digital asset is currently at a point where it is undergoing significant distribution, and this will explain the decline in price. The pullback in and of itself is no cause for alarm, as minor corrections after major surges are normal. In addition to this, there is a lot of accumulation going on as Bitcoin moves from the hands of old investors into the hands of new investors at a higher cost basis. The accumulation is expected to move Bitcoin into the next bullish wave. This bullish wave is the next step in the trend as the BTC price moves into place for the next price surge. Once the volume moves upward as expected, then the asset’s price is expected to follow in succession. BTC Price Could Hit $130,000 Target After Breakout Going by the analyst’s chart shared on the TradingView website, the Bitcoin price correction is not expected to last for long. Mainly, holding the $107,000 support becomes paramount at this level as this could set the launchpad point for the next bullish impulse. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target The completion of the accumulation phase puts the next breakout level as high as $130,000, which would be an over 20% increase from the current level. However, this may not be the end as the crypto analyst has set a swing target for as high as $150,000. As for the timeline for when this could happen, the crypto analyst places a long-term target for the end of the year 2025. But there is also the possibility that the trend would be completed sooner and the Bitcoin price could reach its target and new all-time highs before the year runs out.

This comes after the court rejected the original proposal on June 4. In response, Zettai filed a formal request on June 6 under case HC/SUM 940/2025 seeking “further arguments,” as confirmed by WazirX on X (formerly Twitter). Update on Proposed Scheme of Arrangement As we shared last week, the Singapore Court has declined Zettai’s application in HC/SUM 940/2025 (“SUM 940”) for the Court’s sanction of Zettai’s proposed Scheme.

If the High Court accepts the restructuring plan, Zettai may be required to file a new submission and attend further hearings. The company has been under pressure since WazirX’s hack on July 18, 2024, in which over ₹2,000 crore vanished , leaving 4.4 million users in limbo with no access to their funds. However, the delay in court proceedings has left users frustrated, and if the proposal is not approved, Zettai’s only option will be a longer and more complex appeal process. Silence From WazirX Founder Nischal Shetty Throughout the legal proceedings, WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty has remained noticeably silent. While he has acknowledged the legal case, he has not issued a public apology to affected users nor shared any repayment plans. Despite the ongoing crisis, no refunds have been initiated, and no user funds have been recovered. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is The Crypto Market Going Down Today? , Shetty Focuses on Shardeum Despite WazirX Collapse Amid WazirX’s ongoing troubles, Shetty appears to be focusing on Shardeum, his new Layer 1 blockchain venture. This week, Shardeum Foundation announced MiCA whitepaper acknowledgment, allowing operations in Europe—an achievement promoted by Shetty on social media. Although Shetty has distanced himself from WazirX publicly, Shardeum is still mentioned in his X bio, raising questions about his true involvement in both ventures. What’s Next for WazirX? Zettai has submitted two proposals so far—both rejected by the Singapore High Court . With June 20 approaching, the crypto community is anxiously awaiting the court’s final verdict. If rejected again, Zettai is expected to file an appeal, but there is no official roadmap for repayment or resolution. Final Thoughts With millions in user funds at stake, the crypto world will be watching closely as Singapore’s High Court delivers its decision on June 20. For now, WazirX users remain in the dark, holding onto hope for a favorable outcome. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

WazirX suffered a major hack on July 18, 2024, resulting in the loss of over ₹2,000 crore (approx. $235 million) in user funds, leading to a halt in its operations and ongoing restructuring efforts. When will WazirX resume trading? WazirX halted operations after the hack. While there were plans for a relaunch in Q2 2025 and withdrawal functionality restored by mid-April 2025, the recent rejection of their restructuring plan by the Singapore High Court adds uncertainty to the exact timeline for resuming full trading. Who hacked WazirX?

2025-06-13T09:58:15,"Ethereum Whale Snaps Up $127M in ETH Amid Market Panic","A deep-pocketed Ethereum whale is defying the current crypto bloodbath, scooping up tens of thousands of ETH while panic grips the broader market. On June 13, blockchain tracking account Lookonchain revealed on X that the mysterious trader bought 48,825 ETH, worth approximately $127 million, from Coinbase and Wintermute, over an eight-hour period at an average price of $2,605 per coin. Opportunity in Turmoil This fresh accumulation came amid a brutal market rout sparked by reports of Israeli missile strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The preemptive move sent shockwaves through equities, commodities, and, most notably, digital assets, with more than $190 billion in crypto market value evaporating within hours, driving the price of Bitcoin (BTC) down nearly 5% to $103,000. Ethereum also suffered a similar fate, plunging from $2,760 to a low of $2,470, to erase gains from its recent surge to a 15-week high of $2,830 just days prior. Currently, ETH is trading at about $2,520, down 8.6% in the last 24 hours. Still, it added an extra 2.3% over seven days, outpacing the broader crypto market’s rather measly 0.1% gain in that time. Yet while retail traders fled for the exits, liquidating more than $1 billion in leveraged positions, this veteran whale saw an opportunity. And it isn’t their first strategic move: Lookonchain’s earlier posts traced their footsteps back to late April. On April 27, the entity bought 600 BTC and 30,000 ETH, with the latter costing just under $55 million. Weeks later, on May 22, they sold that ETH at $2,621 each, netting about $23.73 million in profit. Undeterred by volatility, they plunged back in on May 26, acquiring another 30,000 ETH for $75.39 million at $2,513 per coin. That batch was sold just three days ago on June 10 for $82.76 million, securing a further $7.3 million gain. Today’s $127 million buy marks the whale’s largest single accumulation spree yet, executed as retail traders jettisoned their holdings. Confidence in a Rebound? The move appears to be a calculated gamble that the recent plunge in ETH’s value is an overreaction. The whale often leverages OTC desks for discreet, large-scale moves, avoiding slippage and market impact, a luxury unavailable to retail. Their proven track record of buying fear and selling into strength suggests they may view the dip below key technical and psychological support as a prime accumulation zone, betting on Ethereum’s strong fundamental backdrop, including sustained ETF inflows , a supportive U.S. regulatory shift , as well as Vitalik Buterin’s recently unveiled scaling roadmap updates.
