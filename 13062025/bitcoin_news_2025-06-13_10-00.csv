2025-06-13T07:54:30,"Предпродажа SOLX за ночь собрала еще $1 млн и достигла $48 млн","Предпродажа Solaxy (SOLX) за прошлую ночь привлекла еще $1 млн инвестиций, доведя общую сумму финансирования на пресейле до более чем $48 млн. Осталось всего четыре дня для того, чтобы присоединиться к проекту на самых выгодных условиях. В то же время команда проекта анонсировала два крупных обновления, которые вызвали волну обсуждений в сообществе. Первое – это прорыв в инфраструктуре кросс-чейнов, а второе – подтверждение, что Layer-2 сеть Solaxy официально запустится вскоре после того, как $SOLX начнет торговаться на ведущих биржах. Забудьте о обещаниях в дорожных картах – Solaxy действительно реализует задуманное. С запуском своей сети и новыми мощными инфраструктурными решениями проект не просто лидирует в гонке Layer-2 на Solana, он делает это без конкурентов. Приближается окончание периода пресейла, и $SOLX все еще доступен по цене всего $0.001754 – вероятно, это последний шанс купить токен по такой цене перед тем, как он станет доступен широкой базе инвесторов. Для поддержки запуска токена Solaxy недавно сожгла 35 046 000 000 токенов $SOLX стоимостью более $62 мнл по текущей цене пресейла, убрав таким образом 25% от общего предложения и увеличив эксклюзивность оставшихся в обращении монет. От Solana к Ethereum: партнерство Solaxy с Hyperlane открывает истинную совместимость L2 Новое партнерство Solaxy с Hyperlane закладывает основу для эффективного взаимодействия между экосистемами – Solana, Solaxy и Ethereum. Модульная архитектура Hyperlane bridge позволит токенам перемещаться по цепочкам без ущерба для скорости или децентрализации. Для пользователей Solaxy это означает, что они смогут вносить депозиты с помощью Solana, взаимодействовать с dApps и протоколами на Solaxy и выводить средства с минимальными затратами. В долгосрочной перспективе это также обеспечит совместимость на базе Ethereum, позволяя пользователям получать доступ к Solaxy dApps и токенизированной экономике без предварительного прохождения маршрута через Solana. Обновление выходит за рамки внутренних улучшений – это основа для платформы запуска токенов Solaxy, протокола Igniter, позволяющего обрабатывать непрерывные запуски токенов в больших масштабах. Если уровень внедрения будет таким же, как у Pump.fun, на который в последнее время по-прежнему приходится более 50% всех внедрений токенов Solana, Solaxy понадобится нечто большее, чем просто масштабируемость. Ей нужна будет бесперебойная совместимость с самого первого дня. Источник: Dune Analytics Сеть второго уровня Solaxy и токен $SOLX работают вместе – редкое преимущество для первых спонсоров И, как уже упоминалось, Solaxy делает то, чего вы обычно не видите в криптографии, особенно в предпродажных проектах. После события генерации токенов $SOLX (TGE) экосистема Solaxy не просто перейдет в режим разработки – произойдет запуск настоящей сети второго уровня! Реализовано это будет вскоре после того, как $SOLX начнет торговаться на биржах – возможно, уже в июле. На веб-сайте указано, что запуск сети “неизбежен”. Такое быстрое продолжение редко встречается. Большинство проектов привлекают средства, листят свои токены, а затем оставляют ранних инвесторов ждать месяцами или даже годами, пока их основная цепочка или децентрализованное приложение появятся. Solaxy не поступает так. Для ранних инвесторов это означает мгновенную актуальность. Токен не будет «в подвешенном состоянии» – он будет работать в живой, растущей экосистеме с самого начала. Каждая интеграция мостов, запуск приложений и транзакция в цепочке добавляют реальную ценность $SOLX с момента выхода на рынок. В криптоторговле время очень важно. График запуска Solaxy посылает ясный сигнал: это не просто дорожная карта – это реальное выполнение планов. Чтобы поддержать свою технологию и проверить цепочку на прочность, команда также объявила награду в размере $25,000 за найденные баги на платформе Cantina — вознаграждая тех, кто обнаружит критические уязвимости. Что произойдет, когда решение Solana по разгрузке сети появится на крупных биржах? Solaxy создана для разгрузки огромного трафика, который часто перегружает базовый слой Solana, особенно во время пиковых циклов, активности торговых ботов и всплесков мем-монет. Направляя эту активность через собственную среду Solaxy, проект дает сети Solana возможность “перевести дух”, одновременно предлагая пользователям более быстрый и масштабируемый слой Layer-2 для взаимодействия с dApps. Проекты, такие как Snorter Token ($SNORT) , которые зависят от скорости и высокочастотной торговли, ожидается, смогут работать совместно с Solaxy, укрепляя роль цепочки как высокопроизводительного Layer-2, созданного для современного Web3. При цене пресейла $0.001754, ограниченном предложении и почти $50 млн финансирования, $SOLX не нужно много трафика, чтобы взлететь. Даже скромная активность DeFi-экосистемы Solana стоимостью $9 млрд или рынка стейблкоинов стоимостью $11 млрд может значительно поднять стоимость токена до двузначных значений. Осталось всего 3 дня – присоединяйтесь к предпродаже Solaxy, пока есть время А чтобы стать первым спонсором, пока еще есть время, зайдите на официальный сайт Solaxy, подключите поддерживаемый кошелек и купите токены $SOLX. Их можно сразу же отправить в стейкинг, чтобы увеличить свои активы – в настоящее время протокол предлагает динамичный доход в размере 85%, который корректируется в зависимости от активности пула. Для удобства используйте Best Wallet , рекомендуемый некастодиальный Web3-кошелек с полной предпродажной интеграцией и поддержкой нескольких цепочек.

2025-06-13T07:43:35,"Czech Opposition Pushes No-Confidence Vote Over $45M Bitcoin Deal Scandal","The post Czech Opposition Pushes No-Confidence Vote Over $45M Bitcoin Deal Scandal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Czech government is facing strong backlash after it was revealed that nearly $45 million worth of Bitcoin, seized from a convicted criminal, was quietly sold by the Justice Ministry. The sale has now sparked a political storm, leading to the resignation of the justice minister and a call for a no-confidence motion in parliament. $45 Million Bitcoin Scandal The scandal started when the Czech Justice Ministry revealed it had auctioned nearly 500 Bitcoins. These digital assets were seized from Tomas Jirikovsky, an online drug dealer convicted in 2017. He had been in prison from 2017 to 2021 for drug trafficking, fraud, and illegal possession of weapons. While the sale raised approximately 1 billion Czech koruna (about $45 million), the opposition argues that the transaction lacked proper transparency and oversight. Meanwhile, Justice Minister Blazek was criticized for accepting the funds without involving police or prosecutors to verify if the assets were legal, raising concerns about whether the government may have unintentionally legitimized money from criminal sources. Opposition Call For No-Confidence Motion Alena Schillerova, vice chair of the opposition ANO party, called the situation unacceptable. In a recent tweet post , she said there was “no choice” but to file a no-confidence motion, which is now scheduled for Tuesday. ANO is demanding to know who approved the sale, whether the Bitcoin’s origins were legally verified, and if any party improperly benefited. This case highlights the growing need for transparency when governments handle digital assets like Bitcoin. With public trust at stake and elections approaching, how the Czech government responds now could shape its political future. Justice Minister Steps Down As pressure grew, Justice Minister Pavel Blazek resigned on May 30. Although he denied any wrongdoing, he said he was stepping down to protect the government’s image ahead of the October elections. Eva Decroix has stepped in as the new justice minister and has promised an independent probe into the sale. She has also said the ministry will fully cooperate during the investigation. Crypto Scandals Aren’t Just Local This controversy isn’t happening in a vacuum. Around the world, other political leaders are facing similar heat. Argentina’s President Javier Milei faced backlash after a token he promoted collapsed in price, though he was later cleared.

Bitcoin continues to dip, testing key support levels; however, while the geopolitical turmoil is sparking a broad “risk-off” move, on-chain data reveals crypto whales seem to be making their next big move. One analyst has listed a few whale-favourite altcoins that could be gearing up for a rally soon. Altcoin 1: Cardano (ADA) In the last few days, whales have bought over $120 million worth of Cardano (ADA), according to whale alert.

According to data from crypto.news, WhiteBIT Coin ( WBT ) rallied for the third straight day, hitting a new all-time high of $34.3 on June 13 afternoon Asian time. As of press time, its price has settled at $33.67 with a market cap of $4.85 billion, ranking it as the 33rd among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. WBT retained some of its past day gains as the broader crypto market was reeling from Israel’s launch of a major military attack against Iran early morning on June 13, in response to which Iran has promised to take retaliatory measures of its own. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped about 5% to an intraday low of $103,081, while major altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DO G E ) saw losses between 6%-10%, with crypto liquidations soaring 125% to $1.2 billion in a day. You might also like: Tencent reopens talks to acquire South Korea’s Nexon, a game developer exploring blockchain Why is WBT rallying? One key factor driving WBT’s gains today is its announcement of a spot listing for the HOME token, which powers the DeFi App platform, while also adding a HOME-PERP pair to its futures section, drawing in more traders and boosting volume. WBT also gained investor interest as the exchange teased an upcoming partnership with an undisclosed European football club. On-chain activity further supports the bullish sentiment. Data shows a 580% spike in daily active addresses, a strong sign that more users are interacting with the WhiteBIT ecosystem. Meanwhile, Santiment reported a notable increase in whale accumulation, indicating that large holders are buying up WBT. This kind of activity often signals confidence in the token’s longer-term potential and can amplify price momentum during bullish phases . Source: Santiment At press time, WBT had shed some of its gains but still managed to retain its position as the highest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, with bullish momentum continuing to outweigh broader market selling pressure. WBT price analysis On the 1-day USDT chart, WBT looks to have been forming an ascending broadening wedge pattern since early May, typically a sign of increasing volatility within an uptrend. WBT price, MACD and Aroon chart — June 13 | Source: crypto.news The Aroon Up indicator is currently at 92.86%, while Aroon Down is at 28.57%, showing that bullish momentum is still in play. The MACD lines are also pointing upward, adding to the positive sentiment. If this momentum holds, WBT could climb toward the key psychological level of $35. A clear breakout above that would confirm the bullish pattern and may encourage bulls to aim for $38 next, marking a 13% gain from current prices. On the contrary, if market risk sentiment weakens due to escalating macro tensions, the nearest support level to watch would be around $31, where traders previously stepped in to buy the dip.

2025-06-13T07:18:30,"Crypto Liquidations: $1.14 Billion Wiped Out as Market Faces Double Attack?","The post Crypto Liquidations: $1.14 Billion Wiped Out as Market Faces Double Attack? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has witnessed a steep fall. The prime reason for this is the war tensions between Israel and Iran. The dispute escalated again as Israel launched an air strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities on June 13. Moreover, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest inflation report refused hopes for any interest rate cuts in June. This dual pressure from geopolitics and monetary policy has sent shockwaves through the market, leading to over $1.14 billion in liquidations. As crypto traders took the brunt, many sought refuge in safer assets like gold, with PAX Gold and Tether Gold among the rare green tokens in a sea of red. $1.14 Billion Worth Liquidation Hits Traders In the past 24 hours, 246,590 traders have been liquidated, which highlights a severe slash across the derivatives market. The total liquidations as of press time have spiked to $1.14 billion, emphasizing the intense volatility triggered by the external factors. Source: CoinGlass The single largest liquidation was registered on Binance’s BTC/USDT pair, wiping out a jaw-dropping $201.31 million in one go. Binance accounted for the largest share overall, registering $455.60M, Bybit followed next with $370.83M, and OKX with $125.58M. Bitcoin and Ethereum took the major brunt among cryptocurrencies, with $443.77M and $289.96M, respectively, in liquidation volume. Other altcoins, such as SOL, saw $51.95M, and DOGE took $25.61M in liquidations. Source: CoinGlass Where Is the Crypto Market Heading? At the time of press, the total market cap of the industry stands at $3.37 trillion, down 2.51%, while 24-hour trading volume is down 4.77% at $129.97 billion. The Fear & Greed Index remains at a greed-driven score of 61, which is expected to come lower as the day passes. Bitcoin presently trades 3.12% lower at $104,437.94, while Ethereum has taken a bigger hit, down 8.85% at $2,517.03. Major altcoins also faced pressure, with XRP at a 5.47% loss to $2.12 and SOL down 9.74% to $144.33. With BTC dominance at 63.2% and ETH at 9.8%, the market remains heavily reliant on Bitcoin’s resilience. However, unless geopolitical risks settle and macroeconomic stability returns, further downside could be in store.

According to data from Deribit, the contracts, scheduled to expire at 08:00 UTC, represent one of the largest expiries this quarter. The open interest includes nearly equal amounts of calls and puts, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.95. This suggests a slightly bullish bias, though the current spot price, hovering around $104,000, sits well below the max pain point of $107,000. 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $3.7B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $3.04B notional | Put-Call: 0.95 | Max Pain: $107K $ETH : $687M notional | Put-Call: 1.20 | Max Pain: $2,700 ETH upside flows are strong heading into expiry. Will… pic.twitter.com/kLHnzspiXE — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) June 12, 2025 The max pain level is where option holders feel the most financial loss and often acts as a magnetic level in the final trading hours before expiry. Ethereum ( ETH ) options worth $678 million are also due to expire. Unlike Bitcoin ( BTC ), ETH’s put-to-call ratio sits at a more bearish 1.23, reflecting traders hedging downside risk after recent declines. Options are derivative contracts that grant traders the right, but not the obligation, to purchase (call) or sell (put) an asset at a fixed price. Spot prices may be impacted as traders unwind hedges or roll positions when large volumes of options expire. During these times, price frequently moves toward the maximum pain level, particularly in markets with low volume. Read more: Dow, Nasdaq up 0.24%, S&P gains 0.38% on rate cut expectation The current expiry coincides with pressure on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has dropped 7% to $3.3 trillion, and Bitcoin has lost over 5% in the last day. Analysts point to Israel’s attack on Iran as the cause of the macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is beginning to show early signs of a trend shift. The price has slipped below the 20-day moving average, which is often used to predict short-term direction. A decline in bullish momentum is indicated by the relative strength index’s trend below the neutral 50 mark. Although volume has slightly increased, it is still insufficient to validate a complete bearish breakdown. BTC price analysis. Credit: crypto.news A short squeeze might be triggered if Bitcoin maintains above $101,000 and recovers $105,000 before expiration, which could push the price back toward $107,000, the maximum pain level and important resistance. Further declines could be possible if there is a clear break below $101,000, with $97,800 and $95,000 serving as potential support levels. A decline through those areas might signal a more significant correction.

While the world’s largest asset manager hasn’t made any official move yet, Geraci says BlackRock is unlikely to sit back and watch others dominate this next wave of crypto ETFs. Btw, I still fully expect BlackRock to file for spot sol & xrp ETFs… As leader in both spot btc & eth ETFs, it would make *zero* sense to cede other top crypto asset ETF categories to competitors. Related, I also fully expect BlackRock to file for index-based crypto asset ETF. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 12, 2025 BlackRock Could Make a Move Soon, Will it be XRP or SOL? Geraci believes that with BlackRock already leading the charge in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , it won’t want to miss out on the next big opportunity, XRP or Solana. In his view, XRP is now better positioned thanks to recent legal clarity and the launch of regulated XRP futures on the CME . These futures contracts, he says, are often a key step before spot ETFs are filed. He even suggested that the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which already holds XRP, could be turned into a full-fledged ETF. Interestingly, Polymarket shows higher approval odds for SOL—XRP at 87%, Solana at 90%. Get ready for a potential Alt Coin ETF Summer with Solana likely leading the way (as well as some basket products) via @JSeyff note this morning which includes fresh odds for all the spot ETFs. pic.twitter.com/UMzih4oou7 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 10, 2025 Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas hinted at a possible “ Altcoin ETF Summer ,” suggesting that Solana could lead the charge in upcoming altcoin ETFs. He shared insights from fellow analyst James Seyffart’s latest note, which includes updated odds for various spot ETF approvals. The post points to growing optimism around both individual altcoin ETFs and broader crypto basket products gaining traction soon. Why the Hold-Up? Despite the growing momentum, BlackRock remains focused on its two crypto products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust and the iShares Ethereum Trust, which have both seen strong performance. Last year, BlackRock’s ETF head, Samara Cohen, mentioned that only Bitcoin and Ethereum met their standards for liquidity and maturity. It’s unclear whether that stance has evolved since XRP’s legal status has become clearer. Still, regulatory uncertainty remains. Ripple and the SEC are awaiting final approval of their settlement, and XRP’s futures market is still developing compared to BTC and ETH. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For June 13 , XRP ETF Filings Piling Up While BlackRock watches from the sidelines, other major players are taking the lead.

The drop came after Israel launched an attack on Iranian nuclear sites on June 12, causing Bitcoin to fall from $107,000 to $103,000. In just one day, around $636 million was liquidated from the market. Now, there are tensions about Bitcoin slipping further to $102,000 or even $101,000. Despite this bearish trend, many analysts still believe Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of the year . But the big question is — how will Bitcoin achieve this, and what are the key reasons behind such a massive prediction? Why Bitcoin Could Hit $200k By The Year End? In a recent episode , Scott Melker discussed with Alice Liu from CoinMarketCap strong reasons why Bitcoin could rally to $200,000 soon. Liu said, “Crypto market is the golden moment. You need a catalyst like this to trigger people in non-crypto space to look at this.” Big Companies Are Buying Bitcoin: Companies and institutions from the U.S., Europe, Japan, and other regions are adding Bitcoin to their corporate treasury reserves . This rising demand from businesses is putting extra buying pressure on the market while supply stays limited, especially after the recent Bitcoin halving . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Israel-Iran Conflict Triggers Crypto Crash: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices Plunge Hard , Supply Is Drying Up : Bitcoin miners are currently selling very little into the market, averaging only around 500 BTC a day.

Bitcoin is down today, June 13, 2025, primarily due to increased geopolitical tensions following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. This triggered a broader market sell-off and risk-off sentiment among investors. How does institutional buying influence Bitcoin’s price? Big companies and institutions buying Bitcoin for their corporate treasury reserves create significant buying pressure, pushing the price higher as supply remains constrained. How does Bitcoin’s supply affect its price potential? Bitcoin’s limited supply, especially with miners selling very little (around 500 BTC/day) after the halving, creates a supply-demand imbalance that naturally drives its price up.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/three-reasons-why-bitcoin-could-hit-200k-by-the-end-of-2025/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T07:10:12,"Surge: Ethereum ETF Inflows Mirror Bitcoin ETF Trajectory","BitcoinWorld Surge: Ethereum ETF Inflows Mirror Bitcoin ETF Trajectory Are we witnessing history repeat itself? The recent performance of Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) suggests a pattern remarkably similar to the groundbreaking launch and subsequent activity of Bitcoin ETFs. This trend is capturing significant attention in the crypto market, indicating growing institutional and retail interest in Ethereum as an investable asset class. Understanding the Dynamics of Ethereum ETF Inflows Recent analysis highlights a compelling comparison: the flow of funds into Ethereum (ETH) ETFs appears to be tracking the path previously blazed by Bitcoin ETFs, particularly when accounting for the difference in their respective market capitalizations. This isn’t just a casual observation; data points are reinforcing this narrative. For instance, on June 11th, U.S. spot ETH ETF products recorded a substantial net inflow totaling approximately $240 million. This figure represents the second-largest single-day inflow observed since these products began trading. More significantly, these ETH ETFs have demonstrated remarkable consistency, maintaining a trend of net inflows for 18 consecutive days. This sustained positive flow is a key indicator of robust demand. Comparing this to the initial phases of Bitcoin ETF trading, we see parallels in investor behavior and capital allocation. While the absolute dollar amounts might differ due to Bitcoin’s larger market size, the proportional interest relative to the asset’s valuation appears strikingly similar. This suggests that the investment thesis for allocating capital via regulated ETF structures is extending beyond Bitcoin to Ethereum. How Do Ethereum ETF Inflows Compare to Bitcoin ETF Trends? The comparison between Ethereum ETF inflows and Bitcoin ETF trends is crucial for understanding the maturing crypto investment landscape. When Bitcoin spot ETFs launched in the U.S. in January 2024, they saw unprecedented trading volume and significant initial inflows, albeit offset initially by outflows from older Grayscale products. However, the net trend quickly turned positive and remained strong for extended periods. Here’s a breakdown of the comparison points: Relative Scale: While Bitcoin’s market cap is significantly larger than Ethereum’s, the inflow amounts into ETH ETFs, when adjusted for this difference, show a comparable level of investor enthusiasm and capital deployment relative to the asset’s size. Sustained Inflows: Both asset classes have demonstrated periods of sustained net inflows into their ETF products after launch, indicating persistent buying pressure rather than just initial speculative interest. The 18 consecutive days of ETH ETF inflows is a strong signal mirroring similar streaks seen with Bitcoin ETFs. Market Impact: Both types of ETFs provide regulated, accessible avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure. Their inflows directly impact the underlying asset’s price dynamics by increasing demand for the spot asset held by the fund issuers. Investor Base: The investor base for both appears to be a mix of retail gaining easy access through brokerage accounts and institutions seeking regulated exposure without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. This similarity suggests that the regulatory approval and accessibility provided by the ETF structure are powerful drivers of adoption for major cryptocurrencies. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Growing Crypto ETF Popularity? The increasing popularity and inflows into both Ethereum ETF and Bitcoin ETF products bring several benefits and challenges to the forefront of the financial and crypto markets. Benefits: Increased Accessibility: ETFs make investing in crypto as easy as buying stocks through traditional brokerage accounts, opening the market to a much wider audience. Regulatory Clarity: Operating within regulated frameworks provides investors with greater confidence and protection compared to unregulated crypto exchanges. Institutional Adoption: ETFs are familiar vehicles for large institutions, facilitating their entry into the crypto space and potentially bringing significant capital. Price Discovery & Liquidity: Increased trading volume and interest can improve price discovery and add liquidity to the underlying assets. Challenges: Centralization Risk: A large portion of the asset supply being held by a few ETF issuers could introduce centralization risks. Market Volatility: While ETFs offer exposure, they don’t shield investors from the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies. Fee Structures: Investors pay management fees for ETFs, which can erode returns over time compared to direct ownership (though direct ownership has its own costs and risks). Potential for Market Manipulation: While regulated, large flows in and out of ETFs could potentially influence market dynamics. Despite the challenges, the overall trend of increasing ETF inflows is widely seen as a net positive for the long-term growth and legitimization of the crypto asset class. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching the development of ETH ETF and BTC ETF markets, the current trends offer several actionable insights: Monitor Inflow Trends: Consistent net inflows indicate strong buying pressure, which can be a bullish signal for the underlying asset price. Keep an eye on daily inflow data reported by financial news outlets. Understand the Correlation: Recognize that the success of Bitcoin ETFs has paved the way and set expectations for Ethereum ETFs. Their performance may continue to show correlated patterns. Evaluate Your Investment Goals: Determine if gaining crypto exposure through a regulated ETF aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy compared to direct ownership. Consider Diversification: The emergence of ETH ETFs alongside Bitcoin ETFs provides options for diversification within the crypto segment of a portfolio using traditional investment vehicles. Stay Informed on Regulations: The regulatory landscape for crypto and crypto-adjacent products is still evolving. Stay updated on any changes that could impact ETFs. The data on ETH ETF inflows suggests that Ethereum is following Bitcoin’s lead in attracting significant investment via regulated products. This trajectory could have substantial implications for ETH’s price and its position within the broader financial ecosystem. Concluding Thoughts on the Future of Crypto ETF Investment The recent surge in Ethereum ETF inflows, mirroring the earlier success of Bitcoin ETFs, underscores a pivotal moment for the digital asset market. It signals growing confidence from traditional investors and provides further validation of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment assets. As these regulated products gain traction, they are likely to continue bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain, potentially unlocking even greater capital flows into the space.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz. As AI narratives gain traction, many are intrigued to know, “What does the future hold for Worldcoin?” or “Could WLD stage a comeback?” Let’s delve into the anticipated Worldcoin price predictions for 2025 to 2030 and the years to come Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency WorldCoin WDC Token WDC Price $ 0.00349731 -10.28% Market Cap $ 0.00 Circulating Supply 0.00 Trading Volume $ 5.1958 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Q2 2025 price action for Worldcoin (WLD) clearly showed signs of exhaustion before it could push higher. Despite recent optimism, its inability to establish a sustained, long-term bullish trend remains evident. Looking at its historical performance, the recent Q2’s gains appear modest, like a mere bucket of water from a deep well. Since early 2024, WLD is still down over 80% from its highs, even with the latest price surge. The entire weekly price action on the Binance exchange resembles a converging price action structure in a falling channel. This pattern has given good returns when a catalyst shoots a breakout from this range. Many are now asking: What could truly push Worldcoin higher? As seen time and again in the crypto space, social sentiment is often the key driver. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly enhance Worldcoin’s perceived value. The recent investment marks a crucial first step in that direction. If, in the coming sessions, optimistic momentum builds up, then WLD must achieve a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure by breaking above the $2.12 level in May or June. Once this level is cleared and a ChoCh is confirmed, Worldcoin could break out of its bearish pattern and potentially retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, if WLD fails to maintain a bullish trajectory this year, its price could drop as low as $1.10.

In a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the Virginia-based McLean Mortgage Corporation says it has discovered a significant cybersecurity incident impacting 30,453 people. “On October 17, 2024, McLean identified suspicious activity within its digital systems. Upon learning of this activity, McLean immediately took steps to secure the network and engaged digital forensics specialists to investigate what happened and help determine whether any sensitive information may have been impacted.” The company says an internal investigation revealed that an unknown entity gained unauthorized access “to its network and may have downloaded certain files” that contained individuals’ personal information, including first and last name, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and financial account numbers. The firm says it has reported the data breach to federal law enforcement and provided “written notice of this incident to relevant state regulators, as necessary.” McLean Mortgage Corporation provides real estate mortgage services as well as advice on purchasing a home, loan first pre-approval and new construction. The firm says it issued letters of notice to affected individuals while offering a 12-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection service.

2025-06-13T07:00:58,"Bitcoin Is Just 0.2% Of Global Wealth — And That’s Why It’s Not Too Late: Analyst","According to Walker, host of The Bitcoin Podcast, Bitcoin’s share of the world’s wealth is still tiny. It sits at about $2 trillion in market value. That’s just 0.2% of roughly $1 quadrillion held across all assets. For many investors, that number brings a sense of how early this market really is. Yet, it also raises questions about what comes next for this highly talked-about coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Global Wealth Distribution Real estate holds the biggest slice of that $1 quadrillion pie. At around $370 trillion, it represents 37% of total global wealth. Bonds follow close behind with $318 trillion. Those are seen as a safe choice for retirees and conservative funds. Stocks, meanwhile, sit at $135 trillion. Cash and bank deposits add another almost $130 trillion to the mix. These numbers show where most of the world’s money lives today. There is $1000 TRILLION of global wealth. Bitcoin is only $2T… Bitcoin is only 0.2% of global wealth, and there will only ever be 21M bitcoins. We are insanely early yet many still feel like they’ve missed the boat… If you’re reading this, buy bitcoin. Chart: @Croesus_BTC pic.twitter.com/gjju41MMGm — Walker⚡️ (@WalkerAmerica) June 11, 2025 Bitcoin’s Market Share Bitcoin’s $2 trillion value looks small next to these giants. It comes in below art, cars and collectibles, which together amount to $27 trillion. Gold, long a trusted store of value, sits at $22 trillion. So, while Bitcoin is rare by design, it still trails behind assets with centuries of history and deep pockets on the buying side. Scarcity Fuels Price Talk With only 21 million coins ever to be mined, Bitcoin’s supply cap is fixed. That has led to forecasts of big price jumps if demand keeps growing. Based on reports, some say Bitcoin could match gold’s $22 trillion market cap one day. That would push a single coin past $1.15 million. Other backers warn that missing out now could mean buying in later at much higher levels, driven by FOMO—fear of missing out.

It was particularly noteworthy that despite the rising prices of Bitcoin, investors did not see the expected increase in profit taking. Commenting on the profit realization ratio (SOPR) obtained from on-chain data, Alphractal said: “This is surprising. Normally, when prices rise, the profit-taking rate increases and peaks at each new price level. However, right now, although the Bitcoin price is rising, profit-taking is not keeping pace. On the contrary, it is falling. This tells us that investors still see $100,000 as cheap.” Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson drew attention to two important metrics that stand out on technical analysis screens: “The vast majority of altcoins are still in the bearish zone on the 24-hour timeframe, with the MACD indicator. On the other hand, according to the weekly RSI data, some coins are in the overbought zone: TRX, SPX, XMR, GT, and even BTC. In contrast, the coin with the lowest RSI in the oversold zone is CTK, followed by Melania.” Related News: BREAKING: Company that Previously Announced Plans to Purchase $1 Billion of This Altcoin Withdraws Application Wedson drew particular attention to one altcoin in the market: “RENDER is in oversold territory and the increase in open interest on the 5-minute to 1-hour timeframe suggests that whales are long.” *This is not investment advice.

The recent air strikes by Israel on Iran have created geopolitical pressure, which has intensified the sell-offs. Meanwhile, the BTC price and the entire market have witnessed numerous pressures like these in the recent past and hence are believed to withstand the ongoing sell-off and turn out victorious soon. The crypto markets witnessed over $1.1 billion in liquidations, while S&P 500 futures fell 1.9% and crude oil & Gold surged. Meanwhile, from the technical point of view, the BTC chart pattern shows some worrying patterns that point towards more downside. The token printed 3 consecutive daily bearish candles and wiped out the gains incurred earlier this week. With this, the token has reached a crucial level where a rebound could trigger a strong upswing, while a pullback could cause some concerns. The daily chart of Bitcoin shows the formation of an inverse head and shoulder pattern, which is largely considered bullish. However, to validate the price, it is required to trigger a rebound from the lower support and rise along the curve to reach the neckline at around $110,500. If this happens, then the price is more likely to breach the neckline and form a new ATH. However, the technicians suggest a diverse price action showing the possibility of a pullback while the volume continues to drop. The CMF has dropped below 0, suggesting an outflow of money or sell-off, while the RSI is maintaining a steep descending trend. With this, the RSI has reached the ascending support, and hence a drop below the levels could initiate a fresh bearish trend, leading the price lower. To prevent excess drain, probably close to $100K or below, a daily close above the current levels is required, which may hinder the momentum of bears and eventually offer room for a consolidated ascending trend. Therefore, the upcoming weekly close could have a huge impact on the next Bitcoin (BTC) price rally.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-btc-tests-critical-support-amid-geopolitical-uncertainty-will-it-rebound-to-105k-or-drop-to-102k/,"BTC|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T06:33:33,"Fact Check: Is Ripple Dumping XRP Every Month?","The post Fact Check: Is Ripple Dumping XRP Every Month? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Each month, Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP from escrow , and this routine action often fuels rumors of a price dump. But is Ripple flooding the market? According to crypto analyst Vincent Van Code , the truth behind Ripple’s escrow system is far less dramatic—and far more strategic. How Ripple’s Monthly XRP Escrow Works Ripple uses a pre-programmed escrow system built into the XRP Ledger. Every month, 1 billion XRP is unlocked, but only a small portion enters the market . Vincent Van Code explains that more than 80% of the XRP is re-locked into new escrows immediately. The remaining XRP, typically 10% to 20%, is allocated to Ripple’s operational expenses, liquidity needs, and strategic partnerships. This method prevents sudden supply shocks and ensures long-term sustainability. Where Does the Unlocked XRP Go? The XRP that gets re-locked is placed into new time-locked escrows on the blockchain. These are not held by Ripple directly but governed by the XRP Ledger’s built-in escrow protocol. This design ensures XRP cannot be accessed or sold prematurely , eliminating concerns over sudden large-scale dumps. XRP’s Role in Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity System Ripple uses XRP to power its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, enabling fast and low-cost international transactions. When financial institutions use ODL, they convert fiat into XRP, transfer it across borders, and then convert it back into local currency—all within seconds. This use case means the XRP is not held for speculation; it is rapidly bought and sold to complete real transactions. As a result, it has minimal impact on long-term price movements. Ripple’s Sales Are a Small Fraction of Market Volume Van Code also points out that Ripple’s XRP sales represent less than 1% of daily market volume. Given the 24-hour volume exceeding $212 billion, the idea that Ripple is crashing the price through these sales doesn’t hold up. Factors like Bitcoin price , regulatory news, and institutional activity play a far greater role in market movements. He adds that if Ripple had been trying to dump XRP, the market would have reacted much more severely by now. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For June 13 , XRP Market Performance in 2025 Despite market volatility, XRP has outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum , showing a 335.1% annual gain. Here’s how XRP has moved in 2025: January: +46% February: -29.3% March: -2.52% April: +4.98% May: -0.80% June (so far): -2.38% Last 7 Days: -0.8% Last 24 Hours: -6.1% While short-term corrections exist, XRP’s long-term growth and expanding real-world use case remain promising. Fact Check: Is Ripple Dumping XRP? No, Ripple is not dumping XRP. Ripple does unlock 1 billion XRP each month, but over 80% is re-locked into new escrow contracts. Only 10–20% is used for operations and liquidity, mostly powering On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) transactions—not for market dumping. The XRP Ledger ensures this process is transparent and time-locked. Ripple’s sales make up less than 1% of daily volume, so claims of price manipulation are false. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As the market matures and more capital flows into real-world utility tokens, attention is quickly shifting from legacy coins to next-generation projects. Among these, Qubetics ($TICS) is now standing out as a popular crypto coin to buy in 2025—especially for those looking for functionality, innovation, and long-term value. Qubetics ($TICS), with its strong utility focus and fast-rising momentum, is emerging as a leading contender. Qubetics ($TICS) – Building Beyond Hype with Real Utility Unlike many speculative tokens, Qubetics has grounded its momentum in something substantial: its Decentralized VPN. While data privacy becomes a growing concern across the globe, Qubetics offers a real-world solution for individuals and businesses looking to navigate online environments securely, free from centralised control or surveillance. Its blockchain-powered VPN eliminates the need for centralised servers, meaning that no single authority can track or compromise a user’s online activity. For a small business handling sensitive client data, this solution offers a non-negotiable upgrade in security. A professional dealing with high-stakes contracts or intellectual property can access confidential material from any location without fear of interception. Even average users—content creators, gamers, remote workers—stand to benefit from faster, private connections routed through decentralized nodes rather than legacy VPN providers who might store logs or share user data. And that’s just one pillar of the Qubetics infrastructure. It’s not just about offering anonymity; it’s about putting digital control back into the hands of the people—where it belongs. Qubetics is currently in the 37th and final public stage of its crypto presale . So far, over 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 27,800 holders, raising more than $17.9 million. Tokens are priced at $0.3370, but the moment the presale ends, that price jumps to $0.40 with a 20% uptick. But the value here goes well beyond that initial bump. Following a sharp tokenomics overhaul, Qubetics reduced its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, instantly increasing token scarcity. Moreover, 38.55% of the total supply is now earmarked for public distribution, meaning decentralized control is more than a promise—it’s protocol-deep. Analysts are already noting the potential upside. If $TICS hits $5 post-listing, an $18,000 investment at the current presale rate would be worth over $266,000. Should the token reach $10 or $15 post-mainnet—as several credible forecasts now suggest—that same investment could skyrocket to $532,000 or even $798,000. Utility, timing, and architecture—that’s what separates Qubetics from typical presale projects. It’s not just another altcoin vying for visibility; it’s an ecosystem crafted for long-term relevance. With momentum accelerating and scarcity increasing, Qubetics isn’t just worth watching, it’s a project worth backing. Litecoin ($LTC): The One That Got Away for Many Litecoin has earned its spot in the pantheon of legacy crypto assets. Known as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” it brought faster transaction speeds and a more accessible mining algorithm to the table at a time when Bitcoin was starting to scale. It didn’t promise the moon—but over time, it quietly delivered. What started at $0.30 ballooned over the years. Its network upgrades, such as the integration of the Lightning Network and MimbleWimble privacy features, strengthened its case as a reliable and private digital cash alternative. Litecoin’s longevity alone is a testament to its architecture and adaptability. But while $LTC remains a respected name in crypto, it no longer offers the same exponential growth upside as it once did. The ship has largely sailed for those looking to make outsized returns from a low entry point. For backers hunting for the next standout with a strong use case and a timely entry price, Litecoin today doesn’t hold the same allure it once did. Legacy matters. Stability matters. And for those seeking a hedge with historical relevance, Litecoin continues to be a dependable choice. It may not 10x from here, but it remains a key part of the broader crypto ecosystem. However, for those who missed Litecoin’s prime, Qubetics may now be the next best option—and in many ways, a more innovative one. Final Thoughts – Which is One Of The Popular Crypto Coins To Buy? Based on current market dynamics and performance metrics, Qubetics stands out as the popular crypto coin to buy in today’s fast-shifting blockchain space. While Litecoin proved its worth and brought in major returns to early adopters, Qubetics is creating a new category altogether—built on decentralized privacy tools and public-first tokenomics. With less than 10 million tokens left in its presale, the window is closing. Those looking to position themselves for the next cycle may want to take a long, hard look at what Qubetics is building. Because in a space where timing and utility rule, $TICS might just be the rare blend of both.

2025-06-13T06:21:05,"Philippines SEC Unveils New Crypto Regulation","The post Philippines SEC Unveils New Crypto Regulation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On Thursday, the Philippines enacted stricter crypto rules under the new SEC Memorandum Circulars Nos 4 and 5, mandating a CASP license with a capital requirement and reporting of AML. Experts say this new framework in the Philippines lays the groundwork for broader crypto adoption in the country. Key Components of the New SEC Crypto Regulation No License- No Business All crypto asset service providers in the Philippines are now required to obtain a CASP license and adhere to strict disclosure requirements. The disclosure includes information on asset ownership, risks, and operations; crypto companies are required to submit these documents at least 30 days before beginning marketing. Investment requirement policy SEC is ensuring that only eligible firms enter the market, so it has set a minimum paid capital requirement of PHP 100 million. However, the SEC has also provided a mechanism for smaller companies to apply. Physical office SEC has stated that crypto companies seeking to provide services are required to have a physical office in the Philippines and pay an initial PHP 50,000 filing fee. An additional annual supervision fee on revenue will be levied by the officials. Consumer Protection The SEC and the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) council will monitor the CASP. They will ensure security, professionalism, KYC policy, and fair access for investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Brazil’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill passes first committee , Penalty For Non-Compliance The bill was initially issued on May 30th and later took effect on June 12. It states that if a token/ crypto behaves like a financial product or security under federal law of the country, it is subject to SEC regulation. Therefore, the SEC holds the authority to suspend or revoke the CASP license for noncompliance. Guilty CASP will face a fine of up to PHP 100 million and imprisonment for up to five years. Challenges in Implementing The New Crypto Regulations Luis Buenaventura, head of crypto finance at super-app GCash, said there will be substantial challenges implementing the new CASP rules. “Regulation is rarely perfect on day one, but as long as the regulatory authority takes a progressive approach and stays open to refining the framework over time, then I think this signals the Philippines,” said Nathan Marasign, Partner at MLaw Office. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-13T06:10:05,"Crypto Liquidations: Shocking $321 Million Wipeout Rocks Futures Market","BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations: Shocking $321 Million Wipeout Rocks Futures Market Wow, what a rollercoaster! If you’ve been watching the charts lately, you’ve likely seen some dramatic price swings. These movements, while exciting for some, can be brutal for others, especially those involved in crypto futures trading. We just witnessed a staggering event: over $321 million worth of crypto futures positions were liquidated in a single hour across major exchanges. Looking at the bigger picture, the past 24 hours saw total liquidations exceed a massive $636 million . These numbers aren’t just statistics; they represent significant losses for traders and highlight the inherent risks in the volatile crypto market . What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? Let’s break down what these dramatic crypto liquidations actually mean. In simple terms, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange because they no longer have sufficient margin to keep the trade open. Think of margin as the collateral you put down for a loan (in this case, the leverage). If the market moves against your position, and your losses start eating into your margin, the exchange will automatically close your position to prevent your balance from going below zero. This prevents the exchange from losing money. It’s a swift, automated process designed to manage risk, but it can be devastating for the trader whose position is liquidated. Understanding Crypto Futures and Leveraged Trading The massive numbers we’re seeing are directly linked to crypto futures and the use of leveraged trading . Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) at a specific price on a future date. They are popular tools for speculation and hedging. Leverage is where things get amplified. Leveraged trading allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. For example, with 10x leverage, you can open a $10,000 position with only $1,000 of your own money. This magnifies potential profits if the market moves in your favor. However, it also magnifies potential losses if the market moves against you. This is the core mechanism that leads to liquidations. Here’s a quick look at how leverage impacts your risk: Low Leverage (e.g., 2x-5x): Requires a larger margin percentage. More room for the market to move against you before liquidation. High Leverage (e.g., 20x-100x or more): Requires a much smaller margin percentage. Very little room for the market to move against you. A small price swing can trigger liquidation. The recent $321 million liquidation hour suggests that many traders were using high leverage, making their positions extremely vulnerable to even minor market fluctuations. The Role of Crypto Market Volatility The crypto market volatility is the fuel that drives these large-scale liquidation events. Cryptocurrencies are known for their rapid and unpredictable price swings. Unlike traditional markets, crypto can experience double-digit percentage moves in a single day, or even an hour. When many traders have leveraged long positions (betting the price will go up), a sudden sharp drop in price can trigger a cascade of liquidations. As positions are closed, selling pressure increases, potentially driving the price down further, which then triggers even more liquidations. This is often referred to as a ‘liquidation cascade’ or ‘long squeeze’. Conversely, a rapid price surge can cause a ‘short squeeze’, liquidating traders who were betting on the price falling. The recent event seems to be a result of a significant price drop, catching many leveraged long traders off guard. This highlights a key challenge of trading in this space: managing the extreme volatility. Navigating Trading Risk: Lessons from the Wipeout The recent liquidation event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent trading risk involved in leveraged crypto futures. While the potential rewards of leverage are high, the risks are equally, if not more, significant. So, what can traders learn from this? Challenges of Leveraged Trading: Magnified Losses: A small market move can wipe out your entire margin. Liquidation Risk: The constant threat of your position being forcibly closed. Emotional Toll: High leverage can lead to stressful decision-making and impulsive actions. Funding Rates: Holding leveraged positions overnight can incur costs. Actionable Insights for Managing Trading Risk: For anyone engaging with crypto futures or considering leveraged trading , here are some crucial steps to mitigate the trading risk : Understand Leverage: Don’t use leverage you don’t fully comprehend. Start small and understand the margin requirements and liquidation price for your specific position. Use Stop-Loss Orders: This is perhaps the most critical tool. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position if the price hits a certain level, limiting your potential loss and preventing liquidation. Avoid Excessive Leverage: Just because you can use 100x leverage doesn’t mean you should. Lower leverage gives your position more breathing room against crypto market volatility . Risk Management is Key: Never risk more capital than you can afford to lose on a single trade. Consider position sizing relative to your overall portfolio. Stay Informed: Keep track of market news, technical indicators, and sentiment. While volatility is inherent, sudden news or shifts can trigger rapid moves. Consider the Funding Rate: Understand the cost of holding leveraged positions, especially during periods of high market demand for leverage. Examples of good practice include setting stop-losses immediately after opening a leveraged position and using a trading journal to track decisions and outcomes. The Broader Impact on the Crypto Market While painful for individual traders, these large liquidation events can also have broader effects on the crypto market . They can contribute to price volatility in the short term, potentially leading to temporary price bottoms as forced selling exhausts itself, or conversely, accelerating downward trends. They also serve as a reset, sometimes clearing out over-leveraged positions and potentially setting the stage for more sustainable price movements later. However, they underscore that the market remains susceptible to sharp, rapid moves driven by leveraged positions. Conclusion: Navigating the Storms of Crypto Futures The recent event, seeing hundreds of millions in crypto liquidations within hours, is a powerful illustration of the amplified risks in crypto futures trading, especially when using high leveraged trading . It’s a direct consequence of the intense crypto market volatility colliding with aggressive positions. While the potential for profit is a draw, the reality of trading risk means that caution, education, and robust risk management strategies are not optional – they are essential. Understanding how liquidations happen and implementing tools like stop-losses can be the difference between weathering a market storm and being swept away by it. Trade smart, manage your risk, and respect the power of leverage in this dynamic market.

GameStop also gave buyers the option to purchase an extra $450 million worth of notes, which could bring the total to $2.7 billion. The company expects the sale to close on June 17. After fees and costs, GameStop says it will receive about $2.23 billion, or $2.68 billion if the additional notes are sold. The funds will go toward general business needs, including investments and possible acquisitions. While GameStop has not confirmed plans to buy more Bitcoin ( BTC ), the move follows an earlier sale in April where it raised $1.5 billion and used part of the funds to buy 4,710 BTC worth $512 million. As previously reported by crypto.news, the June 11 announcement of the initial $1.75 billion offering triggered a sharp 20% selloff in GameStop shares.

With a dwindling retail footprint and declining core revenues, which dropped 17% quarter-over-quarter in Q1, the company has been doubling down on digital assets. GameStop is one of several public companies that now hold large amounts of Bitcoin. Its May purchase made it the 13th largest corporate holder, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. The company’s broader strategy appears to echo Strategy’s shift, where aggressive Bitcoin accumulation became central to market valuation despite stagnant product revenues. The newly priced notes carry a conversion rate equivalent to $28.91 per share, a 32.5% premium over the average June 12 trading price. The notes do not bear interest, and GameStop cannot redeem them until June 2029, unless certain thresholds are met. Investors may convert early under specific conditions or demand redemption in 2028. The offering gives GameStop more time and flexibility as it looks for ways to recover from declining sales and changing demand in the gaming and retail space.

2025-06-13T06:00:49,"China Tariffs: Lutnick Issues Urgent Warning on Pause Ending","BitcoinWorld China Tariffs: Lutnick Issues Urgent Warning on Pause Ending The world of global finance and trade is often subject to shifts influenced by geopolitical tides. A recent statement attributed to prominent figure Howard Lutnick suggests one such significant shift may be on the horizon, potentially impacting everything from traditional stock markets to the volatile realm of digital assets. The core message? The current pause on China tariffs is unlikely to last. Who is Howard Lutnick and Why Does His View on China Tariffs Matter? Before diving into the implications, it’s important to understand the source. Howard Lutnick is a highly influential figure in the financial world, serving as the Chairman and CEO of BGC Partners and Cantor Fitzgerald. These are major players in global financial services, market brokerage, and real estate. Lutnick’s positions give him unique insights into global capital flows, market sentiment, and macroeconomic trends. When someone with his access and perspective speaks about major trade policy like China tariffs , markets and analysts tend to pay close attention. His comments, reportedly shared via Solid Intel on X, signal a potential change in the landscape that could have far-reaching consequences. Understanding the US-China Trade Context The history of recent US-China trade relations has been marked by periods of tension and negotiation, particularly concerning tariffs. Introduced primarily during the Trump administration, these tariffs imposed significant taxes on various goods imported from China, aiming to address trade imbalances and intellectual property concerns. While there have been phases of de-escalation or pauses on implementing new tariffs, the existing ones have remained a point of contention and a factor influencing supply chains and global economic planning. A ‘pause’ suggests a temporary hold or a lack of new escalations, but Lutnick’s view indicates this temporary state is nearing its conclusion. What Happens if the China Tariff Pause Ends? The potential end of the pause on China tariffs isn’t just a technical trade adjustment; it’s a policy shift with tangible economic effects. If new tariffs are imposed or existing ones are increased, several outcomes are likely: Increased Costs: Importers in the US would face higher costs for goods from China, which could be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. Supply Chain Disruption: Businesses might accelerate efforts to diversify supply chains away from China, a process that is complex, costly, and can lead to short-term disruptions. Retaliation: China could respond with its own tariffs on US goods and services, harming American exporters, particularly in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. Reduced Trade Volume: Overall trade between the two economic giants could decrease, impacting businesses reliant on this exchange. This scenario paints a picture of increased economic friction between the world’s two largest economies, creating uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. How Could Renewed Tariffs Impact Global Markets? The potential re-escalation of the US-China trade conflict is a significant macroeconomic factor that directly influences global markets . Financial markets dislike uncertainty, and renewed trade tensions inject a large dose of it. Here’s how markets could react: Stock Market Volatility: Sectors heavily reliant on trade with China (e.g., technology, manufacturing, retail) could see increased volatility and potential downturns. Broader market indices might react negatively to the prospect of reduced corporate profits and economic slowdown. Investor Sentiment: A breakdown in trade relations can sour investor sentiment globally, leading to a more risk-averse approach. This might cause a rotation out of riskier assets into perceived safe havens. Currency Fluctuations: The US dollar and the Chinese Yuan could see movements based on trade flows and central bank interventions. Other currencies tied to global trade might also be affected. Commodity Prices: Demand for certain commodities could shift based on supply chain changes and industrial activity in both countries. Monitoring statements from figures like Howard Lutnick becomes crucial for market participants trying to navigate this complex environment. Exploring the Cryptocurrency Impact For those focused on digital assets, the potential end of the China tariffs pause raises questions about the cryptocurrency impact . While crypto markets often operate on their own unique drivers, they are not entirely immune to macroeconomic forces and shifts in global sentiment. Here are a few ways renewed trade tensions could play out: Safe Haven Narrative: In times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty, assets outside the traditional financial system, like Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as potential safe havens. Increased trade tensions could bolster this narrative, potentially driving some capital into crypto. Risk-Off Sentiment: Conversely, if renewed tariffs trigger a broader ‘risk-off’ sentiment across global markets , cryptocurrencies, which are still considered high-risk by many traditional investors, could see outflows alongside stocks and other growth assets. Inflation Hedge? If tariffs contribute to inflation in the US by increasing import costs, assets perceived as inflation hedges, including Bitcoin, might gain attention. Capital Flight: In some scenarios, increased economic friction or capital controls related to trade could potentially lead to capital seeking alternative avenues, some of which might flow into cryptocurrencies, although this is a more speculative outcome. The relationship is complex and not always direct, but it’s clear that major shifts in US-China trade relations add another layer of macro uncertainty that crypto investors must consider. Challenges and Opportunities Arising from Trade Shifts The end of the tariff pause presents significant challenges but also potential opportunities: Challenges: Increased costs for businesses and consumers. Disruption of established supply chains. Reduced profitability for companies reliant on US-China trade. Heightened geopolitical risk. Potential for slower global economic growth. Opportunities: Incentive for companies to diversify supply chains to other countries. Potential boost for domestic industries that compete with Chinese imports. Increased focus on technological innovation to reduce reliance on imports. Possible increased interest in alternative assets (like certain cryptocurrencies) if traditional markets face sustained pressure. Navigating these requires careful analysis and strategic planning. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the potential for renewed China tariffs and their impact on global markets and the potential cryptocurrency impact , what steps can investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on official announcements regarding trade policy and expert opinions like those from Howard Lutnick . Review Portfolio Diversification: Assess exposure to sectors and companies heavily involved in US-China trade. Consider diversifying across different geographies and asset classes. Evaluate Supply Chain Risk: For stock investors, understand how companies in your portfolio manage their supply chains and their vulnerability to tariff changes. Consider Alternative Assets: If you believe trade tensions will increase market volatility or inflation, research how assets like gold or certain cryptocurrencies might fit into your strategy (understanding the risks involved with crypto). Long-Term Perspective: Trade disputes can create short-term noise. Focus on your long-term investment goals rather than reacting impulsively to daily headlines. Understanding the interplay between geopolitics, trade policy, and financial markets is key in uncertain times. Conclusion: Preparing for Potential Trade Headwinds Howard Lutnick’s reported comments serve as a timely reminder that the pause in China tariffs is not a permanent state. The potential return or escalation of these tariffs could introduce significant headwinds for US-China trade , disrupt global markets , and have an indirect but notable cryptocurrency impact . While the exact timing and nature of any policy changes remain to be seen, staying informed about the views of influential figures like Howard Lutnick and understanding the potential consequences is essential for navigating the complex economic landscape ahead. Investors across all asset classes should prepare for potential increased volatility and consider how renewed trade tensions might affect their portfolios.

2025-06-13T06:00:19,"Bitcoin Could Jump 20% For Every 1% Liquidity Boost: Expert","Bitcoin’s blistering second-quarter advance is tracking the strongest expansion in global liquidity on record, according to Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts, who argues that every additional percentage point of liquidity injected into the financial system “should” translate into a 20% gain for the cryptocurrency. 1% Liquidity = 20% Bitcoin? Writing on X, Coutts observed that his proprietary Global Liquidity Index broke to a fresh all-time high on 10 April after three years of drift and that, in the nine weeks since, Bitcoin has rallied about 40 percent. “Bitcoin has rallied 40% since April 10 which was when my global liquidity aggregate (GLI) after 3 years broke out to new all time highs on the back of a plummeting US dollar. Since then the aggregate is up 2%. Bitcoin’s Q2 rally is entirely consistent with liquidity regimes of this nature.” He added that “while Bitcoin’s sensitivity to GLI moderates over time, for every extra 1 percent of liquidity added to the system we should expect to see a > 20 percent move in the price of Bitcoin,” he said, further claiming that the steady inflow of capital “doesn’t account for the inevitable ‘oh shit’ moment of panic buying that is going to happen… eventually. It will be best of times, it will be the worst of times.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet—But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos The chart he shared, reproduced above, overlays his GLI (white) with daily Bitcoin prices (orange) from 2018 through June 2025. It shows the index pressing to roughly $138 trillion while Bitcoin changes hands near $108,000, underscoring the tight directional relationship between the two series across several liquidity cycles. Coutts builds the indicator by combining G4 central-bank balance sheets, broad money aggregates such as M2, and key US liquidity accounts including the Treasury General Account and the Federal Reserve’s reverse-repo facility. Since the April breakout the GLI has added only about two percentage points, yet Bitcoin’s market value has already risen by twice the elasticity implied by his model—an outcome he considers “entirely consistent” with prior liquidity regimes, which tend to produce the sharpest price response early in the cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: ‘Fair Price’ Today Is $230,000 For now, he sees little evidence that the GLI’s momentum is cresting; with the Federal Reserve still draining its reverse-repo facility, the People’s Bank of China quietly expanding its balance sheet, and the European Central Bank hinting at renewed long-term refinancing operations, the backdrop remains structurally bullish even if it won’t be a straight line. Looking further out, mainstream liquidity research suggests modest but persistent growth: most macro desks expect the global aggregate to rise roughly one to six percent over the next twelve months, three to eight percent cumulatively by mid-2027, and on the order of ten to fifteen percent by the turn of the decade as governments roll over record debt loads and central banks normalise balance-sheet policies. If Coutts’ rule of thumb holds, even the low end of those projections would leave ample headroom for triple-digit percentage gains in Bitcoin before 2030. At press time, BTC traded at $107,676.

The Galaxy Digital founder and CEO made the prediction on CNBC’s Power Lunch on Thursday. He cited institutional adoption and a growing preference for Bitcoin over gold as possible catalysts for this uptrend.This comes as Bitcoin corrects further from the weekly high of $110,300. The premier asset is down 5.5% from the Tuesday high to $104,269 at the time of writing but remains up 1.48% in the past seven days.Bitcoin Becoming an Institutionalized Macro Asset: NovogratzNovogratz suggested that Bitcoin is becoming an institutionalized macro asset and now sits alongside assets like gold, silver, and the S&P 500. He highlighted that one of the enablers for this newfound traction was partly fueled by the global loss of interest in the US dollar and diversification into assets like Bitcoin.Furthermore, he cited BlackRock’s involvement as a significant turning point for Bitcoin and a catalyst for the institutional interest. For context, $11.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock launched its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) fund in January 2024, following the US SEC’s approval, providing an easier means of exposure to Bitcoin.Novogratz stressed that this shift in attention to Bitcoin occurred as wealth managers and institutions began piling into the macro asset under BlackRock’s influence. Now, he noted that everyone is buying Bitcoin, viewing the pioneering cryptocurrency as a store of value. “Now we've got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin; there’s easier ways to get it,” Novogratz told CNBC.Interestingly, Strategy's playbook has become a new trend as public companies take a page from the business intelligence firm’s Bitcoin strategy. New entrants, including Metaplanet, the Blockchain Group, GameStop , and Trump Media, are raising millions to purchase Bitcoin, contributing to the asset’s scarcity and increasing its appeal.Bitcoin to Slowly Replace Gold, Hit $1MMeanwhile, Novogratz described Bitcoin’s adoption as a means of financial preservation as a “ball rolling down the hill,” predicting that this will ensure it matches toe-to-toe with gold in the near future. He stated that the new generation of investors would buy Bitcoin over gold, with the limitedly capped digital currency replacing the precious metal over time.The CEO also noted that Bitcoin has more room to grow relative to gold, predicting a 10-fold increase in its market cap to reach $1 million per coin. Notably, the price mark is becoming a commonplace outlook for Bitcoin enthusiasts as many grow increasingly confident that it is attainable.

2025-06-13T05:30:00,"Trident Plans Major XRP Reserve While Ripple Nears Final Deal with SEC","Singapore-based Trident Digital Tech Holdings has announced plans to establish a $500 million XRP treasury reserve, reflecting growing institutional interest in the Ripple-associated digital asset. At the same time, Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission may soon conclude, as both parties seek court approval to finalize a $125 million settlement and dissolve a long-standing injunction. Trident Digital Tech Holdings to Launch $500 Million XRP Treasury Reserve Amid Growing Corporate Crypto Trend Trident Digital Tech Holdings, a Web3 technology firm headquartered in Singapore, announced on Thursday that it will establish an XRP treasury reserve of up to $500 million, marking one of the largest single corporate allocations to the Ripple-created cryptocurrency to date. The initiative sheds light on a deepening shift in how forward-looking companies are beginning to engage with decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based assets for treasury management and yield generation. In a statement released with the announcement, Trident’s founder and CEO Soon Huat Lim emphasized the company’s long-term strategic vision for blockchain integration. “This initiative reflects our belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology for capital allocation and cross-border value transfer,” said Lim. “Through this initiative, Trident aims to demonstrate how public companies can thoughtfully and responsibly participate in the ongoing development of decentralized finance.” Unlike traditional treasury approaches that often center around passive buy-and-hold strategies, Trident plans to actively engage with its XRP reserve. The company revealed it will deploy the assets through staking mechanisms and other yield-generating strategies. Additionally, Trident intends to form deeper ties within the Ripple ecosystem, signaling a long-term commitment that could include partnerships or collaborations with RippleNet participants or decentralized applications built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The XRP reserve will be rolled out in the second half of 2025, contingent on regulatory clarity and favorable market conditions. Notably, Trident will fund this ambitious plan through a combination of stock issuance, strategic placements, and other financing instruments. Market Reaction and Financial Backdrop Despite the bold move, the market did not initially react favorably. Trident’s shares plunged by 37.6% on Thursday following the announcement. Investor concerns appear to stem from the company's financial performance rather than its crypto strategy. According to its latest financial disclosures, Trident reported a net income loss of $3.1 million as of December 2024. The company’s revenue declined a staggering 91.4% year-over-year, while operational expenses rose by over 100%, underscoring the financial strain it faces heading into this new initiative. Trident share price on June 12 (Source: Google Finance ) While some analysts view the XRP reserve strategy as a bold pivot aimed at repositioning Trident within a fast-evolving digital economy, others have questioned whether the timing and scale of the reserve are appropriate given the company’s current financial standing. Trident is not alone in its move to incorporate XRP into its corporate treasury. The past several months have seen a surge in similar announcements, highlighting a new trend where XRP joins the ranks of Bitcoin and Solana as a strategic crypto asset held by public and private companies alike. Chinese AI firm Webus recently unveiled a $300 million XRP reserve, while renewable energy conglomerate VivoPower has plans to allocate $100 million. Health logistics company Wellgistics Health also announced a $50 million XRP treasury commitment. Together, these reserves signal a significant shift in institutional perception of XRP—from a utility token used primarily for payments to a strategic digital asset. XRP’s growing role in corporate finance parallels earlier trends seen with Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin’s popularity as a corporate treasury asset began with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) in August 2020, a move that was followed by firms like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific. In 2025, Solana has gained momentum in the same space, with firms like DeFi Development (formerly Janover) and SOL Strategies actively building SOL reserves in anticipation of broader DeFi and NFT adoption on the network. A New Era for Corporate Crypto Strategy? As corporate treasuries begin to resemble diversified crypto portfolios, the emergence of XRP as a reserve asset represents a new frontier. With its roots in real-world payments, and growing support within regulatory discussions, XRP offers a different value proposition compared to Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative or Solana’s high-performance DeFi positioning. Trident’s move may prove to be a defining case study in how Web3-native firms can integrate blockchain assets beyond speculative exposure. However, the steep share price drop and looming financial pressures mean that the company will need to execute flawlessly to win back investor confidence. Whether Trident’s gamble will yield long-term strategic returns or serve as a cautionary tale remains to be seen—but one thing is clear: the age of blockchain-based corporate finance is accelerating, and XRP is staking its claim alongside Bitcoin and Solana. Ripple and SEC Propose $125 Million Settlement Split to End Years-Long Legal Battle The nearly five-year-long legal standoff between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may finally be approaching resolution, as both parties submitted a joint motion on Thursday to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York outlining a proposed settlement. In the motion, Ripple and the SEC asked Judge Analisa Torres to approve a plan that would dissolve the existing injunction against Ripple and allocate the $125 million penalty imposed in the case—$50 million would go to the SEC, while the remaining $75 million would be returned to Ripple. “Doing so would promote efficiency and the policy favoring settlements, obviate the need for additional litigation in this Court and the Court of Appeals, and be consistent with the SEC’s recent actions in other crypto registration cases,” lawyers for both sides stated in the joint court filing. Ripple’s Long Legal Road Nears Its End The case began in December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple, alleging the blockchain company had unlawfully raised $1.3 billion through the sale of its native cryptocurrency XRP, which the agency argued qualified as an unregistered security. The lawsuit instantly became one of the most high-profile crypto enforcement actions in SEC history, setting the tone for regulatory battles throughout the industry. In a landmark ruling in July 2023, Judge Torres handed down a split decision. She ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP , executed through blind bid processes on exchanges, did not constitute securities offerings. However, she found that Ripple’s direct institutional sales did fall under the purview of securities law, making the company liable for a $125 million penalty related to those transactions. Since the court’s decision, the legal process has shifted focus from liability to remedy. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse declared in March 2025 that the company’s legal fight with the SEC was “effectively over,” after the agency dropped its planned appeal. However, procedural hurdles have continued to delay final closure. Just last month, Judge Torres rejected a request from the parties for an indicative ruling under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs relief from a final judgment. She noted that Ripple and the SEC had failed to meet the “heavy burden” required to vacate an injunction and emphasized that such actions should only be granted under “exceptional circumstances.” Thursday’s filing attempts to clear that bar, citing significant developments in the regulatory landscape since the case began. Chief among them is the SEC’s recent policy shift under the Trump administration, which took office in January. Since then, the SEC has disbanded several ongoing investigations into crypto firms, dropped high-profile enforcement actions, and launched a new crypto-focused task force aimed at crafting a more pragmatic regulatory framework. Implications for the Broader Crypto Landscape If the court approves the proposed $50 million/$75 million split and lifts the injunction against Ripple, it would not only bring a long and expensive legal saga to a close but also signal a dramatic de-escalation of tensions between US regulators and major crypto firms. Since the exit of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler earlier this year, the agency’s crypto posture has notably softened. Several cases against leading firms—including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken—have either been scaled back or settled, and roundtable discussions are now guiding future regulatory frameworks instead of courtroom battles. Ripple’s case has long been viewed as a litmus test for how securities law applies to digital assets, and any settlement would likely be referenced in future enforcement and compliance strategies across the crypto industry. While XRP’s legal status remains partially resolved, the proposed compromise may allow Ripple to resume full-scale operations without further legal uncertainty—and reclaim significant funds to reinvest in its ecosystem and international expansion. Judge Torres will now review the joint motion and determine whether the proposed settlement meets the legal standards necessary to amend the final judgment. If granted, it could mark the end of one of the most closely watched legal battles in cryptocurrency history. Until then, both Ripple and the SEC appear aligned in wanting to put the past behind them and look forward to a regulatory environment that is clearer, more collaborative, and better suited to the evolving dynamics of the digital asset space.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9555/trident-plans-major-xrp-reserve-while-ripple-nears-final-deal-with-sec,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|SOL|XRP","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Bitcoin dropped 2.3%, Ethereum shed 4.5%, XRP lost 3.24%, and Solana slid 4.9% against the U.S. dollar. But it was Dogecoin that took the steepest plunge among the top ten, tumbling 5.9% in a single day. Over $320 million in bullish bets were wiped out within a single hour, signaling a harsh wake-up call for overly optimistic traders. BTC & ETH in Red, Altcoins Hit Harder? Bitcoin bore the brunt of the crash, with nearly $317 million in long positions liquidated in a day. The majority, over $306 million, were long bets. Prices slid nearly 4% in 24 hours, pulling BTC below $104K. While it’s still holding a 5% gain for the week, the momentum shifted after it peaked above $110,000 on Tuesday. One massive $201 million long on Binance alone got rekt in the plunge, according to CoinGlass data . Meanwhile, ETH fell over 6% on the day, crashing down to $2,650. Despite this drop, it’s still up about 9% on the week, thanks to an earlier surge. Daily liquidations for ETH totaled $151 million, second only to Bitcoin. While altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin were hit next, as bearish pressure swept across the altcoin market. Solana tumbled over 6% to $152.80, XRP dropped 4% to $2.20, and Dogecoin was the day’s worst performer, down 7% to $0.181. DOGE’s steep fall makes it the biggest loser among the top ten cryptocurrencies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Jerome Powell To be Fired? Donald Trump Warns ‘Fed Rate Cut NOW’ , A Geo-Connect? Crypto took a hit today, mainly because of rising tensions in the Middle East. Reports say Israel launched an airstrike on Iran’s nuclear site, which scared global investors. Many rushed to safer options like gold, causing it to jump 5%, while risky assets like crypto dropped. Inflation Data Triggers Profit-Taking The selling pressure began after the release of the U.S. CPI report on Wednesday , which showed cooling inflation for May. While that might seem like good news, the market reacted with a round of profit-taking, pushing prices down instead. Bitcoin and Ethereum slipped after the report, while altcoins were already struggling earlier in the day, only to see losses deepen by afternoon. Longs Crushed, Market Dips 5% In total, the market saw over $713 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours, $650 million of those from long positions. The broader market is now down roughly 5% in a day, according to CoinGecko, with traders rethinking their bullish positions amid rising volatility. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
