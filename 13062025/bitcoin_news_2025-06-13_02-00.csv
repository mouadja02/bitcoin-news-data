2025-06-12T23:30:40,"Bitcoin 4-Year CAGR Rebounds To 31% – $168K By October?","Bitcoin is holding above key support levels as it continues to consolidate just below the $112,000 all-time high. Despite bullish momentum building across the broader crypto market, BTC has struggled to reclaim this critical resistance level, keeping traders on edge. Analysts agree that a decisive breakout is needed to confirm the uptrend and signal the start of a new expansion phase. According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, the recent recovery in Bitcoin’s 4-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) highlights a shift in long-term market sentiment. After plunging to just 7% in April—reflecting compressed margins and cycle exhaustion—the CAGR has now rebounded to around 31%, which falls into what analysts consider the “strong zone.” This resurgence came as BTC’s price rallied back toward $110,000 by May–June 2025, reviving hopes for a sustained bullish trend. Although the current growth rate remains below historic cycle peaks of 50–80%, the market’s structure and on-chain dynamics suggest there’s still plenty of room for upside. As Bitcoin holds its ground and market conditions stabilize, the stage may be set for a decisive breakout—one that could confirm the uptrend and drive BTC into price discovery once again. Bitcoin Gears Up For Price Discovery As Fundamentals Strengthen Bitcoin is on the verge of entering price discovery, with the asset trading just below its all-time high near $112,000. After weeks of consolidation and steady higher lows, this week could prove decisive for the entire crypto market. A breakout above resistance would signal the start of a new, explosive phase, while a pullback to sweep liquidity below remains a valid risk if momentum stalls. Either way, the market is preparing for a significant move. This critical moment comes amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty. The U.S. economy continues to show signs of systemic stress, driven by elevated Treasury yields, sticky inflation, and geopolitical tensions. Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin’s structure remains strong, underpinned by improving long-term fundamentals. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights from CryptoQuant, pointing to the rebound in Bitcoin’s 4-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). After falling to just 7% in April—signaling a severely compressed market—the CAGR has recovered to 31% by June 2025, entering what Adler calls the “strong zone.” This rebound coincided with Bitcoin’s climb back toward $110,000, reinforcing bullish sentiment. While 31% remains below historic peak CAGRs of 50–80%, Adler notes that the backdrop is favorable. If futures market momentum and leverage continue to build, he projects that Bitcoin could reach $168,000 as early as October 2025. For now, all eyes are on BTC’s next move because whichever direction it breaks, it will likely set the tone for the rest of the year. BTC Consolidates Below ATH: Market Awaits Next Move Bitcoin is currently trading at $107,259 on the daily chart after a minor 1.31% pullback from the $109,300 resistance level. The price action shows BTC forming a range between $103,600 (support) and $109,300 (resistance), with multiple rejections from the upper boundary. Despite this, Bitcoin continues to hold above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $102,998, suggesting that the broader uptrend remains intact for now. This consolidation comes after BTC rebounded sharply from the $103,600 support zone earlier this month. The structure is still constructive, but bulls need to reclaim and hold above the $109,300 level to challenge the $112K all-time high and push into price discovery. Failure to do so could lead to a retest of $103,600, where liquidity is likely concentrated. Volume remains relatively stable, though slightly lower on this latest leg up, hinting that momentum is cooling. That said, as long as BTC holds above the key moving averages and does not close below $103,600, the bullish structure is preserved.

2025-06-12T23:30:00,"South Korean Appeals Court Upholds Kimchi Premium Traders’ Jail Sentences","A South Korean appeals court has upheld the jail sentences of a group of crypto traders who exploited the kimchi premium to make thousands of dollars worth of profit. Nocut News reported that the Daegu District Court Criminal Division upheld all but one of the original verdicts and sentences. A 43-year-old ringleader is facing up to three years in prison. Kimchi Premium: Appeal Unsuccessful The judge did, however, overturn another of the traders’ verdicts. In the original trial, this individual (name withheld for legal reasons) was given an 18-month suspended jail term. However, the Presiding Judge Oh Deok-sik ruled on June 12 that this sentence was “overly lenient,” instead sending this trader to prison for 18 months. The traders were all found guilty of violations of the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information and the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act. The court heard evidence that the group illegally smuggled hundreds of billions of won worth of foreign currency into the country by reselling cryptoassets they had purchased in Japan. Prosecutors explained that the group worked in conjunction with a group of Japanese investors. Together, they concocted a carefully planned bid to exploit the kimchi premium . At the time, Bitcoin (BTC) prices were significantly higher in South Korea. Demand was growing as trading volumes on domestic crypto exchanges spiked. Prosecutors said the group illegally smuggled about 400 billion won ($296 million) worth of foreign currency across international borders. The overseas investors paid the group approximately 27 billion won (almost $20 million) for its services. The kimchi premium as calculated by Scolkg/Cryprice at the time of writing. (Source: Scolkg/Cryprice) Traders Deny Wrongdoing The defendants denied all the charges. They claimed the transactions could not be classified as “capital transactions,” as they involved crypto, not cash. As such, these deals were not subject to standard declaration laws. However, the appellate court rejected these claims. The judge ruled that the defendants “took advantage of the price differences between countries for virtual assets to export foreign currency and obtain commission fees.” The judge added that the original sentence “appears to be appropriate.” Justice Oh added that the court had seen “no other evidence that would require a change in sentence.” Education Ministry accused of shielding group tied to after-school certification scandal https://t.co/Z2fVGqwR8X — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) June 11, 2025 However, in the case of the trader who was jailed instead of receiving a suspended term, the court explained that while this individual only received just over $4,000 in “commission fees,” the nature of this individual’s crime was grave. The court heard that this trader held an important role in the business community and used shell companies to perpetrate the crime. The judge explained: “Considering [this person’s] role and position, the court rules that the original sentence was excessively light.” The post South Korean Appeals Court Upholds Kimchi Premium Traders’ Jail Sentences appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-appeals-court-upholds-kimchi-premium-traders-jail-sentences/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING","Blockchain News|Legal|South Korea",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T23:15:43,"Outgoing FSB Chair: Crypto May Have Hit ‘Tipping Point’ – Here’s Why","The crypto industry may have reached a key juncture as global financial authorities embrace digital assets, with outgoing Financial Stability Board (FSB) Chair Klaas Knot declaring that crypto ‘may have hit a tipping point’ due to dramatically lowered barriers for retail investors and growing institutional adoption. Knot’s assessment, delivered during his final address as FSB Chair at a Financial Stability Conference in Madrid, showed how barriers for retail crypto access have “dropped significantly,” particularly through the introduction of crypto ETFs and stablecoin issuers’ substantial Treasury holdings. His warning comes as the crypto ecosystem’s links with traditional finance continue expanding. Stablecoins settled $27.6 trillion in transactions during Q1 2025 alone , doubling Visa’s entire 2023 settlement volume. Stablecoin Transactions Vs Visa Payments Q1 Source: Bitwise The FSB Chair emphasized that while crypto doesn’t yet pose systemic risk, recent developments suggest authorities must monitor this “fast-growing market” more closely as it approaches mainstream financial integration. Institutional Infrastructure Races to Meet Demand The institutional embrace of crypto infrastructure has accelerated dramatically, with major financial players already positioning themselves for widespread adoption. A June 2 report by Cryptonews shows that UK-listed IG Group has become the first London Stock Exchange company to offer retail crypto trading . Retail clients can buy and sell 38 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, through a partnership with digital asset platform Uphold. IG Group will become the first company on the London Stock Exchange to allow retail investors to trade cryptos, including BTC, ETH, and XRP. #Bitcoin #XRP https://t.co/MImNzg9rAX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 Managing Director Michael Healy described customer demand as “ reaching a tipping point ,” positioning the FTSE 250 firm as a trusted alternative to existing crypto services. Most recently, Stripe’s aggressive crypto expansion further exemplifies this institutional momentum, with the payments giant acquiring crypto wallet infrastructure startup Privy following its $1.1 billion purchase of stablecoin platform Bridge. Privy powers over 75 million accounts across more than 1,000 teams while facilitating billions in transaction volume. It allows companies to integrate crypto wallets directly into their platforms without traditional friction. @stripe acquires crypto wallet infrastructure startup @privy_io in undisclosed deal, marking its second major crypto acquisition following the $1.1 billion Bridge purchase as stablecoins settle record $27.6 trillion in Q1 2025. https://t.co/TeTdIVgt0V — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 This acquisition allows Stripe to offer comprehensive crypto infrastructure spanning wallet creation, stablecoin payments, and fiat integration through a unified platform. This addresses growing business needs, as over 81% of crypto-aware small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) express interest in stablecoin adoption . Government-Led Digital Asset Integration Gains Momentum Government initiatives are also accelerating crypto mainstream adoption through direct blockchain-based investment products. In May, Thailand’s Ministry of Finance announced it would launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens within two months. Thailand is set to launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens, marking a step toward financial inclusivity for retail investors. #Thailand #SEC https://t.co/2akullmpsP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 These tokens would allow retail investors to purchase government bonds via blockchain-based “G-tokens” with a minimum investment threshold of just $3. Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira emphasized the initiative’s goal of broadening access to government-backed investments, particularly as commercial banks offer only 1.25% on 12-month fixed deposits. Similarly, China’s Zhejiang Province has integrated digital yuan pilots into its “first-launch economy” strategy, testing the central bank digital currency in retail debut scenarios through the “Digital Yuan + First-Launch” initiative. This represents a strategic shift from public services to consumer transactions, incorporating the currency within broader economic programs rather than treating it as a standalone technology. The approach addresses public hesitation by linking digital payments to familiar retail experiences like store launches and branded spaces. The UK government is simultaneously tightening oversight while expanding access. Starting in January 2026, crypto firms will be required to collect detailed customer information on every trade. The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting 2026. #UK #Crypto https://t.co/tHJKf7rEE5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 18, 2025 The new HMRC rules mandate that platforms record full names, addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users.

2025-06-12T23:14:07,"Dogecoin Price Prediction: Ripple’s CEO Admits He Was Wrong About Dogecoin – New Partnership Coming?","Brad Garlinghouse has walked back his once-harsh stance on DOGE, boosting the Dogecoin price outlook with institutional acknowledgment as a highly liquid asset. Speaking at Ripple Apex, he claims the once-gimmick has become more than a meme coin , distancing itself from what he generalized as “get-rich-quick rug pulls” to become “part of the ecosystem. It plays a role.” Citing Elon Musk’s continued endorsement, Garlinghouse said Musk “willed Dogecoin into so much liquidity that it’s not going away.” “I used to speak not so kindly about Dogecoin… was created as a joke, right?” ~ #Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse pic.twitter.com/pEB91t3KiP — The Crypto Times (@CryptoTimes_io) June 12, 2025 While he did not entertain a partnership, the concession marks a notable shift for a figure long-positioned on the institutional end of the spectrum—opening the door for institutional acceptance. With rising speculation around Dogecoin ETF approval, Garlinghouse’s comments may be seen as early validation, giving it more credit in the “best crypto to buy” conversation. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Could Institutions Boost DOGE? Even without a Ripple collaboration, Dogecoin may be on the breakout path, following a massive 4-year cup-and-handle pattern. DOGE / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle pattern confluence zone. Source: TradingView, Binance. DOGE is currently consolidating within the descending channel forming the handle, but a fast approaching confluence zone could see a breakout unfold in the coming weeks. Key support from the 0.236 Fib level and the historic support trendline that has underpinned every major DOGE bottom since September is set to intersect with the channel’s resistance. The historic support that has marked DOGE bottoms since September could push a breakout as it intersects with the channel’s upper resistance, aligned with support from the 0.236 Fibbonnaci level. A confirmed breakout would set a technical target around $0.75—a staggering 300% gain from current levels in line with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. The upcoming June 15 deadline for a US spot Dogecoin ETF decision could bring the catalyst Dogecoin needs, opening the doors to institutional inflows if approved. #Dogecoin awaits eagerly for SEC ETF rulings in June. Approval odds near 80%. pic.twitter.com/nD3d0bvkmF — dogegod (@_dogegod_) June 12, 2025 Momentum indicators also point to retail inflows. The RSI has stabilized at 45 after dipping below the neutral zone, and the MACD is tightening, hinting at a potential crossover that could shift sentiment. While the setup isn’t screaming bullish yet, it’s also far from bearish. This fragile balance suggests that any uptick in volume or sentiment could tip the scales. If historic support becomes an accumulation base, DOGE could finally break the handle structure and resume its long-term uptrend. Bitcoin Could Have the Edge, With Some Help Those who jumped to speculative plays like Dogecoin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.1 million in its second presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 648% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

2025-06-12T23:01:45,"Bitcoin Hashrate Breaks a New All-Time High – Is a Massive $BTC Price Rally Next?","Bitcoin has hit yet another milestone as its network hashrate reached a new all-time high of 1.046 zettahashes per second, marking the strongest security level in the cryptocurrency’s 16-year history. Source: Bitcoin Magazine This hash rate breakthrough occurs at a time when approximately 93.3% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply has already been mined. Due to the halving mechanism that reduces mining rewards every four years, only 1.4 million BTC will remain to be created over the next century. The timing proves especially relevant as 126 public companies now hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries, controlling 819,857 BTC, representing 3.9% of the total supply. Source: BitcoinTreasuriesNet Meanwhile, mining difficulty has surged 6.81% to an all-time high of 121.51 trillion, creating an increasingly competitive environment where miners are liquidating massive amounts of their holdings to survive the post-halving revenue crunch. Corporate adoption has also accelerated dramatically, with companies like Mercurity Fintech raising $800 million for Bitcoin treasury reserves. Mining Economics Under Pressure Despite Network Strength The mathematical precision of Bitcoin’s supply curve creates a unique scarcity dynamic that intensifies with each passing halving event , as the April 2024 halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, forcing miners to compete for diminishing rewards while hash rate paradoxically continues climbing. This “engineered scarcity” becomes even more pronounced when considering that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC, roughly 14% to 18% of the total supply, is permanently lost due to forgotten passwords, destroyed hard drives, and dormant addresses, including Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet , which contains over 1.1 million BTC. The combination of capped supply, permanent losses, and exponentially decreasing issuance creates what analysts describe as “hardening scarcity,” where Bitcoin’s adequate circulating supply may be closer to 16–17 million rather than 21 million, while traditional assets like gold remain fully recoverable and reusable. March 2025 witnessed a devastating 50% decline in miner revenue compared to the previous year , falling to approximately $1.2 billion as the hash price plummeted to just $44.20 per petahash per second, down more than 11% since early March. This revenue compression forced a dramatic behavioral shift among mining companies, with 15 public mining firms liquidating over 40% of their freshly minted Bitcoin in March alone. Despite this selling pressure, Bitcoin’s network demonstrated strong resilience. It is worth mentioning that this phenomenon occurs because of Bitcoin’s self-correcting mechanism, where mining difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks to maintain 10-minute block times regardless of network participation. This ensures continued operation even as inefficient miners exit the network. Technical Analysis Points to Bullish Momentum Despite Short-Term Volatility A careful look at the technical indicators across multiple timeframes suggests Bitcoin is positioned for continued upward momentum despite current consolidation around $106,927. The three-year hash rate correlation chart shows a compelling relationship between network security and price appreciation, with both metrics experiencing synchronized recovery from the crypto winter lows of $20,000 and 200–300 billion hashes per second to current levels exceeding $106,000 and 890 billion hashes per second. The exponential hash rate growth through 2024 and into 2025 coincides with Bitcoin’s push toward six-figure valuations, creating a virtuous cycle in which increased computational power secures the network and bolsters investor confidence. Short-term technical analysis reveals Bitcoin consolidating within a constructive range, with key resistance levels at $108,026, $110,321, and $111,870, while the 25-period exponential moving average at $107,935 provides dynamic support. The volume profile analysis shows strong accumulation zones with the heaviest trading occurring around $105,000-$107,000, establishing this as a strong value area. The profitability indicator, showing 60.92%, also suggests that the most recent buyers remain in profit, typically preceding either continuation moves or healthy consolidation phases. The descending trendline acting as dynamic resistance appears to be breaking down, a development that historically signals bullish momentum. Combined with Fibonacci extension levels and golden cross formations, where shorter moving averages cross above longer ones, the technical structure initially supports projections toward $111,870. Successful breaks potentially open paths toward $115,000-$120,000 in the near term, provided Bitcoin maintains support above the key $105,000-$107,000 value area.

2025-06-12T23:00:51,"Altcoin Season Just Flashed A Golden Cross Amid Crypto Market Recovery","Crypto analyst InvestingScope has drawn market participants’ attention to a major occurrence that hints at an imminent altcoin season. The analyst also revealed how high the crypto market could reach as altcoins outperform Bitcoin during this period. Altcoin Season May Be Imminent As Golden Cross Flashes In a TradingView post, InvestingScope revealed that altcoins have made a 1-day Golden Cross, the first since just right after the US elections. He noted that the rally that followed made new highs for these altcoins, indicating that another altcoin season may be on the horizon. The analyst also predicted that the total crypto market can reach at least $4.03 trillion on this rally. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises He noted that since the Bear Cycle bottom, this is the fourth 1-day Golden Cross and that the minimum the market has surged around such a formation was just over 73%. As such, the crypto market cap, currently valued at $3.39 trillion, can reach the $4 trillion target during this altcoin season rally. Altcoins have again rallied following the recent Bitcoin run close to its all-time high (ATH). The Ethereum price hit $2,900, coming close to the psychological $3,000 level. Additionally, the Solana price also hit $170, its highest level over the last 90 days. With two of the top major altcoins making these runs, this has further fueled optimism that altcoin season may be around the corner. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas told investors to get ready for a potential Altcoin ETF summer with Solana likely leading the way. This development could be the catalyst that sparks the altcoin season, with the SEC already asking issuers to amend their S-1 filings. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ETFs just hit a four-month high of inflows, with $240 million flowing into these funds on June 11. These funds have also witnessed 18 consecutive days of inflows as optimism grows about the SEC approving staking for these funds. This could be another catalyst for altcoin season as the Ethereum price usually leads the way. ETH/BTC Breakout Is Imminent In an X post, market expert Paul Barron indicated that the ETH/BTC breakout was imminent, a development which would usher in the altcoin season. He declared that Altseason is preparing for a face-melter and that the ETH/BTC breakout is “committed”. The expert added that with market sentiment up 2.8%, ETH will be the leader. Related Reading: When Will Altcoin Season Begin After Bitcoin Price Hit ATH Above $111,000? Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has also made a case for Ethereum to lead the altcoin season. In a recent analysis, he stated that from a technical perspective, ETH is looking solid at its current levels. The analyst claimed that $2,800 is the next resistance to clear out before a rally to a new high of $3,900. He added that Ethereum usually performs well near the peak of the cycle.

2025-06-12T22:57:38,"Why are Whales Moving Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Buying More Bitcoin (BTC)? An On-Chain Analysis","Massive shifts in the crypto sphere spark intense curiosity, as significant players move large amounts of Shiba Inu (SHIB) . Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales are on a buying spree, accumulating more BTC. This article delves into the reasons behind these massive moves and explores which other cryptocurrencies could be their next target. Bitcoin Shows Steady Gains with Bullish Potential Ahead Bitcoin delivered moderate gains in the past month with a nearly 5% increase, while a 6.4% rise over the last six months indicates a consistent upward trend. A modest 3% boost during the past week validates this gradual recovery. Price movements have largely remained within a stable range, reflecting cautious optimism among traders during both short- and medium-term cycles. Market sentiment suggests measured accumulation rather than explosive growth, allowing traders to benefit from a predictable rally. This period of steady performance has built a foundation of resilience amid fluctuating market conditions, hinting at the potential for further strength. Current market activity centers around a price range of approximately $94,832 to $113,326.8, with the nearest resistance at $121,869.42 and support at $84,880.08. A second resistance appears near $140,364.09, while a lower support stabilizes around $66,385.41. Indicators show that bulls currently hold moderate control despite occasional bearish pushback. Trading within these levels encourages watching for breaks above the $121,869.42 barrier to signal a stronger rally; however, a drop below $84,880.08 could trigger selling pressure. Traders might consider strategic entries within this window, monitoring volume and momentum closely as price tests these key levels. Shiba Inu Price Action and Trading Insights Shiba Inu dropped 18.53% over the past month and 55.01% in the last six months. A modest weekly increase of 0.23% highlights intermittent efforts to regain lost ground. Price fluctuations within a narrow band from $0.0000108 to $0.0000162 reveal a volatile market that has struggled to build upward momentum. The steep decline over these periods emphasizes weakness in the coin’s long-term performance and a significant departure from earlier highs. The current price action centers around pivotal technical levels critical for near-term trades. The nearest resistance at $0.0000196 presents a barrier that, if breached, could indicate a shift in sentiment, while the support at $0.00000885 offers a floor where buyers may step in. Momentum indicators show bears currently dominate, leaving no clear trend. Traders may consider short-term positions by watching for reversals near these levels, as quick decisions may uncover emerging opportunities or deeper bearish control. Conclusion Crypto whales are making strategic moves, evidenced by large transfers of Shiba Inu . Simultaneously, Bitcoin whales are increasing their holdings, signaling strong confidence in its long-term value. Examining this whale behavior reveals significant ongoing interest and trust in both BTC and SHIB. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-12T22:20:36,"US PPI Data Reveals Unexpected Calm, Boosting Crypto Hopes","BitcoinWorld US PPI Data Reveals Unexpected Calm, Boosting Crypto Hopes Hello crypto enthusiasts! Economic data points from the United States often send ripples across global markets, and this week is no different. The latest report on the US PPI , or Producer Price Index, just dropped, and it’s stirring up some discussion about the state of inflation and what it could mean for assets like cryptocurrencies. What Did the Latest US PPI Report Show? The U.S. Department of Labor recently released the figures for the Producer Price Index for May. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key numbers: Month-over-Month (May vs. April): PPI rose by 0.1%. This was slightly below the market expectation of a 0.2% increase. Year-over-Year (May 2024 vs. May 2023): PPI increased by 2.6%. This figure was in line with forecasts and represented a slight uptick from the 2.5% recorded in April. This print, particularly the softer month-over-month figure, provides a slightly different perspective on inflationary pressures compared to some recent data releases. It suggests that the prices producers are receiving for their goods and services aren’t accelerating as quickly as some anticipated. Understanding the Producer Price Index : Why Does it Matter? So, what exactly is the Producer Price Index ? Think of it as a measure of inflation from the perspective of the sellers or producers in the economy. It tracks the average changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. Why is this important? Because changes in producer prices often serve as an early indicator of potential changes in consumer prices. If producers are paying more for raw materials or receiving higher prices for their goods, those costs can eventually be passed on to consumers, showing up later in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The PPI is often seen as a leading or coincident indicator for the CPI, though the relationship isn’t always perfectly direct or immediate. Tracking the PPI helps economists and policymakers gauge inflationary trends earlier in the supply chain. How Does This Inflation Data Influence the Federal Reserve ? The Federal Reserve , the central bank of the United States, has a dual mandate: to maximize employment and maintain stable prices (control inflation). Economic data like the PPI is crucial for the Fed’s decision-making process regarding monetary policy, specifically interest rates. When inflation data comes in lower than expected, it can provide the Fed with more flexibility. It suggests that the economy might be cooling down, and the urgency to keep interest rates high to combat inflation could lessen. Conversely, hotter-than-expected inflation data puts pressure on the Fed to maintain or even increase rates. While the Fed pays closer attention to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index as its preferred inflation gauge, the PPI and CPI are also significant inputs into their assessment of the overall inflationary environment. A series of softer inflation prints across different measures could pave the way for potential interest rate cuts in the future. What’s the Potential Impact on the Crypto Market ? Now, let’s talk about why this matters to the Crypto Market . Cryptocurrencies are often considered risk assets. Their prices can be influenced by macroeconomic factors, including interest rates and inflation expectations. Here’s the general dynamic: Higher Interest Rates / Strong Inflation Fears: Tend to be negative for risk assets like crypto. Higher rates make traditional investments (like bonds) more attractive, and borrowing becomes more expensive, potentially reducing speculative investment in volatile assets. Lower Interest Rates / Cooling Inflation: Can be positive for risk assets. Lower rates reduce the attractiveness of traditional savings and debt becomes cheaper, potentially encouraging investment in higher-growth or more speculative areas like crypto. The May PPI report, showing a slightly weaker month-over-month increase than anticipated, could be interpreted by markets as a sign that inflationary pressures might be easing. This narrative, if sustained by future data, could support the argument for the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates sooner rather than later. While one data point isn’t a trend, it adds to the overall picture the market is building. Therefore, a softer PPI print is generally seen as a marginally positive signal for risk assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto market, as it aligns with the hope for future monetary easing. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Economic Indicators ? While the May PPI data provides a piece of the puzzle, markets are always looking ahead to the next major releases. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is often considered more impactful for direct market reaction, and the May CPI data is also highly anticipated. The CPI report will give us insight into inflation from the consumer’s perspective, which is a critical component the Fed evaluates. Beyond inflation data, market participants will also be closely watching employment figures, retail sales, and manufacturing data to get a comprehensive view of the U.S. economy’s health. The collective picture painted by these economic indicators will heavily influence market sentiment and expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s future actions. In Conclusion The U.S. May PPI report came in slightly below market expectations on a month-over-month basis, while the year-over-year figure remained stable and in line with forecasts. This data point suggests that inflationary pressures at the producer level might be moderating, which is a piece of potentially good news for those hoping for future interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. While not a definitive game-changer on its own, this Inflation Data contributes to the ongoing narrative that could influence the Fed’s path and, consequently, the performance of the Crypto Market and other risk assets. As always, staying informed about key economic releases is vital for understanding the broader market context.

2025-06-12T22:10:36,"Bitcoin Volatility Alert: Mike McGlone Warns of Risky Turning Point for Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Volatility Alert: Mike McGlone Warns of Risky Turning Point for Crypto Market Are we in the calm before a storm in the crypto market ? That’s the question market watchers are asking following recent commentary from Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior macro strategist, Mike McGlone. McGlone, a seasoned analyst known for his macro perspectives on digital assets, has flagged a potentially critical development for Bitcoin . Why is Bitcoin Volatility So Low Right Now? One of the most striking observations McGlone highlighted on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) is the historically subdued Bitcoin volatility . For an asset class notorious for its wild price swings, Bitcoin has recently entered a period of unusual quietness. This low volatility isn’t just low in absolute terms; McGlone points out it’s nearing levels seen during past periods of consolidation, and crucially, it’s currently lower relative to traditional safe havens like gold and major stock indices such as the S&P 500. Typically, Bitcoin’s volatility dwarfs that of conventional assets. Its price can surge or plummet by double-digit percentages in a single day, a characteristic that has historically attracted speculative traders seeking outsized gains. However, the current environment paints a different picture. This sustained period of lower volatility suggests a potential equilibrium between buying and selling pressure, or perhaps a market waiting for a significant catalyst. Comparing Bitcoin Volatility: How Does it Stack Up? McGlone’s comparison to gold and the S&P 500 is key. Gold is traditionally seen as a store of value with relatively low volatility, while the S&P 500 represents a broad market index with moderate volatility influenced by economic cycles and corporate earnings. Bitcoin, positioned as a nascent digital store of value and a high-growth tech-like asset, usually sits at the high end of the volatility spectrum. When Bitcoin’s volatility compresses to levels approaching or even dipping below these traditional assets, it signals a potential shift. This could imply several things: Increased Maturation: As the market capitalization grows and institutional participation increases, Bitcoin could naturally become less volatile, similar to how other asset classes mature. Market Indecision: Investors might be holding back, unsure of the next major trend, leading to tighter trading ranges. Building Pressure: Periods of low volatility often precede periods of high volatility. The market might be coiling up before a significant price move. Here’s a simplified look at how volatility typically compares (note: specific percentages fluctuate constantly): Asset Typical Volatility (Relative) Current McGlone Observation Bitcoin High Historically Low, nearing/below Gold & S&P 500 Gold Low Higher relative to current Bitcoin volatility S&P 500 Moderate Higher relative to current Bitcoin volatility This unusual dynamic is what catches McGlone’s attention and prompts his warning. The Risky Turning Point: What Does McGlone Warn About? While low volatility can sometimes be interpreted as a sign of stability or maturity, McGlone suggests it could signal a potential Bitcoin risk . His core concern seems to be that while this maturation might reduce the probability of the kind of explosive, ‘100x’ gains seen in earlier cycles, the current low volatility environment, paradoxically, could heighten systemic risks. Why is low volatility potentially risky now, especially amid what McGlone describes as ‘bullish sentiment’? He posits that a combination of factors creates this heightened risk: Complacency: Prolonged low volatility can lead market participants to become complacent, potentially taking on excessive leverage or underestimating the possibility of a sharp move. Market Structure: The increasing financialization of Bitcoin, with derivatives markets and institutional products, means that a sudden shift could trigger cascading effects (e.g., liquidations). Politicization: McGlone highlights Bitcoin’s increasing politicization. Regulatory uncertainty, geopolitical events, and government stances on crypto can introduce sudden, unpredictable risks that low volatility might be masking. A negative political or regulatory shock could trigger a sharp sell-off in a market that has become accustomed to quiet trading. Underlying Bullish Sentiment: If bullish sentiment persists without a corresponding upward price movement, it can create pent-up energy. When a catalyst finally arrives (positive or negative), the ensuing move can be more violent than expected because positions have built up during the quiet phase. Therefore, according to McGlone, the current low volatility isn’t necessarily a sign that Bitcoin has become a boring, stable asset. Instead, it could be a precarious state where underlying pressures are building, and the market is particularly vulnerable to external shocks or a sudden shift in sentiment, potentially leading to a significant move with elevated systemic risk for the broader crypto market . Navigating Potential Bitcoin Price Action: Actionable Insights So, what does this mean for investors and traders? McGlone’s analysis suggests caution, even if the prevailing sentiment is bullish. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Risk Exposure: Given the potential for increased volatility and systemic risk, assess your current position size and leverage. Are you comfortable with the potential downside if the market moves sharply against you? Prepare for a Breakout: Low volatility periods often precede significant price movements. Have a plan for both potential upside and downside scenarios. What will you do if Bitcoin surges? What will you do if it plummets? Watch Macro and Regulatory News: Pay close attention to macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and most importantly, regulatory developments globally. As McGlone notes, Bitcoin’s politicization means external factors can have a swift and significant impact. Consider Hedging Strategies: If you hold significant Bitcoin, explore hedging options to protect against potential downside risk during this uncertain period. Focus on Long-Term Conviction: For long-term investors, periods of uncertainty and potential volatility can present opportunities to accumulate positions if your conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value remains strong. However, timing entries carefully during volatile swings is crucial. The key takeaway is not necessarily that a crash is imminent, but that the current market state is potentially more fragile than the quiet volatility might suggest. The combination of low volatility, bullish sentiment, and increasing external influences creates a complex environment. Conclusion: The Quiet Before the Storm? Mike McGlone’s warning serves as a crucial reminder that even in periods of relative calm, risks persist in the dynamic crypto market . Bitcoin’s unusually low volatility compared to traditional assets like gold and the S&P 500 could be a signal of maturation, but McGlone cautions that it might also be the market building pressure before a significant move. The increasing politicization of Bitcoin adds another layer of complexity, potentially amplifying systemic risks during a shift. While the potential for large gains remains a draw for many, understanding the potential downsides and preparing for increased volatility is paramount for navigating what could be a critical turning point for Bitcoin price action.

2025-06-12T21:50:36,"Bitcoin Price Plunge: What the BTC Drop Below $107,000 Means","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plunge: What the BTC Drop Below $107,000 Means The cryptocurrency market felt a familiar jolt recently as the Bitcoin Price experienced a notable decline, pushing the digital asset below the widely watched $107,000 level. This movement has naturally captured the attention of traders, investors, and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about the market’s direction and the factors influencing this shift. According to monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC has fallen below $107,000 . Specifically, the report highlighted BTC trading at $106,973.42 on the Binance USDT market at the time of observation. While this specific price point might seem minor in the grand scheme of Bitcoin’s volatile history, breaching a significant psychological or technical level like $107,000 often triggers increased market scrutiny and can influence short-term trading sentiment. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Experience a Drop? Understanding the reasons behind a Bitcoin Price movement is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Price drops are rarely attributable to a single factor. Instead, they often result from a confluence of technical indicators, market sentiment, and broader economic or regulatory news. Here are some potential contributing factors: Market Sentiment and Profit-Taking: After periods of upward movement or consolidation, traders may decide to take profits, leading to selling pressure. Negative sentiment, perhaps triggered by unfavorable news or rumors, can also cascade quickly in the interconnected crypto market. Technical Resistance: Price levels can act as technical resistance points. If Bitcoin struggles to break above a certain level, it can lead to a pullback as traders lose confidence in the immediate upward trajectory. The $107,000 level could have represented such a point after a prior move. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic news, such as inflation data, interest rate changes by central banks, or geopolitical events, can influence investor risk appetite. When traditional markets face uncertainty, investors might reduce exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors regarding cryptocurrency regulation in major economies can significantly impact prices. Stricter regulations are often perceived negatively by the market. Whale Activity: Large transactions by major holders (‘whales’) can move the market. Significant sell orders can quickly drive the price down, especially during periods of lower liquidity. Analyzing these factors requires staying informed and understanding how different pieces of information can interact to influence price action. What Does This BTC Price Drop Mean for Investors? A BTC Price Drop below a key level presents both challenges and potential opportunities, depending on an investor’s perspective, strategy, and time horizon. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Price drops often increase market volatility, making short-term trading riskier. Emotional Trading: Declines can trigger fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), leading investors to make impulsive decisions like selling at a loss. Uncertainty: It can be difficult to determine if the drop is a temporary correction or the start of a more significant downturn. Potential Opportunities: Buying Opportunity: For long-term investors bullish on Bitcoin’s future, a price dip can be seen as an opportunity to accumulate more BTC at a lower price point. This aligns with strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). Testing Support Levels: Traders can watch how the price reacts to potential support levels below $107,000. A strong bounce from a support level could indicate renewed buying interest. Re-evaluating Strategy: A price drop serves as a good reminder to review one’s investment thesis, risk tolerance, and portfolio allocation. Navigating a price drop requires discipline and a clear strategy, avoiding decisions driven purely by emotion. Navigating the Current Crypto Market News In times of market volatility, staying informed with reliable Crypto Market News is paramount. The digital asset space is dynamic, with constant updates ranging from technological developments and project milestones to regulatory shifts and macroeconomic indicators. However, it’s equally important to filter out the noise and potential misinformation. Here are some actionable insights for consuming crypto news effectively: Verify Sources: Always cross-reference information from multiple reputable news outlets. Be wary of sensational headlines or information shared only on social media without credible backing. Understand the Context: News often has a specific context. A regulatory proposal might sound negative initially but could have nuances or a long implementation timeline. Understand the potential impact in the broader market context. Distinguish News from Opinion: Be clear about whether you are reading a factual report or an analyst’s opinion or prediction. Both can be valuable, but they serve different purposes. Be Mindful of Sentiment: News can heavily influence market sentiment. While tracking sentiment is useful, don’t let it dictate your entire strategy. Base decisions on fundamental research and your own risk assessment. Being a well-informed participant in the crypto market involves more than just knowing the latest price; it requires understanding the underlying drivers and potential future trends. Performing Bitcoin Analysis in Volatile Times When the market is experiencing a BTC Price Drop or significant volatility, performing thorough Bitcoin Analysis becomes even more critical. Analysis can be broadly categorized into fundamental and technical approaches. Fundamental Analysis: This involves looking at the underlying value and factors that could influence Bitcoin’s long-term price. This includes examining network hash rate, transaction volume, adoption rates, regulatory landscape, and macroeconomic environment. While a short-term drop below $107,000 might be a blip, fundamental analysis helps assess if the long-term outlook remains strong. Technical Analysis: This involves studying price charts and using indicators to predict future price movements based on historical data and patterns. Traders might look at support and resistance levels (like the $107,000 level itself, and potential levels below it), moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and volume trends. A drop below a key level is a technical signal that prompts analysts to look for the next potential support zone. Combining both fundamental and technical analysis can provide a more holistic view. For example, strong fundamentals might suggest that a technical price dip is a temporary correction rather than a long-term reversal. Getting a BTC Update : Where to Find Reliable Information? Getting a timely and accurate BTC Update is essential for making informed decisions. With the sheer volume of information available, knowing where to look is key. Reliable sources typically include: Reputable Crypto News Websites: Platforms like Bitcoin World, CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, and others with established track records for reporting facts. Exchanges and Data Aggregators: Platforms like Binance (where the specific price was noted), CoinMarketCap, and CoinGecko provide real-time price data, volume, and market cap information. Official Project Channels: While Bitcoin doesn’t have a central ‘project’, following developers and key contributors on platforms like Twitter or participating in community forums can provide insights into network developments. Regulatory Body Websites: For news on potential regulation, checking the official websites of financial regulators in relevant countries is crucial. Be cautious of sources that promise guaranteed returns or push specific assets without clear, unbiased analysis. Diligent research and critical thinking are your best tools. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the recent BTC Price Drop and market volatility, what steps can investors take? Stay Calm and Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions are often detrimental in volatile markets. Stick to your pre-defined strategy. Review Your Strategy: Revisit your investment goals, risk tolerance, and portfolio allocation. Does the price drop change anything about your long-term conviction in Bitcoin? Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you are a long-term investor, a dip can be an opportunity to buy smaller amounts at regular intervals, lowering your average purchase price over time. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For traders, using stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the price continues to fall. Diversify: While this article focuses on Bitcoin, remember that diversification across different asset classes (not just different cryptocurrencies) can help manage risk. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on headlines or social media tips. Conduct your own analysis and understand what you are investing in. Ultimately, navigating market dips is a test of patience and adherence to a well-thought-out plan. Conclusion The recent fall of the Bitcoin Price below the $107,000 mark serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. While specific price levels are often psychological milestones, the underlying factors driving such movements are what truly matter. This BTC Price Drop highlights the importance of staying informed through reliable Crypto Market News , conducting thorough Bitcoin Analysis , and getting a timely BTC Update from trustworthy sources. For investors, it’s a period that demands careful consideration, adherence to strategy, and a focus on long-term goals rather than short-term price swings. Whether viewed as a challenge or an opportunity, understanding the market dynamics is key to navigating the exciting yet unpredictable world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-12T21:40:36,"Systemic Risk: FSB Chair Issues Dire Warning on Crypto’s Growing Threat","BitcoinWorld Systemic Risk: FSB Chair Issues Dire Warning on Crypto’s Growing Threat Are the lines between the world of crypto and traditional finance blurring faster than we think? According to a significant warning from a top global financial regulator, the answer is a resounding ‘yes,’ and it could spell trouble for the entire system. The increasing interconnectedness between the crypto market risk and the broader financial system is now approaching a critical threshold, according to the Chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). What Did the Financial Stability Board Chair Say? Klaas Knot, who heads the Financial Stability Board (an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system), recently delivered a stark message during a speech in Madrid on June 12. His core concern? The growing links between the seemingly separate worlds of digital assets and conventional banking and markets. He highlighted that these connections are becoming so significant that they could soon pose a systemic risk – a risk that could potentially destabilize the entire financial system, not just the crypto sector. Knot pointed to two key areas driving this increased interconnectedness: Retail Access via ETFs: Products like spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) make it easier for everyday investors to gain exposure to crypto assets through traditional brokerage accounts. While this seems like a benefit for accessibility, it deepens the link between mainstream finance and the volatile crypto market. Stablecoins and Traditional Assets: The reserves held by major stablecoins increasingly include significant amounts of traditional financial assets, particularly U.S. Treasury bills. This creates a direct link where stress in the stablecoin market could potentially transmit shocks into traditional short-term funding markets. This isn’t just theoretical hand-wringing. As Cointelegraph reported, Knot’s warning underscores a shift in the regulatory perspective, moving from viewing crypto as a niche concern to a potential source of broader financial instability. Understanding Systemic Risk in the Context of Crypto The term ‘ systemic risk ‘ might sound technical, but it’s crucial for understanding the FSB’s concern. Systemic risk refers to the risk of collapse of an entire financial system or market, as opposed to the risk of collapse of a single entity, group, or component within the system. Think of it like a domino effect: if one large, interconnected piece falls, it can knock down many others, leading to a widespread crisis. Historically, systemic risk has been associated with traditional finance – the collapse of large banks, the subprime mortgage crisis, etc. Now, regulators like the FSB are worried that crypto is becoming large and connected enough to potentially trigger or amplify such events. Why is this happening? The initial vision of crypto often involved being separate from traditional finance. However, to gain wider adoption, crypto has built bridges: Exchanges connect fiat currency to crypto. Institutions are investing in crypto or offering crypto services. Stablecoins aim to bridge the gap between crypto and fiat value. ETFs and similar products package crypto for traditional investors. Each of these bridges, while facilitating growth and adoption, also creates pathways for risk to travel between the two systems. A severe downturn in the crypto market risk could lead to forced selling of traditional assets held by crypto entities (like stablecoin reserves), potentially impacting traditional market liquidity and prices. Conversely, stress in traditional markets could force institutions to pull back from crypto, causing cascading effects. The Growing Stablecoin Risk Knot’s specific mention of stablecoins holding U.S. Treasuries highlights a particularly sensitive point. Stablecoin risk isn’t just about whether a stablecoin maintains its peg; it’s also about the composition and management of its reserves. Major stablecoins hold tens of billions of dollars in assets, a significant portion of which are often short-term government securities (like T-bills) and commercial paper. Here’s why this creates a link and potential risk: Large Holders: Stablecoin issuers have become significant players in certain short-term funding markets. Potential for Rapid Selling: If a stablecoin faced a large number of redemption requests (people cashing out their stablecoins for fiat), the issuer might be forced to sell off its reserve assets quickly. Market Impact: Large, rapid sales of assets like T-bills could potentially disrupt the functioning of those critical short-term markets, which are vital for the plumbing of the traditional financial system. Contagion: Disruptions in these markets could then affect banks, money market funds, and other traditional financial institutions. While many stablecoin issuers have improved the quality and transparency of their reserves following past incidents (like the Terra/LUNA collapse), the sheer scale of the assets held means this remains a key area of focus for regulators concerned about systemic risk . How Does Increased Retail Access Via ETFs Contribute? The approval and popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., represent a significant step in mainstreaming crypto. While this is often seen as a positive development for investors seeking easier access, from a regulator’s perspective focused on financial stability , it increases the number of participants directly exposed to crypto volatility through traditional channels. Consider this scenario: Millions of retail investors hold Bitcoin ETFs in their standard brokerage accounts. A sudden, sharp downturn occurs in the crypto market. Investors panic and sell their ETF shares. The ETF issuer must sell underlying Bitcoin to meet redemptions, potentially exacerbating the crypto price drop. Simultaneously, widespread losses on crypto holdings could impact retail investor confidence and spending, potentially having minor macroeconomic effects, or leading to margin calls and issues within brokerage firms themselves if not properly managed. While current ETF volumes might not pose an immediate, massive systemic risk , the concern is about the trend and future scale. As more crypto assets get packaged into traditional products and more people gain easy access, the potential for crypto market shocks to have broader societal and financial impacts increases. The Role of Crypto Regulation This is where crypto regulation comes into play. The FSB’s warning isn’t necessarily a call to ban crypto, but rather a clear signal that regulatory frameworks need to be developed and implemented to manage the risks associated with its integration into traditional finance. The goal of crypto regulation from this perspective is to build safeguards that prevent crypto market volatility from spilling over and causing wider economic damage. Key areas for potential regulation include: Stablecoins: Rules on reserve composition, custody, transparency, and redemption policies. Crypto Platforms & Exchanges: Requirements around consumer protection, market integrity, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) checks. Intermediaries: Regulations for banks, brokers, and other financial institutions that offer crypto-related services or hold crypto assets. Data Reporting: Requiring crypto firms to provide data on their activities and holdings to regulators to monitor interconnectedness and risk build-up. The challenge for regulators is immense. Crypto operates globally, often across different jurisdictions with varying rules. Developing coordinated and effective crypto regulation that fosters innovation while managing systemic risk and protecting consumers is a complex task. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? For participants in the crypto market , warnings like the one from the FSB Chair are a reminder that increased mainstream adoption comes with increased scrutiny and the potential for more stringent rules. While some in the crypto community view regulation negatively, others see it as a necessary step for long-term sustainability and broader institutional acceptance. Key takeaways for market participants: Expect More Regulation: The trend towards increased crypto regulation is likely to continue globally as regulators focus on financial stability . Stablecoin Scrutiny: Stablecoins will remain a key focus area, particularly regarding their reserves and operations. Interconnectedness Matters: Understand that the crypto market is no longer operating in a vacuum; it’s increasingly linked to the traditional financial system. Risk Awareness: Be aware of potential contagion risks and how events in traditional finance or specific crypto sub-sectors (like stablecoins) could impact the broader market. While the FSB’s warning highlights potential downsides, it also implicitly acknowledges the growing significance of the crypto sector. The fact that regulators are focusing on its potential to create systemic risk means it’s no longer considered a fringe phenomenon but a component that needs to be integrated safely into the global financial architecture. Conclusion: Navigating the Blurring Lines FSB Chair Klaas Knot’s warning serves as a crucial reminder that as crypto becomes more accessible and integrated into traditional finance through avenues like ETFs and stablecoin reserves, the potential for systemic risk increases. This growing interconnectedness means that problems in the crypto world could potentially impact traditional markets and vice-versa, posing a challenge to overall financial stability . Regulators like the Financial Stability Board are closely monitoring these developments, and the call for effective crypto regulation is becoming louder. While managing crypto market risk and particularly stablecoin risk is complex, developing robust frameworks is seen as essential to harness the potential benefits of digital assets while mitigating the dangers of a financial crisis triggered by or amplified by the crypto sector. The future of finance will likely involve navigating these increasingly blurred lines carefully, with a strong emphasis on risk management and regulatory clarity.

According to Nasdaq filings, this shift brings ADA alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in one of the main benchmarks watched by big investors. It’s a sign that regulators and asset managers see Cardano as more than just another blockchain token. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Index Broadens To Nine Assets Based on reports from TapTools and Nasdaq’s Form 8-K, the index grew from five to nine assets. It now lists Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Chainlink, Uniswap, and adds Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Stellar (XLM). The change gives these newcomers a seat at the table. It also means more options for funds that track this benchmark. Cardano $ADA has officially been added to the Nasdaq Crypto Index, joining BTC and ETH in one of the industry’s top institutional benchmarks. It’s not just recognition— It’s infrastructure-level validation.

With ADA and the other three in play, Bitcoin’s share falls to 75% and Ethereum’s to 11%. This shift lets portfolio managers spread risk across a broader set of tokens. It also lowers the concentration in the two biggest names in crypto. SEC approves NASDAQ Index that includes ADA Cardano pic.twitter.com/p7Rj5RVGQd — Cardano Feed ($ADA) (@CardanoFeed) June 11, 2025 ETF Holdings Await SEC Signoff Even though the index itself now includes all 9 assets, the US-listed Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF still holds only Bitcoin and Ethereum. That won’t change until the SEC signs off on updates to the ETF’s rulebook. Based on the current timeline, that approval is expected in early 2026. Until then, US investors can track the wider index on paper, but their ETF shares will stick with the original two coins.

It means added liquidity, better price support, and a clearer path into institutional portfolios. More cash in and out of ADA markets could narrow trading spreads and smooth out big swings. Trading platforms, custody services, and exchanges will feel the impact too. They’ll need to meet the index’s criteria—steady volume, regulated venues, and institutional-grade storage. Those checkpoints help keep major players comfortable when they decide to buy or sell ADA at scale. Overall, bringing ADA into this benchmark shows that big finance is watching Cardano more closely than before. Yet the final step—actual ETF inclusion in the US—still lies with regulators.

2025-06-12T21:13:45,"Crypto Cracks Late in Day, Bitcoin Slumps Below $106K","Cryptocurrencies were broadly lower on Thursday, with the selloff picking up steam in the early U.S. evening hours. Bitcoin BTC slipped more than 2.5% over the past 24 hours to $105,900, but the declines were far steeper in altcoins, with ether ETH, solana SOL, XRP XRP and dogecoin DOGE among those tokens sporting 5%-7% drops. Risk assets in general got off to a poor start Thursday as President Trump threatened renewed tariff measures as the early July deadline for trade deals begins to get near. In addition, with nuclear negotiations with Iran not going well, there were boosted fears of Israeli strikes against Iranian nuclear sites. “Look, there’s a chance of massive conflict,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday. “We have a lot of American people in this area, and I said, we’ve got to tell them to get out, because something could happen soon, and I don’t want to be the one that didn’t give any warning and missiles are flying.” “I don’t want to say imminent, but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen,” Trump said about Israel potentially striking Iran. He stated that he had advised against an attack while negotiations were ongoing. While U.S. stocks were able to shake off the headlines and close with modest gains, cryptos weren't so lucky. Green shoots? The rally in risk assets — crypto included — over the past several weeks has taken place amid a U.S. Federal Reserve seemingly determined not to ease monetary policy for the foreseeable future. And yet, there continue to be signs that weak economic data may soon force the Fed's hand — a far slowed pace of employment gains and weaker inflation numbers among them. Two more data points arrived Thursday in May's Producer Price Index, which came in softer than forecast on both the headline and core levels, and initial jobless claims, which unexpectedly matched last week's multi-month high of 248,000. Continuing jobless claims rose to 1.956 million, the third consecutive gain and the highest level since November 2021. President Trump continued his crusade to goad Fed Chair Jerome Powell into a more dovish posture, calling him a ""numbskull"" for not cutting rates . ""I may have to force something,"" threatened Trump. Powell's term as Fed boss doesn't end until 2026 and the president had previously said firing him prior to that was not an option.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/12/crypto-cracks-late-in-day-bitcoin-slumps-below-106k,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL","Markets|Bitcoin|Market Wrap|News",cryptocompare

The Coinbase One Card, issued in partnership with American Express, includes perks such as earning 4% in BTC after purchases, boosted rewards on USDC stablecoin holdings and higher staking rewards and transaction credits on Base, the Ethereum layer-2 network developed by the exchange, according to the card's website . The card's rollout is expected this fall. The move comes as more crypto platforms and exchanges are rolling out payment cards to enable users to spend their blockchain-based token stash on everyday purchases. For example, self-custodial wallet MetaMask introduced its debit card last year, while Mastercard unveiled plans in April to launch debit cards with crypto exchanges OKX and Kraken . It's also not the first crypto endeavour for Amex, either: the company issued a credit card offering crypto rewards with Abra in 2022. Coinbase's announcement coincided with the company's State of Crypto Summit event in New York, where the exchange also hinted at expanding perpetual futures trading to the U.S., according to media reports . Perps trading has been limited to non-U.S. users at Coinbase Advance.

On Thursday, Coinbase announced a series of new products geared towards enhancing mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. On the top list, Coinbase unveiled its Coinbase One Card in collaboration with American Express. The Coinbase One Card will offer up to 4 percent Bitcoin back on each purchase. The cryptocurrency exchange announced the launch of perpetual futures in the United States, with the feature expected to be expanded to global markets soon. The exchange also introduced its Coinbase Business and announced the waitlist is open to entrepreneurs seeking to venture into the crypto space. Coinbase also announced a strategic partnership with Shopify to enable USDC checkouts on Base through Shopify Payments and Shop Pay. Will Coinbase Overthrow Peers? As Coinpedia has reported in the past, Coinbase has suffered significant criticism for its poor customer service, especially during challenging times such as account takeovers and scams. As a result, Coinbase has continued to record significantly low quarterly trades volume compared to Binance and Bybit . The launch of the new products will play a crucial role in rebuilding its broken trust with the customers. Moreover, Coinbase is heavily regulated in the United States and has huge backing from institutional investors seeking to venture into the crypto market. However, Coinbase will have to use more unique tactics to attract more customers amid heightened competition from its competitors. Rising competition from other crypto exchanges, such as Upbit and Kraken , also presents more headwinds for Coinbase in the near future. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency industry will continue to boom in the near future, fueled by institutional investors and clear crypto regulations, thus ensuring a long term growth prospects for Coinbase.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/coinbase-unveils-new-products-are-they-the-awaited-triggers-to-attract-more-crypto-traders/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

The S&P 500 rose 0.38% to close at 6,045.26, led by a rally in large-cap tech stocks. The benchmark index now sits less than 2% below its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.24%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 101.85 points, or 0.24%, to 42,967.62. Oracle was the day’s standout performer, surging 13% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results and projecting over 70% growth in cloud infrastructure revenue next year, fueled by rising AI demand. The strong report lifted the broader tech sector and helped drive market gains. The rally came despite a 4.8% drop in Boeing shares, which weighed on the Dow after one of its 787 Dreamliners crashed in India. Still, investor sentiment held up amid easing Treasury yields and softer economic data that pointed to potential Fed policy easing.

The data, combined with strong demand at a Treasury auction, sent yields lower, with the 10-year note dipping below 4.4%.

A break-retest scenario would hint at a continuation as towards the next resistance zone between 3,000 to 3,050 as long as prices don't re-enter the May Range. Price action looks a bit more mixed looking in the 1H timeframe - prices might be forming what resembles like a head and shoulders which would be confirmed with a bigger correction in other crypto assets. By Elior Manier The cryptocurrency picture is confusing to understand in the past week, with most altcoins rallying but the path is not a one way up. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is unchanged and most altcoins are down in today's session. ETH ( ETH-USD ), for example, broke above its 2,739 May highs, establishing local highs at 2,879 on Wednesday before retracting. Prices are down 2.80% on the session, but the descent looks more like a retracement than a full correction of the preceding up-moves. Ethereum's recently launched ETF's like ETHA ( ETHA ) or FETH ( FETH ) have had some steady inflows, not showing many signs of weakness there.Let's take a look at different timeframes, going from the Daily to the hourly to spot potential trends and hurdles.

ETH 4H Timeframe ETH 4H Chart, June 12, 2025 – Source: TradingView Ethereum has consolidated above what was the preceding immediate resistance at 2,739 and is now considered the main pivot to future movements.The RSI went from overbought to slightly above neutral on the 4H timeframe accompanied by the 4H MA 20 - Candles are not showing any type of decision with a few three consecutive dojis. A break-retest scenario would hint at a continuation as towards the next resistance zone between 3,000 to 3,050 as long as prices don't re-enter the May Range.If they do, there is support at the 50 MA around 2,630 and after, the Main support zone 1 from 2,385 to 2,425.

In the meantime, prices are consolidating in the pivot zone mentioned higher and would need to break above the 1H MA 50 to keep pushing higher.The immediate resistance point is the last highs at 2,879.

In a 90-second video message to Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit, Trump said it was an honor to be called “Crypto President.” Trump reiterated his goal of ending the previous administration’s “war on crypto” policy in his speech and said they would establish a working group to evaluate digital assets. He also referred to new regulations on the agenda of Congress. “Our administration is working with governors to pass the GENIUS Act, which supports the creation of dollar-backed stablecoins. We will also create clear and simple market frameworks that will enable America to be a leader in the future of crypto and Bitcoin,” he said.

Trump also claimed to have created a “U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile” via an executive order, although these have not yet been officially established.

In a new thread, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 115,800 followers on the social media platform X that BTC whales exiting long positions in favor of building short positions against retail could cause the crypto asset by market cap to slide down to $106,300. “BTC isn’t the most exciting market at the moment, but that $106,000 imbalance looks appealing if this holds.

The company has successfully acquired the assets of Pelicoin , a prominent Crypto ATM operator primarily based in Louisiana. This strategic step is poised to substantially enhance Bitcoin Depot ‘s operational footprint, particularly within the vital Gulf South region. What Does the Bitcoin Depot Acquisition Mean? The Bitcoin Depot acquisition of Pelicoin ‘s assets is more than just a simple business transaction; it represents a calculated expansion strategy. By integrating Pelicoin ‘s existing infrastructure, Bitcoin Depot gains immediate access to a well-established network of Bitcoin ATM locations. This is crucial for a business model that relies heavily on physical accessibility for users looking to buy or sell cryptocurrency using cash. The primary benefit of this acquisition for Bitcoin Depot is the rapid expansion into new and existing markets without the time and cost associated with building new locations from scratch. It leverages Pelicoin ‘s established presence and customer base. Expanding the Bitcoin ATM and Crypto ATM Footprint The deal significantly bolsters Bitcoin Depot ‘s nationwide presence. While the exact number of locations acquired was not specified in the initial announcement, the addition of Pelicoin ‘s machines means more places where customers can easily interact with the crypto market. These new locations are strategically spread across several states, including: Louisiana Mississippi Tennessee Alabama Texas This expansion through the Pelicoin acquisition enhances the density of Bitcoin Depot ‘s network, making it more convenient for users in these states to find a nearby Bitcoin ATM or Crypto ATM . A larger, more accessible network is a direct competitive advantage in the burgeoning crypto ATM industry.

By acquiring Pelicoin ‘s assets, Bitcoin Depot is specifically targeting growth in this geographical area. The Gulf South represents a market with increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, and having a robust network of Bitcoin ATM s there is key to capturing that demand. This regional focus allows Bitcoin Depot to consolidate its position and potentially become the dominant Crypto ATM operator in these states.

2025-06-12T19:43:27,"Czech government under pressure over bitcoin donation from ‘Silk Road’ entrepreneur","A controversial $45 million Bitcoin donation by an entrepreneur convicted of operating a dark web marketplace is rocking the Czech political scene. A Bitcoin (BTC) donation is shaking the Czech political landscape. On Thursday, June 12, the Czech opposition called for a no-confidence vote on the government over alleged corruption. The scandal involves the donation of 468 bitcoins, worth $45 million, to the state by an ex-convict. The benefactor was Tomáš Jiříkovský, a controversial entrepreneur and drug trafficker who operated a dark web marketplace for illegal drugs. He was convicted in 2017 for drug trafficking, fraud, and illegal weapons possession, and served his sentence until 2021. The payment, which was made to the Justice Ministry, was accepted by then-Minister Pavel Blazek. The funds were later liquidated into fiat and transferred to the state treasury. However, the donation prompted pressure from the opposition, and Blazek was forced to resign on May 31. You might also like: Czech Republic passes crypto-friendly law, exempts Bitcoin from capital gains While the funds were given to the state rather than to the minister personally, the opposition questioned the origins of the funds. The opposition accused the government of accepting the bitcoins without any AML or KYC checks. Without verifying their origin, it’s impossible to know whether they were connected to illegal activity. Czech story mirrors ‘Silk Road’ scandal Jiříkovský’s operations closely resemble those of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road. The platform was one of the first places where Bitcoin could be readily used, but it was also a hub for illegal drug trafficking. Ulbricht was pardoned in January 2025 by President Donald Trump after serving 11 years in jail. Interestingly, in June, he received a 300 Bitcoin donation from a “questionable source.” The scandal is rocking the crypto-friendly Czech government, which had hoped to attract crypto businesses with its flexible stance on MiCA regulations. It also risks undermining public trust in Bitcoin by associating it with illegal operations. Read more: Czech Republic might create a BTC reserve ahead of the U.S. administration.
