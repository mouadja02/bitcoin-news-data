One of the company’s member just sold his entire $10 million stake in MSTR stock. What’s more surprising? Not a single insider has bought any shares in 2025. This has raised concerns that this could hurt Bitcoin price and MSTR stock performance. $10M Sell-Off by MicroStrategy Insider Carl Rickertsen, a board member of MicroStrategy, recently sold all of his MSTR shares, worth over $10 million. This move is raising eyebrows, especially because Rickertsen has been with the company since 2022. He originally bought $700,000 worth of MSTR stock when the price was under $25. Since then, the stock has skyrocketed, making his exit highly profitable. Reports from Protos reveal that Rickertsen didn’t just sell, he exercised stock options and dumped the shares on the very same day. This kind of move often signals a lack of long-term confidence in a company. Zero Insider Buys MSTR Shares in 2025 What’s even more worrying is that no insiders have purchased MSTR shares so far in 2025. According to Protos, there have been 26 insider sales this year, with total sell-offs outpacing purchases by over $864 million. “Insiders might sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one: they think the price will rise” – Peter Lynch. Well, ZERO insiders have bought $MSTR in 2025. Instead, there have been 26 insider sales this year alone. 5 year score: Insider sales exceed purchases by $864M. pic.twitter.com/nZSzqFcWZe — Protos (@Protos) June 12, 2025 This trend paints a concerning picture for small investors, especially as the stock has dropped 10% in the past month. That’s a huge red flag for many retail investors, especially when the company’s own executives are not backing the stock they help run. Strategy: Continue To Accumulate Bitcoin This comes at a time when Michael Saylor, the face of Strategy, continues to promote the firm’s Bitcoin-first strategy. The company now holds a staggering 582,000 BTC worth over $63 billion. But despite all that, MSTR shares are down by 8% , currently trading around $379. Peter Schiff Slams MicroStrategy Famous economist and long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff didn’t hold back. He called MicroStrategy’s business model a “complete fraud,” and claimed bankruptcy was only a matter of time. While Schiff admits he regrets not buying Bitcoin earlier, he still believes gold, not Bitcoin, will come out on top.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/microstrategy-insider-sells-10m-in-stock-is-confidence-in-mstr-slipping/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T08:56:08,"Bitcoin Price’s Brutal Sell-Off Has One More Stop, Says Analyst — Here’s Where","The Bitcoin price continues to decelerate as the crypto market shows signs of weakness due to macroeconomic factors. The top crypto by market capitalization has been testing critical support levels and is at risk of falling deeper into its monthly lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Jump 20% For Every 1% Liquidity Boost: Expert At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price trades around $104,000 recording a 2.5% drop over the past 24 hours. Other cryptocurrencies show greater weaknesses on similar timeframes with Ethereum and XRP displaying a 8% and 4% drop, respectively. Bitcoin price hints at further losses on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Price Alert, Key Levels To Watch According to top crypto analyst Daan Crypto, the Bitcoin price has been trading within a narrow window after losing the range high located at $108,385. While the cryptocurrency has been able to withstand the sell-off, the analyst drew important levels to watch. As seen on the chart below, and according to the analyst, the Bitcoin price is likely to stay on its bearish course and potentially touch the mid area of its current range. This price action would put BTC at around $99,600 in the coming days. If buyers can’t hold the sell pressure around this level, then BTC is more than likely to keep bleeding into its range low of $90,000. This bearish price action, the analyst clarified, would become the norm for the rest of June. Key Levels to watch as the Bitcoin price shows weakness on low timeframes. Source: Daan Crypto via X Daan Crypto stated the following regarding the Bitcoin price action: Quick move after that which was obviously “helped” by the headlines although the news was looming already with the past 48 hours of headlines which is also why price started selling of prior. I’ve said it a couple of times before but I’ll say it again. Bulls had no business going back down below $108K and I’m treating this as another deviation and move back into the larger range. This is reason enough for me to be cautious and not add on exposure that was derisked (…). In this context, the analyst advised his followers to wait for clear confirmation that the bull trend is returning if Bitcoin can retake its range high around the previously mentioned level. Otherwise, the best course of action is to remain cautious. Optimism Fades as Bitcoin Aims for Lower On a separate note, trading desk QCP Group noted that the biggest risk for Bitcoin and the crypto market comes from the rising tensions between the US and China, and the growing tensions in the Middle East.

2025-06-13T08:53:39,"U.S. May Issue Crypto Bonds Backed by Bitcoin and XRP, Says Ex-CFTC Chair","The post U.S. May Issue Crypto Bonds Backed by Bitcoin and XRP, Says Ex-CFTC Chair appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The idea of the U.S. government issuing crypto-backed bonds is gaining real traction and the endorsement is coming from one of Washington’s most familiar voices in financial regulation. Speaking at the XRPL Apex 2025 conference in Singapore, former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo said the concept of government bonds backed by assets like Bitcoin and XRP is “more than a possibility.” Here’s everything you need to know! Trump’s New Approach: Hold Crypto, Don’t Sell Giancarlo, who led the CFTC under President Trump and is widely known in the industry as “Crypto Dad,” revealed that the current administration is taking a very different approach to digital assets compared to its predecessors. In past years, federal agencies typically sold off seized crypto. Under Trump, that strategy has changed. According to Giancarlo, the administration now believes that holding digital assets could strengthen the U.S. financially. Had the government held onto Bitcoin seized years ago, it could have made a serious dent in the national debt, he noted during the interview with Bradley Kimes of Digital Perspective. Importantly, Giancarlo clarified that this shift doesn’t need new laws. Federal agencies already have the authority to hold confiscated digital assets and that power is now being used. Crypto as a Strategic Reserve Beyond simply storing digital assets, the government is looking at ways to use them strategically. Giancarlo compared the move to how the U.S. manages its Strategic Petroleum Reserve – a stockpile used not just for emergencies, but as a tool to stabilize markets. When oil prices are manipulated by global producers, the U.S. can release supply to push back. That same thinking is now being applied to crypto, especially with all the geopolitical changes! As BRICS nations develop alternatives to the U.S. dollar, and countries like China continue to stockpile resources, Giancarlo said the U.S. should do the same but with digital commodities. An interesting approach, wouldn’t you say? The U.S. Already Holds Billions in Crypto Well, the administration is already building out reserves. In March, President Trump signed an executive order creating the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which now holds over 200,000 BTC, worth more than $22 billion at current prices. These assets were collected through criminal and civil forfeitures and are treated as long-term holdings, similar to gold. Alongside that, the Digital Asset Stockpile was launched to manage other tokens like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Unlike the Bitcoin reserve, this pool is more flexible, allowing the Treasury to make calculated sales or acquisitions as needed. Kimes closed the conversation by noting that if the U.S. starts using crypto reserves the same way it uses oil, it could influence market behavior. Giancarlo agreed. Here’s what we can see: crypto’s not on the sidelines anymore.

2025-06-13T08:53:25,"Bitcoin słabnie, a cena ropy wystrzeliła w związku z napięciami na linii Izrael-Iran","W obliczu eskalacji napięć na Bliskim Wschodzie i gwałtownego wzrostu cen ropy zwiększył się popyt na opcje sprzedaży, kosztem opcji kupna BTC. Jeszcze na początku tygodnia krótkoterminowe prognozy ceny Bitcoina napawały inwestorów optymizmem, kluczowa okazała się jednak nieprzewidywalność i zmienność rynków i sytuacji międzynarodowej. Handlowcy krypto bacznie obserwują rynek i szukają tanich alternatyw, gotowych do eksplozji jeszcze w tym roku. Cena Bitcoina spada – ryzyko masowej wyprzedaży Cena bitcoina spadła do 50-dniowej prostej średniej kroczącej (SMA) na poziomie 104 493 USD, wydłużając 24-godzinne straty do 3,00% (według danych z Coingecko). Ceny na krótko przekroczyły poziom 110 000 USD na początku tego tygodnia – byki mogą mieć nadzieję, że 50-dniowa SMA się utrzyma, ponieważ potencjalny spadek poniżej SMA może zachęcić do większych wyprzedaży (czyli sytuacji, którą zaobserwowano po załamaniu się wsparcia w lutym 2025 r.). W momencie pisania tego tekstu cena baryłki ropy zaczęła spadać i wynosi 72,38 USD. We wczesnych godzinach porannych cena baryłki ropy wynosiła aż 78,4 USD osiągając najwyższy poziom od 16 stycznia 2025 r. Ruch ten nastąpił po tym, jak Izrael przeprowadził ataki powietrzne na Iran, z dużym prawdopodobieństwem ściągając na siebie odwetowe ataki rakietowe ze strony Teheranu. Nadchodzi impuls inflacyjny? Nagłe skoki cen ropy naftowej wywołują impuls inflacyjny, w którym zwiększona cena ropy prowadzi do wzrostu kosztów produkcji i transportu. To z kolei może przyczynić się do ogólnego wzrostu cen w gospodarce. Wzrost cen ropy naftowej ma bezpośredni wpływ na wiele sektorów, w tym na transport, przemysł i rolnictwo. Sytuacja jest o tyle poważna, że wojna handlowa prowadzona już przez prezydenta Donalda Trumpa nieustannie grozi zachwianiem gospodarki i wzrostem inflacji, zwłaszcza w krajach będących importerami netto. Wszystko to może obniżyć oczekiwania dotyczące obniżek stóp procentowych przez Fed, zwiększając zmienność spadkową akcji i kryptowalut. W chwili pisania tego tekstu kontrakty futures powiązane ze S&P 500 spadły o 1,3% w ciągu ostatniej doby. Inwestorzy poszukują alternatywy dla Bitcoina Inwestorzy, niezależnie od tego, czy wierzą w optymistyczne prognozy Bitcoina, czy są co do nich bardziej sceptyczni, chętnie rozglądają się za innymi możliwościami inwestycyjnymi. Najlepiej, jeśli są one dopasowane do indywidualnych możliwości finansowych oraz wykazują się konkretną użytecznością. Dzięki rozwiązaniu problemu ze skalowalnością sieci Bitcoin przez Bitcoin Hyper oraz airdropom bitcoinów w ramach projektu Bitcoin Bull Token , potencjał wzrostu tokenów jest na tyle duży, że nie mógł zostać niezauważony przez łowców okazji przedsprzedażowych. Bitcoin Hyper – wprowadza Layer 2 na Bitcoinie Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) wprowadza pionierską sieć Bitcoin Layer-2, która ma przyspieszyć transakcje na całym blockchainie Bitcoin, zwiększyć skalowalność i otworzyć drogę do nowych możliwości, takich jak natychmiastowe płatności i bardziej funkcjonalne aplikacje zdecentralizowane dApps. Będzie to możliwe dzięki integracji z Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) oraz zdecentralizowanemu Canonical Bridge. Kluczową rolę w ekosystemie pełni token $HYPER, umożliwiając płacenie za transakcje, uczestniczenie w głosowaniach DAO (w przyszłości) oraz korzystanie z aplikacji DeFi. Od razu po zakupie tokenów $HYPER można je przeznaczyć do stakingu, otrzymując roczne nagrody na poziomie do 732% APY. Warto jednak zauważyć, że wysokość APY będzie stopniowo maleć w miarę wzrostu liczby inwestorów. Bitcoin Bull Token – organizuje airdropy BTC Projekt Bitcoin Bull Token jest ściśle powiązany z ruchami ceny Bitcoina. Jego celem jest zapewnienie posiadaczom tokenów realnych zysków związanych z umacnianiem się Bitcoina – kluczowym elementem projektu jest możliwość zdobywania airdropów Bitcoina, gdy cena BTC przekroczy określone poziomy: 150 000 USD, 200 000 USD, 250 000 USD itd. Tuż po zakupie tokenów $BTCBULL można je przeznaczyć do stakingu, który jest nagradzany pasywnymi zwrotami na poziomie APY 57%. Token $BTCBULL ma być też odporny na inflację, dzięki mechanizmowi spalania tokenów. Również w tym przypadku, gdy Bitcoin osiągnie nowe ATH (np. 125 000 USD, 175 000 USD itd.), część tokenów zostanie trwale spalona, co zmniejszy podaż i wpłynie na wzrost wartości pozostałych tokenów.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-slabnie-a-cena-ropy-wystrzelila/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|Poland",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T08:44:09,"Critical Ethereum Report from 21 Industry Experts: Is There Still Hope for ETH?","The largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has been under a lot of criticism for its poor performance against Bitcoin (BTC) and its failure to surpass its previous ATH. Despite this, some analysts stated that they still maintain bullish expectations for Ethereum, while industry experts published a comprehensive report on Ethereum. The report was contributed by 21 notable figures, including Consensys Founder and Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin, Etherealize co-founders Vivek Raman, Danny Ryan and Grant Hummer, and Ether.fi founder and CEO Mike Silagadze. Accordingly, prominent Ethereum supporters argued that ETH was seriously undervalued. Leading Ethereum tech experts and industry figures have argued in their “Bullish Case for ETH” report that ETH is significantly undervalued and has the potential to reach $740,000 per token in the long term. Stating that Ethereum is more than just a store of value, the report said, “ETH is the fuel, collateral and reserve asset that feeds the financial system of the future.” “ETH is the digital oil that powers the financial digital economy. And it is significantly mispriced.” The report noted that ETH secured $767 billion worth of assets, and stated that ETH should be positioned not just as a technology stock, but as a fundamental layer of the on-chain economy. Vivek Raman, co-founder of ETH think tank Etherealize, said that it is correct to compare ETH to global reserve assets such as oil, bonds, or M2 money supply to more accurately reflect Ethereum’s potential. Raman added that the eventual adoption of ETH could rival or even surpass the transformative impact of the internet. “Ethereum is becoming the indispensable asset at the heart of a digitally native financial system. Simply put, ETH is digital oil. Once adopted, it will be as big as the internet, maybe even bigger. At this point, ETH lagging behind BTC is a mispricing, not a structural weakness.” They Focused on Bitcoin, They Overlooked Ethereum! Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin compared Bitcoin to Ethereum, saying: “Institutional investors have been so focused on Bitcoin and its narrative as a store of value that they have overlooked an asset with much greater growth potential. Not only does ETH share the same store of value properties that made Bitcoin popular, it also has a broad utility, offers more predictable scarcity, and provides a steady return, making it the ultimate productive reserve asset. As Ethereum further establishes itself as the backbone of the digital economy, ETH becomes even more indispensable.” *This is not investment advice.

This has triggered widespread sell-offs, and Bitcoin is down 3.5% to $104,209, while major altcoins have fallen between 6% and 9%. Pi Coin has also dropped around 13% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $0.5506. Analyst Dr. Altcoin said that the strike has had a direct impact on Pi and the broader market. He warned that if Iran retaliates, prices could fall even further. Over the past week, Pi is down 11%, and it has lost 56% of its value over the past month. Technical Analysis – Trend Still Bearish The conflict in Iran, combined with delays in the Pi mapping migration in Chinese-speaking regions, could have contributed to the sharp drop. However, this could also be an opportunity to stack Pi at a discount. But Pi coin appears to be in a clear downtrend, due to both macro tensions and technical weakness. Most technical indicators are signaling a sell. It is currently trading below all major short-term and mid-term EMAs and SMAs (from the 10-day to the 100-day range), all of which are signaling sell. The MACD and Momentum indicators also suggest further downside, while the RSI at 32 shows that Pi is nearing the oversold territory. Unless market sentiment improves or strong buying returns, the bearish trend is expected to continue. There have been rising doubts around its valuation model. Dr. Altcoin has dismissed the idea of a Global Consensus Value (GCV) as completely unrealistic, and an “economic impossibility.” Many users expect the Core Team to break its silence on the GCV debate on the upcoming Pi2Day on June 28, 2025, as the Pi open mainnet launch is expected within the same timeframe. Pi Price at Risk of New Lows Analysts warn that without a major update, the price could fall further to $0.40 by late August. But a recovery may follow as token unlocking slows down during the same period, which could reduce selling pressure and help restore investor confidence. If updates on mainnet activation, merchant tools, or GCV clarity are shared, they could reshape how Pi is perceived and valued. A broader crypto market rally could help lift Pi along with other altcoins. Rising social media activity is another positive signal. Furthermore, a possible exchange listing could also trigger a short squeeze similar to what was seen with other coins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-crashes-13-after-israel-strikes-whats-next/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T08:30:00,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin price faces surge toward $108K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $104,808 (-1.7%) Market cap $2.19 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $56.76 Billion (-38%) Circulating supply 19.86 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $108,592.69 24-hour low $102,822 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $104,808 Price Prediction $116,908 (+10.8%) Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Price Volatility 2.2% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $101,295 200-Day SMA $87,277 14-Day RSI 54.42 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin triggered a bearish pressure below $105K. Resistance for BTC is at $111,960 Support for BTC/USD is at $102,519 The BTC price analysis for 13 June confirms that BTC faces a surge in bearish volatility as the price plunged hard below $105K level. Currently, bears are aiming for further declines as selling pressure rises. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price holds below $105K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faced strong bearish pressure as it dropped below $105K. As sellers increase their domination, buyers are struggling to push the price above immediate fib levels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.78 billion, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $104,808, declining by over 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows bearish volatility : 1-day chart The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades above the midline at 48, hinting that further bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the $105K level. Sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below EMA trend lines. Bitcoin aims for further declines The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.8, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $111,960, it will fuel a bullish rally to $115,562. BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $102,519, beginning a bearish trend to $100,331. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure as sellers defended further surges. This plunged the BTC price below $105K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T08:16:10,"Over $1B Liquidated in 24 Hours as Bitcoin Crashes 3.3%, Worst Day in June 2025 – What’s Happening?","Bitcoin experienced its worst single-day performance since June, plummeting 3.3% to $103,556 as Israeli airstrikes on Iran triggered a massive crypto liquidation cascade that destroyed over $1.16 billion in leveraged positions within 24 hours. The selloff began in the early hours before Israeli forces launched Operation Rising Lion , targeting what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as the “heart” of Iran’s nuclear program, including strikes on the Natanz enrichment facility and military infrastructure near Tehran and Tabriz. This unexpected geopolitical war affected global financial markets, with Bitcoin dropping from a 24-hour high of $108,500 as investors fled risk assets amid escalating Middle East tensions. Source: Cryptonews The liquidation data reveals the severity of the market panic, with long positions bearing the brunt of the damage at $1.16 billion compared to just $113.97 million in short liquidations. Source: Coinglass The cascading effect intensified throughout the day, starting with $20 million in liquidations within the first hour and exploding to nearly $1 billion over 12 hours as algorithmic trading systems and leveraged positions were quickly wiped out. Geopolitical Catalyst Exposes Crypto Market Leverage The Israeli strikes, which began around 3:30 AM local time in Tehran, revealed the cryptocurrency market’s dangerous overleverage as what started as a geopolitical war quickly morphed into a technical breakdown. Netanyahu’s announcement that the operation would continue “for as many days as it takes to remove the threat” created sustained uncertainty that prevented any meaningful recovery attempts throughout the trading session. However, if the war escalates, the cryptocurrency as we know it has always served as digital gold during global uncertainty. The speed and magnitude of the decline, amplified by algorithmic trading systems treating crypto as a risk-off asset, quickly shifted sentiment in an already overleveraged market. Iran’s immediate counterattack, launching approximately 100 drones toward Israel while declaring a state of emergency, further amplified market fears and sustained the selling pressure across all major cryptocurrencies. For Instance, ETH is down over 8% from a week high of $2,700 to $2,500. Similarly, XRP has been down 6%, SOL 9%, and Dogecoin 9%, all in the past 24 hours. This indicates that the selloff was indiscriminate across the entire market rather than concentrated in Bitcoin alone. Technical Analysis Reveals Bitcoin Might Dip Further The price action across multiple timeframes revealed that the geopolitical development triggered technical breakdowns that had been building for weeks, suggesting the market was vulnerable to external catalysts. The hourly chart showed Bitcoin breaking decisively below critical support at $106,500, with three distinct rejection points in the supply zone between $109,500 and $110,500 indicating heavy institutional selling pressure. The bearish breakout pushed Bitcoin below the psychological $105,000 level, with the next major demand zone sitting around the round-number $100,000 target. The four-hour analysis also exposed a descending channel pattern constraining Bitcoin since its peak above $112,000. The recent break below the channel’s lower support line signaled an acceleration of the bearish trend. The volume profile showed increased selling activity coinciding with the geopolitical news flow, while the resistance level around $112,000 now appears formidable for any recovery attempts. The technical structure suggests that rallies will likely be met with renewed selling pressure, with the channel breakdown targeting the $100,000-$102,000 demand zone. Most concerning was the Ichimoku rising wedge breakdown on the four-hour timeframe, which revealed Bitcoin trading below the cloud and indicated a shift from bullish to bearish momentum. Rising wedges represent diminishing buying pressure despite higher prices, and the breakdown typically leads to sharp declines with measured move targets around $96,000. This technical objective aligns with previous significant support levels and would represent approximately a 10% decline from current levels, suggesting further downside pressure if geopolitical tensions remain elevated or additional macro factors emerge to pressure risk assets.

2025-06-13T08:11:56,"Single Bitcoin Trader Loses $200M as Crypto Bulls See $1B Liquidations","Crypto bulls took a heavy beating on Thursday with over $1.15 billion in liquidations wiping out leveraged positions across major exchanges, marking one of the bloodiest days for crypto markets in recent months. The largest single liquidation was a bitcoin BTC long position on Binance, valued at $200 million, making it one of the biggest one-off losses in the year so far. It is unclear which trading firm or individual was behind that position, as exchanges don’t make that data public. Data from Coinglass shows over 247,00 traders were liquidated in the 24-hour span. Long traders bore the brunt, accounting for over $1 billion in losses — reflecting overly optimistic positioning after a week of bullish sentiment fueled by Circle’s high-profile IPO and a resurgence in U.S.-focused DeFi narratives. BTC lost more than 3% to trade at $104,700 in Asian afternoon hours, while ether ETH sunk 8% to $2,530. Tokens like solana's SOL SOL and dogecoin DOGE also slid over 8%, while XRP XRP fell to $2.20. Crypto exchanges Binance and Bybit accounted for more than $834 million in liquidated trades, the most among counterparts. Liquidations occur when traders use borrowed funds to bet on asset prices and fail to maintain a sufficient margin to cover their positions. Exchanges then forcibly close positions to prevent further losses, a built-in risk feature that often results in chain reactions during volatile moves.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/13/single-bitcoin-trader-loses-200m-as-crypto-bulls-see-1b-liquidations,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Trading|Top Stories|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T08:10:15,"Bitcoin sees the biggest movement into accumulation wallets","Inflows of Bitcoin into accumulation wallets continue, with no pressure to capitulate or take profits. Buying from wallets with over 10 BTC reached their highest levels in the year to date. Bitcoin accumulation addresses saw rapid inflows in the past few days, despite the price spike. Over 30K BTC were bought up and sent to addresses that were extremely conservative about moving their coins. In total, accumulation addresses absorbed $3.3B, or 30,754 BTC. Currently, accumulation and even occasional buying are absorbing all newly mined coins, while also drawing down the reserves of OTC desks and exchanges. The recent wave of buying continued even at prices above $109,000. Bitcoin is still in accumulation mode, though sinking slightly to $104,578. Accumulation is happening while anticipating a larger rally in 2025, with $120,000 the next target. Accumulation addresses are relatively old, and have an average accumulation price of $64,000. However, newer accumulation addresses are also added, even near peak prices. Based on CryptoQuant data, over 2.91M BTC are now held in accumulation addresses with different ages. In 2025, inflows to accumulation addresses exhibited a higher baseline, with more regular stacking. There is also a growth trend in buying more Bitcoin , as inflows reached peak levels for the year to date. Bitcoin accumulation wallets had higher baseline activity in 2025, recently reaching peak inflows for the year to date. | Source: CryptoQuant The recent data confirms the trend where despite the near-peak valuations, whales are not taking profits. BTC spot markets still show long-term confidence, despite the short-term volatility with derivative trading. The crypto fear and greed index switched to 51 points, signaling a neutral attitude, down from the recent levels of extreme greed. However, spot accumulation can continue under different market conditions. BTC accumulation boosted by the treasury narrative The recent Bitcoin buying is a mix of anonymous whales and high-profile corporate buyers. Previous trends showed retail was hardly active above $90,000 per BTC, with most of the accumulation coming from whales and other large-scale wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC. Corporate buyers and funds can also afford to keep absorbing Bitcoin even near peak prices. Treasuries already contain 3.41M BTC, with active buying from some of the high-profile holders in the past week. Even smaller corporate buyers have taken up to 5,000 BTC off the market in a single day. In the past month, 20 companies added Bitcoin to their public balances, with more announcements and plans to finance Bitcoin acquisitions with debt or equity. The idea of a Bitcoin strategic reserve is also brought back to crypto projects. Recently, the Polkadot community raised a proposal to build a tBTC reserve, buying and holding wrapped coins for the long term. Part of the Bitcoin accumulation may also be due to DeFi protocols and other types of collateral wallets. As Bitcoin becomes more valuable, on-chain activity is slower, while some protocols are offering a way to tap the Bitcoin value without selling. Solana is also becoming one of the venues for wrapped Bitcoin. A total of 4,726 BTC is now held on Solana in the form of tBTC , with 75% growth for the whole of 2025. Additionally, Bitcoin staking and other DeFi protocols are holding up coins with no intention to sell. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The platform enables automated strategies for efficient collateral management in lending and borrowing activities. During the beta testing period, Altitude attracted over $5 million in total value locked (TVL) from whitelisted participants. The platform is designed to help users manage onchain borrowing while maintaining optimal capital efficiency and preventing under-collateralization. Automated rebalancing features Altitude offers automated rebalancing capabilities, adjusting borrowing positions based on collateral price movements for assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). The platform’s dashboard displays loan health metrics based on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios with controls for parameter adjustments. When collateral values increase, Altitude borrows against the assets and uses the capital to generate yield that reduces the loan amount. Conversely, when collateral values decrease, the platform returns funds to lending pools to maintain optimal LTV ratios. The system also identifies favorable lending rates and adjusts positions to secure the most attractive financing terms. Addressing capital efficiency challenges The platform targets capital efficiency issues in DeFi, where users typically borrow at 40-50% LTV ratios, leaving significant capital unused. Beta users have reported improved capital efficiency and reduced complexity in borrowing processes, allowing them to focus on yield generation opportunities. Funding and market positioning Altitude raised $6.1 million in funding from web3 venture capital firms, including Tioga Capital, New Form Capital, and GSR. The platform positions itself as the first DeFi protocol to offer automated rebalancing for borrowing based on collateral price movements. The public launch provides DeFi users access to lending and borrowing activities through an interface that reduces the need for constant position monitoring while enabling yield generation on crypto assets .

Ethereum Has Recently Seen Notable Exchange Outflows As explained by the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) in a new post on X, a large amount of Ethereum has left exchanges. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which measures the net amount of ETH entering into or exiting out of the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the exchanges are receiving a net number of deposits. As one of the main reasons why investors deposit their tokens to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish implication for the ETH price. Related Reading: Tron Has Plenty Of Room For A 2025 Bull Run, Risk Metric Signals On the other hand, the indicator being below zero suggests the exchange outflows outweigh the inflows. Such a trend can imply the holders are accumulating, which can naturally have a bullish effect on the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by Sentora that shows the trend in the Ethereum Exchange Netflow over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Exchange Netflow has seen a sharp negative spike during the past day, which suggests the investors have withdrawn a significant amount of the cryptocurrency. In total, the exchanges have handled net outflows of more than 140,000 ETH (worth about $390 million) with this withdrawal spree. This is the largest single-day exit that these platforms have faced in over a month. These outflows have come as Ethereum has been attempting a breakout from its month-long range. As such, it’s possible that a portion of the large holders of the market have some level of confidence in this rally. In some other news, the cash-margined Ethereum Futures Open Interest has set a new all-time high, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed in an X post. The Futures Open Interest is an indicator that measures the total amount of positions related to Ethereum that are currently open on all derivatives platforms. Here, the ‘cash-margined’ Open Interest is of relevance, which includes all the contracts that have fiat/stablecoins as collateral.

2025-06-13T07:43:35,"Czech Opposition Pushes No-Confidence Vote Over $45M Bitcoin Deal Scandal","The post Czech Opposition Pushes No-Confidence Vote Over $45M Bitcoin Deal Scandal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Czech government is facing strong backlash after it was revealed that nearly $45 million worth of Bitcoin, seized from a convicted criminal, was quietly sold by the Justice Ministry. The sale has now sparked a political storm, leading to the resignation of the justice minister and a call for a no-confidence motion in parliament. $45 Million Bitcoin Scandal The scandal started when the Czech Justice Ministry revealed it had auctioned nearly 500 Bitcoins. These digital assets were seized from Tomas Jirikovsky, an online drug dealer convicted in 2017. He had been in prison from 2017 to 2021 for drug trafficking, fraud, and illegal possession of weapons. While the sale raised approximately 1 billion Czech koruna (about $45 million), the opposition argues that the transaction lacked proper transparency and oversight. Meanwhile, Justice Minister Blazek was criticized for accepting the funds without involving police or prosecutors to verify if the assets were legal, raising concerns about whether the government may have unintentionally legitimized money from criminal sources. Opposition Call For No-Confidence Motion Alena Schillerova, vice chair of the opposition ANO party, called the situation unacceptable. In a recent tweet post , she said there was “no choice” but to file a no-confidence motion, which is now scheduled for Tuesday. ANO is demanding to know who approved the sale, whether the Bitcoin’s origins were legally verified, and if any party improperly benefited. This case highlights the growing need for transparency when governments handle digital assets like Bitcoin. With public trust at stake and elections approaching, how the Czech government responds now could shape its political future. Justice Minister Steps Down As pressure grew, Justice Minister Pavel Blazek resigned on May 30. Although he denied any wrongdoing, he said he was stepping down to protect the government’s image ahead of the October elections. Eva Decroix has stepped in as the new justice minister and has promised an independent probe into the sale. She has also said the ministry will fully cooperate during the investigation. Crypto Scandals Aren’t Just Local This controversy isn’t happening in a vacuum. Around the world, other political leaders are facing similar heat.

Bitcoin continues to dip, testing key support levels; however, while the geopolitical turmoil is sparking a broad “risk-off” move, on-chain data reveals crypto whales seem to be making their next big move. One analyst has listed a few whale-favourite altcoins that could be gearing up for a rally soon. Altcoin 1: Cardano (ADA) In the last few days, whales have bought over $120 million worth of Cardano (ADA), according to whale alert. At the same time, Bloomberg Intelligence raised the chances of a Cardano ETF approval to 75% by 2025.

2025-06-13T07:29:46,"Here’s why WhiteBIT’s WBT hit a new all-time high while the crypto market crashed","WBT, the utility token of the crypto exchange WhiteBIT, emerged as the top-performing coin today, defying the broader bearish market trend triggered by Israel’s attack on Iran earlier today. According to data from crypto.news, WhiteBIT Coin ( WBT ) rallied for the third straight day, hitting a new all-time high of $34.3 on June 13 afternoon Asian time. As of press time, its price has settled at $33.67 with a market cap of $4.85 billion, ranking it as the 33rd among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. WBT retained some of its past day gains as the broader crypto market was reeling from Israel’s launch of a major military attack against Iran early morning on June 13, in response to which Iran has promised to take retaliatory measures of its own. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped about 5% to an intraday low of $103,081, while major altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DO G E ) saw losses between 6%-10%, with crypto liquidations soaring 125% to $1.2 billion in a day. You might also like: Tencent reopens talks to acquire South Korea’s Nexon, a game developer exploring blockchain Why is WBT rallying? One key factor driving WBT’s gains today is its announcement of a spot listing for the HOME token, which powers the DeFi App platform, while also adding a HOME-PERP pair to its futures section, drawing in more traders and boosting volume. WBT also gained investor interest as the exchange teased an upcoming partnership with an undisclosed European football club. On-chain activity further supports the bullish sentiment. Data shows a 580% spike in daily active addresses, a strong sign that more users are interacting with the WhiteBIT ecosystem. Meanwhile, Santiment reported a notable increase in whale accumulation, indicating that large holders are buying up WBT. This kind of activity often signals confidence in the token’s longer-term potential and can amplify price momentum during bullish phases . Source: Santiment At press time, WBT had shed some of its gains but still managed to retain its position as the highest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, with bullish momentum continuing to outweigh broader market selling pressure. WBT price analysis On the 1-day USDT chart, WBT looks to have been forming an ascending broadening wedge pattern since early May, typically a sign of increasing volatility within an uptrend. WBT price, MACD and Aroon chart — June 13 | Source: crypto.news The Aroon Up indicator is currently at 92.86%, while Aroon Down is at 28.57%, showing that bullish momentum is still in play. The MACD lines are also pointing upward, adding to the positive sentiment. If this momentum holds, WBT could climb toward the key psychological level of $35. A clear breakout above that would confirm the bullish pattern and may encourage bulls to aim for $38 next, marking a 13% gain from current prices. On the contrary, if market risk sentiment weakens due to escalating macro tensions, the nearest support level to watch would be around $31, where traders previously stepped in to buy the dip.

2025-06-13T07:18:30,"Crypto Liquidations: $1.14 Billion Wiped Out as Market Faces Double Attack?","The post Crypto Liquidations: $1.14 Billion Wiped Out as Market Faces Double Attack? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has witnessed a steep fall. The prime reason for this is the war tensions between Israel and Iran. The dispute escalated again as Israel launched an air strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities on June 13. Moreover, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest inflation report refused hopes for any interest rate cuts in June. This dual pressure from geopolitics and monetary policy has sent shockwaves through the market, leading to over $1.14 billion in liquidations. As crypto traders took the brunt, many sought refuge in safer assets like gold, with PAX Gold and Tether Gold among the rare green tokens in a sea of red. $1.14 Billion Worth Liquidation Hits Traders In the past 24 hours, 246,590 traders have been liquidated, which highlights a severe slash across the derivatives market. The total liquidations as of press time have spiked to $1.14 billion, emphasizing the intense volatility triggered by the external factors. Source: CoinGlass The single largest liquidation was registered on Binance’s BTC/USDT pair, wiping out a jaw-dropping $201.31 million in one go. Binance accounted for the largest share overall, registering $455.60M, Bybit followed next with $370.83M, and OKX with $125.58M. Bitcoin and Ethereum took the major brunt among cryptocurrencies, with $443.77M and $289.96M, respectively, in liquidation volume. Other altcoins, such as SOL, saw $51.95M, and DOGE took $25.61M in liquidations. Source: CoinGlass Where Is the Crypto Market Heading? At the time of press, the total market cap of the industry stands at $3.37 trillion, down 2.51%, while 24-hour trading volume is down 4.77% at $129.97 billion. The Fear & Greed Index remains at a greed-driven score of 61, which is expected to come lower as the day passes. Bitcoin presently trades 3.12% lower at $104,437.94, while Ethereum has taken a bigger hit, down 8.85% at $2,517.03. Major altcoins also faced pressure, with XRP at a 5.47% loss to $2.12 and SOL down 9.74% to $144.33. With BTC dominance at 63.2% and ETH at 9.8%, the market remains heavily reliant on Bitcoin’s resilience. However, unless geopolitical risks settle and macroeconomic stability returns, further downside could be in store.

According to data from Deribit, the contracts, scheduled to expire at 08:00 UTC, represent one of the largest expiries this quarter. The open interest includes nearly equal amounts of calls and puts, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.95. This suggests a slightly bullish bias, though the current spot price, hovering around $104,000, sits well below the max pain point of $107,000. 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $3.7B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $3.04B notional | Put-Call: 0.95 | Max Pain: $107K $ETH : $687M notional | Put-Call: 1.20 | Max Pain: $2,700 ETH upside flows are strong heading into expiry. Will… pic.twitter.com/kLHnzspiXE — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) June 12, 2025 The max pain level is where option holders feel the most financial loss and often acts as a magnetic level in the final trading hours before expiry. Ethereum ( ETH ) options worth $678 million are also due to expire. Unlike Bitcoin ( BTC ), ETH’s put-to-call ratio sits at a more bearish 1.23, reflecting traders hedging downside risk after recent declines. Options are derivative contracts that grant traders the right, but not the obligation, to purchase (call) or sell (put) an asset at a fixed price. Spot prices may be impacted as traders unwind hedges or roll positions when large volumes of options expire. During these times, price frequently moves toward the maximum pain level, particularly in markets with low volume. Read more: Dow, Nasdaq up 0.24%, S&P gains 0.38% on rate cut expectation The current expiry coincides with pressure on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has dropped 7% to $3.3 trillion, and Bitcoin has lost over 5% in the last day. Analysts point to Israel’s attack on Iran as the cause of the macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is beginning to show early signs of a trend shift. The price has slipped below the 20-day moving average, which is often used to predict short-term direction. A decline in bullish momentum is indicated by the relative strength index’s trend below the neutral 50 mark. Although volume has slightly increased, it is still insufficient to validate a complete bearish breakdown. BTC price analysis. Credit: crypto.news A short squeeze might be triggered if Bitcoin maintains above $101,000 and recovers $105,000 before expiration, which could push the price back toward $107,000, the maximum pain level and important resistance. Further declines could be possible if there is a clear break below $101,000, with $97,800 and $95,000 serving as potential support levels. A decline through those areas might signal a more significant correction.

While the world’s largest asset manager hasn’t made any official move yet, Geraci says BlackRock is unlikely to sit back and watch others dominate this next wave of crypto ETFs. Btw, I still fully expect BlackRock to file for spot sol & xrp ETFs… As leader in both spot btc & eth ETFs, it would make *zero* sense to cede other top crypto asset ETF categories to competitors. Related, I also fully expect BlackRock to file for index-based crypto asset ETF. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 12, 2025 BlackRock Could Make a Move Soon, Will it be XRP or SOL? Geraci believes that with BlackRock already leading the charge in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , it won’t want to miss out on the next big opportunity, XRP or Solana. In his view, XRP is now better positioned thanks to recent legal clarity and the launch of regulated XRP futures on the CME . These futures contracts, he says, are often a key step before spot ETFs are filed. He even suggested that the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which already holds XRP, could be turned into a full-fledged ETF. Interestingly, Polymarket shows higher approval odds for SOL—XRP at 87%, Solana at 90%. Get ready for a potential Alt Coin ETF Summer with Solana likely leading the way (as well as some basket products) via @JSeyff note this morning which includes fresh odds for all the spot ETFs. pic.twitter.com/UMzih4oou7 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 10, 2025 Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas hinted at a possible “ Altcoin ETF Summer ,” suggesting that Solana could lead the charge in upcoming altcoin ETFs. He shared insights from fellow analyst James Seyffart’s latest note, which includes updated odds for various spot ETF approvals. The post points to growing optimism around both individual altcoin ETFs and broader crypto basket products gaining traction soon. Why the Hold-Up? Despite the growing momentum, BlackRock remains focused on its two crypto products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust and the iShares Ethereum Trust, which have both seen strong performance. Last year, BlackRock’s ETF head, Samara Cohen, mentioned that only Bitcoin and Ethereum met their standards for liquidity and maturity. It’s unclear whether that stance has evolved since XRP’s legal status has become clearer. Still, regulatory uncertainty remains. Ripple and the SEC are awaiting final approval of their settlement, and XRP’s futures market is still developing compared to BTC and ETH. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For June 13 , XRP ETF Filings Piling Up While BlackRock watches from the sidelines, other major players are taking the lead.

The regulator recently extended its review period for 21Shares’ ETF to October and has yet to respond to Grayscale’s filing from May.

2025-06-13T07:10:16,"Three Reasons Why Bitcoin Could Hit $200k By The End of 2025","The post Three Reasons Why Bitcoin Could Hit $200k By The End of 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is currently trading below $104,000, down about 4% in the last 24 hours. The drop came after Israel launched an attack on Iranian nuclear sites on June 12, causing Bitcoin to fall from $107,000 to $103,000. In just one day, around $636 million was liquidated from the market. Now, there are tensions about Bitcoin slipping further to $102,000 or even $101,000. Despite this bearish trend, many analysts still believe Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of the year . But the big question is — how will Bitcoin achieve this, and what are the key reasons behind such a massive prediction? Why Bitcoin Could Hit $200k By The Year End? In a recent episode , Scott Melker discussed with Alice Liu from CoinMarketCap strong reasons why Bitcoin could rally to $200,000 soon. Liu said, “Crypto market is the golden moment. You need a catalyst like this to trigger people in non-crypto space to look at this.” Big Companies Are Buying Bitcoin: Companies and institutions from the U.S., Europe, Japan, and other regions are adding Bitcoin to their corporate treasury reserves . This rising demand from businesses is putting extra buying pressure on the market while supply stays limited, especially after the recent Bitcoin halving . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Israel-Iran Conflict Triggers Crypto Crash: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices Plunge Hard , Supply Is Drying Up : Bitcoin miners are currently selling very little into the market, averaging only around 500 BTC a day. With more people and companies wanting to buy and less Bitcoin available, this supply-demand imbalance naturally pushes the price higher. Bitcoin Is Seen as Digital Gold: More investors now view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, much like gold. Large funds, corporate treasuries, and even some governments are considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This confidence is helping to build a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s next major price surge. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin is down today, June 13, 2025, primarily due to increased geopolitical tensions following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. This triggered a broader market sell-off and risk-off sentiment among investors. How does institutional buying influence Bitcoin’s price? Big companies and institutions buying Bitcoin for their corporate treasury reserves create significant buying pressure, pushing the price higher as supply remains constrained. How does Bitcoin’s supply affect its price potential? Bitcoin’s limited supply, especially with miners selling very little (around 500 BTC/day) after the halving, creates a supply-demand imbalance that naturally drives its price up.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/three-reasons-why-bitcoin-could-hit-200k-by-the-end-of-2025/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T07:10:12,"Surge: Ethereum ETF Inflows Mirror Bitcoin ETF Trajectory","BitcoinWorld Surge: Ethereum ETF Inflows Mirror Bitcoin ETF Trajectory Are we witnessing history repeat itself? The recent performance of Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) suggests a pattern remarkably similar to the groundbreaking launch and subsequent activity of Bitcoin ETFs. This trend is capturing significant attention in the crypto market, indicating growing institutional and retail interest in Ethereum as an investable asset class. Understanding the Dynamics of Ethereum ETF Inflows Recent analysis highlights a compelling comparison: the flow of funds into Ethereum (ETH) ETFs appears to be tracking the path previously blazed by Bitcoin ETFs, particularly when accounting for the difference in their respective market capitalizations. This isn’t just a casual observation; data points are reinforcing this narrative. For instance, on June 11th, U.S. spot ETH ETF products recorded a substantial net inflow totaling approximately $240 million. This figure represents the second-largest single-day inflow observed since these products began trading. More significantly, these ETH ETFs have demonstrated remarkable consistency, maintaining a trend of net inflows for 18 consecutive days. This sustained positive flow is a key indicator of robust demand. Comparing this to the initial phases of Bitcoin ETF trading, we see parallels in investor behavior and capital allocation. While the absolute dollar amounts might differ due to Bitcoin’s larger market size, the proportional interest relative to the asset’s valuation appears strikingly similar. This suggests that the investment thesis for allocating capital via regulated ETF structures is extending beyond Bitcoin to Ethereum. How Do Ethereum ETF Inflows Compare to Bitcoin ETF Trends? The comparison between Ethereum ETF inflows and Bitcoin ETF trends is crucial for understanding the maturing crypto investment landscape. When Bitcoin spot ETFs launched in the U.S. in January 2024, they saw unprecedented trading volume and significant initial inflows, albeit offset initially by outflows from older Grayscale products. However, the net trend quickly turned positive and remained strong for extended periods. Here’s a breakdown of the comparison points: Relative Scale: While Bitcoin’s market cap is significantly larger than Ethereum’s, the inflow amounts into ETH ETFs, when adjusted for this difference, show a comparable level of investor enthusiasm and capital deployment relative to the asset’s size. Sustained Inflows: Both asset classes have demonstrated periods of sustained net inflows into their ETF products after launch, indicating persistent buying pressure rather than just initial speculative interest. The 18 consecutive days of ETH ETF inflows is a strong signal mirroring similar streaks seen with Bitcoin ETFs. Market Impact: Both types of ETFs provide regulated, accessible avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure. Their inflows directly impact the underlying asset’s price dynamics by increasing demand for the spot asset held by the fund issuers. Investor Base: The investor base for both appears to be a mix of retail gaining easy access through brokerage accounts and institutions seeking regulated exposure without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. This similarity suggests that the regulatory approval and accessibility provided by the ETF structure are powerful drivers of adoption for major cryptocurrencies. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Growing Crypto ETF Popularity? The increasing popularity and inflows into both Ethereum ETF and Bitcoin ETF products bring several benefits and challenges to the forefront of the financial and crypto markets. Benefits: Increased Accessibility: ETFs make investing in crypto as easy as buying stocks through traditional brokerage accounts, opening the market to a much wider audience. Regulatory Clarity: Operating within regulated frameworks provides investors with greater confidence and protection compared to unregulated crypto exchanges. Institutional Adoption: ETFs are familiar vehicles for large institutions, facilitating their entry into the crypto space and potentially bringing significant capital. Price Discovery & Liquidity: Increased trading volume and interest can improve price discovery and add liquidity to the underlying assets. Challenges: Centralization Risk: A large portion of the asset supply being held by a few ETF issuers could introduce centralization risks. Market Volatility: While ETFs offer exposure, they don’t shield investors from the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies. Fee Structures: Investors pay management fees for ETFs, which can erode returns over time compared to direct ownership (though direct ownership has its own costs and risks). Potential for Market Manipulation: While regulated, large flows in and out of ETFs could potentially influence market dynamics. Despite the challenges, the overall trend of increasing ETF inflows is widely seen as a net positive for the long-term growth and legitimization of the crypto asset class. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching the development of ETH ETF and BTC ETF markets, the current trends offer several actionable insights: Monitor Inflow Trends: Consistent net inflows indicate strong buying pressure, which can be a bullish signal for the underlying asset price. Keep an eye on daily inflow data reported by financial news outlets. Understand the Correlation: Recognize that the success of Bitcoin ETFs has paved the way and set expectations for Ethereum ETFs. Their performance may continue to show correlated patterns. Evaluate Your Investment Goals: Determine if gaining crypto exposure through a regulated ETF aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy compared to direct ownership. Consider Diversification: The emergence of ETH ETFs alongside Bitcoin ETFs provides options for diversification within the crypto segment of a portfolio using traditional investment vehicles. Stay Informed on Regulations: The regulatory landscape for crypto and crypto-adjacent products is still evolving. Stay updated on any changes that could impact ETFs. The data on ETH ETF inflows suggests that Ethereum is following Bitcoin’s lead in attracting significant investment via regulated products. This trajectory could have substantial implications for ETH’s price and its position within the broader financial ecosystem. Concluding Thoughts on the Future of Crypto ETF Investment The recent surge in Ethereum ETF inflows, mirroring the earlier success of Bitcoin ETFs, underscores a pivotal moment for the digital asset market. It signals growing confidence from traditional investors and provides further validation of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment assets. As these regulated products gain traction, they are likely to continue bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain, potentially unlocking even greater capital flows into the space.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz. As AI narratives gain traction, many are intrigued to know, “What does the future hold for Worldcoin?” or “Could WLD stage a comeback?” Let’s delve into the anticipated Worldcoin price predictions for 2025 to 2030 and the years to come Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency WorldCoin WDC Token WDC Price $ 0.00349731 -10.28% Market Cap $ 0.00 Circulating Supply 0.00 Trading Volume $ 5.1958 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Q2 2025 price action for Worldcoin (WLD) clearly showed signs of exhaustion before it could push higher. Despite recent optimism, its inability to establish a sustained, long-term bullish trend remains evident. Looking at its historical performance, the recent Q2’s gains appear modest, like a mere bucket of water from a deep well. Since early 2024, WLD is still down over 80% from its highs, even with the latest price surge. The entire weekly price action on the Binance exchange resembles a converging price action structure in a falling channel. This pattern has given good returns when a catalyst shoots a breakout from this range. Many are now asking: What could truly push Worldcoin higher? As seen time and again in the crypto space, social sentiment is often the key driver. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly enhance Worldcoin’s perceived value. The recent investment marks a crucial first step in that direction. If, in the coming sessions, optimistic momentum builds up, then WLD must achieve a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure by breaking above the $2.12 level in May or June. Once this level is cleared and a ChoCh is confirmed, Worldcoin could break out of its bearish pattern and potentially retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, if WLD fails to maintain a bullish trajectory this year, its price could drop as low as $1.10.

In a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the Virginia-based McLean Mortgage Corporation says it has discovered a significant cybersecurity incident impacting 30,453 people. “On October 17, 2024, McLean identified suspicious activity within its digital systems. Upon learning of this activity, McLean immediately took steps to secure the network and engaged digital forensics specialists to investigate what happened and help determine whether any sensitive information may have been impacted.” The company says an internal investigation revealed that an unknown entity gained unauthorized access “to its network and may have downloaded certain files” that contained individuals’ personal information, including first and last name, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and financial account numbers. The firm says it has reported the data breach to federal law enforcement and provided “written notice of this incident to relevant state regulators, as necessary.” McLean Mortgage Corporation provides real estate mortgage services as well as advice on purchasing a home, loan first pre-approval and new construction. The firm says it issued letters of notice to affected individuals while offering a 12-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection service.

It sits at about $2 trillion in market value. That’s just 0.2% of roughly $1 quadrillion held across all assets. For many investors, that number brings a sense of how early this market really is. Yet, it also raises questions about what comes next for this highly talked-about coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Global Wealth Distribution Real estate holds the biggest slice of that $1 quadrillion pie. At around $370 trillion, it represents 37% of total global wealth. Bonds follow close behind with $318 trillion. Those are seen as a safe choice for retirees and conservative funds. Stocks, meanwhile, sit at $135 trillion. Cash and bank deposits add another almost $130 trillion to the mix. These numbers show where most of the world’s money lives today. There is $1000 TRILLION of global wealth. Bitcoin is only $2T… Bitcoin is only 0.2% of global wealth, and there will only ever be 21M bitcoins.

Chart: @Croesus_BTC pic.twitter.com/gjju41MMGm — Walker⚡️ (@WalkerAmerica) June 11, 2025 Bitcoin’s Market Share Bitcoin’s $2 trillion value looks small next to these giants. It comes in below art, cars and collectibles, which together amount to $27 trillion. Gold, long a trusted store of value, sits at $22 trillion. So, while Bitcoin is rare by design, it still trails behind assets with centuries of history and deep pockets on the buying side. Scarcity Fuels Price Talk With only 21 million coins ever to be mined, Bitcoin’s supply cap is fixed. That has led to forecasts of big price jumps if demand keeps growing. Based on reports, some say Bitcoin could match gold’s $22 trillion market cap one day. That would push a single coin past $1.15 million. Other backers warn that missing out now could mean buying in later at much higher levels, driven by FOMO—fear of missing out.

It was particularly noteworthy that despite the rising prices of Bitcoin, investors did not see the expected increase in profit taking. Commenting on the profit realization ratio (SOPR) obtained from on-chain data, Alphractal said: “This is surprising. Normally, when prices rise, the profit-taking rate increases and peaks at each new price level. However, right now, although the Bitcoin price is rising, profit-taking is not keeping pace. On the contrary, it is falling. This tells us that investors still see $100,000 as cheap.” Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson drew attention to two important metrics that stand out on technical analysis screens: “The vast majority of altcoins are still in the bearish zone on the 24-hour timeframe, with the MACD indicator. On the other hand, according to the weekly RSI data, some coins are in the overbought zone: TRX, SPX, XMR, GT, and even BTC. In contrast, the coin with the lowest RSI in the oversold zone is CTK, followed by Melania.” Related News: BREAKING: Company that Previously Announced Plans to Purchase $1 Billion of This Altcoin Withdraws Application Wedson drew particular attention to one altcoin in the market: “RENDER is in oversold territory and the increase in open interest on the 5-minute to 1-hour timeframe suggests that whales are long.” *This is not investment advice.

The recent air strikes by Israel on Iran have created geopolitical pressure, which has intensified the sell-offs. Meanwhile, the BTC price and the entire market have witnessed numerous pressures like these in the recent past and hence are believed to withstand the ongoing sell-off and turn out victorious soon. The crypto markets witnessed over $1.1 billion in liquidations, while S&P 500 futures fell 1.9% and crude oil & Gold surged. Meanwhile, from the technical point of view, the BTC chart pattern shows some worrying patterns that point towards more downside. The token printed 3 consecutive daily bearish candles and wiped out the gains incurred earlier this week. With this, the token has reached a crucial level where a rebound could trigger a strong upswing, while a pullback could cause some concerns. The daily chart of Bitcoin shows the formation of an inverse head and shoulder pattern, which is largely considered bullish. However, to validate the price, it is required to trigger a rebound from the lower support and rise along the curve to reach the neckline at around $110,500. If this happens, then the price is more likely to breach the neckline and form a new ATH. However, the technicians suggest a diverse price action showing the possibility of a pullback while the volume continues to drop. The CMF has dropped below 0, suggesting an outflow of money or sell-off, while the RSI is maintaining a steep descending trend. With this, the RSI has reached the ascending support, and hence a drop below the levels could initiate a fresh bearish trend, leading the price lower. To prevent excess drain, probably close to $100K or below, a daily close above the current levels is required, which may hinder the momentum of bears and eventually offer room for a consolidated ascending trend. Therefore, the upcoming weekly close could have a huge impact on the next Bitcoin (BTC) price rally.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-btc-tests-critical-support-amid-geopolitical-uncertainty-will-it-rebound-to-105k-or-drop-to-102k/,"BTC|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T06:33:33,"Fact Check: Is Ripple Dumping XRP Every Month?","The post Fact Check: Is Ripple Dumping XRP Every Month? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Each month, Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP from escrow , and this routine action often fuels rumors of a price dump. But is Ripple flooding the market? According to crypto analyst Vincent Van Code , the truth behind Ripple’s escrow system is far less dramatic—and far more strategic. How Ripple’s Monthly XRP Escrow Works Ripple uses a pre-programmed escrow system built into the XRP Ledger. Every month, 1 billion XRP is unlocked, but only a small portion enters the market . Vincent Van Code explains that more than 80% of the XRP is re-locked into new escrows immediately. The remaining XRP, typically 10% to 20%, is allocated to Ripple’s operational expenses, liquidity needs, and strategic partnerships. This method prevents sudden supply shocks and ensures long-term sustainability. Where Does the Unlocked XRP Go? The XRP that gets re-locked is placed into new time-locked escrows on the blockchain. These are not held by Ripple directly but governed by the XRP Ledger’s built-in escrow protocol. This design ensures XRP cannot be accessed or sold prematurely , eliminating concerns over sudden large-scale dumps. XRP’s Role in Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity System Ripple uses XRP to power its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, enabling fast and low-cost international transactions. When financial institutions use ODL, they convert fiat into XRP, transfer it across borders, and then convert it back into local currency—all within seconds. This use case means the XRP is not held for speculation; it is rapidly bought and sold to complete real transactions. As a result, it has minimal impact on long-term price movements. Ripple’s Sales Are a Small Fraction of Market Volume Van Code also points out that Ripple’s XRP sales represent less than 1% of daily market volume. Given the 24-hour volume exceeding $212 billion, the idea that Ripple is crashing the price through these sales doesn’t hold up. Factors like Bitcoin price , regulatory news, and institutional activity play a far greater role in market movements. He adds that if Ripple had been trying to dump XRP, the market would have reacted much more severely by now. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For June 13 , XRP Market Performance in 2025 Despite market volatility, XRP has outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum , showing a 335.1% annual gain. Here’s how XRP has moved in 2025: January: +46% February: -29.3% March: -2.52% April: +4.98% May: -0.80% June (so far): -2.38% Last 7 Days: -0.8% Last 24 Hours: -6.1% While short-term corrections exist, XRP’s long-term growth and expanding real-world use case remain promising. Fact Check: Is Ripple Dumping XRP? No, Ripple is not dumping XRP. Ripple does unlock 1 billion XRP each month, but over 80% is re-locked into new escrow contracts. Only 10–20% is used for operations and liquidity, mostly powering On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) transactions—not for market dumping. The XRP Ledger ensures this process is transparent and time-locked. Ripple’s sales make up less than 1% of daily volume, so claims of price manipulation are false. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-13T06:30:24,"Missed Litecoin’s Peak? Qubetics Could Be the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy Heading Into 2025","In 2011, Litecoin ($LTC) entered the crypto industry with a modest launch price of around $0.30. Back then, few believed it could hold a candle to Bitcoin, let alone go on to command a value above $80 in 2025 with a market cap in the billions. Those who took early positions in Litecoin now sit on massive gains. But for many others, the regret of missing out on that early entry remains sharp. The question echoing across crypto circles today is: where’s the next Litecoin-level opportunity hiding, is it Qubetics ? Crypto’s track record of life-changing returns has triggered waves of new buyers in search of the next high-potential digital asset. As the market matures and more capital flows into real-world utility tokens, attention is quickly shifting from legacy coins to next-generation projects. Among these, Qubetics ($TICS) is now standing out as a popular crypto coin to buy in 2025—especially for those looking for functionality, innovation, and long-term value. Qubetics ($TICS), with its strong utility focus and fast-rising momentum, is emerging as a leading contender. Qubetics ($TICS) – Building Beyond Hype with Real Utility Unlike many speculative tokens, Qubetics has grounded its momentum in something substantial: its Decentralized VPN. While data privacy becomes a growing concern across the globe, Qubetics offers a real-world solution for individuals and businesses looking to navigate online environments securely, free from centralised control or surveillance. Its blockchain-powered VPN eliminates the need for centralised servers, meaning that no single authority can track or compromise a user’s online activity. For a small business handling sensitive client data, this solution offers a non-negotiable upgrade in security. A professional dealing with high-stakes contracts or intellectual property can access confidential material from any location without fear of interception. Even average users—content creators, gamers, remote workers—stand to benefit from faster, private connections routed through decentralized nodes rather than legacy VPN providers who might store logs or share user data. And that’s just one pillar of the Qubetics infrastructure. It’s not just about offering anonymity; it’s about putting digital control back into the hands of the people—where it belongs. Qubetics is currently in the 37th and final public stage of its crypto presale . So far, over 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 27,800 holders, raising more than $17.9 million. Tokens are priced at $0.3370, but the moment the presale ends, that price jumps to $0.40 with a 20% uptick. But the value here goes well beyond that initial bump. Following a sharp tokenomics overhaul, Qubetics reduced its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, instantly increasing token scarcity. Moreover, 38.55% of the total supply is now earmarked for public distribution, meaning decentralized control is more than a promise—it’s protocol-deep. Analysts are already noting the potential upside. If $TICS hits $5 post-listing, an $18,000 investment at the current presale rate would be worth over $266,000. Should the token reach $10 or $15 post-mainnet—as several credible forecasts now suggest—that same investment could skyrocket to $532,000 or even $798,000. Utility, timing, and architecture—that’s what separates Qubetics from typical presale projects. It’s not just another altcoin vying for visibility; it’s an ecosystem crafted for long-term relevance. With momentum accelerating and scarcity increasing, Qubetics isn’t just worth watching, it’s a project worth backing. Litecoin ($LTC): The One That Got Away for Many Litecoin has earned its spot in the pantheon of legacy crypto assets. Known as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” it brought faster transaction speeds and a more accessible mining algorithm to the table at a time when Bitcoin was starting to scale. It didn’t promise the moon—but over time, it quietly delivered. What started at $0.30 ballooned over the years. Its network upgrades, such as the integration of the Lightning Network and MimbleWimble privacy features, strengthened its case as a reliable and private digital cash alternative. Litecoin’s longevity alone is a testament to its architecture and adaptability. But while $LTC remains a respected name in crypto, it no longer offers the same exponential growth upside as it once did. The ship has largely sailed for those looking to make outsized returns from a low entry point. For backers hunting for the next standout with a strong use case and a timely entry price, Litecoin today doesn’t hold the same allure it once did. Legacy matters. Stability matters. And for those seeking a hedge with historical relevance, Litecoin continues to be a dependable choice. It may not 10x from here, but it remains a key part of the broader crypto ecosystem. However, for those who missed Litecoin’s prime, Qubetics may now be the next best option—and in many ways, a more innovative one. Final Thoughts – Which is One Of The Popular Crypto Coins To Buy? Based on current market dynamics and performance metrics, Qubetics stands out as the popular crypto coin to buy in today’s fast-shifting blockchain space. While Litecoin proved its worth and brought in major returns to early adopters, Qubetics is creating a new category altogether—built on decentralized privacy tools and public-first tokenomics. With less than 10 million tokens left in its presale, the window is closing. Those looking to position themselves for the next cycle may want to take a long, hard look at what Qubetics is building. Because in a space where timing and utility rule, $TICS might just be the rare blend of both.
