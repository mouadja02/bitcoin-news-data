2025-06-13T19:44:47,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Hit Hard by Geopolitical Tensions: Binance Funding Rates Signal Deep Bearish Shift","In the early hours of Friday, June 13th, the cryptocurrency market faced intense downward pressure following a surprise military strike by Israel on Iran. The geopolitical shock sent global risk assets tumbling, with Ethereum (ETH) experiencing a sharp drop below the crucial $2,600 support level. Geopolitical Shock According to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant, this sudden plunge triggered a cascade of long liquidations on Binance, where data from liquidation heatmaps revealed concentrated wipeouts in the $2,650-$2,430 range. Many traders had opened long positions at around $2,800, expecting continued upside, only to be caught off guard by the sell-off. As prices fell through key levels, stop-losses and liquidation orders were triggered en masse, which resulted in a rapid flush of overleveraged positions. Bitcoin also felt the impact, as Binance’s funding rates for BTC perpetual contracts fell to deeply negative levels not seen since June 8. This drop in funding rates reflects a market-wide shift in sentiment, which means that traders are now heavily shorting BTC amid fears of continued downside. The panic-driven trading behavior suggests extreme caution across crypto markets, and derivatives data are pointing to increased bearish expectations. However, the aggressive liquidation of ETH longs and the return of negative BTC funding rates may indicate an overly pessimistic market stance. Such conditions often precede a potential price rebound, as excessive leverage is cleared out and markets stabilize. While uncertainty remains high due to the geopolitical backdrop, the removal of speculative build-up could create a healthier setup for recovery. Flight to Safety Grips Markets In a note released Friday, QCP Capital also echoed these concerns and stated that the digital asset complex remains tightly tethered to geopolitical tail risks, and markets now appear to be poised to trade “headline to headline.” Bitcoin fell around 3% while Ethereum posted a sharper 9% drop, as risk sentiment evaporated across Asia and safe-haven assets like oil and gold surged. Interestingly, crypto volatility spiked, with front-end BTC risk reversals flipping decisively in favor of puts, which indicated a sharp rise in demand for downside protection. While over $1 billion in long liquidations rattled major crypto assets, Bitcoin’s relatively muted decline indicated underlying institutional support. However, the firm warned that any escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict could threaten oil supply corridors and add to inflationary pressure, thereby complicating the Fed’s rate trajectory. Exacerbating the uncertainty, a widespread internet outage involving Google Cloud and Cloudflare added further stress to equities and tech-linked crypto sentiment. With Tehran’s response pending, the outlook for crypto remains fragile, which is currently not shaped by fundamentals but by geopolitical volatility and macro headline flow.

2025-06-13T19:41:22,"Whales scoop up Bitcoin while retail traders grow bearish","Whales are buying up BTC during periods when retail traders express bearish sentiment. Institutions, whales and other large-scale buyers keep shaking down retail, taking signs from social media. Retail sentiment on BTC goes counter to the inflows of smart money. Based on Sentiment data, social media chatter often signals bearish attitudes among retail buyers. Santiment tracked messaging across X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, BitcoinTalk, and Farcaster, seeking out the mention of extremely low predictions below $70K, as well as bullish predictions for a rally above $120K. According to Santiment, the peak signal arrived around the time of the April 8 price crash, where retail predicted a fall to $70K. Whales and institutions only accelerated their buying. Since May, BTC has also exhibited a signal of predominant market takers , indicating a domination of buying demand. For the second time since 2022 market takers have continued buying up coins during a rally, showing peak exuberance. Previous periods of market taker activity happened at lower price ranges, with more conservative accumulation. This time, buyers are still highly active near peak valuations. Most of the sellers originated from the wallet cohort that held for 3-6 months, based on the hodl waves indicator. Experienced traders often choose a dual strategy of holding and trading to accumulate more BTC. Overall, no holders are pressured to sell, as over 98% of addresses are in profit, and long-term accumulators and miners have a much lower average entry price. Whales still accumulate at any price range The latest episode of bearish predictions lasted from June 4 to June 6, when BTC fell to just above $101,000. During that time, bear-posting accelerated, predicting another dip to a lower range. Despite the temporary price drop, accumulation from whales and large-scale wallets did not skip a beat, with near-peak inflows . Even during the recent sideways trading around $104,000, crowd sentiment remains bearish, while smart money is bullish on BTC. $BTC Sentiment CROWD = Bearish 🟥 MP = Bullish 🟩 Check out sentiment and other crypto stats at https://t.co/HQDyBNuzek pic.twitter.com/aOm2ImXyvk — Market Prophit (@MarketProphit) June 13, 2025 Retail traders have often heard the adage of not selling their coins to whales, ETFs or institutions. However, the ability to realize profits at a higher price was appealing to retail and their share of holdings decreased. The ratio of retail to whale holdings has been sliding in most of 2025, from 2.1 points to 2.0 points. The ratio has been rising in all of the history of BTC, since institutions only arrived in the past two years. BTC retail holders gradually declined in 2025, with the balance shifting toward institutions and whale buyers. | Source: MacroMicro The addition of corporate treasuries further added buyers capable of mopping up all newly mined BTC. Institutions and buyers with borrowed funds can afford to risk even near the price top, while retailers are more wary due to crashes from the previous bull cycles. The current bull cycle also looks different, with a more gradual BTC price expansion. At the same time, the types of investors are shifting, and BTC continues to change hands. Retail traders are also wary of overall demand, as institutional buying and ETF demand have also reversed. During some of the rallies, whales also sold BTC for profit and re-bought lower. Profit-taking was only slower during the latest rally above $109,000. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Based on the agreement, the real estate platform-turned Solana treasury company will have the right—but not the obligation—to sell up to $5 billion in shares to stock up on the altcoin . 1/ Today, we announce that DeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: $DFDV ) has secured a $5 BILLION equity line. This gives DFDV the flexibility to raise capital when it’s most strategic, fueling continued accumulation of $SOL and accelerating growth in $SOL Per Share (SPS). pic.twitter.com/3ep3QxuRTT — DeFi Dev Corp. (@defidevcorp) June 12, 2025 The purchase is set to have a trickle effect, opting to “raise capital gradually, when it’s strategically advantageous, rather than locking in one-time pricing during volatile markets.” However, accumulation could begin sooner rather than later. With Solana still trading 50% below its February all-time highs, current levels may offer a compelling entry point. With a recent SEC request for SOL ETF issuers to submit amended S-1 filings within a week, putting approval on track for July, the doors may soon open to inflows from traditional markets. Solana Price Analysis: Could Institutional Demand Push a New SOL High? Demand from traditional investment markets could give Solana the push it needs to break out of a massive cup-and-handle pattern forming since 2021. The Solana price currently trades within the descending channel forming the handle, with its last upward attempt falling short, it remains locked in a downtrend. SOL / USDT 1-week chart, 2021 cup-and-handle pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. That said, with potential support at the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level—a zone typically viewed as a prime accumulation range—$140 could prove a potential bottom for the next leg up. This level also aligns with the lower support of a smaller ascending channel forming since the mid-April market bottom. A bounce here would affirm the structure and establish a key confluence zone for a breakout attempt. In the weakest bullish scenario, a confirmed cup-and-handle breakout projects a technical target of $430, in line with the 3.618 Fibbonaci level—a 128% gain from current levels. While momentum indicators have weakened, they have yet to flip decidedly bearish. The MACD line still holds a narrow lead above the signal line, and the RSI has stalled just below neutral at 45. While their current downtrends are both indicative of building bearish momenumn, the balance remains delicate. Neither buyers nor sellers have full control. A potential SOL ETF approval in July—and the institutional demand it may unlock—could tip the scales in favor of a bullish continuation. $ETH Staking ETF is just around the corner. $SOL spot ETF is expected to be approved in 3-5 weeks. The setup for a massive altcoin season is there. Bulls about to full send alts to Valhalla. pic.twitter.com/pyIhFrBStE — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) June 11, 2025 While this bullish case is a far cry from overtaking Bitcoin, it sets a long-term precedent that could set Solana on the path to flip Ethereum to challenge the leading cryptocurrency. In the meantime, continued sell pressure could see the ascending channel break down, forming a new downtrend to retest lower supports or the handle’s base. Traders Have 3 Days to Make the Most of the Next Solana Rally New ICO Solaxy ($SOLX) could be the biggest beneficiary of a Solana price breakout as its first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution, filling a critical gap in the ecosystem.

2025-06-13T19:08:33,"Shiba Inu Price Prediction as SHIB Burn Rate Skyrockets 112,839% in 24 Hours – $1 SHIB Possible?","The Shiba Inu price (SHIB) has gone down by 7.1% in the past 24 hours as global markets react to Israel-Iran tensions. Trading volumes have surged by nearly 72% and currently account for more than 5% of the token’s circulating supply. Other tokens in this category like Pepe (PEPE) and SPX6900 (SPX) have experienced much more dramatic pullbacks of 20.2% and 17.5% during this same period respectively. Despite this latest weakness, one metric could favor a bullish Shiba Inu price forecast . According to Shib Burn , a website that tracks how many Shiba Inu tokens are burned in real time, the token’s burn rate experienced a 112,839% increase in just 24 hours as nearly 112 million SHIB were put out of circulation during this period. SHIB tokens are burned automatically when transactions like swaps occur within this blockchain. This significant amount of burned tokens implies that transaction volumes skyrocketed lately, possibly as sales picked up their pace during this recent pullback. That said, this number of burned is just a tiny fraction of the token’s circulating supply of nearly 590 trillion SHIB. In the near term though, it may help shrink the available supply to cushion SHIB’s decline. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Could Rise to $0.00001500 If It Bounces Off This Key Support Looking at the daily chart, the price action broke below its trend line support a few days ago and, since then, SHIB has been dropping quite sharply. The price already tried to move above its short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) once and failed to do so. SHIB continues to trade below its 200-day EMA as well, which favors a bearish mid-term outlook. However, as the token approaches a key support at $0.00001050, the price could bounce off this level and find a way back to retest its former trend line support, which coincides with the 200-day EMA at $0.00001546. Traders should keep an eye on how the price action behaves once the price gets to that support as a strong bounce could favor a bullish short-term Shiba Inu price prediction. So, maybe not $1 for SHIB for now but the token does offer some promising upside if this key support holds. In the meantime, one of the most promising crypto presales of the year has arrived. Its name is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) and it is the first layer-2 scaling protocol for the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Hyper Surpasses $1M Raised Just 15 Days After Its Launch Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to unlock billions of dollars of untapped potential within the Bitcoin blockchain by enabling investors, developers, and users to execute transactions safely through a layer-2 side chain. This project leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and uses smart contracts to automatically settle transactions made through its L2. It then bundles them into a single transaction sent to Bitcoin’s L1. This makes Bitcoin-based dApps scalable and cheaper to launch and operate and it opens up the door for the launch of meme coins and DeFi applications. Once the solution becomes widely adopted, the demand for $HYPER will explode. To buy this token at its discounted presale price, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

In the past 24 hours, BTC price dropped over 3 percent to trade about $105k on Friday, June 13, 2025, during the mid-North American trading session. The wider altcoin market experienced a similar drop, resulting in more than $1.1 billion rekt from crypto leveraged markets in the last 24 hours. As a result, crypto traders have been mixed with some remaining optimistic while some waiting for a clear signal to re-enter. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Issues a Bold Bitcoin Prediction The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a stablecoins summer following the ongoing regulatory goodwill from major jurisdictions, led by the United States. As the global money supply (M2) grows exponentially, more institutional investors have proliferated into the stablecoins market, thus significantly improving the crypto liquidity. Following the Bitcoin and wider altcoin drop in the past few days, Matt Hougan, the CIO at Bitwise, highlighted that an accumulation is more likely in the coming weeks before a parabolic rally before the end of this year. “I think this is the ‘Summer of Accumulation’, a moment for long-term investors to build positions ahead of an epic EOY run,” Hougan noted . What the Chart is Saying? After enjoying an impressive rally following the end of the trade wars in the past two months, BTC price experienced a significant resistance level of about $112k. The flagship coin failed to rally beyond $112k and has since retraced to a crucial buy zone of around $105k. In the four-hour timeframe, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD line KAS been hinting at potential reversal.

Altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), which have low liquidity compared to Bitcoin, were among the assets that lost the most value in this process. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest asset in the cryptocurrency market, is trading sideways at $105,600 at the time of writing, despite falling by as much as 3%. “The crypto market is reacting negatively to the news of Israel’s attack on Iran, in line with other risk assets. Technically, support is expected at $101,000, but geopolitical developments will determine price action in the short term,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets.

Following the developments, investors turned to safe havens such as government bonds, while stocks fell, oil prices rose more than 9% and gold gained value. “While Bitcoin is sometimes traded as a macroeconomic hedge, in high-risk moments like military conflict, investors prioritize liquidity over narrative. Positions are closed to generate cash, dollars are diverted, and leverage is reduced in volatile assets,” said Sean McNulty, head of derivatives Asia-Pacific at FalconX Ltd.

After slumping to the $102,600 mark, bitcoin BTC rebounded to around $106,000 before fading lower in the U.S. afternoon hours with reports about a fresh wave of airstrikes targeting Iran. The top cryptocurrency was down 1.6% in the last 24 hours, changing hands at $105,200 and still less than 6% shy of its all-time high price. Meanwhile, the CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding memecoins, stablecoins and exchange coins — has lost 4.4% in the same period of time. Tokens such as ether ETH, avalanche AVAX and toncoin TON were the hardest hit, slumping between 6% and 8%. Crypto stocks, however, aren’t doing too hot. Most equities are in the red, especially bitcoin miners MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), down 5% and 4% respectively. A notable exception is stablecoin issuer Circle (CIRCL), which is still benefiting from the windfall of its recent IPO; the stock is up 13% today, with news of retail giants Amazon and Walmart reportedly exploring stablecoins adding to the momentum. Traditional markets don’t seem overwhelmingly concerned by the war. While gold is up 1.3%, potentially gearing up for new all-time highs, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are only down 0.4% each. What's next for bitcoin? ""Nice bounce thus far and lack of follow-through lower,"" well-followed crypto trader Skew said in a Friday X post . Market participants will likely remain cautious through the weekend with BTC tightly correlated with traditional markets amid heightened geopolitical risks, Skew added. On the longer timeframe, some analysts see risks of a deeper pullback. 10x Research founder Markus Thielen noted that BTC's drop below $106,000 translates to a failed breakout, and traders should wait for more favorable setups before rushing to buy the dip. He highlighted the $100,000-$101,000 zone as key support, warning that a break below could mark a return to the broader consolidation phase similar to last summer. John Glover, chief investment officer at bitcoin lender Ledn, argued that bitcoin entered a corrective phase from its record highs that could see the largest digital asset drop to $88,000-$93,000. He said the $90,000 level could offer a favorable entry for opportunistic investors before BTC resumes its uptrend.

The firm recently added 56.87 BTC to its holdings, spending about ¥887 million, equivalent to about $6 million. This latest move pushes Remixpoint’s total Bitcoin stash past 1,000 BTC, a major milestone for the company. This move reflects a growing trend among businesses worldwide, adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as part of long-term financial strategies. Remixpoint Increases Bitcoin Holdings Remixpoint’s purchase of 56.87 BTC was made at an average price of $104,000 per coin. This latest buy pushes Remixpoint’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,038.27 BTC, marking the first time the firm has held over 1,000 BTC in its reserve. The market value of Remixpoint’s crypto assets is now around ¥17.25 billion, valued at $115 million. Bitcoin alone makes up about ¥16.1 billion, valued at $107 million of this amount. The Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed company currently holds an unrealized profit of ¥2.32 billion. This highlights its belief in Bitcoin’s long-term growth. The money for the recent purchase came from a stock acquisition rights exercise completed on June 10. A Growing Trend in Japan and Beyond Remixpoint is not the only Japanese company increasing its exposure to Bitcoin. Metaplanet, another Tokyo-listed firm, now holds 8,888 BTC, valued at over $921 million. To buy more Bitcoin, the company plans to issue 555 million shares through special warrants in a capital raise worth about $5.4 billion . In the U.K., Smarter Web Company also made a major Bitcoin purchase. The firm bought 74.27 BTC at an average price of £80,454, valued at $109,256 per coin, spending a total of £5.975 million. This brings Smarter Web’s total holdings to 242.34 BTC, with an average purchase price of £78,793, equivalent to $107,002. The purchase is part of Smarter Web’s “10-Year Plan,” which is focused on building Bitcoin as a long-term reserve. Bitcoin Finds Its Place in Corporate Strategy The trend goes beyond Japan and the UK. Companies like Mercurity Fintech plan to raise $800 million to grow their Bitcoin treasuries. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, remains the biggest corporate holder, holding about 3% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply . Financial institutions are also getting involved. Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, recently launched a structured bond linked to Bitcoin. This shows that digital assets are becoming more accepted in mainstream finance.

In a new company blog post, Coinbase says it’s launching Coinbase Business, a regulatory-compliant all-in-one financial platform for start-ups and small firms that would allow them to manage crypto assets, receive payments, and automate financial workflows. According to Coinbase, traditional finance serves as a barrier to success for smaller businesses, with crypto assets being the solution. “Startups struggling to hire and reliably pay global talent, small family-owned businesses taken through the wringer by credit card fees, interest rates and chargebacks, a new restaurant’s books wrecked by long settlement cycles – all factors that eat into the efficiency and earning potential of almost all businesses today. Crypto and stablecoins solve this exact problem for all of the above with fast, global, and low-cost money movement.” Coinbase Business will offer business owners a quick and easy way to settle payments using digital assets, trade and manage their crypto portfolios, earn passive income via stablecoin rewards, streamline accounting using third-party software, and onboard new users. “We’re bringing [our] security, scale, and compliance to everyday businesses with Coinbase Business – a modern financial stack built with the speed and scale of crypto. Coinbase Business is purpose-built for modern operations and designed to streamline financial workflows for small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and startups.” Customers can currently apply for early access to the Coinbase Business alpha, a preliminary version of the platform.

2025-06-13T18:40:31,"Former Wex exchange chief to face charges in the U.S.","Officials in Poland have agreed to hand over the former chief executive of Wex, once Russia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to the United States. The Russian national was arrested in Warsaw at the end of 2024 at a U.S. request issued within a criminal case over alleged fraud and money laundering. Former Wex exchange chief to face charges in the U.S. Polish authorities have approved the extradition of Dmitry Vasiliev, former director of the now defunct Russian digital asset exchange Wex, to the United States, Russia’s official news agency reported late on Thursday, quoting his lawyer, Alexander Surzhin. In an interview, Surzhin explained that the Russian national will be transferred to U.S. custody as part of the case that was initiated against Alexander Vinnik, co-founder of the infamous BTC-e exchange, succeeded by Wex. The lawyer told Tass: “The Polish Minister of Justice has signed a permission to extradite to the United States my client, Dmitry Vasiliev, who was detained in Warsaw last year as part of an American investigation into a criminal case, in which Alexander Vinnik was also a defendant.” Surzhin, who represents Vasiliev at the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ), expects that his client may find himself in the United States in the near future to face charges that may bring him a 25-year prison sentence. Vasiliev’s odyssey takes him to America after Vinnik’s return to Russia Wex’s ex-head was arrested in Warsaw in December 2024. At the time, the Polish police said they were acting on a U.S. request, adding that the Russian was in custody awaiting the completion of the extradition procedure. A statement quoted by Reuters detailed: “Dmitry V. is suspected of numerous frauds, money transfers and money laundering in connection with running one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.” But that wasn’t Vasiliev’s first time in jail. Polish law enforcement detained him in 2021 when he was wanted by and subsequently sent to Kazakhstan . The Central Asian nation was accusing him of fraud related to the crypto exchange he had been running. Earlier that year, Vasiliev was apprehended in Italy but released several weeks later, with Italian authorities citing faults in the extradition request. Then in 2022, he was also arrested in Croatia, according to local media reports, which revealed that Zagreb acted on a red warrant issued by Interpol. The case in Kazakhstan was based on the accusations of three crypto investors who alleged that in 2018, the Russian took their dollars but never sent them the Bitcoin they wanted to buy. It was closed in October 2024 after the court established that they were too incompetent to work with crypto wallets. Another chapter in the Vinnik-Wex-BTC-e saga Wex launched in September 2017 after BTC-e shut down earlier that year. The former was considered the successor of the latter, as it took over its customer database. Vasiliev was managing the new trading platform until its collapse in 2018. His arrests were preceded by the disappearance of almost $500 million from accounts hosted on Wex, including some that belonged to European investors. BTC-e’s alleged operator, Alexander Vinnik, was arrested in Greece in 2017. He was later extradited to France, where he was sentenced to five years in prison in December 2020. Vinnik was then handed over to the U.S. in 2022, where he was held accountable for laundering up to $9 billion through the exchange. In May 2024, he pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Eventually, the United States exchanged Vinnik, in a prisoner swap with Moscow under President Trump, for American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who had been held in a Russian prison since 2021 and had received a 14-year sentence for allegedly carrying medical cannabis in his luggage. Earlier in June this year, Bloomberg Law reported that another suspected BTC-e operator, Belarusian national Aliaksandr Klimenka, has asked a U.S. judge to dismiss the case against him, arguing he could no longer have Vinnik testify on his behalf since his return to Russia.

2025-06-13T18:32:11,"As BTC swings, smart money eye RUVI with audit incoming and $1.7M raised","Bitcoin’s well-documented price volatility has always been a double-edged sword for investors. While its swings create significant opportunities for short-term growth, they also introduce a level of risk that can deter those seeking more stable long-term returns. This volatility has prompted smart investors to look for emerging projects with strong fundamentals. One name rising to the top of these alternative opportunities is Ruvi AI, an innovative blockchain platform powered by artificial intelligence. With over $1.7 million raised in its ongoing presale, a global partnership with WEEX Exchange, and an incoming third-party audit, Ruvi AI is proving to be more than just hype. Here’s why industry analysts believe this project is set to skyrocket. Bitcoin’s volatility drives investors to alternatives Bitcoin’s significant price fluctuations are nothing new. For some, this volatility is part of its charm, providing traders with frequent profit-taking opportunities. For others, however, the lack of predictability calls for safer investments with clearer growth paths. Ruvi AI stands out in this regard as it offers a transparent growth roadmap alongside its affordable entry price, making it appealing for investors cautious of Bitcoin’s unpredictable behavior. By combining blockchain and AI technologies, Ruvi AI addresses real-world challenges in industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance. Unlike speculative cryptocurrencies, it offers long-term scalability and utility, positioning itself as a standout option in today’s crypto market. A closer look at Ruvi AI’s presale success Currently in Phase 2, Ruvi AI’s presale is a testament to its growing popularity. The project has raised an impressive $1.7 million and sold over 145 million tokens, all at a remarkable entry price of just $0.015 per token. This early-stage opportunity offers a way for investors to secure significant allocations while creating a foundation for exceptional returns. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its structured valuation plan. Unlike Bitcoin, whose pricing depends on fluctuating market dynamics, Ruvi AI guarantees a post-presale price of $0.07 per token, as outlined in its roadmap. Analysts are even more bullish, with projections placing the token’s value at $1 post-listing, representing a potential 66x return for those who join during the presale. Ruvi AI’s VIP tiers reward early commitment For investors ready to make a commitment, Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers are an enticing opportunity to amplify returns. Here’s how the tiers break down: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers are ideal for investors aiming to maximize returns while the presale remains open, allowing substantial gains when values increase post-listing. Transparency and security take center stage A defining feature of Ruvi AI is how it prioritizes investor security and transparency. To affirm its credibility, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, ensuring token liquidity and seamless accessibility for investors worldwide. Furthermore, Ruvi AI is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope, a respected entity in blockchain security audits. This evaluation aims to certify the platform’s technical integrity, reassuring investors of its robustness and trustworthiness. Analysts predict this upcoming audit will significantly boost momentum for the project, serving as a launching pad for future growth. Real-world applications fuel Ruvi AI’s growth Beyond its investment potential, Ruvi AI is built around solving real-world problems, ensuring its scalability and value in the long term. Its integration of blockchain and AI technologies enables it to create impact in critical industries: Marketing: AI-powered analytics help businesses optimize customer targeting, refine campaigns, and improve engagement. Entertainment: Personalized recommendations and smooth digital payments empower creators and enhance the consumer experience. Finance: Blockchain-backed fraud detection and transaction transparency enhance trust and streamline financial operations. With these practical applications, Ruvi AI positions itself as more than just another token. It is a robust platform capable of carving a lasting presence in various markets. Why Ruvi AI deserves your attention While Bitcoin’s price swings command headlines, Ruvi AI is quietly establishing itself as a significant player that’s hard to ignore.

The breakdown at $3.20 — a previously firm support zone—unleashed heavy sell pressure and marked a turning point in short-term sentiment, with over 50 million tokens traded during the selloff. After briefly breaching the $3.00 level, SUI found support around $2.997, where buyer interest began to surface. Price has since recovered into a narrow $3.00–$3.05 consolidation band, though momentum remains fragile. Lower highs continue to form, suggesting that sellers are still in control unless bulls can reclaim levels above $3.05 with conviction. The sharp move follows a wave of broader crypto weakness and a brief spike in BTC prices tied to U.S. inflation data earlier this week. While the macro backdrop remains uncertain, SUI’s price behavior appears primarily technical: the $3.20 breakdown triggered cascading stop-losses and panic selling, while psychological support near $3.00 has temporarily stemmed the decline. Volume patterns suggest cautious accumulation, with a notable spike at 14:00 UTC when over 1.2 million tokens changed hands. However, unless buyers can reclaim key resistance levels, the current bounce may prove short-lived. A confirmed close above $3.05 would be the first step toward invalidating the current downtrend. Technical Analysis Highlights UI dropped from $3.343 to $2.9556 in 24 hours, a 12.9% decline before partial recovery. Sell pressure intensified after the $3.20 breakdown at 00:00 UTC, with 50M+ tokens traded. Price has stabilized in a $3.00–$3.05 consolidation band. A minor recovery lifted price from $2.997 to $3.017 in the most recent hour. Volume at 14:00 UTC topped 1.2M, signaling short-term accumulation near support. Resistance sits at $3.05; support remains firm at $2.94.

2025-06-13T18:05:52,"Here Are the Possible Bearish Targets for Bitcoin After BTC Fails To Break Out Above Major Level, According to Crypto Analyst","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may pull back after failing to hold a key support level. In a new thread, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 116,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC may revisit the lower bound of a trading range at the $100,000 level, after a possible weekend bounce. “Possible scenario for BTC following Thursday’s $106,600 failure. Pull back/consolidate on Friday, weekend rally (because that’s what retail does) into $106,000-$107,000, and then revisit the $100,000 lows. Invalidation on a sustained break (high time frames) above $107,000… Personally, I wouldn’t be a buyer here, not after losing $106,600. It’s shorts only for me, but only if BTC gives me the opportunity on a bounce.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett also says that BTC whales exiting long positions in favor of building short positions against retail is causing the flagship crypto asset to weaken. “Whales were shorting into retail strength all day Thursday. It was a scam BTC pump from the start.” Lastly, the analyst warns that the USDT dominance chart (USDT.D) may start flashing bearish for Bitcoin. Many traders closely watch the USDT.D chart as it shows how much of the crypto market cap is comprised of the stablecoin USDT. A bullish USDT.D chart is generally considered bearish for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it indicates traders are unloading their crypto holdings in favor of the stablecoin. “Not ready to call it just yet, but the USDT.D weekly chart is starting to look primed for another push back to 5%. I’ll wait for Friday’s two-day close to get a more definitive answer on this idea, but it looks decent so far. (Tether dominance moves inversely to BTC and ETH).” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,658 at time of writing, down 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, USDT.D is at 4.79% at time of writing.

Some traders see this as a knee-jerk reaction and expect a rebound once headlines fade. Others warn that the US CPI release later this week could add another twist.

During the robust bullish performance of BTC in the past few weeks, on-chain data shows that the SOPR indicator has been dropping sharply. Key Bitcoin SOPR Indicator Dips Sharply As Bitcoin continues to show upside strength, Rafaela Romano, a crypto enthusiast, highlighted that a significant divergence is developing below the surface. In a surprising turn of events, Bitcoin’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Indicator has witnessed a notable decline amidst a stunning rise in BTC’s price. The crypto enthusiast reported the unusual development in a recent post on the X platform. In the past, the SOPR indicator, a key on-chain metric used to gauge overall market profitability, has aligned strongly with BTC’s performance. When the price climbs, the Spent Output Profit Ratio rises as well, hitting new highs at every new price point. Such an alignment between price movements and the indicator’s upside move is reflected by huge profit-taking from investors and traders during price spikes. However, while Bitcoin’s price has risen strongly and is holding beyond the $100,000 mark, this metric has been falling at a rapid pace. “Interestingly, the price of Bitcoin has been rising, but profit-taking is not keeping up,” the crypto enthusiast stated. This current divergence suggests that many investors are confident about the flagship asset’s prospects in the short term as they continue to accumulate and hold their coins . According to the enthusiast, the trend is a sign that BTC holders, especially seasoned investors or long-term holders, still consider the $100,000 level a cheap value. A bullish sentiment of this magnitude among seasoned investors could pave the way for BTC’s next major rally in the short term as long as these key players continue to purchase the asset . A Weakened BTC Net Realized Profits Investors’ conviction in Bitcoin is undoubtedly growing strong in the current market environment. Another crucial indication of waning profit-taking by investors is a continued decrease in the BTC Net Realized Profit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Strengthen Their Grip As Realized Cap Climbs To Uncharted Territory As reported by Darkfost, a verified author and on-chain expert, this metric has decreased even as BTC maintains its upside trajectory compared to past scenarios. In early 2024, when Bitcoin reached a top, the net realized profits rose to $3.5 billion. Also, when the asset climbed to its previous top in January this year, profit-taking grew to $4.5 billion. Meanwhile, data shows that profit-taking declined sharply to $1.8 billion following BTC’s surge to its current top in May . Currently, realized profits have decreased further, dropping to barely $700 million in the last seven days after reaching $110,000 on Thursday. Darkfost noted that the trend suggests most BTC holders remain patient on the sidelines, opting to hold instead of taking profits.

For instance, Invesco recently filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking within its ETH ETF, which would give investors both price exposure and yield. Furthermore, Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade has the potential of boosting ETF interest by improving wallet usability and transaction efficiency. Therefore, a mix of regulatory optimism like staking in ETFs, technical upgrades, and consistent institutional flows are propelling Ethereum into the spotlight right now. Coupled with its dominant DeFi infrastructure and strong price dynamics, Ethereum ETFs are attracting fresh capital at scale. Ethereum’s Institutional Momentum Gains Steam Even though ETH is experiencing a pullback at the $2,530 level, the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization continues eyeing the psychological price of $3,000 . Where is Ethereum getting its backing from? Well, institutional demand is surging as Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin in derivatives markets, with sophisticated investors betting on ETH’s long-term growth and its pivotal role bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The COO of crypto exchange OKX Lennix Lai acknowledged, “Ethereum is overshadowing BTC on our perpetual futures market, with ETH accounting for 45.2% of trading volume over the past week. BTC, by comparison, sits at 38.1%.” Ethereum Futures Open Interest Smashes $20B Barrier Ether futures open interest has surged to an unprecedented all‑time high, now exceeding $20 billion. Leading on-chain metrics provider Glassnode acknowledged , “ETH futures open interest (cash-margined) just hit a new all-time high - topping $20B. Despite a slight pullback from the $2.8K levels, leverage continues to build as traders load up using stablecoins.” What’s Driving the Spike? Heavy Leverage & Speculation Traders are increasingly employing cash‑margined futures with stablecoins, layering on more leverage. This can be shown by the fact that open interest is at historic-high levels. Institutional Inflows & Whale Activity Institutional investors, most notably BlackRock, are ramping up ETH accumulation—some $163.6 million in the last two weeks alone. On‑chain analytics firm Lookonchain reports major whale distributions and withdrawals from exchanges, indicating a shift toward long-term stakeholding. Retail Engagement Retail traders appear to be returning, with futures trading frequency among small investors climbing above the one-year average. This resurgence is in stark contrast to diminished activity in Bitcoin’s on‑chain metrics. Price Context and Outlook Despite the surge in open interest, ETH remains below its key resistance of $2,800–$3,000, trading at the $2,500 zone . Analysts suggest that breaking above $2,800 could open the way toward $3,000 and beyond, though heightened risk awaits should the market cool. Conclusion With all eyes glued to ETH $3,000, the largest altcoin continues to enjoy various bullish on-chain metrics ranging from skyrocketing ETF inflows to historic high open interest. Even though a bullish June 2025 outlook is taking center stage, thanks to robust sentiment and potential upside, holding the psychological price of $2,500 will be key when it comes to determining the next move that Ethereum makes.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9566/ethereum-et-fs-see-record-inflows-as-eth-closes-on-3-k,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T17:49:16,"Charles Hoskinson floats $100m ADA treasury reboot to stabilize Cardano ecosystem","With just $31 million in stablecoins against $356 million in total value locked, Cardano’s founder has proposed unprecedented treasury diversification into Bitcoin and native dollar-pegged assets to boost the network’s decentralized finance and stablecoin ecosystem. On June 12, Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson proposed the idea in a YouTube video of swapping $100 million worth of Cardano ( ADA ) tokens for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and native stablecoins USDM and USDA to strengthen the ecosystem. Hoskinson framed the treasury overhaul as a strategic bet on Cardano’s future as a multi-asset financial ecosystem. Drawing inspiration from sovereign wealth funds in Norway and Abu Dhabi, he argued that converting a portion of ADA’s treasury into yield-generating assets would unlock liquidity and signal serious confidence to institutional players. You might also like: Bitcoin is oversold after Israeli strike on Iran: analyst A strategic fix for Cardano’s liquidity imbalance In his remarks, Hoskinson addressed the stark disparity between Cardano’s treasury composition and its decentralized finance ambitions. His argument stemmed from what he termed Cardano’s “stablecoin drought”, a glaring imbalance that’s stifling development. “We have a treasury with about $1.5 billion of ADA, and yet there’s only about $30 million of stablecoins in the entire Cardano ecosystem,” he said. “That’s a problem.” For context, while Ethereum boasts $190 in stablecoins for every $100 of TVL, Cardano lags far behind with just $9. “This isn’t just lagging behind; it’s choking our ecosystem,” Hoskinson argued. According to him, the proposed conversion aims to boost stablecoin reserves by targeting a 33% to 40% stablecoin-to-TVL ratio and to prime Bitcoin-focused decentralized finance by allocating $25 million to $50 million to Bitcoin to attract yield-seeking holders. Hoskinson also believes the move could improve the chances of Cardano-native stablecoins being listed on tier-two and tier-three exchanges. While some traders on X voiced concern that liquidating $100 million in ADA would crash the market, Hoskinson dismissed the skepticism with a chuckle, claiming, “ADA’s liquidity can swallow this without a 1% price blip.” He emphasized that the proposed treasury shift wouldn’t be a reckless exchange dump but a carefully managed operation using time-weighted average price algorithms and over-the-counter desks, the same tools institutional players use to quietly shift nine-figure positions. “This isn’t some meme coin we’re talking about,” he stressed. Whether the move turns Cardano into a decentralized finance powerhouse or backfires depends largely on timing and sentiment management.

2025-06-13T17:49:08,"Weekly Recap: Milestones Galore for Stablecoins","First slowly, then all at once. For years, crypto toiled in the darkness, a band of outlaws frowned upon by elites in Washington and in the media. Then came the market rallies, and Trump, and legislation like the GENIUS Act. Now crypto is finally everywhere. Look at the big news this week. Amazon and Walmart – companies about as mainstream as they come – are considering launching their own stablecoins. You read that right. According to the Wall Street Journal, the world’s biggest retailers are tired of paying merchant fees and other unaccountable costs to the likes of VISA and Mastercard. They want to use their own blockchain-based tokens to do their own transactions, their way. This is contingent on the passage of the GENIUS Act, which now appears a near certainty after this week’s Senate vote. Jesse Hamilton had the news. And that wasn’t the only big stablecoin news this week. Societe Generale, a lion of European finance, announced its own stablecoin on Ethereum and Solana . And Jack Ma’s Ant Group applied for stablecoin issuer licenses in Hong Kong and Singapore. The whole world is going stablecoin crazy. And why not? These mostly dollar-pegged tokens are a vastly better form of money, allowing quicker settlement times and lower fees particularly on cross-border transactions. GENIUS wasn’t the only crypto legislation moving forward in Congress. The market structure bill – known as CLARITY – emerged from key House committees . If enacted, the law would provide long-sought guardrails for crypto companies particularly around securities laws and the roles of the SEC and CFTC. The market reacted well to the Congressional tailwinds and we saw several new announcements for bitcoin accumulation vehicles (AKA “digital asset treasuries”). Anthony Pompliano, a crypto influencer and investor, will head a new $750 million fund , for instance. If you’re not impressed by all this, then crypto really may not be your thing. But legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones disagrees with you.

2025-06-13T17:37:51,"India cracks down on crypto tax evasion in enforcement push","India’s Income Tax Department has launched a fresh crackdown on potential tax evasion and money laundering tied to virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. According to government officials and local reporting , the department has identified individuals and entities engaging in crypto transactions who failed to comply with the Income Tax Act, 1961. The Central Board of Direct Taxes recently sent emails to thousands of individuals, urging them to review and update their income tax returns if crypto income was misreported or omitted. The initiative is part of CBDT’s broader NUDGE campaign, aimed at encouraging voluntary compliance. This marks the third NUDGE campaign in six months, following earlier drives that focused on foreign asset disclosures and false political donation deductions. Although India does not recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender, income from VDA transfers has been taxable since April 2022. Under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act, crypto income is taxed at a flat 30% without deductions, except for the cost of acquisition. Losses cannot be offset or carried forward. You might also like: Monero crypto remains bullish as price corrects into high-probability value zone India’s mismatching tax documents Officials say discrepancies are being uncovered through data analytics, including mismatches between income tax returns and tax deducted at source filings by crypto exchanges, or Virtual Asset Service Providers. Some taxpayers reportedly failed to file the mandatory Schedule VDA or declared crypto income at lower tax rates, while others wrongly claimed deductions. The crackdown comes amid broader concerns over the use of unaccounted income in high-risk crypto investments. While the government is working on a discussion paper to explore regulatory options for VDAs, including a possible ban, it has clarified that taxation does not imply formal approval of cryptocurrencies.

Both of these assets are arguably the premier safe-haven flights to safety. With the Middle Eastern conflict possibly about to escalate, can these assets rebound to all-time highs? Poorly correlated but heading in the same direction Even though both gold and Bitcoin can be categorised as safe-haven assets, the correlation between the two of them could be said to be volatile and inconsistent. Even so, while gold has been rising of late, as Bitcoin has been undergoing a correction, a recent bounce from Bitcoin has put the king of the cryptocurrencies back into the reckoning for a return to all-time highs. Gold confirms bull flag breakout Source: TradingView The daily chart for gold illustrates how it was moving inside of a rising channel for a long period of time. A breakout of this channel and confirmation have contributed to the development of a bull flag, a breakout of which has been confirmed and now the price is climbing higher. The measured move out of the bull flag is to $3,700. Bitcoin bounces sharply from support Source: TradingView The daily Bitcoin chart shows the relatively sharp climb up from $74,000 to the $112,000 all-time high. Following such a climb it was only natural for the price to consolidate sideways for an extended period. This resulted in the price going as low as $100,400. Since then, the price spiked, and more recently with the Middle Eastern conflict, it fell back down to support at $102,800. However, the collapse was bought back up very quickly, leaving a long candle wick behind and a bullish pinball candle. Gold or Bitcoin to take the lead from here? Source: TradingView The Bitcoin/Gold chart in the daily time frame reveals a real battle between the two sound money assets. Going back a lot further than the above chart shows, Bitcoin has been winning that battle hands down for most of its history. That said, Bitcoin has been unable to consistently stay above the Bitcoin/Gold price of 37 ounces, last set in April 2021. With central banks still buying a lot of gold, and with Bitcoin treasuries being set up left, right, and centre, it remains to be seen which of the two assets will take the lead from here.

It will focus on integrating financial services with innovation and expanding real-world application scenarios for digital assets. At the 2025 Caixin Summer Summit, Chan confirmed that the city had already launched licensing systems for digital asset trading platforms and stablecoins. Hong Kong was also advancing new regulations for custody and OTC services. Chan previously said the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) was reviewing virtual asset derivatives for professional investors, starting with BTC and ETH Perpetuals. Hong Kong released its first policy statement on the development of digital assets in October 2022, covering the regulation of crypto exchanges and the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Chan believes that the future of digital tech growth in Hong Kong will be powered by blockchain and Web3 technologies. The Financial Secretary also said that legislation for stablecoin regulation was set for imminent passage. He added that he and his colleagues at the Financial Services & the Treasury Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) were working hard to get the relevant licensing regime to go live this year. Chan says it is essential to explore digital finance in the real economy Chan said financial innovation was where Hong Kong must win in order for the city to become a financial powerhouse. He added that it was essential to explore ways of utilizing digital finance to better support the real economy’s development, including in finance and cross-border financial services. Chan explained that the convergence of Web3 and AI was unlocking new frontiers in finance. Decentralized AI algorithms enhanced credit assessments, audited smart contracts more precisely, and delivered personalized investment strategies. Beyond finance, the technology streamlined supply chains transformed healthcare data management, and created new immersive gaming experiences. Web3 and AI were transforming businesses and public services, driving innovation and efficiency at every turn. “We will unveil a second policy statement on the development of virtual assets. It will cover how to make use of Web3 to fast-track the development of traditional financial services, empower the real economy, and strengthen the application of digital asset technologies.” – Paul Chan , Financial Secretary of Hong Kong The Financial Secretary also said the city offered a stable environment for investors amid a complicated geopolitical landscape.

Notably, Nvidia fell 1.5%, and Apple declined 1% following the attacks. Simultaneously, investors rotated into traditional safe havens such as gold and the dollar. Consequently, crypto was among the most affected asset classes by Middle East tensions. The overall crypto market cap was down 2.7%, while Bitcoin (BTC) was down 2.19%, falling to $105k.

Following the impulsive rally, XMR is now undergoing a correction, one that may provide the ideal foundation for a continuation toward higher targets. After breaking market structure with a strong upward surge, Monero ( XMR ) has entered a corrective phase, which is natural and expected following such impulsive price action. The key to the current move lies in where the correction finds support. Technical confluence zones offer valuable insight into where buyers may re-enter the market, and for Monero, that zone appears to be forming around the $269 region. Key technical points Bullish Breakout Confirmed: XMR broke above key resistance and confirmed a shift in trend with higher highs and higher lows. Healthy Pullback in Progress: A correction is now underway, setting up for a potential higher low formation. $269 Support Confluence Zone: This level aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, VWAP support, and the 200-day moving average. Upside Targets at $338 and $417: These resistance levels remain open if the bullish structure continues from support. XMRUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Monero’s impulsive rally signaled a clear shift in market behavior, breaking the prior range and confirming bullish intent. With price now pulling back, this phase should not be viewed as weakness, but rather a viable correction in a strong uptrend. The $269 level is now the critical support area to monitor. It brings together several high-probability technical factors: 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the recent swing VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) support The 200-day moving average, which serves as a long-term dynamic support Historical high-timeframe structure This confluence creates a strong foundation for bulls to defend. A bounce from this region would confirm a higher low formation, in line with the newly established bullish structure.

Recent news Telegram’s deal with xAI, which would see Elon Musk’s AI company integrate into Telegram, is a work in progress despite an announcement from Pavel Durov. While Durov confirmed that the deal is yet to be signed, the Telegram founder said there is an “agreement in principle,” which might be why TON still has significant support at the $3.0. Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Why is TON up? The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market, which saw Bitcoin rise above $100,000. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Will TON reach $1,000?

2025-06-13T17:17:08,"Former CFTC Chairman Talks About Bitcoin and XRP! ""BTC and XRP Are More Than a Possibility for the US!""","Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo, appointed by US President Donald Trump during his previous presidency, spoke about Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP. Speaking at the XRPL Apex 2025 conference in Singapore, Chris Giancarlo noted that the US government is increasingly interested in the idea of issuing crypto-backed bonds. Bitcoin and XRP Are More Than a Possibility for the US! At this point, Chris Giancarlo stated that the US could issue Bitcoin and XRP-backed crypto bonds, and said that BTC and XRP-backed US crypto bonds are more than a possibility. Known as the “Godfather of Crypto” for his early support of the industry, Giancarlo said the current Trump administration has taken a very different approach to digital assets than its predecessors and sees their long-term value. At this point, Giancarlo pointed out that in recent years, federal agencies have often sold seized cryptocurrencies and said, “This strategy has changed during the Trump era. The administration now believes that holding digital assets can strengthen the United States financially.” Stating that he supports the strategic Bitcoin reserve, Giancarlo argued that the BTC sales were a great loss for the United States. “If the US government had not held on to the Bitcoins it seized a few years ago and sold them, it could have reduced its national debt by a significant amount. “In fact, the government could do this without changing any relevant laws. Federal agencies already have the authority to hold seized digital assets, and that authority is now being actively used.” As is well known, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which currently contains over 200,000 BTC worth approximately $22 billion. These assets were seized through criminal and civil forfeitures and will be held as long-term assets similar to gold. Trump also launched a Digital Asset Stock to hold other altcoins besides Bitcoin, such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T17:15:10,"Qubetics, Stellar, Monero: Top Crypto to Invest in for Short Term After Bitcoin’s $645M Liquidation Shock","Is the latest market shakeup a sign of what’s ahead or just a reset before the next leg up? Bitcoin’s dramatic fall below $106K has sent shockwaves across the digital asset sector, triggering over $645 million in liquidations and prompting short-term participants to seek immediate gains with reduced exposure risk. This kind of volatility doesn’t just test market sentiment—it filters out tokens with no real purpose. In this environment, only projects with concrete use cases, technical strength, and sound economic models are drawing serious capital. Among the few turning heads, Qubetics ($TICS) is standing out for offering utility that meets current market demands—especially when rising gas fees and sluggish networks are becoming more than just an inconvenience. Qubetics directly addresses longstanding cross-chain limitations by creating a Web3 aggregator that removes the isolated silos most networks still operate in. This protocol enables seamless interoperability across major chains, allowing users and businesses to move value and data in real time. While Qubetics gears up for its final presale stage, Stellar is pushing forward by onboarding PayPal’s stablecoin PYUSD, giving its network a meaningful adoption milestone. Meanwhile, Monero maintains strong bullish indicators with projections pointing to double-digit short-term returns. These trends highlight how select tokens—those driving clear utility or chart-backed performance—are stepping up. For those searching for the top crypto to invest in for short term, the right plays are no longer based on speculation—they’re anchored in functionality and timely market movement. How Qubetics Delivers Functional Use Cases That Compete in Today’s Market The promise of blockchain has always been about decentralization and transparency, but most protocols still fall short when it comes to uniting networks into one usable system. Qubetics flips that narrative by becoming the first Web3 aggregator that allows major chains like Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and more to work together through a unified protocol. This removes the need for redundant systems, duplicate wallets, or manual swapping processes that create inefficiency for both users and enterprises. Use cases are broad and grounded in real-world functionality. A logistics firm in Germany can initiate payment in BTC, instantly move funds via Qubetics into Solana for smart contract-based delivery verification, and then close the transaction using Ethereum. Similarly, healthcare providers transmitting sensitive data across decentralized cloud infrastructure can rely on Qubetics to bridge data securely between compliance-specific chains. For content creators receiving global payments, the ability to instantly convert stablecoins and deploy royalties via any supported blockchain makes Qubetics not only competitive—it’s necessary. These applications support the token’s positioning as the top crypto to invest in for short term by solving issues that competitors still struggle with: network isolation, speed, and real-time settlement. Why Qubetics Presale Is the Top Crypto to Invest in for Short Term Qubetics has officially entered its final presale phase—Stage 37. With a fixed price of $0.3370, over 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold and the project has raised more than $18 million to date. More than 27,900 token holders are already on board, and just 10 million tokens remain before the listing price increases to $0.40. That pricing structure alone offers early adopters an instant 20% return once it goes live. The recent overhaul of Qubetics’ tokenomics has cut total supply from over 4 billion down to 1.36 billion, while increasing public sale allocation to 38.55%. This ensures wider access, stronger decentralization, and long-term scarcity. With these updates, early buyers at the $0.3370 mark stand to see immediate gains and potential exponential growth. For example, a $5,000 allocation today will purchase approximately 14,846 tokens. Once listed at $0.40, this holding jumps to a value of around $5,938—an instant boost. And if $TICS climbs to projected figures between $5 and $10 in the next market cycle, the same $5K investment could grow to between $74,230 and $148,460. This combination of token scarcity, active demand, and high functionality underscores why Qubetics presale stands out as the best crypto presale and remains the top crypto to invest in for short term right now. PYUSD Launch on Stellar Network Could Expand Real-World Stablecoin Adoption PayPal has confirmed that its USD-backed stablecoin, PYUSD, will be integrated onto the Stellar network pending approval from the New York Department of Financial Services. This move unlocks low-cost, fast-settlement payments across Stellar’s infrastructure—an important shift as businesses demand faster merchant solutions. By rolling out PYUSD on Stellar, PayPal aims to allow users to fund wallets, send payments, and receive merchant settlements with a level of flexibility previously out of reach on traditional rails. The integration will also support corporate working capital functions, such as bulk payouts and financial liquidity services for vendors. With Stellar’s known strengths in speed and near-zero fees, this collaboration with PayPal marks a step toward institutional-scale adoption. These developments bring value to Stellar not just from a branding perspective but from tangible use case integration, making it part of a short list of protocols benefiting directly from fiat-stablecoin bridges in real commerce. Technical Indicators Suggest Monero Could Deliver Double-Digit Short-Term Gains Monero is currently trading near $309.50 and holds a short-term bullish outlook. Based on current models, the token is forecasted to reach as high as $324.06 by June 23—representing a potential upside of 6.22%. The Fear & Greed Index registers at 61, reflecting market confidence. More importantly, Monero has posted a 79.52% increase over the past year, and has stayed in the green 53% of the days over the last month. That’s a performance few privacy tokens can match in the current environment. Further analysis shows a price potential of between $304.64 and $455.64 over the next 12 to 18 months, which places Monero as a contender for short-term movement with long-term benefits. Its consistent trading patterns and positive sentiment across multiple indicators suggest this token is still earning real traction. The projected 38.33% surge into 2026 makes it a compelling case for participants seeking stable charts paired with active community support. Why These Three Tokens Are Leading This Month’s Watchlist Bitcoin’s liquidation wave forced market participants to take a harder look at which assets hold structural integrity. Amid that scrutiny, Qubetics delivers with its Web3 aggregator model and active final-stage presale. Stellar gains traction via a real-world partnership with PayPal and stablecoin access, while Monero continues to ride strong technicals and forecasted upside. Each coin addresses current market demands through distinct advantages—be it Stellar’s real-time scalability, Monero’s proven privacy framework, or Stellar’s rapidly expanding footprint in global payments. For those seeking the top crypto to invest in for short term, Qubetics delivers a rare early-access opportunity through its engineered scarcity, cross-chain functionality, and ongoing public allocation. With its presale approaching completion, now is the time to join this best crypto presale before its listing phase reshapes its valuation profile. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the top crypto to invest in for short term? Qubetics currently leads based on its final presale phase, functional use case, and immediate return on listing. Why is Qubetics presale attracting attention now? With a fixed price of $0.3370 and a listing at $0.40, it offers a 20% ROI at launch and long-term value based on reduced supply. What’s driving Monero’s short-term price potential? Bullish forecasts, a strong technical pattern, and 79.52% annual growth make Monero a solid short-term pick.

2025-06-13T17:00:52,"Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000 Imminent As Fibonacci Resistance Is At Stake","Bitcoin’s recent price action has shown signs of fading momentum three weeks after reaching a new all-time high of $111,814. The leading cryptocurrency climbed back above $110,000 on Monday off the back of cooling U.S. inflation data and a temporarily weaker dollar. However, the rally was short-lived. Profit-taking, compounded by geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, has contributed to a risk-off environment that pushed Bitcoin down below $105,000 in the past 24 hours. This sharp reversal highlights a significant technical level that could decide whether Bitcoin sustains its uptrend or enters a crash towards $94,000. Final Fibonacci Resistance Holding The Line According to a new analysis shared by pseudonymous crypto analyst XForceGlobal on the social media platform X, Bitcoin’s current corrective structure could deepen if it fails to overcome the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance level. The analyst highlighted that the bullish impulse that carried Bitcoin now appears to be losing steam. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000 The price zone around $110,500, which is marked by the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance, has not been convincingly breached, casting doubt on the strength of the current wave structure. Bitcoin tested this level twice earlier this week, and, as noted by the analyst, if this resistance level fails to break soon, there is a slight possibility of a deeper pullback. If this pullback does occur, this would lead to the formation of a corrective wave C, and with distinct symmetry in an ABC corrective pattern. In this case of the corrective Wave C playing out, the next central area of interest lies around the $94,000 level, an area that aligns with the completion of a larger impulse Wave 2. Wave 2 Dip To $96,000 Before Bullish Wave 3 Begins The rundown of a corrective Wave 2 and a bearish impulse Wave 2 is based on the outlook of Bitcoin failing to clear the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance at $110,000. Applying the Elliott wave count on the current price action shows that the recent push to $111,814 all-time high was a larger bullish impulse Wave 1. However, the ensuing correction since then has also played out in the form of a sub-wave 123 structure, and an ABC corrective pattern. Altogether, these are expected to make up a larger corrective impulse Wave 2. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Crash To $31,000 Amid 5-Wave Impulse Completion Nevertheless, XForceGlobal noted that Bitcoin is still in a highly bullish structure on the macro level. If the price action plays out this way, the next move after the impulse Wave 2 to $94,000 would be a reversal upwards with bullish impulse Wave 3. In this case, the analyst projected an expansion move that would send Bitcoin to another all-time high. Notably, the price target in this case would be a surge above $118,500. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,000, down by 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-13T17:00:39,"Is BlockDAG the Best Crypto ICO of 2025? Bitcoin Hyper, SUBBD, and Snorter Try to Keep Up as BDAG Nears $300M","Crypto presales in 2025 are on fire, but only a few projects show the kind of real traction and breakout potential that truly define the best crypto ICO of the year. As the landscape fills with bold promises, BlockDAG, Bitcoin Hyper, SUBBD, and Snorter show potential. BlockDAG, however, is delivering something far more tangible: infrastructure, adoption, and momentum. Forget the hype cycle, BlockDAG is building something foundational. It’s not a fleeting meme coin, but a high-throughput Layer 1 blockchain with full EVM compatibility and a growing user base. With $299 million raised already and over 22.4 billion BDAG coins sold, the numbers speak for themselves. The project’s current Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, with a launch target of $0.05. If you’re scanning for the best crypto ICO with real-world traction and deep market interest, this one’s at the top of the list. 1. BlockDAG: Leading the Charge as 2025’s Best Crypto ICO Candidate BlockDAG is rapidly becoming one of the most closely watched names in the 2025 presale cycle. Having already raised $299 million and sold 22.4 billion coins, BDAG is drawing serious attention from those looking for the best crypto ICO to get behind. The project’s Batch 29 price is currently $0.0276, with the launch price set at $0.05. That kind of pricing gap sets the stage for huge gains. But BlockDAG’s value goes beyond numbers. Its Layer 1 architecture merges DAG scalability with Proof-of-Work security, creating lightning-fast, low-cost transactions. Full EVM compatibility allows Ethereum-based apps to migrate without hurdles, giving developers more freedom to scale. The X1 Miner app is another key highlight. With 1.5 million downloads already, it’s enabling mobile-based mining that puts real coins into the hands of users daily. With its combination of tech, traction, and timing, BlockDAG is setting the pace for the best crypto ICO race in 2025. 2. Bitcoin Hyper: Fast and Focused Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper is gaining momentum as it introduces smart contract functionality and DeFi capabilities to Bitcoin via a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) foundation. By fusing Solana-speed confirmations with Bitcoin’s brand trust, this Layer 2 solution offers a compelling model. Its presale crossed $1 million in under a week. That kind of growth comes from serious features like up to 2000% staking APY, decentralized bridging, and zero private-sale dilution. A whale recently scooped $139K in tokens, signaling early institutional interest. Though it lacks BlockDAG’s scale, Bitcoin Hyper delivers a unique Layer 2 niche that might appeal to those looking for the best crypto ICO with Bitcoin roots and DeFi upside. 3. SUBBD: Web3 for the Creator Generation SUBBD is offering creators more than just a platform, it’s building a Web3 economy around content engagement. Using AI-enhanced features and smart contracts, the project allows users to monetize videos, live streams, and even real-time chat. So far, SUBBD has raised over $615K. Its $SUBBD token supports staking at 20% APY, and its presale price of $0.055 is aimed at early supporters ahead of a potential rise toward $0.30 post-launch. The roadmap is detailed, with a beta platform coming soon, and audits in place to verify integrity. For those interested in creator-focused platforms with solid tokenomics, SUBBD could emerge as one of the best crypto ICO picks for a Web3 content economy. It’s not at BlockDAG’s level of volume or reach, but it’s clearly carving a niche. 4. Snorter: Solana Trading Automation Inside Telegram Snorter is tapping into the red-hot Telegram bot trend, offering automated trading inside the app with Solana blockchain speed. It includes MEV protection, copy-trading features, and sniping tools that bring pro-level functions to retail traders. The project has raised over $650K, and more than 5 million $SNORT tokens are already staked with yields exceeding 500% APY. Backed by audits from Coinsult and SolidProof, Snorter is preparing for a Q3 launch with a goal of merging convenience with performance. While it may not have the infrastructure breadth of BlockDAG, Snorter brings serious utility to a growing crypto niche and could be a worthy addition to any best crypto ICO watchlist. Final Verdict: Which ICO Stands Out in 2025? The race to find the best crypto ICO of 2025 is heating up fast, but not all projects are built for the same outcome. Bitcoin Hyper delivers speed and Bitcoin-layer innovation. SUBBD empowers creators through tokenized tools. Snorter brings powerful automation to everyday traders. Yet only one project is ticking every major box: BlockDAG. With $299 million raised, 1.5 million users actively mining through the X1 app, a working EVM-compatible Layer 1 testnet, BlockDAG isn’t just promising, it’s already executing. If you’re looking for the best crypto ICO that offers infrastructure, scale, vision, and near-term upside, BlockDAG is leading the field, and the opportunity window is closing fast.
