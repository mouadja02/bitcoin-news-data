2025-06-13T16:55:02,"Trump Calls Fed Chair Jerome Powell a ‘Numbskull,’ Claims Lack of Rate Cuts Are Costing US $600,000,000,000 a Year","US President Donald Trump has more insults for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. At a bill signing ceremony on Thursday, Trump claimed the government would save $600 billion a year in short-term debt payments if Powell lowered the federal funds rate by 2 percentage points. In May, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it planned to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5%, arguing that it was the most suitable level to achieve both maximum employment and controlled inflation. The Fed has held interest rates steady since December, when it cut the rate by 0.25%. Trump says he’s not planning on firing Powell, but he slammed the Fed chair for not adjusting course. “We’re going to spend $600 billion a year – $600 billion – because of one numbskull that sits there [and says] ‘I don’t see enough reason to cut the rates now.’ And the problem he’s got, and I explained to him… cut your rates now, there’s no inflation. We got it down, we got prices down.” Inflation rose by 2.4% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was slightly less than the 2.5% increase predicted by economists, CBS reports . Powell met with Trump last month following a barrage of insults from the president. The Fed, however, noted in a statement following the meeting that Powell did not discuss interest rate expectations with the president. “At the President’s invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments, including for growth, employment, and inflation. Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook. Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not slashing interest rates, saying earlier in May that communicating with the Fed chair was “like talking to a wall.” “The Bank of England cut. China cut. Everybody’s cutting but him. I don’t know, we’ll see what happens. It’s a shame. I call him ‘Too Late.’ Too Late Powell, that’s his nickname. And it’s a shame, it’s ridiculous… he’s always too late. But in this case, it’s not going to matter that much because our country is so strong, we’re so powerful in terms of economic strength and what we’ve done.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-13T16:29:28,"Ordinals price prediction 2025 – 2031: Can ORDI surge 100X?","Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $7.77 Market cap $163.07 24-hour trading volume $104.07M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $8.77 24-hour low $7.38 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 10.72% 50-day SMA $9.37 200-day SMA $17.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 61 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) ORDI price analysis: ORDI turns bearish On the day of writing (June 13), ORDI’s price dropped by 10.37% in 24 hours and 33.30% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume rose by 54.04% in 24 hours, as more traders positioned themselves in the bear market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDI/USD 1-day price chart. Source TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the William alligator trendlines, signaling a bearish market sentiment. The move comes as Bitcoin pulls back from $106,000. The signal and MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, with the histograms in negative territory signaling a bearish market. At the same time, the relative strength index shows that the price is in neutral territory at 41.15. It is oversold when it drops below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDI/USD 4-hour chart. Image source: TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI has reversed from last month’s high at $13.61 and is at $7.78, losing over 40% of its value.

ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is falling further as it corrects from the month’s high. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T16:22:26,"2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF Vs Competing Bitcoin Leverage","Summary BITX offers strong short-term returns and liquidity, but is not suitable for long-term holding due to leverage decay and high fees. Compared to peers, BITX leads in assets and volume, but lower-fee competitors like BITU and BTCL have outperformed on total return since July 2024. MSTR stock has delivered better long-term Bitcoin leverage than any 2x ETF, without the high management fees of BITX. While still bullish on Bitcoin, I advise caution with leverage now, as rising global conflict may pressure risk assets, including BTC. When I first covered the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BATS: BITX ) for Seeking Alpha back in late 2023 , I noted the fund offered juicy returns but that buyers of the ticker should be careful. As a leveraged fund, BITX is not intended for long-term holding and is designed for shorter-term trading. Still, given the sustained uptrend that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been in since the launch of BITX back late-June 2023, the fund's total return has actually been quite impressive for holders who have been hanging on this entire time. Data by YCharts While holding BITX since inception hasn't generated double the 250% return of BTC since it has certainly outperformed the coin itself. I have to repeat again that holding BITX this long is not what the fund is intended for. And buying the fund during large price surges can actually be quite detrimental to investor returns. But as the chart above shows, there are times when going long BTX offers a sizable upside. Could we be at another one of those times right now? In this update, we'll look at BITX compared to several other 'leveraged Bitcoin' options that the market has to offer. We'll also get into my technical view of BTC at this point in time and look at how Bitcoin reacted to the escalation in the Middle East during the morning hours of June 13th. BITX vs. Peers BITX is not the only leveraged Bitcoin fund in the market. For this comparison, we'll stack BITX up against the following funds: Proshares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ) T-Rex 2x Long Bitcoin Daily Target ETF ( BTCL ) CoinShares/Valkyrie Bitcoin Futures Leveraged Strategy ETF ( BTFX ) Fund Comparison BITX BITU BTCL BTFX Issuer Volatility Shares Trust ProShares Rex Valkyrie ETF Trust II Inception 06/27/2023 04/01/2024 07/09/2024 02/21/2024 Expense Ratio 1.90% 0.95% 0.95% 1.86% AUM $2.85B $1.17B $51.83M $16.91M Source: Seeking Alpha, June 13th In terms of assets under management, BITX is the clear winner of the four funds, with nearly $3 billion in AUM. BITU has just under $1.2 billion, while BTCL and BTFX don't even crack the $100 million threshold. BITX also happens to be the most expensive of the funds at 1.9%. My view is the expense matters more if you're planning to hold something for a long period of time. For leveraged funds like these, as long as the fees are somewhat close, holders shouldn't feel much of a difference in terms of total return. We'll get into that metric shortly. I think one of the reasons why BITX has such a large AUM advantage over the other funds - beyond simply benefiting from first mover advantage - is that it pays out monthly dividends: Dividends BITX BITU BTCL BTFX Dividend Yield (TTM) 11.61% 5.06% 3.96% - Dividend Rate (TTM) $6.32 $2.61 $2.12 - Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth 0 Years 0 Years 0 Years - Dividend Frequency Monthly Monthly None - Source: Seeking Alpha, June 13th At a trailing twelve-month yield of 11.6%, BITX might be more appealing to potential buyers due to its larger payout than each of the other funds. BTFX is the only one that doesn't pay a yield at all. Given three of these four funds pay out a yield and the varying expense ratios of the products, total return is an important consideration. In the chart below, I'm showing the total return of the four funds since the inception of the newest one, which is BTCL. If designed properly, these funds should generally perform in close tandem, and they do: Data by YCharts The out-performers are BITU and BTCL - given these are the two funds with the smallest expense ratios, this should not be surprising. What this tells us is that the yields offered by these funds are not strong enough reasons to hold leveraged funds longer than shareholders perhaps should. Another consideration is liquidity. As trading instruments, I would argue this matters far more than any dividend yield these products have to offer. Fund Liquidity BITX BITU BTCL BTFX AUM $2.85B $1.17B $51.83M $16.91M Average Daily Share Volume 7,499,749 2,231,130 82,910 6,615 Share Price $54.42 $51.53 $53.49 $52.78 Average Daily Dollar Volume $408.14M $114.97M $4.43M $349.16K Avg Vol/AUM* 14.3% 9.8% 7.7% 2.4% Source: Seeking Alpha, June 13th, *analyst's calculation Here, BITX has another large edge over the rest of the leveraged funds in the market. At 14.3% average daily volume to AUM, traders who buy BITX have a better chance of getting in and out of their trades at the prices they want due to the stronger level of liquidity that the fund has over peers. Just for kicks, we can also compare the total returns of these tickers to something like Strategy ( MSTR ) common stock. That company is using leverage to orchestrate a massive Bitcoin flywheel that is currently working quite well to positive feedback loop BTC prices higher. Data by YCharts Here we see that MSTR shares have actually worked better as 2x leverage on Bitcoin than any of the actual 2x leveraged funds have. While all of the leveraged funds have outperformed Bitcoin since the inception of BTCL in July 2024, only MSTR shares have generated price returns double that of BTC. In fact, the 190% return has actually been more than double the 83% return of Bitcoin. And the real kicker is, MSTR doesn't charge a 1.9% management fee. Price Action Indications While there are exceptions, I generally prefer to look at Bitcoin through the weekly chart rather than anything shorter when I'm assessing directional cues: Bitcoin Weekly Chart (TrendSpider) Something that I've been pointing out for years is the relationship between the 8 and 20-week simple MAs. These levels are still favoring bulls in my view, but the conviction is becoming concerning in the 20-week MA. Unlike the 8 weeks, the 20 is no longer in a clear uptrend. This could indicate that we're getting closer to a short-term top in the coin. I should also point out the fairly obvious negative divergence in the weekly RSI. New highs in coin price are accompanied by lower highs in RSI. This is typically viewed as bearish behavior. As was the early morning action on June 13th: 5-day BTC vs XAU (Seeking Alpha) As tribal as these investment communities can be, I'll reiterate that I've long been of the view that investors with an anti-fiat philosophy haven't had to choose between Bitcoin and Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) when they can simply buy both. Though I've primarily covered Bitcoin and Digital Assets for Seeking Alpha over the last several years, I've been an advocate for Gold for longer. The escalation between Israel and Iran was met with action in the financial markets. For better or worse, Gold was viewed as the safe, risk-off asset, while Bitcoin was viewed as the opposite. Closing Summary BITX will work perfectly fine as a short-term trade for Bitcoiners or speculators who want leverage on Bitcoin's price moves. Despite the fund not experiencing the level of decay that has been seen in other leveraged ETF products, I maintain that BITX is not a product that should be held long-term. For long-term Bitcoin leverage, MSTR has been a far better alternative. Whether that remains the case is unknowable. Finally, while I'm still bullish on Bitcoin and have my core position, I don't think this is the time to be playing around with leverage on top of what is already a volatile asset. Given the increasing level of global conflict, I suspect we'll see pressure on risk assets broadly. I doubt Bitcoin will be immune from that.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794712-2x-bitcoin-strategy-etf-bitx-vs-competing-leverage?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD|BITU|BTCL|BTFX|MSTR|BITX",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T16:20:15,"Israel Iran Conflict: Urgent Warning for Crypto Market Amid Geopolitical Risk","BitcoinWorld Israel Iran Conflict: Urgent Warning for Crypto Market Amid Geopolitical Risk The world is watching the Middle East with heightened concern. Recent reports indicate a significant escalation in rhetoric, with Israel’s Prime Minister’s office stating the country is prepared for a possible full-scale war with Iran. This statement, conveyed to Russian news agency TASS according to Walter Bloomberg on X, underscores the increasing geopolitical risk in a critical global region. While this news originates from political and military spheres, the interconnected nature of global finance means that such tensions inevitably cast a long shadow over various markets, including the dynamic and often volatile world of cryptocurrency. Understanding the Israel Iran Conflict: What Was Said? The core of the recent news revolves around a direct statement from the Israeli Prime Minister’s office. According to reports citing TASS and shared by Walter Bloomberg: The statement explicitly mentioned Israel’s readiness. It referred to the potential outbreak of a full-scale war. The potential adversary named was Iran. The communication was reportedly made to a Russian news agency. This kind of official communication, even relayed through third parties, signals a serious assessment of the current security situation and potential future scenarios by the Israeli government. It’s a stark reminder of the underlying tensions that have long existed between the two nations and their proxies in the region. How Does Geopolitical Risk Influence the Crypto Market? Geopolitical events, from regional conflicts to global pandemics, have a documented history of impacting financial markets. The cryptocurrency market, despite its decentralized ethos, is not immune to these external pressures. Here’s why: Investor Sentiment: Uncertainty breeds caution. When major international crises emerge, investors often move away from riskier assets, which crypto is generally perceived to be, towards perceived safer havens. Global Economy: Conflicts can disrupt supply chains, impact energy prices, trigger inflation, and influence central bank policies. These macroeconomic shifts directly affect liquidity and investor appetite for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Responses: Increased geopolitical tension can lead to new sanctions or stricter financial controls, potentially impacting how crypto is used or regulated internationally. Narrative Shifts: Crises often fuel narratives around alternative financial systems or ‘safe haven’ assets, which can sometimes benefit assets like Bitcoin, though this is debated. The Israel Iran conflict represents a significant source of geopolitical risk that market participants must consider. Analyzing the Potential Crypto Market Impact Predicting the exact impact of a potential Israel Iran conflict on the crypto market impact is complex, but we can outline potential scenarios based on historical reactions to similar events: Scenario 1: Initial Risk-Off Reaction Likely immediate effect: A sell-off across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Reasoning: Traders and investors reduce exposure to volatile assets during periods of high uncertainty. Historical parallel: Similar reactions were seen at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the initial stages of the conflict in Ukraine. Scenario 2: Bitcoin as a Contested Safe Haven Potential effect: After an initial dip, Bitcoin’s price might stabilize or even see inflows if the ‘digital gold’ or ‘safe haven’ narrative gains traction. Reasoning: Some investors view Bitcoin as an asset outside traditional financial systems and government control, potentially preserving value during geopolitical or economic turmoil. Challenge: Bitcoin’s volatility and correlation with traditional tech stocks often undermine its safe haven claim compared to assets like gold or government bonds. The narrative is not universally accepted or consistently proven during crises. Scenario 3: Broader Economic Fallout Potential effect: Sustained conflict could lead to significant disruptions in global energy markets, potentially spiking oil prices. This could fuel inflation, forcing central banks to maintain or even raise interest rates. Reasoning: Higher interest rates generally make risk assets less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Persistent inflation erodes purchasing power, potentially directing funds towards perceived inflation hedges, though crypto’s effectiveness here is also debated. Overall crypto market impact: A challenging environment characterized by reduced liquidity and cautious investor behavior. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is also influenced by internal factors like technological developments, regulatory news specific to crypto, and market cycles (like the Bitcoin halving). Geopolitical events add another layer of complexity. Is Bitcoin a True Safe Haven Amid Middle East Tension? The question of whether Bitcoin safe haven status holds during times of Middle East tension is a subject of ongoing debate within the financial community. Proponents argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, limited supply, and independence from traditional banking systems make it an ideal store of value when geopolitical or economic instability threatens fiat currencies and traditional assets. Arguments for Bitcoin as a Safe Haven: Decentralization: No single government or entity can seize or control Bitcoin. Limited Supply: The fixed supply (21 million coins) makes it potentially resistant to inflation caused by excessive money printing during crises. Accessibility: Can be accessed and transferred across borders relatively easily, potentially useful in regions facing capital controls or financial disruption. Arguments Against Bitcoin as a Safe Haven: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings are significantly larger than traditional safe havens like gold or the US dollar. This volatility undermines its reliability as a stable store of value in times of panic. Correlation with Risk Assets: Bitcoin has often shown high correlation with tech stocks and other risk-on assets, particularly during market downturns. It tends to fall when traditional markets fall. Market Maturity: The crypto market is still relatively young and less tested by prolonged, severe global crises compared to traditional assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto remains uncertain in many parts of the world, adding another layer of risk. While there have been instances where Bitcoin’s price surged during specific regional currency crises or periods of high inflation, its performance during broader global risk-off events (like early COVID-19 or the initial Ukraine invasion) has often mirrored that of other risk assets, experiencing sharp declines. Therefore, relying on Bitcoin safe haven status during significant Middle East tension carries considerable risk. Navigating Geopolitical Risk: Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders Given the potential for increased geopolitical risk stemming from the Israel Iran conflict and its potential crypto market impact, what steps can crypto investors consider? It’s important to approach this with caution and a long-term perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much volatility you can withstand. Geopolitical events can cause sudden and significant price swings. Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Consider whether your current allocation aligns with your risk tolerance in light of potential increased market instability. Are you overexposed to volatile assets? Stay Informed, But Avoid Panic: Follow reliable news sources regarding both the geopolitical situation and crypto market impact. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or hype. Diversification: While crypto itself is an asset class, consider diversification within crypto (e.g., not solely holding one coin) and across different asset classes if appropriate for your overall financial strategy. Consider Stablecoins: In periods of high volatility, some investors move a portion of their holdings into stablecoins to preserve capital, though stablecoins carry their own risks (e.g., counterparty risk, regulatory risk). Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term geopolitical shocks can be viewed as noise. However, sustained conflict with significant global economic repercussions could impact even long-term outlooks. Revisit your investment thesis. Security: Ensure your crypto holdings are stored securely in hardware wallets or reputable exchanges, especially during uncertain times. There are no guarantees in markets, particularly when unpredictable geopolitical factors are at play. The key is to be prepared, informed, and disciplined. The Middle East Tension and Broader Market Implications The Middle East tension, exacerbated by statements like the one from the Israeli PM’s office, doesn’t just affect crypto in isolation. It’s part of a larger global picture. Increased conflict in the region could lead to: Higher energy prices (oil, gas). Disruption of shipping routes. Increased defense spending by nations. Potential shifts in international alliances and trade relationships. These factors collectively contribute to a global economic environment that can be challenging for risk assets. The crypto market impact is filtered through these broader economic channels as well as direct investor sentiment. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in the Crypto Landscape The statement from the Israeli Prime Minister’s office regarding readiness for a full-scale war with Iran is a serious development that highlights significant geopolitical risk. While the news is not directly about cryptocurrency, the potential for conflict in the Middle East tension has clear implications for global financial markets, including the volatile crypto space. Investors should be aware of the potential crypto market impact, which could include initial downturns driven by risk aversion, followed by a possible (though uncertain) test of Bitcoin’s safe haven narrative. The broader economic consequences of a major Israel Iran conflict, such as inflation and energy price spikes, also pose headwinds for risk assets. Staying informed about both geopolitical developments and market reactions is crucial. Rather than reacting impulsively, investors should consider their risk tolerance, review their portfolio, and focus on a disciplined approach. The coming period may test the resilience of the crypto market against significant external pressures.

Will ADA Price Drop?","Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson, who attracted the market's attention with his statements, announced his $100 million proposal. According to Coindesk, Charles Hoskinson proposed converting $100 million worth of ADA reserves into Bitcoin (BTC) and local stablecoins USDM and USDA to revitalize and strengthen the DeFi and stablecoin ecosystem. “We can take the $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury, convert it into a mix of stablecoins on Cardano, namely USDM and USDA, and convert some of it into Bitcoin, which makes it Prime Bitcoin DeFi.” Hoskinson stated that with this proposal, he aims to increase the stablecoin-TVL ratio from 10% to 30-40%. Hoskinson said that the current 10% stablecoin-TVL ratio is killing Cardano. According to DefiLlama data, Cardano’s total TVL is $356 million, while the value of minted stablecoins is only $31 million. In comparison, Solana has $9.8 billion in TVL and $11 billion in stablecoins minted on-chain. There was criticism that the proposed $100 million sale would affect the price of ADA, but Hoskinson dismissed concerns about the price impact as unfounded. Hoskinson hit back at critics for being inexperienced, adding that the sale would not cause any problems. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) is going mainstream, as both governments and public companies continue accumulating the asset. On Friday, June 13, Matador Technologies published a weekly report on institutional Bitcoin adoption. According to the Canada-based financial technology firm, public companies are accelerating their Bitcoin accumulation. 1/ 🏛️ Regulatory momentum in U.S. Congress •CLARITY (crypto market structure) and GENIUS (stablecoin framework) bills are advancing, with bipartisan support and a bitcoin‑friendly CFTC chair nominee Brian Quintenz. •This marks a turning point: clearer regulation unlocking… — Matador Technologies (@buymatador) June 13, 2025 The company reports that 22 public firms accumulated approximately $11.3 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past month. GameStop led the wave, acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin with its $1.75 billion convertible note. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet is targeting a 210,000 Bitcoin treasury. According to the Matador Technologies report, the main driver of corporate adoption is the regulatory momentum around crypto in the U.S. Currently, U.S. legislators are reviewing two bills: the CLARITY Act, which addresses the overall crypto market structure, and the GENIUS Act, which focuses on stablecoins. You might also like: Citigroup sees stablecoin issuers among top US Treasury holders by 2030 U.S. moves forward with reserves, other countries follow Another key development, according to Matador Technologies, is the rise of sovereign Bitcoin reserves. The U.S. is taking the lead, with President Donald Trump formalizing a Bitcoin strategic reserve on March 6. The federal government currently holds around 200,000 Bitcoin, mostly originating from asset seizures. In addition, U.S. states including Texas and Arizona are considering their own Bitcoin reserves — signaling strong political momentum behind Bitcoin adoption. Other countries, including Japan, Brazil, Czech Republic, Pakistan, are also considering their own Bitcoin treasury allocations. Still, a recent scandal in the Czechia related to a Bitcoin donation highlights the political risk of such moves. Rising adoption, both at the corporate and governmental level, is making Bitcoin increasingly resilient to volatility.

The buying wick printed on the latest daily candle confirms a strong reaction from what appears to be a maximum value zone. Pi Network’s ( PI ) price action took a steep hit as it fell below the value area low and traded directly into a macro swing low support. However, this flush was met with immediate demand, leading to a sharp intraday recovery and a strong close back above high-timeframe support. The technical bounce was characterized by a prominent buying tail, a classic signature of value-based demand, now placing Pi in a potential reversal zone Key technical points Break Below Value Area Low: Price dipped under the VAL and found strong buy-side pressure at the swing low region. Impressive Recovery Candle: The wick and close above support confirm aggressive market interest and demand. Reclaiming the Value Area Low: Sustained closes above this level confirm validation of the demand zone. Key Resistance at $0.65: Breaking this dynamic resistance would confirm a trend shift and open room for a move toward $0.80. PiNetwork (6H) Chart, Source: TradingView The drop below the value area low initially looked like a breakdown, but Pi Network’s price quickly reversed after reaching a key swing low, a high-interest liquidity pocket. The strong buying tail formed on the candle reflects not only rejection of lower prices but also signals the presence of maximum value buyers stepping into the market. Price has now closed back above the high-timeframe support and is showing signs of acceptance above the value area low. This reclaim is critical. From a market profile perspective, acceptance back above the value area low after a failed breakdown often signals a trap and provides high-probability long setups.

2025-06-13T16:10:11,"Anthony Pompliano’s ProCapBTC Pursues Massive $750M Bitcoin Investment via SPAC","BitcoinWorld Anthony Pompliano’s ProCapBTC Pursues Massive $750M Bitcoin Investment via SPAC Big news is circulating in the crypto world, and it involves a familiar name: Anthony Pompliano . The founder of Pomp Investments is reportedly embarking on an ambitious venture aimed squarely at acquiring a substantial amount of Bitcoin. This development signals a potential new avenue for significant Bitcoin investment , particularly through traditional financial structures. Who is Anthony Pompliano and What’s ProCapBTC’s Plan? Anthony Pompliano, widely known as “Pomp,” is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space. He’s an entrepreneur, investor, and commentator who has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and digital assets for years. His firm, Pomp Investments, focuses on building and investing in companies within the crypto industry. Now, according to a report by the Financial Times, Pomp is set to take the helm as CEO of a new public entity called ProCapBTC . The core mission of ProCapBTC is straightforward yet significant: to raise a substantial war chest specifically for purchasing Bitcoin. The target amount is a staggering $750 million. This move positions ProCapBTC as a dedicated vehicle for large-scale exposure to the leading cryptocurrency, potentially attracting investors who prefer accessing digital assets through publicly traded companies. Leveraging a Crypto SPAC for the Bitcoin Investment How does ProCapBTC plan to raise this considerable sum? The strategy involves merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) named Columbus Circle Capital 1. This mechanism is essentially a shortcut for a private company (ProCapBTC) to become publicly traded without going through the traditional initial public offering (IPO) process. The SPAC merger is intended to facilitate the capital raise in two parts: $500 million: Expected to be raised through equity, likely from investors participating in the SPAC transaction. $250 million: Planned through convertible debt, which can later be converted into equity under certain conditions. This approach highlights the increasing use of financial engineering, including the Crypto SPAC structure, to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset market. SPACs offer speed and a degree of certainty compared to traditional IPOs, although they also come with their own set of risks and complexities. The Significance of a $750M Institutional Bitcoin Purchase A planned $750 million purchase of Bitcoin is a significant event, regardless of who is behind it. When a public company is specifically formed and capitalized with the explicit goal of holding Bitcoin, it underscores the growing trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. This isn’t just another fund allocating a small percentage; it’s a company built around the asset itself. Why is this happening? Several factors likely contribute: Demand: There is clear and growing demand from institutional investors and potentially retail investors via public markets for exposure to Bitcoin. Accessibility: A public company structure makes it easier for many types of investors, including institutions with strict mandates, to gain exposure compared to buying and holding Bitcoin directly. Belief in Bitcoin: Pomp and his associates are strong believers in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a store of value and digital gold. If successful, ProCapBTC would join a growing list of publicly traded companies holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets, although its model appears to be primarily focused on being a Bitcoin acquisition vehicle rather than an operating business that happens to hold Bitcoin. Challenges and Opportunities for ProCapBTC While the plan is ambitious, executing a $750 million Bitcoin investment through a SPAC merger isn’t without its hurdles. Potential challenges include: Market Volatility: The price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. The value of ProCapBTC’s holdings would fluctuate significantly, impacting its share price. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and public companies dealing with them is still evolving. Execution Risk: Completing the SPAC merger and successfully raising the targeted $750 million requires navigating complex financial and legal processes. Premium to NAV: Publicly traded Bitcoin holding companies often trade at a premium or discount to the actual value of the Bitcoin they hold (Net Asset Value – NAV), which can add another layer of complexity for investors. However, the opportunities are also significant. If successful, ProCapBTC could become a major player providing accessible exposure to Bitcoin for a wide range of investors. The involvement of a well-known figure like Anthony Pompliano could lend credibility and attract investor interest. What to Watch For For those interested in this development, several key milestones are worth monitoring: Completion of the SPAC merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1. Successful execution of the $750 million capital raise (equity and debt). Confirmation of Pomp’s role as CEO. Details regarding the timing and strategy for the actual Bitcoin investment purchases. This initiative by ProCapBTC , led by Pomp, is a clear indicator of the continued drive to integrate digital assets into traditional financial frameworks and facilitate large-scale Institutional Bitcoin adoption. Conclusion The reported plan for Anthony Pompliano to lead ProCapBTC in a $750 million Bitcoin investment via a Crypto SPAC merger is a compelling development in the ongoing story of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. It represents a bold attempt to create a dedicated, publicly traded vehicle for significant Bitcoin exposure. While challenges exist, the potential for providing traditional investors with easier access to the world’s leading cryptocurrency is substantial. This move underscores the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset and the innovative ways the market is finding to meet investor demand.

2025-06-13T16:04:08,"Bitcoin Remains Above $100K For a Month: Nexchain Gains Huge Momentum in Crypto Presale","Bitcoin’s sustained price above $100K has sent a wave of bullish energy across the entire crypto market. While Bitcoin continues to solidify its position as a store of value, altcoin investors are hunting for the next big breakout. One presale project making waves during this bull run is Nexchain, an AI-powered Layer 1 blockchain that has raised over $4.4 million and is emerging as a standout name in the crypto presale space. Nexchain Crypto Presale Momentum Grows With $4.4M Raised In a sea of token sales, Nexchain is rapidly becoming the leading crypto presale to watch in 2025. The project has already raised $4.4 million in its Stage 18, offering tokens at $0.07 with a projected listing price of $0.30. That’s a promising 429% return on investment (ROI) for early adopters. But Nexchain isn’t just about numbers; it’s built on solid fundamentals. It’s an AI-integrated Layer 1 blockchain capable of processing 400,000 transactions per second, thanks to its hybrid consensus mechanism. It also introduces a unique reward system: holders earn daily gas fee revenue, creating a sustainable incentive model. From a security perspective, Nexchain scores major credibility points. Certik , a leading blockchain security firm, audits the platform. The doxxed team, public roadmap, and an active Telegram and X (formerly Twitter) community demonstrate that Nexchain is here for the long term. With an intuitive 3-click buy process, Nexchain has made it incredibly simple for retail investors to participate in its crypto presale, eliminating the need for technical expertise. In an era where scam concerns prevail, Nexchain stands out with its transparency, usability, and tangible progress. Bitcoin Above $100K Creates Bullish Environment Bitcoin’s strong performance has long been a bellwether for broader market behavior. Now, as it holds above the $100,000 mark for over a month, confidence in the crypto space is soaring. Institutional capital is flowing in again, and retail investors are returning with optimism. In this bullish climate, presales are gaining renewed attention. Investors who missed the early Bitcoin gains are now turning to high-potential ICO opportunities with strong fundamentals and promising upside. This is where Nexchain fits perfectly. The current Bitcoin rally isn’t just boosting BTC; it’s revitalizing the entire altcoin ecosystem. And among hundreds of presales, Nexchain’s performance stands out. While other projects hype up vague promises, Nexchain already offers a testable framework, ongoing development, and verified team credentials. It’s in the right place at the right time, and that’s creating serious momentum in its crypto presale. Why Nexchain May Be a Smart Diversification Move Smart investors know the value of diversifying during bull markets. While Bitcoin remains a blue-chip asset, the real gains in 2025 may come from well-positioned early-stage projects with utility, and that’s exactly what Nexchain offers. Being early in a project like Nexchain means maximizing upside. At $0.07 per token, the potential for exponential growth is substantial, especially when considering the $0.30 listing price and the limited token supply. That’s a powerful incentive for both short-term speculators and long-term believers. Nexchain also brings something BTC doesn’t: real-world blockchain utility. From daily gas-sharing rewards to high-speed Layer-1 architecture, this isn’t a meme token. The transparent roadmap, steady progress updates, and Certik audit give it the credibility many presales lack. In today’s market, many tokens are fueled purely by speculation. Nexchain, however, is a functioning tech with visible milestones, backed by a real team. For those already holding BTC, adding Nexchain to the portfolio may be a smart hedge with huge growth potential. It’s more than hype, it’s a solid diversification play in an increasingly bullish market. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Final Window Before the Listing Bitcoin’s continued strength has reignited investor interest across the board. But the biggest opportunity may lie in early-stage projects that are already delivering results, and Nexchain is proving to be one of them. With over $4.3 million raised, a working blockchain product, and a Certik-audited foundation, Nexchain is building a track record of transparency and real progress. As its crypto presale nears its final stages, experts are urging investors not to miss out on what could be the last opportunity before its listing on major exchanges. The time to act is now, before Nexchain moves out of presale pricing and into the spotlight.

The sudden spike in volatility pushed Ethereum away from its recent highs, as it retraced after failing to break above the critical $3,000 resistance level. This marks a pivotal moment for ETH, which had shown strong momentum in recent sessions before being hit by the broader market downturn. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeats History – Key Support Holds Again Ahead Of Potential Rally Despite the sharp correction, top analyst Quinten Francois remains optimistic. He pointed to the ETH/BTC pair, which continues to look strong relative to other assets. According to Francois, this pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle—a pattern that often precedes a breakout to the upside if support holds. With Bitcoin holding near its range highs, Ethereum’s performance against BTC could serve as a leading indicator for the broader altcoin market. Now, Ethereum stands at a crossroads. A bounce from current levels could renew bullish momentum and re-establish the $2,800–$3,000 range as the launchpad for higher prices. But failure to hold support may trigger another wave of downside pressure. All eyes are on ETH/BTC as markets brace for what comes next. Ethereum Holds Key Level Against BTC Ethereum has been leading the crypto market with impressive strength since April, posting a remarkable surge of over 100% from its lows near $1,400. This steep recovery highlights Ethereum’s growing momentum, positioning it as a potential frontrunner in triggering the next altseason. The asset’s consistent performance above key support levels and its resilience during market dips have renewed bullish sentiment, with traders increasingly focusing on ETH as the key asset to watch. Many analysts believe Ethereum could be the spark that reignites capital rotation into altcoins. Its breakout from a month-long range, combined with increasing DeFi activity and improving on-chain metrics, has added to the bullish case. However, caution remains. Ongoing geopolitical tensions—particularly the recent escalation between Israel and Iran—are injecting volatility into global markets, including crypto. These developments have disrupted otherwise promising technical setups across the board, leading to uncertainty and risk-off sentiment. Quinten Francois commented on the current climate, noting that “some charts don’t look good, others are holding on by a thread.” However, he singled out the ETH/BTC pair as a relative strength signal, stating that it “still looks good.” This pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle—a structure that, if defended, could pave the way for a continuation of ETH’s dominance over Bitcoin. In this environment, Ethereum’s performance—especially relative to BTC—could determine the broader market’s next phase. If ETH/BTC holds and breaks higher, the door opens for a full altseason run. But a failure to hold could reinforce caution and signal a pause across the crypto market. For now, Ethereum remains the most important chart to watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Previous Resistance As Support – Can Bulls Defend This Level? ETH Faces Sharp Rejection After Tagging Range Highs Ethereum is facing a crucial technical test after a strong rejection near the $2,830 resistance level. The chart shows ETH failing to hold above the highlighted supply zone between $2,700 and $2,830, where sellers stepped in aggressively. This resulted in a sharp breakdown that sliced through the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) on the 4-hour timeframe, now positioning ETH around $2,512. What’s more concerning is the spike in volume during the breakdown. This confirms the strength behind the move, signaling panic among bulls and potential distribution by short-term holders. ETH is now holding just above a previous support zone from early June, but the current setup suggests uncertainty and risk of further downside. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tests Ascending Channel Resistance – Breakout Or Breakdown? Unless Ethereum can reclaim the $2,600–$2,620 area soon, the next likely target could be the $2,400 level, where the next strong demand cluster sits.

2025-06-13T15:58:09,"Solana’s $400 Price Target Gets Bold Confirmation as Analyst Predicts “VIOLENT” Breakout Despite 60% Drop","Major cryptocurrency Solana is looking to shrug off a recent price pullback to continue its bullish price activity. The 6th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is among the most widely used digital currencies, with significant use cases emerging in recent years. The Solana ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) is slowly inching towards a $10 billion valuation, making it the center of attention for crypto investors. However, despite being one of the most developed and used cryptocurrency networks, SOL is struggling to translate this impressive on-chain performance into price gains. It set a new All Time High (ATH) of around $294 in December, but that came and went, with SOL reporting more than 60% losses in the ensuing months. Currently trading at $147, the digital currency is somewhat in the middle of things, prompting investors to scratch their heads regarding the coin’s future. SOL to Rise to $400? However, a popular crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), @AltcoinGordon, has tweeted that SOL is looking to post a massive price breakout after Bitcoin posted a new ATH earlier this week. He stated: “The next leg up for $SOL is going to be VIOLENT. My blue lines NEVER fail. Bitcoin just made an ATH, but that is NOTHING compared to what is coming for Solana. Do you understand?” SOL Recent Price Action Solana is known as the “blockchain that never sleeps,” but its recent price performance is one to forget, especially in a bullish setup. Here is the graph from the last 30 days: The last four weeks or so have been a story of a dogged price performance. The cryptocurrency was flat for a large part of May, and it had just started to appreciate a week ago, and got close to $190. However, even that bullish action didn’t last long, and the bears forced it back below $180. This happened even as Bitcoin and several altcoins posted new ATHs amid a recent surge in the general altcoin market. SOL is still quite a distance away from its $295 ATH, and even then, it struggles to hold on to any small gains. SOL TVL Forecasts Better Times Ahead The TVL of the SOL’s ecosystem has reached a new high of $9.6 billion and is set to breach the $10 billion valuation in the near future. This important indicator and a string of on-chain analytics show that it is only a matter of time before SOL reignites its much-anticipated bull market.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/solanas-400-price-target-gets-bold-confirmation-as-analyst-predicts-violent-breakout-despite-60-drop/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T15:48:29,"Ripple’s XRP Crazy Explosion to $10 Price In The Cards As Metrics Show Insane XRP Momentum","XRP, one of the most recognized names in the digital asset space, may be approaching a decisive moment. Recent technical analysis suggests that XRP’s six-year consolidation period mirrors the pattern that led to its dramatic surge in 2017. Could this setup ignite another breakout? XRP Six Years of Compression: A Setup or a Stall? Since 2018, XRP price has traded within a compressed range, fluctuating between $0.20 and $0.60 for long periods. At the time of writing, XRP was priced at around $2.14. This prolonged stagnation has frustrated investors waiting for a decisive move. However, analysts on X argue that extended consolidation phases often precede explosive moves to the long-awaited $10 price. Amelie noted on May 25 that XRP’s chart setup closely mirrors its 2017 breakout pattern. In 2017, XRP skyrocketed from under $0.30 to above $3.30 within weeks, delivering one of crypto’s most dramatic rallies. The principle of “the longer the consolidation, the stronger the breakout” underpins this comparison. XRP’s current consolidation began around early 2018, following the broader crypto market’s correction from its 2017 highs. Unlike then, today’s environment features matured infrastructure, greater regulatory clarity, and expanding use cases for XRP . As noted in the U.S. Faster Payments Council’s 2025 report, Ripple’s partnerships with global financial institutions signal that XRP is not just riding technical patterns but also benefiting from real-world adoption. According to CoinShares’ recent fund flows report (May 20), XRP witnessed $37.2 million in outflows, ending an 80-week inflow streak. This shift in sentiment underscores how external factors, including legal decisions and regulatory actions, continue to impact XRP’s price dynamics . These outflows occurred against a backdrop of consolidation and building momentum, suggesting the market may be repositioning. Key Levels and Market Sentiment XRP’s trading volume jumped 18% over the past week, reflecting growing trader interest. Meanwhile, open interest in XRP futures contracts on major exchanges has risen to $1.5 billion, signaling that leveraged traders are preparing for a potential move. While the echoes of 2017 are undeniable, today’s market is far from identical. Regulatory pressures remain a wildcard, with Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC last year providing some relief but leaving uncertainties unresolved. XRP/USDT| Source: TradingView The broader macroeconomic environment, including U.S. interest rates and Bitcoin’s movements, will also influence XRP’s trajectory. For traders watching XRP, the key lies in whether it can break through its resistance levels and sustain upward momentum. As Amelie’s analysis suggests, the long wait might finally be nearing an inflection point, but traders must remain cautious given the complex interplay of technical, regulatory, and macro factors.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-crazy-explosion-to-10-price-in-the-cards-as-metrics-show-insane-xrp-momentum/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T15:47:11,"Gold and Silver Gained Value While Risky Assets Including Crypto Market Dropped After Israel Attacked Iran! Here is All the Data","Cryptocurrency markets fell sharply after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear and missile infrastructure, sparking a broader sell-off in global risk assets. Crypto Markets Fall as Geopolitical Tensions Rise as Israel Attacks Iran While Bitcoin remained stable despite the decline in the overall crypto sector, the SOL ETF lost about 10% of its value despite expectations. Bitcoin (BTC) lost 2.9% and traded around $102,664. In contrast, gold, considered a traditional safe haven, rose 1.3% and approached an all-time high of $3,445 per ounce. The Israeli attack, which reportedly targeted senior Iranian military officials, came shortly after the International Atomic Energy Agency accused Iran of violating limits on uranium enrichment. Iran retaliated by launching 100 suicide drones into Israeli territory. Although the US denied involvement, the attack rattled markets and sent stocks plunging worldwide. Market Impact Across Asset Classes The ripple effect has spread far beyond cryptocurrencies: Japan's Nikkei index fell 0.89%. Euro Stoxx 50 lost 1.37%. U.S. futures were broadly lower, with the E-mini Nasdaq-100 down 1.42%. Oil prices rose and settled after Brent crude gained more than 14%. Gold and silver gained, reflecting the risk aversion trend. In the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) was more affected than Bitcoin and fell by 8.81% to $2,523. Solana ETF Momentum Overshadowed The SEC reportedly requested an update to the Solana ETF S-1 filing, causing a brief spike, according to Wintermute OTC trader Jake Ostrovskis. Bloomberg analysts rate the probability of approval by the end of the year at 90%. But the geopolitical shock quickly erased those gains. “Markets appear to be underexposed to SOL and related assets, which could create interesting opportunities once volatility subsides,” Ostrovskis said. Derivatives and the Liquidity Shake There was a significant easing in the derivatives markets: Total open interest (OI) fell from $55 billion to $49.3 billion. Binance alone lost $2.5 billion worth of OI overnight. Put/call ratios on Deribit have risen, indicating a defensive shift among investors (BTC: 1.28, ETH: 1.25) Funding rates turned negative and altcoins like DOT, LINK, and 1000SHIB showed sharp declines. Despite the sell-off, BTC leverage remains high, with $84 million of long-side open positions between $102,000 and $104,000 still at risk if downward pressure resumes. Spot ETF Flows Continue to Support Crypto As markets react to tensions in the Middle East, flows into crypto ETFs remain strong: BTC spot ETFs have seen inflows of $939 million since the beginning of the month. ETH spot ETFs recorded $811 million in inflows, including $112 million on June 12 alone, marking 19 consecutive days of positive flows. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T15:43:27,"Cardano Founder Says the Biggest Threat to Bitcoin’s Dominance Is Cardano","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has reaffirmed his longstanding position that Cardano represents the most significant challenge to Bitcoin’s dominance. According to Hoskinson , Cardano’s trajectory over the past seven years reflects a consistent adherence to the foundational principles of decentralization and sound monetary policy. He stated that Cardano's community has stayed true to promises made at the outset, emphasizing that its technological advancements have addressed long-standing limitations in the Bitcoin network.Technological Advancements and Governance ModelsHoskinson pointed to several developments in Cardano that, in his view, surpassed Bitcoin’s innovation pace. Notably, he referenced the Extended UTXO model, which expands on Bitcoin’s own UTXO structure, allowing for smart contract support while maintaining a similar security architecture. He also highlighted Cardano’s Plutus programming language, which enables advanced decentralized applications, and the platform’s integration of on-chain governance, which he described as a superior decision-making framework compared to Bitcoin’s informal consensus process.Building on these technical milestones, Hoskinson argued that Cardano successfully translated early Bitcoin ecosystem ideas—such as colored coins and Lightning Network innovations—into functioning features. He asserted that many of these innovations were originally discussed within the Bitcoin community but never prioritized in Bitcoin's official development roadmap. As a result, Cardano has positioned itself, in Hoskinson’s view, as the ecosystem that “finished the work” envisioned by early Bitcoin developers.Decentralization, Security, and Network StabilityMeanwhile, the Cardano network has operated for seven years without downtime, hacks, or major failures. Hoskinson emphasized that its proof-of-stake consensus achieves comparable security to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system, while also delivering greater energy efficiency and scalability. He cited nine years of peer-reviewed research, simulations, and formal methods development that culminated in the current stable state of the Cardano blockchain.This focus on long-term development aligns with the Cardano founder’s belief that blockchain success should be measured not solely by market price or user adoption, but by technical integrity and resilience. He stressed that the network’s resilience and evolution reinforce Cardano's claim to being “sound money,” a term often used by Bitcoin supporters to describe their asset.Institutional Momentum and Bitcoin’s Future RoleHowever, Hoskinson also acknowledged Bitcoin’s growing institutional support. In a prior interview with Bitcoin Magazine, he discussed how Bitcoin’s integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) has progressed due to upgrades like Taproot, which introduced new capabilities for programmability. He noted that this evolution enables Bitcoin to participate in DeFi more effectively, with Cardano’s architecture providing a compatible platform through its own UTXO-based design.Hoskinson further addressed the impact of institutional involvement on Bitcoin’s market trajectory. He mentioned that entities such as BlackRock , which now holds over 600,000 Bitcoin tokens, and support from parts of the U.S. government, contribute to significant market momentum. He projected that Bitcoin could reach a price range between $250,000 and $500,000 within two years, with the potential to hit $1 million by decade’s end, fueled by adoption from Fortune 500 companies.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/13/cardano-founder-says-the-biggest-threat-to-bitcoins-dominance-is-cardano/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-founder-says-the-biggest-threat-to-bitcoins-dominance-is-cardano,"ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Latest Cardano (ADA) Crypto News Today",cryptocompare

Key Takeaways: Brian Daly’s appointment signals a more industry-savvy approach to fund and crypto regulation. Kurt Hohl returns to the SEC with a focus on strengthening financial reporting standards. The new leadership shift under Chairman Paul Atkins is seen as a positive for digital asset innovation. Brian T. Daly will take over as Director of the Division of Investment Management on July 8, while Kurt Hohl will assume the role of Chief Accountant on July 7. The new appointments come after crypto-friendly Paul Atkins was sworn in as Chairman of the SEC in April, marking a leadership shift that is being welcomed by the digital asset industry. SEC’s Brian Daly Brings Decades of Fund Advisory Experience to Top Role Daly, a seasoned figure in the investment management legal sphere, brings decades of experience advising hedge funds, asset managers, and private investment firms. His background includes senior roles at Akin Gump and Schulte Roth & Zabel, as well as in-house compliance leadership at top-tier funds like Millennium Partners and Raptor Capital. Daly’s appointment signals a potential shift toward rulemaking that is more attuned to industry dynamics, including evolving digital asset strategies within traditional fund structures. “Brian has deep familiarity with all levels of the investment management industry,” said Atkins. Daly added that he is eager to help tailor regulation “within statutory authority” while maintaining strong compliance expectations for advisers and fund managers. His track record suggests a regulatory approach grounded in legal precision and institutional pragmatism, qualities likely to influence how crypto-related fund products, like spot ETH or BTC ETFs, are evaluated moving forward. Alongside Daly, the return of Kurt Hohl as Chief Accountant brings added weight to the SEC’s oversight capabilities. It's personnel day at the SEC. – Jamie Selway has officially been named T&M director. – Akin Gump partner Brian Daly has been picked to lead the agency's Investment Management division. – Kurt Hohl is joining the agency as chief accountant. https://t.co/wu7RQLEAWl — Declan Harty (@declanharty) June 13, 2025 With nearly four decades of auditing experience, including a lengthy tenure as a partner at Ernst & Young, Hohl’s focus will be on strengthening accounting standards and transparency, key issues as more crypto firms seek to go public or comply with U.S. disclosure laws. Hohl previously served at the SEC in the 1990s, where he authored the foundational Financial Reporting Manual. His return signals a renewed focus on rigorous reporting and clarity in financial statements, especially relevant for crypto-native companies navigating IPOs or stablecoin disclosures. “At a time when capital markets are evolving rapidly, these appointments position the SEC to respond more effectively to both innovation and investor protection,” Atkins said. SEC Drops Biden-Era Lawsuits Under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC has already withdrawn or delayed several prominent cases against crypto firms. The agency dropped its lawsuits against Coinbase and Cumberland DRW earlier this year, and a separate investigation into Uniswap Labs closed in February without enforcement action. Last week, the agency also closed its investigation into CyberKongz , a prominent Ethereum-based NFT and gaming project, with no enforcement action taken. More recently, the SEC announced it would not pursue further legal action against Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, the founder of Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX.

2025-06-13T15:20:50,"Positive U.S. Regulatory Environment More Conducive for Crypto Corporate Activity: JPMorgan","Expectations of a more benign regulatory environment in the U.S. is leading to an increase in the number of crypto companies looking to go public and an uplift in venture capital (VC) funding, investment bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. The GENIUS Act's progress in the Senate has become a ""key factor in anticipating a clearer and more supportive regulatory environment,"" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. ""The anticipation of such a U.S. regulatory environment is conducive to crypto corporate activity such as IPOs and VC funding,"" the authors wrote. The Senate's Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act mandates federal regulation for stablecoins with a market cap of over $10 billion with the potential for state regulation if it aligns with federal rules. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets and are also used to transfer money internationally. The bank noted that the number of crypto IPOs so far this year matches the pace of offerings seen in the bull market of 2021. Press reports suggest that more crypto companies, including Ripple, Kraken , Consenys and CoinDesk's owner Bullish are getting ready to IPO this year, the report said. Venture capital funding is also on the rise, and has exceeded levels seen in 2023/24, on an annualized basis, the bank said. IPOs give crypto investors a way to diversify their digital asset exposure beyond just bitcoin BTC and ether ETH, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. It means they can take advantage of opportunities in areas such as blockchain infrastructure, payments and settlement, custody and tokenization, the report added.

2025-06-13T15:20:18,"Here Are Perfect Times to Buy and Sell Bitcoin Based on Halving Cycles","A prominent Bitcoin trader has suggested the perfect time for market participants to buy and sell BTC for optional gains, referencing the Bitcoin halving cycles. The Bitcoin halving , which helps reduce the premier crypto asset's daily issuance rate, has historically served as an important factor for investors looking to evaluate Bitcoin's price action, especially with respect to its cyclical movements.Bitcoin Investment Strategy Around the Bitcoin HalvingWhile some of these assessments have been rather undependable, trader Mags, who calls himself ""the scalping pro"" has recently called attention to a structure that could assist investors who are willing to play the long game when it comes to Bitcoin.In a disclosure yesterday, Mags identified a simple Bitcoin investing strategy that may help with maximizing gains. Specifically, he centered the strategy around the Bitcoin halving cycles, identifying precisely when to buy BTC before the halving and when to sell off one's bag after the halving.According to Mags, investors who want to time the market perfectly should buy Bitcoin 500 days before the next halving is expected to occur. After this, they should hold onto their Bitcoin bag and do nothing. Meanwhile, once it is 500 days after the halving, Mags advises that they sell off their tokens. They can then repeat this process ahead of the next halving.Bitcoin's Cyclical Movements Around the HalvingData from his chart shows the analytical bearing of this investment advice. Interestingly, Bitcoin tends to be near its bottom price of the cycle about 500 days before the next halving. In addition, the crypto asset draws closer to its cycle top 500 days after the halving.The chart suggests that this pattern has continued to play out since the second halving in history, which occurred on July 9, 2016. Specifically, Bitcoin had dropped to around $230 in late February 2015, about 500 days before this halving. Meanwhile, by late November 2017, also 500 days after the halving, BTC had surged to $11,800, close to that cycle's top. Bitcoin Cyclical Movements Around the Bitcoin Halving | Mags Further, BTC collapsed to a low of around $3,700 by December 2018, 500 days before the third halving. After the third halving occurred on May 11, 2020, Bitcoin's price surged to $50,000 about 500 days later, specifically in September 2021. This was also close to the cycle's top.Now, the trend appears to also be playing out in the ongoing cycle. Notably, Bitcoin slumped to a cycle low of $16,000 in early December 2022, about 500 days before the latest halving which occurred on April 20, 2024. Interestingly, 500 days after the halving is in September 2025, and Mags expect BTC to reach new highs then.The September 2025 TimelineInterestingly, the September 2025 timeline aligns with predictions from other analysts for when Bitcoin could reach its cycle top. Last month, market veteran Peter Brandt suggested Bitcoin could reach its top for this cycle in August to September 2025, projecting a top price of $150,000.Also, analyst EGRAG predicted last October that Bitcoin's cycle top could come up in mid to late 2025. While Mags' Bitcoin halving template does not perfectly identify Bitcoin's cycle bottom and top, it has proven to be accurate in pointing out prices close to these regions. Meanwhile, the trader failed to provide a definitive target for his cycle top. Despite this, his chart points to a price around the $160,000 mark. BTC currently trades for $104,745, down 1% this week. To claim $160,000, the asset must rise 52% from the current level.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/13/here-are-perfect-times-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin-based-on-halving-cycles/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-perfect-times-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin-based-on-halving-cycles,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T15:15:57,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Plunges After Major Escalation In Middle East Tensions","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses for a third consecutive day, plunging to a low of $102,832 as markets turned bearish thanks to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Tensions flared up after Israel conducted preemptive strikes on Iranian military facilities, worsening market sentiment. Traders hopeful of a move past $111,000 were stunned as geopolitical realities meant bullish sentiment around BTC evaporated. The flagship cryptocurrency has rebounded to reclaim $105,000 but remains trading in the red. Bitcoin (BTC) Traders Prepare For Volatility Bitcoin (BTC) traders and holders are bracing for increased volatility after on-chain data revealed a steady decline in exchange and OTC balances, indicating a tightening supply as traders begin accumulating the asset. Retail investor activity is also subdued, making it an unusual backdrop for an asset pushing towards all-time highs. As demand grows, centralized exchanges have reported substantial declines in their Bitcoin balance. Balances have plunged over 14% since the beginning of 2025 to 2.5 million BTC , a level last seen in August 2022. A declining supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges typically indicates growing investor confidence as they move their assets into cold storage. However, this also reduces the liquid supply of the asset, leading to a spike in prices. Over-the-counter (OTC) Bitcoin numbers are also showing a drop in supply. While OTC desks operate by matching buyers and sellers, they rely on BTC reserves to facilitate quick and credible transactions. However, these reserves are also at historic lows, with CryptoQuant data revealing OTC addresses associated with miners have reported a 19% drop in Bitcoin balances since January. With exchange and OTC reserves drying up, the supply is shrinking rapidly. This could amplify price movements as demand for an increasingly scarce asset rises. Liquidations Rattle Crypto Bitcoin (BTC) slumped below $106,000 on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. The decline continued on Friday, falling to an intraday low of $102,832 before rebounding. Bitcoin’s sudden decline sent alarm bells ringing across crypto, with the mood gloomy as sellers hold a distinct advantage. The drop dragged the crypto market down as well, with its market cap plummeting to $3.24 trillion. A total of $645 million in long and short positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours, with $297 million tied to Bitcoin longs alone. Data from Coinglass highlighted a massive $201 million liquidation on a BTC /USDT trade. GameStop’s Bitcoin Bid Sends Shares Into Freefall GameStop’s plan to add more Bitcoin to its balance sheet by boosting its private convertible note offering to $2.25 billion sent its share tanking 22%. The move by the video game and consumer electronics retailer indicates a firm commitment to building its corporate Bitcoin treasury. The sale of the boosted convertible note offering is expected to conclude on Tuesday. GameStop expects to raise $2.23 billion from the offering or $2.68 billion if the purchasers exercise their right to purchase additional notes in full. The boosted offering is a $500 million increase from the initial $1.75 billion announced on Wednesday. The funding round comes after the retailer announced the purchase of 4,710 BTC , valued at around $513 million. The purchase came two months after the company announced plans to build a Bitcoin treasury. GameStop plans to use the funds raised from the offering for general corporate purposes, including investments consistent with GameStop’s investment policy, hinting at more Bitcoin purchases in the future. The video game retailer is currently the 11th largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. However, the company's shareholders are unhappy with the pivot towards Bitcoin, with the share price plunging 22% following the announcement. The firm's share price has struggled to maintain its upside momentum since it announced mixed earnings for the first quarter of 2025. GameStop reported a revenue of $732.4 million, slightly lower than the expected $754.2 million. Czech Government Faces No-confidence Vote After Bitcoin Scandal The Czech Republic's main opposition party has called for a No-confidence Vote against the ruling party, accusing it of corruption over a $45 million Bitcoin payment from a convicted criminal. Alena Schillerova, Vice Chair of the right-wing ANO Party, stated on X that her party felt there was no choice but to submit the no-confidence motion scheduled for Tuesday. The country's Justice Ministry announced on May 28 that it had sold almost 500 Bitcoin for 1 billion Czech koruna ($45 million) in an auction after receiving it from Tomas Jirikovsky. Jirikovsky ran an online black market and was convicted of embezzlement, drug trafficking, and weapons violations in 2017. The opposition has demanded a probe into the auction and the ministry's conduct. It has also asked for information about who sanctioned the transaction. They also alleged that the winners of the Bitcoin auction were demanding their funds back and wanted to know how they would be compensated. The Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek was forced to resign because of the scandal. However, he denied any wrongdoing, adding that he resigned to protect the government's reputation in an election year. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses for a third consecutive day as escalating tensions in the Middle East plunged the markets into chaos. The flagship cryptocurrency surged past $110,000 at the beginning of the week, fueling speculations of a move past $111,000 and a new all-time high. However, global tensions flared after Israel launched preemptive strikes on Iran, targeting its military and nuclear facilities. As a result, BTC plunged below $105,000, falling to a low of $102,832. BTC’s sudden decline sent shockwaves through the market, dragging the broader crypto ecosystem down. As a result, the crypto market cap fell over 4% to $3.24 trillion. 10x Research discussed Bitcoin’s price action in a post on X, stating, “Bitcoin Just Lost Its Breakout — Here’s the Support Level That Matters Now. Bitcoin’s breakout above $106,000 didn’t hold, and that could mean more than just a failed rally. Bitcoin needed to hold above the $106,000 breakout level. Falling back below this threshold invalidates the Monday breakout signal and reinforces our cautious stance.” The decline caught an optimistic market, buoyed by recent positive price action, completely off guard. As a result, over $427 million in long positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. BTC was trading around $109,000-$110,000 a day prior, fueling speculations about a move to a new all-time high. While BTC has dropped substantially, gold and oil prices have surged. However, analysts believe this trend could reverse soon if historical trends are anything to go by. Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano highlighted the same in a post on X, stating that “Oil up. Gold up. Bitcoin down. The initial reaction follows exactly what happened when Iran shot 300 missiles at Israel. Bitcoin ended up outperforming the other two over the first 48 hours in that situation. Will be interesting to see what happens here.” BTC faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday (June 2), falling to an intraday low of $103,768 before recovering to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,902. The price fell back into the red on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $015,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. It recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $104,378. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged over 4%, crossing the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settling at $110,251. Bulls lost momentum after reaching this level, and the price fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday. However, it recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. Bearish sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42% to $108,687. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at 105,828. The price fell to a low of $102,832 during the ongoing session as markets turned bearish but has made a marginal recovery to move to $104,816.

2025-06-13T15:11:43,"Bitcoin slips 4% to $103K amid sell-offs","Bitcoin slipped to a low of $103,100 in the past 36 hours, a 4.0% decline from its weekly high. The downturn coincided with a 10-point drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, now sitting at 61, its lowest in the week. According to a poll conducted by market intelligence platform Santiment Feed on social platform X, more than 50% of respondents are in support of “buying the dip.” Meanwhile, 28% said they expect prices to fall further below $100,000 and are prepared to sell their holdings. Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is 61. Greed Current price: $104,493 pic.twitter.com/u3EeLb7fhN — Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (@BitcoinFear) June 13, 2025 Even after Friday’s sell-off, Bitcoin has recovered modestly to trade near $105,000, ahead of the expiration of roughly 28,000 Bitcoin options contracts, worth an estimated $3 billion. Similar expiries last week had minimal impact on the spot market, but BTC’s recent price action shows there could be a further pullback in prices. On-chain data mulls accumulation amid pullback On Tuesday, June 11, Bitcoin briefly surged back to $110,000, testing its all-time high last reached in late May. Yet, per CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan, whales refrained from profit-taking. On-chain data from the analytics platform showed that large holders added to their positions instead of exiting the market. That day alone, accumulation wallets received 30,784 BTC, worth approximately $3.3 billion, raising their collective holdings to 2.91 million BTC. The average entry price for these wallets now stands around $64,000. Amr Taha, an on-chain analyst, indicated a growing divergence between Bitcoin’s price and Binance’s Open Interest (OI). Although the price retested all-time highs on June 11, Binance’s OI failed to match levels seen during the previous peak in late May. This discrepancy hints at weakening participation in the futures market, often a precursor to short-term volatility. Stablecoin withdrawals and negative net taker volume spell red Over $750 million worth of stablecoins were removed in recent days, a move reminiscent of similar outflows on May 29. Analysts say such large-scale withdrawals often reflect de-risking behavior or capital rotation when they align with price highs. Binance’s Net Taker Volume, a measure of selling versus buying, spiked to -$197 million, the most negative reading since June 6. The metric shows traders could be dumping Bitcoin at market prices rather than placing passive orders, also deemed as panic-selling. BTC Net Taker Volume Chart | Source: CryptoQuant The seven-hour moving average of this indicator has remained negative since June 12. Still, looking at previous occurrences, such extreme net-taker sell-offs have also marked short-term bottoms. For instance, after a similar reading on June 6, Bitcoin rebounded by 4% within 24 hours. “ The net taker volume and geopolitical panic have created a high-risk, high-reward setup. While short-term volatility may persist, the conditions resemble past recovery scenarios ,” analyst Tah commented. Friday’s downturn was compounded by an early morning military strike by Israel on Iran, triggering sell-offs across global risk assets. Crypto markets were hit especially hard, with leveraged long positions unwound en masse as traders scrambled to exit positions. Analysts note that high-risk assets like Bitcoin are liquidity sources during times of crisis, which could be why exit positions and liquidations spiked during the early Asian trading sessions. The combination of fear and technical exhaustion may have driven Bitcoin’s drop from $110,000 to $103,000.

2025-06-13T15:00:30,"Crypto Con: Aussie Adviser Banned 10 Years Over $9.6 Million Scam","Australia’s financial watchdog has slapped a decade-long ban on a Sydney-based adviser after she sent client funds into a crypto operation flagged as risky. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) says Glenda Maree Rogan moved A$14.8 million ($9.6 million) into a platform already marked as unlicensed. Clients, family and friends reportedly lost out when their money vanished into what ASIC calls a likely scam. Adviser Accused Of Misleading Clients According to ASIC , Rogan pitched a “high-yield fixed-interest account” between May 2014 and February 2024. She worked as an accountant and financial adviser at Fincare firms in Sutherland and Wollongong. But rather than place the funds in secure accounts, multiple transfers went into her personal and company bank records. Many of those funds then converted to crypto and sent on to Financial Centre, a platform ASIC warns “should not be trusted.” Funds Routed Through Personal Accounts Based on reports, Rogan moved money from March 2022 through June 2023. During that 16-month stretch, she sent A$14.8 million into personal and corporate accounts before pushing most of it into crypto . Investigators say she must have doubted the platform’s legitimacy by October 2022, yet went ahead anyway. Family members and close friends who invested under her advice are now caught up in an ongoing probe. 10-Year Ban Imposed ASIC announced the 10-year prohibition took effect on June 6, 2025. Under the ban, Rogan cannot provide or control any financial services business. The regulator said she is “not a fit and proper person” and likely to break financial services laws if allowed to continue. Her license expired on February 8, 2024, and she has been unlicensed since then. Rogan can appeal through the Administrative Review Tribunal, but for now her name sits on ASIC’s banned and disqualified register. Broader Crypto Crackdown This move comes amid a wider push against shady crypto operations in Australia. On June 3, AUSTRAC rolled out new rules and set transaction caps for crypto ATMs to stem scams. In April, inactive crypto exchanges were told to de-register or face cancellation. And in February, AUSTRAC took action against 13 remittance firms and exchanges, with more than 50 under review for potential breaches. Regulators are making clear that unlicensed services will face rapid enforcement. Investors are being urged to check ASIC’s register before handing over cash. High promised returns, especially in crypto, should raise red flags. Anyone hitting a supposed “guarantee” might be staring at an unregulated scheme. While ASIC continues its inquiry into Rogan, this case underlines just how careful people must be when a trusted adviser steers them toward something that sounds too good to be true.

Retail investors keep buying, too, thanks to easier trading apps and ETFs like IBIT. A handful of public companies have raised millions to buy Bitcoin outright.

Their moves chip away at the 21 million-coin supply, making each remaining Bitcoin scarcer. Bitcoin Versus Gold Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is hard-wired into its code. Gold, by comparison, has a market worth north of $12 trillion and sees about 1–2% new supply each year through mining. Novogratz argues that younger investors will choose a capped digital asset over a metal bar. That switch isn’t guaranteed, but once people see Bitcoin as a store of value, its appeal could grow. At today’s $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin has room to expand many times over if it ever rivals gold. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Challenges Ahead Regulators remain a wildcard. The SEC green-lit IBIT, but future rules on taxes or derivatives could slow things down. Bitcoin’s price swings make it riskier than bonds or gold. Institutions often chase stable returns, and Bitcoin pays no dividends or interest. Finally, moving another $10 trillion into crypto would need a massive shift in asset allocations. That kind of inflow isn’t impossible, but it won’t happen overnight. Based on reports, Novogratz sees Bitcoin’s march toward gold’s market cap as a “ball rolling down a hill.” He predicts that, over time, Bitcoin will match gold and then outpace it.

2025-06-13T15:00:03,"SWC Bitcoin Holdings Soar: The Smarter Web Company Advances Ambitious Digital Asset Initiative","BitcoinWorld SWC Bitcoin Holdings Soar: The Smarter Web Company Advances Ambitious Digital Asset Initiative In a move signaling continued confidence in the digital asset space, The Smarter Web Company (SWC), a London-listed technology firm, recently announced a significant increase in its Bitcoin reserves. This strategic decision is part of the company’s long-term vision, dubbed “The 10 Year Plan,” which emphasizes the growing importance of digital assets in a modern corporate framework. For those tracking the intersection of traditional business and the evolving world of cryptocurrency, this development from The Smarter Web Company is a notable point of interest. What Does the Latest Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for SWC? On June 13, The Smarter Web Company confirmed it had acquired an additional 74.27 BTC. This latest Bitcoin acquisition is not an isolated event but rather a deliberate step within a predefined corporate strategy. The amount itself, while specific, adds substantially to their existing reserves, demonstrating a tangible commitment to their stated goals regarding digital assets. Understanding the context of this purchase requires looking at the company’s broader plan and their existing holdings. Understanding SWC Bitcoin Holdings: A Growing Stack Following this recent purchase, SWC Bitcoin holdings have reached a total of 242.34 BTC. This figure represents the cumulative result of their acquisitions under their digital asset initiative. To put this into perspective, while not on the scale of major corporate holders like MicroStrategy or Tesla, it positions The Smarter Web Company as a technology firm actively integrating Bitcoin into its treasury strategy. The increase from previous holdings indicates a consistent approach to accumulating this asset over time, aligning with a long-term investment horizon. Exploring The Smarter Web Company’s Corporate Bitcoin Strategy The rationale behind holding Bitcoin as part of a corporate Bitcoin strategy is multifaceted. For companies like The Smarter Web Company, it can serve several potential purposes: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential store of value in an environment of currency devaluation concerns. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset (potentially) to traditional cash or bond holdings. Exposure to a New Asset Class: Gaining direct exposure to the growth potential of the cryptocurrency market. Signal to Market: Demonstrating forward-thinking and an understanding of technological trends to investors and customers. SWC’s public announcement frames this within their “The 10 Year Plan,” suggesting a long-term commitment rather than short-term speculation. This indicates a belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value and role in the future economy. Why Are Companies Pursuing a Digital Asset Initiative? The trend of companies adopting a digital asset initiative is gaining momentum across various sectors, particularly in technology. Beyond the specific case of The Smarter Web Company, the broader movement reflects a shift in how corporate treasuries and strategic planners view non-traditional assets. Key drivers include: Belief in the underlying technology (blockchain). Potential for significant returns, despite volatility. Increasing institutional acceptance and infrastructure. Exploring use cases beyond investment, such as payments or decentralized finance (though SWC’s focus appears to be treasury). However, this strategy is not without its challenges, including regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, security risks, and accounting complexities. Companies undertaking such initiatives must carefully weigh these factors. The Implications for The Smarter Web Company and the Market For The Smarter Web Company , this continued accumulation reinforces their stated commitment to their “The 10 Year Plan” and its digital asset component. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the company sees long-term value in holding Bitcoin. For the wider market, such announcements from publicly listed technology firms contribute to the narrative of increasing corporate adoption, which is often viewed positively by crypto investors as it signals maturity and broader acceptance of the asset class. Key Takeaways: SWC made a notable Bitcoin acquisition of 74.27 BTC. Total SWC Bitcoin holdings now stand at 242.34 BTC. This is part of a defined corporate Bitcoin strategy under “The 10 Year Plan.” The move highlights the growing trend of companies pursuing a digital asset initiative . It signals The Smarter Web Company’s long-term view on Bitcoin’s role. Conclusion: A Strategic Step in a Digital Future The recent Bitcoin acquisition by The Smarter Web Company underscores a deliberate and ongoing strategic pivot towards integrating digital assets into its core financial planning. With SWC Bitcoin holdings growing, the company is actively pursuing its “The 10 Year Plan,” positioning itself within the evolving landscape where a robust digital asset initiative is seen as a potential driver of future value and stability. This move by The Smarter Web Company provides another data point in the broader trend of corporate adoption of Bitcoin, signaling a belief in its long-term potential despite the inherent volatility of the crypto market.
