2025-06-13T10:59:08,"3 Best Crypto to 1000x as Evertz Pharma Becomes the First German Company with a Bitcoin Reserve","Evertz Pharma is the first German company to create a long-term Bitcoin reserve, the latest development in the rampant Bitcoin adoption cycle which has seen more companies buying more $BTC than ever. While Michael Saylor’s Strategy still holds the crown as the King Bitcoin Hoarder, after staking an impressive 582,000 $BTC, Evertz Pharma’s recent $10.8M investment is a considerable step-up from its first Bitcoin purchase of $2M back in 2020. And the Bitcoin adoption train doesn’t stop here. Mercurity Fintech Plans an $800M Bitcoin Treasury Mercurity Fintech Holding, a major player in the tech and financial sectors, is another firm that’s jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon, announcing plans to create a massive $800M Bitcoin treasury. This comes as the company has been promised an upgrade in the Russel’s Microcap Index, now poised to be listed in the Russel 2000 and Russel 3000 indexes. Shi Qiu, CEO of Mercurity, explains the investment as more than a mere portfolio diversification: ‘We’re building this Bitcoin treasury reserve based on our belief that Bitcoin will become an essential component of the future financial infrastructure. We are positioning our company to be a key player in the evolving digital financial ecosystem.’ — Shi Qiu, GlobeNewswire Press Release This announcement comes less than a week after Mercurity announced a ‘strategic partnership with SBI Digital Markets (SBIDM) ,’ designed to ‘accelerate the adoption of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and facilitate its global distribution ’ CSO of Mercurity, Wilfred Day, declared that: ‘The tokenization of real-world assets is a transformative trend that’s changing how investors access markets. This collaboration lets us bring institutional-grade digital solutions to our clients while maneuvering through complex regulations that they deeply care about.’ — Wilfred Daye, GlobeNewswire Press Release Evertz Pharma and Mercurity Fintech are just the latest names in a growing list of institutional investors, many of whom plan long-term $BTC acquisitions. Besides Strategy, other companies that have built their own Bitcoin reserves include: Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA): 49,179 $BTC Riot Platforms (RIOT): 19,225 $BTC CleanSpark (CLSK): 12,502 $BTC Tesla (TSLA): 11,509 $BTC 2025 is just the beginning of Bitcoin’s balance sheet domination. It also suggests that the crypto market as a whole is becoming more credible, and as Bitcoin rises, some of the best altcoins today may surge beyond anyone’s expectations. Here are 3 best crypto to 1000x if Bitcoin ramps up its chart pressure. 1. Solaxy ($SOX) — Solana’s Layer 2 Solution to Network Congestion and High Transaction Fees Solaxy ($SOLX) is Solana’s upcoming Layer 2 solution, currently in presale. Solaxy aims to address Solana’s most pressing issue, network congestion, which translates into problems like slow and even failed transactions and high fees. Solaxy’s fix? Off-chain execution, paired with parallel processing, for near-instant finality and ultra-low latency. Solaxy’s detailed roadmap explains the project’s true potential and scope, which includes reducing network congestion, eliminating downtime, and building the foundation for future Solana upgrades. The presale has accumulated over $48M so far, earning a place as one of the best presales of 2025 . Considering $SOLX’s price of only $0.001756, Solaxy offers a low-cap entry and a good way to diversify your portfolio into meme coins. If Solaxy delivers on its promised utility, as detailed in the whitepaper , our analysts predict a 2025 post-launch price point of $0.032 by December. We’re talking about an ROI of 1,722%. With widespread adoption and successful blockchain implementation, we could see a $0.2 $SOLX price by the end of 2026 , for an ROI of 11,289%. Important note: $SOLX’s presale is set to conclude in a little over 3 days. So, if you want to get in, you should do it today. Go to the presale page and buy your $SOLX to position yourself ahead of the curve. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) — Telegram Bot with a Hunger for Hot Tokens Snorter Token ($SNORT) is a Solana-based Telegram project introducing Snorter Bot, your best friend at sniffing promising crypto tokens. Snorter Bot is the antidote to manual coin hunting, which often involves missed opportunities and a technically demanding process. The bot also helps you sidestep dodgy honeypots and rug-pulls, which are easy to fall prey to when manual coin hunting. The bot operates exclusively in the Telegram chat, offering fast and secure swaps, a portfolio dashboard, and limit orders and dynamic stop-losses. This also means you don’t need to juggle multiple wallets and browser extensions anymore. Snorter Token entered its presale phase in May 2025 and has already accumulated over $926K, with a token price of $0.0951. If you want to join the presale, now is a good time, given the staking APY of 329%. Indeed, the whales are circling, hoovering up some $200K just today. So, if Snorter Token’s crypto-hungry Aardvark is winking at you, go to the presale page, buy a few $SNORTs , and take full advantage of its relentless appetite for rare meme coin finds. 3. KAKA ($KAKA) — The KAKA Squirrel Hoarding Nuts in the Charts KAKA ($KAKA) is what you get when you inject meme juice into a squirrel and release it into the market. It’s a simple project with an even simpler story: ‘I was born in a dumpster behind a 7-Eleven, baptized in a porta-potty, and raised on expired trail mix and spy pigeon lore.’ — KAKA the Squirrel, Official website Despite releasing at the end of May 2025, and losing over 80% of its value after its post-launch spike, KAKA is gathering nuts again. 161% over the past seven days , more precisely, and 14.9% in the last 24 hours. With only 1B tokens, market cap of 1.57M, and a 76% positive community sentiment, KAKA is worth a second glance. Will the Bitcoin Adoption Trend Continue? Yes, based on the number of major institutional acquisitions, we believe the Bitcoin adoption trend will continue into 2026 and beyond. Evertz Pharma and Mercurity Fintech are the latest in a long list of big-time Bitcoin hunters, and their combined efforts will only drive Bitcoin up. And, with it, promising low-cap projects like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Snorter Token ($SNORT). Don’t take this as financial advice.

2025-06-13T10:40:55,"Bitcoin Liquidity Crunch Paves Way for $115K Breakout","On-chain exchange reserves have hit a five-year low, and analysts argue the resulting supply squeeze could catapult BTC toward $115,000 in coming weeks. Is Bitcoin Eyeing the $115K to $200K Zone? With U.S. inflation falling lower than expected, Bitcoin has the potential of hitting $200,000 by year-end, says a 21Shares crypto strategist Matt Mena. He noted that a decisive breakout above the $105K–$110K range could propel BTC to $120K and fast-track the year-end target of $138.5K by late summer. Market analyst Crypto King was of a similar opinion that $120,000 was the next psychological price for Bitcoin, thanks to reduced selling activity by short-term holders. The analyst stated , “With $120K as the next key psychological level, Bitcoin appears to be steadily positioning for another upward move, though increased profit-taking may emerge as that milestone nears.” With the consumer price index (CPI) increasing by only 0.1% in May, which was way below expectations, this might be the stepping stone towards Bitcoin soaring to $200,000. Mena pointed out, “Today’s CPI print may serve as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin - and it may be the unlock that brings this target forward by several months. If momentum continues building, a $200K Bitcoin by year-end is now firmly in play.” A surge to $200,000 would validate the long-standing belief among Bitcoin advocates that it is a store of value, akin to digital gold. This price move signals deepening institutional adoption—from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to corporate treasuries—indicating that major players see Bitcoin as a credible, long-term investment rather than a speculative asset. Bitcoin Whales Remain Steadfast Bitcoin whales — the entities holding 1,000 BTC or more — have remained incredibly steadfast, thanks to various factors: Institutional conviction . Institutions and high-net-worth holders view every dip—from $110K to $104K—as an opportunity, not a threat. The U.S. macro backdrop (cooling inflation, positive CPI) further reinforces this conviction. Reducing visible supply . Whale inflows to exchanges have dropped to 7-year lows after declining to approximately 2.3 BTC, signalling a shift in market structure and investor behavior. Lower exchange supply tends to elevate price support. Bitcoin whales have doubled down in June 2025, with overall holdings and new whale cohorts hitting cycle‑highs. Their strategic accumulation—especially during sentiment‑driven dips—and reduced exchange deposits point to confidence about a new all-time high (ATH) being attained this cycle. Crypto King added , “Despite the recent dip, on-chain data shows large holders remain firm, with no significant profit-taking at current levels. This continued conviction suggests confidence in further upside and potential for new price discovery.” Whale holding has also been going through the roof with more than $3.3 billion being recently sent to BTC accumulation wallets. These addresses now hold 2.91 million BTC at an average entry of $64,000, underscoring strong long-term conviction amid market volatility. Therefore, the convergence of institutional capital, ETFs, and corporate treasury adoption is transforming Bitcoin’s demand profile. Conclusion Even though Bitcoin is witnessing a pullback to the $104K zone, the apex cryptocurrency continues to make history by trading above the psychological price of $100,000 for more than 30 consecutive days. With an intensified liquidity crunch and whale accumulation playing out, these bullish on-chain metrics might be the catapult needed to thrust BTC to new historic highs of $115K to $120K. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will shed off the present downward pressure with its ATH presently sitting at $111,814.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9558/bitcoin-liquidity-crunch-paves-way-for-115-k-breakout,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T10:40:34,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 13, 2025","Crypto saw a notable drop today. 98 of the top 100 coins have recorded decreases over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 6.1% to $3.38 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $168 billion, the highest it’s been in days. TLDR: The market has continued yesterday’s pullback, entering consolidation; A short-term correction may be underway; Crypto market sentiment moves towards the fear zone; Bitcoin drops below the $105,000 level; Another all-time high is possible; US spot ETH ETFs continue to outperform their BTC counterparts with 18 consecutive days of inflows; Additional drops are likely. Crypto Winners & Losers Continuing a decline that started yesterday, all top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices drop over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by another 2.7% to the current price of $104,694. Ethereum (ETH) recorded the second-highest fall on the list of 7.9% to the price of $2,529. The top loss is Solana (SOL)’s 8.7%, which now trades at $145. At the same time, the smallest decrease is Tron (TRX)’s 0.5% to the price of $0.2738. Moreover, only two of the top 100 coins have appreciated today. WhiteBIT Coin (WBT) is up 3.3% to $33.58, while LEO Token (LEO) increased by 2% to the price of $9.05. On the other hand, sixteen coins saw double-digit decreases. The highest among these is SPX6900 (SPX)’s 18.6%, currently trading at $1.38. Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler , highlighted that financial markets are hesitant, despite a mildly positive inflation print in the US and consumer prices rising slightly less than expected. “Ongoing geopolitical tensions and renewed tariff rhetoric from Donald Trump continue to weigh on investor sentiment, preventing a clear upward breakout,” Lienkha says. A Short-Term Correction May Be Underway James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , commented that we can’t say what is exactly happening at the moment. “Bitcoin seemed as if it were heading for a new all-time high before retreating,” he writes. “It is truly hard to know if a single factor or a confluence of factors is at play here.” Institutional inflows have been supporting the recent rally, and with BTC hovering just below its May peak, “another all-time high seems realistic if these trends persist.” Despite the recent pullback, #Bitcoin remains above most major short-term cost basis levels. As of June 11: 1w CB: $106.2K 1m CB: $105.2K 3m CB: $98.3K 6m CB: $97.0K As most short-term holders are still in profit, the top-heavy risk seems limited. pic.twitter.com/JDVmw0xOi2 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 12, 2025 Moreover, Ruslan Lienkha argues that BTC appears to be entering a consolidation phase. “From a technical standpoint, the asset has formed a potential double top on the chart, suggesting a short-term correction may be underway.” The coin has spent most of the year trading within the $90,000–$110,000 range, which may serve as a key support and accumulation zone before a new attempt at an ATH. Meanwhile, altcoins are showing signs of divergence, Lienkha says. ETH, SOL, and XRP have been trading sideways and remain significantly below their previous ATHs. “This subdued performance also reflects a declining short-term correlation with Bitcoin.” However, speculations around a forthcoming Solana ETF approval “translate into fresh capital inflows” for this coin. Source: YouHodler Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $104,694, falling below the $105,000 mark. This is up from the intraday low of $103,081 and down from the intraday high of $108,356, which the coin held very briefly. It’s currently down 6.3% from the all-time high of $111,814. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView In the same time period, Ethereum saw a notable plunge from its intraday high of $2,767 to the intraday low of $2,469, correcting slightly upwards since. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment keeps retreating into fear. It’s currently in the neutral zone, falling from 65 seen yesterday to 54 today . This suggests that the concerns over market overheating and heading for an additional correction are easing. “Encouragingly, the wave of fear in market sentiment did not translate into a meaningful shift in spending behavior,” Glassnode says. Moreover, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw another day of net inflows, though it’s nearly half of yesterday’s amount. It stood at $86.31 million on Thursday. BlackRock took in $288.33 million, but others ended the day with significant losses. At the same time, US ETH spot ETFs have recorded 19 consecutive days of inflows, surpassing the BTC counterparts again with $112.36 million in inflows on 12 June. BlackRock’s share here is $101.53 million, and Fidelity’s is $10.83 million. Meanwhile, stablecoins have been increasingly drawing investor attention . Total stablecoin market capitalization has reached a new all-time high of $250.949 billion, per DeFiLlama . According to Toledano, “the ease with which USDT and USDC can be converted into both digital assets and fiat currencies enhances their appeal, offering unmatched convenience and flexibility within a rapidly evolving financial landscape.” Monthly stablecoin flows reached $717 billion–$719 billion from February to April, and annual volumes topped $27.6 trillion, surpassing Visa and Mastercard. Therefore, “stablecoins appear increasingly unstoppable, cementing their role as a transformative force in global finance.” Stablecoins are booming again. Market cap hit a record $228B, up $33B (+17%) in 2025.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1?

Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.15389999 -8.22% Market Cap. $ 6,500,698,829.0942 Trading Volume. $ 254,993,571.7373 Circulating Supply. 0.00 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 Since peaking at $0.40 in mid-January 2025, HBAR price has been on a steady decline. External factors dragged it into a falling wedge pattern, reaching a low of $0.125 in early April. However, from April second week, a broader crypto rally lifted HBAR as well. It broke out of the wedge, rebounding from a strong support zone, the same area that fueled the Q4 2024 rally. This zone, confirmed by the FRVP indicator, showed high buying interest and supported a sharp rebound. HBAR surged nearly 80%, climbing from $0.125 to $0.228 in April to Mid-may. But the momentum didn’t hold. Over the last 30 days, HBAR dropped around 35%, with 17% of that loss occurring in just three days. Currently, HBAR is forming another falling wedge and is trading near its lower boundary. If bulls regain strength, a breakout above $0.22 could follow, potentially reaching $0.27 soon. Looking further ahead, a daily close above $0.27 could open the path to $0.40. If momentum continues, HBAR might even touch $0.75 by year-end. On the downside, failure to hold support may push the price down toward $0.072. Meanwhile, internal developments tell a different story. Hedera’s ecosystem continues to grow. In 2025, it launched its first native hardware wallet, Citadel, and an AI-based tool, the Hedera Agent Kit, making token creation more accessible. Another major project, HashSphere, is due in Q3 2025. It aims to offer a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. To streamline operations, Hedera also rebranded key entities on May 15. The HBAR Foundation is now the “Hedera Foundation,” and the Governing Council is the “Hedera Council.” In short, while external pressures weigh on price, Hedera’s internal progress remains strong. If macro conditions improve, 2025 could still bring a major turnaround.

2025-06-13T10:31:50,"Shiba Inu Rolls Out Shib Alpha Layer, Kusama Teases AI Whitepaper","The post Shiba Inu Rolls Out Shib Alpha Layer, Kusama Teases AI Whitepaper appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Shiba Inu just picked up real momentum. After a two-week silence, SHIB lead developer Shytoshi Kusama is back online with a teaser that’s stirring up the ecosystem. In a post on X, he hinted at a long-in-the-works whitepaper focused on artificial intelligence, just hours before fellow developer Kaal Dhairya announced the beta launch of Shib Alpha Layer, a powerful new Layer 3 network built on Shibarium. The message is loud and clear: SHIB is done playing small. Kusama’s Comeback Signals Bigger Plans Kusama hasn’t posted since May 30. But when he finally returned, he made it count. Referencing the SHIB ecosystem’s partner TokenPlayAI (powered by Astra Nova), Kusama said it’s part of a larger strategy that’s been in the works for months. And it won’t stay under wraps for long. “This is part of a much larger AI strategy we have been developing for months,” he wrote. “I’ll speak more about my view on AI and our partners in an upcoming AI focused whitepaper.” He’s also updated his X bio to reflect this direction, stating that he’s working on “a final white paper exploring Ai, Shib, Shy.” While details are still limited, this marks a deliberate move toward positioning SHIB as a key player in tech-forward development. In case you missed this big news with @TokenplayAI (powered by @Astra__Nova ). This is part of a much larger AI strategy we have been developing for months. I'll speak more about my view on AI and our partners in an upcoming AI focused whitepaper. Stay tuned. https://t.co/soqnS5QT0B — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) June 12, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Anthony Pompliano to Lead $750M Bitcoin Acquisition Bid via Public Firm , Enter: Shib Alpha Layer (Beta) While Kusama was teasing vision, Dhairya delivered something more solid. In a post of his own, the developer revealed that Shib Alpha Layer, the project’s new Layer 3 rollup abstraction stack, is now live in beta. It’s built with ElderLabs and runs on Shibarium as its settlement layer. So what’s under the hood? Quite a bit: A single-chain experience that hides the complexity of rollups Lightning-fast transactions and near-instant confirmations The ability to pay gas fees not just in BONE, but in other tokens and stablecoins Enhanced privacy features, modular app support, and more Instant bridging and interoperability coming soon Dhairya summed it up with one statement that says it all: “Today we flip the script… Meme era ends here. The Shib Alpha era begins.” A New Chapter for SHIB What a shift in identity! The rollout of a high-speed Layer 3 network, paired with an upcoming whitepaper and long-term tech strategy, suggests SHIB’s developers are building for something much bigger than hype cycles. Dhairya even emphasized that this wasn’t backed by VC money or marketing machines – just a small team of engineers pushing out real products. Round of applause! SHIB seems to be busy writing its own playbook and leaving the meme coin era behind for good. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-13T10:30:33,"Huione darknet still raking in crypto as $81B flows despite shutdown","Chainalysis’ analysis reveals that Huione, one of the largest darknet marketplaces, continues to process massive volumes of cryptocurrency despite enforcement efforts. An estimated $81 billion has flowed through the platform, even after authorities targeted its Telegram channels and support infrastructure. On May 13, Haowang Guarantee, formerly Huione Guarantee , announced it closed after the Telegram messaging service blocked thousands of its connected accounts and channels. However, Chainalysis said activity connected to the illicit marketplace has not decreased since the so-called “shutdown,” according to an analysis released Thursday, June 12. The American blockchain analysis firm highlighted that their data indicates that the platform handles billions of dollars in transactions. According to the report, this demonstrates a strong system that works mostly independently without relying heavily on its public-facing setup. Huione defies US sanctions as crypto transactions surge The Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on May 1 proposed prohibiting the Huione Group from access to the US banking system. They alleged that the company assisted North Korea’s state-sponsored Lazarus Group in laundering cryptocurrency. Even though US banks usually act quickly and terminate relationships upon announcement to manage regulatory risk, Huione has proved resilient against officials, said Chainalysis. The blockchain analysis firm further stated that this de-risking effect suggests Huione probably lost access to US dollars starting from the day of the notice. Still, transaction data indicates that the operational impact was minimal. Following their explanation, the data reveals that transaction volume remained steady after the FinCEN announcement and may have even increased. Huione’s daily volume. Source: Chainalysis Apart from Chainalysis, TRM Labs also shared data concerning Huione’s operations. According to a May 30 report from crypto analytics company TRM Labs, the Huione Group continues to run channels for its VIP vendors and has taken at least $81 billion in crypto since 2021. This is more than $5 billion for the Hydra marketplace, a comparable Russian online black market. TRM Labs further illustrated that Huione is a key channel for cyber-related crimes, such as pig butchering scams, fraud, and cyber heists. Huione’s cryptocurrency exchange has also reappeared on the scene, now with its old logo and operating from a new domain, according to Chainalysis. The exchange also maintains a social media presence on other platforms, like its Telegram channels. Chainalysis reveals strategies to curb Huione’s illegal activities The Huione Group , a Cambodian company, manages a variety of businesses, including its payment service platform Huione Pay PLC, crypto exchange Huione Crypto, and Haowang Guarantee. The continued existence of the Huione Group and its subsidiaries is part of a larger challenge of responding to sophisticated organized criminal groups that can operate at scale. Still, Chainalysis said that it had not come to the attention of law enforcement. To curb this, Chainalysis suggested that they need an ecosystem-wide response, which means ongoing and varied enforcement strategies, to tackle illegal companies like Huione effectively. Chainalysis also mentioned that dealing with these networks might need new enforcement methods that look deeper than just shutting down surface operations and instead focus on the complicated systems that keep them running. The crypto ecosystem feels hopeful after the blockchain analysis company’s strategies to tackle Huione’s unlawful actions. Stopping cybercrimes is undoubtedly important, according to crypto analysts. This is because cybercrime poses a serious risk to people, companies, and governments, leading to monetary losses, harm to one’s reputation, and a decline in confidence in online systems.

2025-06-13T10:27:59,"Shopify Introduces USDC Stablecoin Payments via Coinbase’s Base Network","Shopify has launched early access to stablecoin payments using Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), in a strategic collaboration with U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The integration is currently being tested on Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain, Base, with a full rollout planned through Shopify Payments and Shop Pay later this year. Announcing the move on Thursday, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke called stablecoins a “natural way to transact on the internet,” adding that the company worked closely with Coinbase to develop the commerce-focused smart contract protocol behind the system. The new payment feature will also support future buyer incentives, including 1% cash back in local currency, enhancing the platform’s appeal for both customers and merchants. Why Shopify Chose Base for Its Stablecoin Integration Base, a Layer-2 network built by Coinbase, is the fourth-largest blockchain for USDC, accounting for 6% of the stablecoin’s $61 billion total supply, according to USDC Transparency and CoinGecko data. Known for its low-cost and high-speed transactions, Base offers Shopify a 24/7 global payment infrastructure, aligning with the company’s goals to streamline cross-border commerce. “Base is an ultra-fast and affordable network that has emerged as a great way for moving money,” Shopify said in a statement, citing its reliability and cost-efficiency. While the company has not disclosed plans to support USDC on other chains or additional crypto assets, the exclusive choice of Base has sparked debate online. Some users questioned the decision, suggesting that broader multi-chain support would have widened merchant access. Still, the Base integration signals Shopify’s broader intent to modernize online payments and explore blockchain-native solutions for faster, cheaper transactions. A Long Crypto History: From Bitcoin to Diem Shopify’s latest venture into stablecoins builds on more than a decade of crypto experimentation . The company enabled its merchants to accept Bitcoin as far back as 2013, partnering with third-party gateways like BitPay and Solana Pay. According to the Shopify Help Center, the platform now supports nine alternative crypto payment methods, although it notes that direct methods like Shopify Payments perform better during high-volume flash sales due to faster settlements. Shopify and Coinbase also have a shared history in crypto innovation. Both were involved in Meta’s failed Diem project (formerly Libra) , a stablecoin initiative that ultimately shut down in 2022 after global regulatory resistance .

2025-06-13T10:19:58,"How Low Can Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Prices Go?","The post How Low Can Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Prices Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has faced the wrath of geopolitical tensions and monetary policies. The recent Israel-Iran war news has led to the market cap of the business dropping by 2.51% to $3.37 trillion. This fall in numbers was catalyzed by $1.14 billion worth of liquidations. Amidst this downturn, the top-tier cryptos, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices have taken a substantial hit. In this price analysis, I will walk you through the plausible future of these cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: Bitcoin is currently priced at $104,777.84, down 2.79% on the day. With a massive surge in 24-hour volume by 28.85% to $69.67 billion, the rising sell volume signals a panic-induced liquidation. The daily chart shared by me highlights that the RSI hovers at 48.85, indicating waning bullish momentum. The price has slipped below the 20-day SMA at $106,454, and a rejection from the middle Bollinger Band confirms the dominance of bears. The support zone at $101,909 is critical. If breached, I believe BTC price could plunge to the psychological mark of $100,000, which also aligns with the lower Bollinger Band. That being said, the upside potential remains capped near $113,000, unless macro conditions improve significantly. Until then, traders may expect sideways to downward movement with a bearish bias. Also read: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: Ethereum price has faced a heavy correction, and is down 7.83% to $2,531.74. As a result, the market cap has shrunk to $305.38 billion. The 30.82% rise in volume at $39.09 billion hints at further short-term capitulation. The RSI has dropped to 49.43, nearing neutral but pointing downwards. It is worth noting that the ETH’s candle has decisively broken below the midline of the Bollinger Bands at $2,593, now testing the lower range at $2,404. I believe the last line of defense stands at $2,336, a key support level from the chart. A daily close below that could open room toward $2,200. Recovery will face resistance at $2,783, the upper Bollinger band. Until bulls regain strength above the 20-day SMA, the downside risk remains a concern. Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! Ripple XRP Price Analysis: XRP has been under my watch for quite some time now, and it has plunged by 5.08% to trade at $2.12, with its market cap now at $125.26 billion. It’s battling to hold above $2.09, the daily low, and sees its resistance at around $2.35. On the technical side, the RSI sits weak at 41.37, suggesting sellers are in control. The price has broken below the 20-day SMA of $2.22, with the next support at $1.9645, marked on the chart. Breaking this zone may bring further decline toward $1.85. That being said, for any notable rebound, XRP needs to reclaim the 20-day SMA and push toward $2.3496, but the current structure leans bearish. If you are an XRP hodler, you should not miss out on our Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Can Bitcoin fall below $100,000? Yes, if the market sentiment deteriorates and the $101,909 support fails, BTC price may revisit the $100k psychological level. Q2: What’s the downside target for Ethereum if the correction continues? If ETH breaks below $2,336, it could slide further toward $2,200, especially if broader market sentiment worsens. Q3: Should you buy XRP right now? Not yet. With the RSI under 45 and price nearing a key support at $1.96, it’s better to wait for confirmation of reversal before buying.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/how-low-can-bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-prices-go/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Price Analysis",cryptocompare

BTC’s price has already experienced substantial volatility after the initial Israeli missile strikes against Iran, but has recovered some ground and now stands close to $105,000. Trump said on his own social media platform that he “gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest words, to “just do it,” but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done.” The POTUS blamed it on a certain “Iranian hardliner” who spoke “bravely,” but noted that all of the top military personnel are now dead. Consequently, Trump urged the nation’s leaders to sign the nuclear deal once again, or the situation could worsen. “The United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come – And they know how to use it.” He warned that the next planned attacks will be even more brutal and Iran should make a deal before “there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.” Israel’s strike earlier this morning led to immediate price volatility across all financial sectors. While oil went up , the ever-volatile crypto market plunged, with BTC dumping below $103,000 for the first time since last Friday. However, the asset has recovered some ground and now stands close to $105,000. Investors should be aware that more volatility is likely to follow if the tension between the US, Iran, and Israel further escalates. BTCUSD.

The vote is scheduled for Tuesday, June 17, and could mark a turning point for crypto regulation in the country. The U.S. Treasury Secretary believes the stablecoin market cap could exceed $2 trillion in the next few years. What’s the GENIUS Act About? The full name of the bill is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act. Its goal is to bring legal clarity to stablecoins by setting specific rules for issuers. If passed, stablecoin providers would be required to fully back their tokens with U.S. dollars or other liquid assets. The bill also mandates yearly audits for companies that issue more than $50 billion worth of stablecoins, and it includes extra compliance measures for foreign issuers like Tether . The U.S. Senate will hold a final vote on the GENIUS Act—a major stablecoin regulation bill—on June 17. If passed, it moves to the House. pic.twitter.com/ZRmUqzqOpq — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) June 13, 2025 What Happens After the Senate Vote? If the Senate passes the GENIUS Act, the bill will move to the House of Representatives for further review and voting. The House already has its version of a stablecoin bill, called the STABLE Act, which was passed out of committee in May. However, the two bills differ in some key areas, especially in how they regulate state-based issuers and handle oversight for foreign stablecoin companies. For the legislation to become law, both the Senate and House must agree on a final version of the bill. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. May Issue Crypto Bonds Backed by Bitcoin and XRP, Says Ex-CFTC Chair , Why This Matters Now Stablecoin legislation has become a hot topic, especially after President Donald Trump voiced support for clearer crypto laws . Trump wants to see progress by August, adding urgency to the process. Earlier this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that passing such a law could open the door for massive growth in the stablecoin sector. He even predicted the market could explode to over $2 trillion by 2028. Right now, the USD stablecoin market stands at around $252 billion, according to CoinGecko. Tuesday’s vote could be the first major step toward building a clear and unified rulebook for stablecoins in the U.S. Whether the GENIUS Act becomes law or not, it’s clear that Washington is finally getting serious about crypto regulation . Globally, big investors are eyeing the stablecoin market, and if approved in the US, it will open the door for global investors to flood the US market. In parallel news, China’s largest fintech company, Ant Group, plans to launch stablecoin payments and is preparing to apply for licenses in Singapore and Hong Kong. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act) is a bill aimed at providing legal clarity for stablecoins in the U.S., mandating full backing by U.S. dollars or liquid assets and yearly audits for large issuers. How will the GENIUS Act impact stablecoin regulation in the US? The GENIUS Act aims to establish a clear federal framework for stablecoins, requiring full backing with liquid assets, regular audits, and robust consumer protections, thereby accelerating blockchain adoption and legitimizing the sector. What are the key differences between the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act? Both bills mandate 1:1 backing and disclosures. Key differences include the GENIUS Act allowing conditional algorithmic stablecoins while the STABLE Act imposes a two-year ban, and variations in federal-state oversight for smaller issuers. How could US stablecoin laws influence global crypto investment trends? Clear US stablecoin laws could significantly boost global crypto investment by attracting large institutional capital, enhancing trust, and potentially solidifying the U.S. dollar’s role in digital finance, encouraging widespread adoption.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/u-s-senate-to-decide-stablecoin-future-with-genius-act-on-june-17/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT","News|Stablecoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T10:09:17,"Anthony Pompliano to Lead $750M Bitcoin Acquisition Bid via Public Firm","The post Anthony Pompliano to Lead $750M Bitcoin Acquisition Bid via Public Firm appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano is stepping into the spotlight again – this time to lead a public company planning to raise $750 million to buy Bitcoin. The move comes as investor confidence in crypto is rebounding, helped by pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration. The deal involves a potential merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1, a SPAC backed by Cohen & Company, and signals a major shift toward growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Here’s how Pompliano is positioning himself at the heart of this renewed momentum. Crypto’s New CEO: Pompliano Takes Charge Pompliano is reportedly in talks to lead ProCapBTC, a new group aiming to raise $500 million in equity and $250 million in convertible debt, according to a Financial Times report. The plan is to use this capital to directly purchase Bitcoin – similar to the aggressive strategies of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. The funding would come through a planned merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1, which went public on Nasdaq last month with a $250 million upsized IPO. The merger is expected to be announced soon, though discussions are still ongoing. Pompliano already has experience in this space. Just last month, he launched ProCap Acquisition Corp, another SPAC, through a $220 million IPO. It’s not yet clear how the two ProCap entities are connected, based on public info. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Polices Make an Impact Under Trump’s second term, crypto is making a comeback with support from the top. His administration’s pro-crypto outlook is helping to bring back big money, and big players, into the space. ProCapBTC’s focus on acquiring Bitcoin fits right into this larger trend. IPOs from crypto firms like Bullish and Gemini are gaining traction, and Circle’s stock initially jumped 170%, reflecting growing demand for exposure to digital assets. If the deal goes through, Pompliano could play a key role in what may become the administration’s broader push for crypto adoption. Why Anthony Pompliano is a Perfect Choice? Pompliano has been in crypto since 2013, has over 1.7 million X followers, and holds deep market understanding. His influence, podcast success, and $220 million blank-cheque experience make him a top contender to lead ProCapBTC’s $750 million Bitcoin investment goal. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and growing institutional demand further facilitate this move, making Pompliano at the forefront of Bitcoin’s institutional revolution. Conclusion: ProCapBTC’s approach to dubbing Saylor’s methods demonstrates confidence in Bitcoin’s prospects. Columbus Circle’s $250 million IPO in May paves the way for a major influence on the market. Pompliano’s leadership might accelerate additional institutional acceptance. As talks advance, the cryptocurrency community watches intently, anticipating Pompliano’s next step.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/anthony-pompliano-to-lead-750m-bitcoin-acquisition-bid-via-public-firm/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

Ethereum Spot ETFs Record $112 Million Inflows on June 12, Outperforming Bitcoin for 19th Day in a Row On the same day, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $86.31 million, extending their streak for four consecutive days. The latest figures show continued investor interest in Ethereum-based products, which have consistently outpaced Bitcoin ETFs in net inflows in recent weeks. Analysts cite growing optimism about Ethereum’s role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, positive regulatory signals, and expectations for future network upgrades as the drivers behind this trend. The strong inflows also reflect a broader revival of institutional crypto interest, with both BTC and ETH ETFs continuing to attract capital amid relatively stable market conditions. It is eagerly awaited how the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets will be affected following today's Israel-Iran tensions. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T10:00:30,"Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next?","The Bitcoin price has suffered a violent rejection after hitting the $110,000 level, showing a clear intention of the bears to keep the digital asset from hitting new all-time highs. So far, the rejections from $110,000 have been swift and have put the bears back in control. This has given credence to calls that the Bitcoin price will fall back below the psychological level of $100,000, something that could trigger another wave of declines in the crypto market. Bitcoin Rejection At $110,000 Part Of The Plan? The Bitcoin price rejection has no doubt triggered a wave of panic among investors, many of whom believe that this is the end of the cycle. However, a crypto analyst has suggested that the pullback is part of the larger plan as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap moves on its way to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000 In the analysis, they explain that the digital asset is currently at a point where it is undergoing significant distribution, and this will explain the decline in price. The pullback in and of itself is no cause for alarm, as minor corrections after major surges are normal. In addition to this, there is a lot of accumulation going on as Bitcoin moves from the hands of old investors into the hands of new investors at a higher cost basis. The accumulation is expected to move Bitcoin into the next bullish wave. This bullish wave is the next step in the trend as the BTC price moves into place for the next price surge. Once the volume moves upward as expected, then the asset’s price is expected to follow in succession. BTC Price Could Hit $130,000 Target After Breakout Going by the analyst’s chart shared on the TradingView website, the Bitcoin price correction is not expected to last for long. Mainly, holding the $107,000 support becomes paramount at this level as this could set the launchpad point for the next bullish impulse. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target The completion of the accumulation phase puts the next breakout level as high as $130,000, which would be an over 20% increase from the current level. However, this may not be the end as the crypto analyst has set a swing target for as high as $150,000. As for the timeline for when this could happen, the crypto analyst places a long-term target for the end of the year 2025. But there is also the possibility that the trend would be completed sooner and the Bitcoin price could reach its target and new all-time highs before the year runs out.

This comes after the court rejected the original proposal on June 4. In response, Zettai filed a formal request on June 6 under case HC/SUM 940/2025 seeking “further arguments,” as confirmed by WazirX on X (formerly Twitter). Update on Proposed Scheme of Arrangement As we shared last week, the Singapore Court has declined Zettai’s application in HC/SUM 940/2025 (“SUM 940”) for the Court’s sanction of Zettai’s proposed Scheme.

If the High Court accepts the restructuring plan, Zettai may be required to file a new submission and attend further hearings. The company has been under pressure since WazirX’s hack on July 18, 2024, in which over ₹2,000 crore vanished , leaving 4.4 million users in limbo with no access to their funds. However, the delay in court proceedings has left users frustrated, and if the proposal is not approved, Zettai’s only option will be a longer and more complex appeal process. Silence From WazirX Founder Nischal Shetty Throughout the legal proceedings, WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty has remained noticeably silent. While he has acknowledged the legal case, he has not issued a public apology to affected users nor shared any repayment plans. Despite the ongoing crisis, no refunds have been initiated, and no user funds have been recovered. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is The Crypto Market Going Down Today? , Shetty Focuses on Shardeum Despite WazirX Collapse Amid WazirX’s ongoing troubles, Shetty appears to be focusing on Shardeum, his new Layer 1 blockchain venture. This week, Shardeum Foundation announced MiCA whitepaper acknowledgment, allowing operations in Europe—an achievement promoted by Shetty on social media. Although Shetty has distanced himself from WazirX publicly, Shardeum is still mentioned in his X bio, raising questions about his true involvement in both ventures. What’s Next for WazirX? Zettai has submitted two proposals so far—both rejected by the Singapore High Court . With June 20 approaching, the crypto community is anxiously awaiting the court’s final verdict. If rejected again, Zettai is expected to file an appeal, but there is no official roadmap for repayment or resolution. Final Thoughts With millions in user funds at stake, the crypto world will be watching closely as Singapore’s High Court delivers its decision on June 20.

2025-06-13T09:58:15,"Ethereum Whale Snaps Up $127M in ETH Amid Market Panic","A deep-pocketed Ethereum whale is defying the current crypto bloodbath, scooping up tens of thousands of ETH while panic grips the broader market. On June 13, blockchain tracking account Lookonchain revealed on X that the mysterious trader bought 48,825 ETH, worth approximately $127 million, from Coinbase and Wintermute, over an eight-hour period at an average price of $2,605 per coin. Opportunity in Turmoil This fresh accumulation came amid a brutal market rout sparked by reports of Israeli missile strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The preemptive move sent shockwaves through equities, commodities, and, most notably, digital assets, with more than $190 billion in crypto market value evaporating within hours, driving the price of Bitcoin (BTC) down nearly 5% to $103,000. Ethereum also suffered a similar fate, plunging from $2,760 to a low of $2,470, to erase gains from its recent surge to a 15-week high of $2,830 just days prior. Currently, ETH is trading at about $2,520, down 8.6% in the last 24 hours. Still, it added an extra 2.3% over seven days, outpacing the broader crypto market’s rather measly 0.1% gain in that time. Yet while retail traders fled for the exits, liquidating more than $1 billion in leveraged positions, this veteran whale saw an opportunity. And it isn’t their first strategic move: Lookonchain’s earlier posts traced their footsteps back to late April. On April 27, the entity bought 600 BTC and 30,000 ETH, with the latter costing just under $55 million. Weeks later, on May 22, they sold that ETH at $2,621 each, netting about $23.73 million in profit. Undeterred by volatility, they plunged back in on May 26, acquiring another 30,000 ETH for $75.39 million at $2,513 per coin. That batch was sold just three days ago on June 10 for $82.76 million, securing a further $7.3 million gain. Today’s $127 million buy marks the whale’s largest single accumulation spree yet, executed as retail traders jettisoned their holdings. Confidence in a Rebound? The move appears to be a calculated gamble that the recent plunge in ETH’s value is an overreaction. The whale often leverages OTC desks for discreet, large-scale moves, avoiding slippage and market impact, a luxury unavailable to retail. Their proven track record of buying fear and selling into strength suggests they may view the dip below key technical and psychological support as a prime accumulation zone, betting on Ethereum’s strong fundamental backdrop, including sustained ETF inflows , a supportive U.S. regulatory shift , as well as Vitalik Buterin’s recently unveiled scaling roadmap updates.

2025-06-13T09:38:40,"Gary Gensler’s Crypto Crackdown Ends: Trump’s SEC Scraps 14 Rules","The post Gary Gensler’s Crypto Crackdown Ends: Trump’s SEC Scraps 14 Rules appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Donald Trump’s return to power is already sending shockwaves through the crypto industry — but this time, in a good way. After promising pro-crypto reforms during his campaign, Trump has now followed through. His administration has officially rolled back at least 14 controversial crypto rules introduced under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler — signaling what many believe is the start of a new deregulatory era for crypto in the U.S. US SEC Under Paul Atkins Withdraws 14 Gensler-Era Crypto Rules In a major move aligning with President Trump’s pro-crypto and deregulatory agenda, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now led by crypto-friendly Chair Paul S. Atkins , has withdrawn multiple rules that were considered harmful to digital asset innovation. Most of these policies, introduced between March 2022 and November 2023 during Gensler’s tenure, were seen as overreaching and restrictive. Why These Withdrawals Matter The previous Biden administration maintained a conservative and skeptical stance toward crypto. Gensler’s SEC took an aggressive regulatory approach that many in the industry labeled as hostile — targeting DeFi platforms, custodians, crypto derivatives, and more. Trump vowed to dismantle these roadblocks. Now, he’s making good on that promise. Top Gensler-Era Rules Now Scrapped Here are the key rules that have been rolled back , bringing relief to the crypto industry: Rule 3b-16 — DeFi in the Crosshairs Would have expanded the definition of “exchange” to include DeFi protocols and platforms facilitating communication between buyers and sellers. Its withdrawal is seen as a win for decentralized finance. Qualified Custodian Rule Would have restricted crypto custody to traditional financial institutions like banks or broker-dealers. This would’ve effectively excluded most crypto-native exchanges and wallet providers. Cybersecurity & Risk Management Rules Aimed at investment advisers and funds, including those handling crypto. Would have imposed stricter cybersecurity frameworks and regular incident disclosures. Large Swap Position Reporting Required firms dealing in crypto-related swaps to report detailed position data. Many crypto funds saw this as onerous and unnecessary. ESG Reporting Mandate Would have forced public companies to disclose extensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics. Critics argued it added non-crypto-related burdens that hinder innovation. Coinbase and Industry Leaders Celebrate Crypto leaders quickly voiced support. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal cheered the move on X, posting: “Down goes 3b-16, qualified custodian, and all the other unfinished Gensler rule proposals.” The sentiment is shared across the crypto industry, as many view this as a turning point for regulatory clarity in the U.S. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. May Issue Crypto Bonds Backed by Bitcoin and XRP, Says Ex-CFTC Chair , What’s Next for US Crypto Regulation? Although these Gensler-era rules are now off the table, the SEC under Atkins may propose new, industry-friendly regulations in the future — but only after open consultation with stakeholders. For now, the message is clear: Crypto has a seat at the table under Trump’s administration, and unnecessary barriers are being dismantled. Bottom Line With Gensler’s policies getting tossed and pro-crypto voices leading the charge, this moment could mark the true beginning of America’s crypto renaissance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-13T09:30:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price surpass previous ATH?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces minor recovery toward $0.63. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious. In this outlook, we’ll assess how Pi’s price has responded to recent events and provide an informative Pi network price prediction model from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.546 Price Change 24h -12% Market Cap $4.1 Circulating Supply 7.44B PI Trading Volume 24h $217.6M All-Time High $2.98 (Feb 26, 2025) All-Time Low $0.4012 (Apr 05, 2025) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.546 Price Prediction $ 0.477123 (-25.39%) Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 22.32% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 41.98 Pi Price Analysis PI Network dropped over 11% in 24 hours, signalling strong bearish pressure. The RSI fell to 31.92, nearing oversold territory and indicating weak buying momentum. The MACD histogram below zero shows bearish momentum with no reversal signal. As of June 13 2025, PI Network faces support near the $0.50 level, where the price briefly bounced off after a sharp decline. This zone could attract buyers looking for a short-term entry. The resistance is at around $0.60, a level previously broken during the recent decline. For any bullish recovery, the price has to break and hold above this resistance area. Pi 1-day chart shows price fall as selling pressure grows Pi Network’s price dropped to $0.5460, losing over 11% in 24 hours. This decline shows strong selling pressure dominating the market. The MACD indicator is in negative territory, with a wide gap between the MACD and signal lines. This suggests bearish momentum is gaining strength with no signs of slowing. The RSI is at 31.92, approaching the oversold zone below 30. This reflects weak buyer interest and a possible continuation of the downward trend unless reversal signals emerge. Pi/Usdt Price Chart Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart The Pi/USDT 4-hour chart reveals bearish pressure as the price dropped by 3.05%, closing at $0.5461. During the session, the price touched a low of $0.5430, showing sellers remain in control. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 14.32, which is in the oversold zone, indicating extreme selling conditions and weak buyer activity. Pi/Usdt Price Chart The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) supports the downtrend, with the MACD line at -0.0136 and the signal line at -0.0048. The growing gap between these lines, along with deep red histogram bars, confirms that bearish momentum is still strong. Traders are closely watching the $0.50 support level, which may offer temporary relief if selling slows. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.626183 BUY SMA 5 $0.615731 BUY SMA 10 $0.670562 SELL SMA 21 $0.758351 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.706153 SELL EMA 5 $0.704162 SELL EMA 10 $0.696138 SELL EMA 21 $0.77642 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.72 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Is Pi A Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi Price Down Today? Pi Coin is down today due to growing investor exits, as shown by large exchange inflows and insufficient demand to support price stability. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to achieve $10 by 2033.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction it was still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 in over-the-counter or sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. April 2025 Pi network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. May 2025 , the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T09:23:33,"Polkadot (DOT) eyes Bitcoin reserve to diversify its treasury strategy","Cryptocurrencies traded in red on Friday amid US-Iran nuclear tensions . With volatility a defining feature in the maturing digital assets sector, protocols are contemplating how to position their treasuries. In that context, the Polkadot community has introduced a forward-thinking proposal, planning to partially back the DOT ecosystem with Bitcoin. Notably, they plan to convert 501,000 DOT tokens, worth approximately $1.9 million at the current market price, into tBTC (tokenized Bitcoin). Crypto India @CryptooIndia · Follow BREAKING: Polkadot community proposes creating a #Bitcoin Strategic Reserve using 500,000 $DOT .Plan includes:• Gradual tBTC purchases via Hydration’s Rolling DCA• Adding tBTC to Hydration Omnipool as liquidityProposal is still under forum discussion. 10:32 AM · Jun 13, 2025 112 Reply Copy link Read 29 replies Polkadot forums discuss the proposal , which aims to strengthen the blockchain’s financial stability and hedge against future market uncertainty. Why is the Polkadot community considering a Bitcoin reserve? Despite cryptos’ inherent volatility, enthusiasts have widely recognized Bitcoin as a dependable store of wealth. While Polkadot has DOT as its native token, key for ecosystem growth and governance, relying on one asset makes the treasury vulnerable to wild volatility. Meanwhile, integrating BTC appears as a strategic move to instill trust in Polkadot’s financial stability and balance the treasury’s risk portfolio. One of the strongest assets of the past decade, Bitcoin continues to perform. This is an opportunity for Polkadot to hedge against uncertainty while signaling to the broader industry that we do believe in and support a multi-chain future. Managing risks via Hydration’s rolling DCA and Omnipool The proposal highlights a risk-managed and structured way of adding Bitcoin into Polkadot’s ecosystem. It involves converting native DOT into tokenized BTC through Hydration’s rolling dollar-cost averaging (DCA) feature. Rather than a one-time purchase, the community seeks to gradually swap 501K DOT assets for tBTC over a year. After the initial accumulation, the platform will supply 0.005 BTC to boost the Hydration Omnipool (a DeFi pool holding multiple assets) liquidity. After a short accumulation period, chunks of 0.005 tBTC will be provided as liquidity into the Hydration Omnipool. This will allow diversification of the Polkadot treasury portfolio while also supporting ecosystem DeFi incentives. The Bitcoin and Polkadot bridge will leverage Threshold Network’s non-custodial solution to ensure a secure, verifiable, and decentralized Bitcoin reserve. DOT price outlook The native coin hovers at $3.80 after losing over 6% in the past 24 hours. While prevailing broad market declines explain DOT’s structure, the alt has struggled over the past sessions, down 25% on the monthly timeframe. Chart by Coinmarketcap Polkadot holds a crucial support barrier at $3.60. Marking this zone as the bear cycle’s bottom could herald a significant rebound and massive gain for loyal holders . However, losing $3.60 could catalyze extended consolidations and price declines. Broad market sentiments will determine DOT’s short-term trajectory. Meanwhile, enthusiasts will watch how the proposed Bitcoin treasury might shape Polkadot’s ecosystem in the long term.

2025-06-13T09:23:08,"CFTC Interim Chair Caroline Pham Makes Critical Statements About Cryptocurrencies! ""Trump's Support Won't Make It Easier!""","While US President Donald Trump and his administration have come to the fore with their support for Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies, there has also been a softening in important institutions such as the SEC. While the CFTC is expected to be among these institutions, interim CFTC Chair Caroline Pham made important statements. Pham said the agency will maintain tight control over the cryptocurrency industry despite the Trump administration's support. CFTC interim chairman Pham emphasized that the Trump administration’s cryptocurrency policy does not mean unconditional regulatory ease. Speaking at the Coinbase Summit, Caroline Pham said the agency will not ease its oversight of cryptocurrencies amid the Trump administration’s promise to support the industry. “There is no easy path for anyone and it is not easy for regulators either. Just because we are for innovation and growth doesn't mean you can break the law with impunity. And I'm not talking about twisting the law to criminalize an asset class or technology, I'm talking about lying, cheating and stealing.” Stating that fraud and theft will not be tolerated in the crypto industry at this point, Pham stated that the CFTC has ended its “regulation through enforcement” approach and shifted its focus to fraud and scams. Caroline Pham also recently criticized previous crypto policies under the Joe Biden administration. “Biden’s past laws and regulations have not only harmed cryptocurrencies but also the current derivatives market,” Pham said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T09:18:56,"Chart Decoder Series: Bollinger Bands – How to Trade Volatility Like a Pro","Welcome back to the Chart Decoder Series, where we break down technical charting tools Bitfinex offers. So far, we’ve covered: Moving Averages (SMA & EMA) to spot trends and momentum Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought or oversold zones Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for timing entries and exits with trend shifts Now let’s dive into Bollinger Bands , a flexible tool that helps traders read volatility and spot extremes in price. What Are Bollinger Bands? Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: Middle Band : A 20-period simple moving average (SMA) Upper Band : The SMA + 2 standard deviations Lower Band : The SMA – 2 standard deviations They stretch and contract based on market volatility. When the bands are far apart: high volatility When they’re tight: low volatility (and often a big move is coming) How to Use It: Price exceeds the Upper Band This often signals overbought conditions. A short-term pullback or reversal may follow, though strong momentum can drive further gains. Price dips below the Lower Band This may indicate oversold conditions. A bounce is possible, but it’s best confirmed with additional indicators like RSI or volume. Price moves closely along the Upper Band Known as “walking the band,” this usually reflects a strong trend. While it can persist, traders should watch closely for fading momentum. Bands contract significantly A squeeze suggests the market is in a low-volatility phase. These periods often precede sharp breakouts in either direction. Bands begin to widen Indicates rising volatility. The market may be transitioning into a more active phase with larger price swings. Example in Action: Let’s break down what we’re seeing on a 1-hour BTC/USD chart on Bitfinex, using Bollinger Bands (BB 20, 2) as your main indicator. Current price: 105100 Middle Bollinger Band (20 SMA): 104978 Upper Band: 105619 Lower Band: 104337 In this example, BTC is sitting just above the Middle Band, showing tentative signs of strength. This is often a neutral-to-bullish zone, where price is deciding whether it wants to make a move or hang out sideways for a while longer. What’s interesting is that the Bollinger Bands were wider earlier , reflecting some sharp moves (clearly seen from the recent dips and spikes). But now they’re starting to contract , hinting that the market could be entering a consolidation phase . What Could Happen Next? Bullish Scenario: If BTC can hold above the Middle Band and we see a few strong candles push higher, a test of the Upper Band (~105619) is likely. A clean break above it could signal an incoming breakout (keep an eye on volume). If the price climbs without strong participation, it may just be a fake-out. Bearish Scenario: If BTC slides back below the Middle Band and volume picks up on red candles, we could revisit the Lower Band (~104337) pretty quickly. This would keep BTC in a short-term downtrend channel. Sideways Drift: The most probable scenario for now: consolidation. The slight tightening of the Bands suggests reduced volatility, meaning BTC might just range between the Middle and Upper/Lower bands while traders wait for a macro catalyst. Bollinger Bands work best when used with confirming indicators . If you’re serious about catching breakouts or reversals with more confidence, try pairing this with: RSI for overbought/oversold confirmation Volume for strength validation Candlestick patterns near the bands for entry signals BTC/USD Update with RSI + Bollinger Bands Current RSI (14): 51.47 This puts us right in the neutral zone between overbought (70) and oversold (30). No clear momentum yet, but… RSI has been slowly climbing out of a recent low and just broke above 50. This can sometimes be seen as a shift in short-term momentum , where bears are losing control and bulls are cautiously stepping in. Right now, the chart says: neutral-to-hopeful. BTC is crawling back from recent lows, with RSI nudging toward bullish territory. Still a waiting game. Pro Tips: Use Bollinger Bands with RSI or MACD to confirm signals Don’t assume every touch of the bands = reversal. Context is key Bollinger Band “squeezes” are often followed by powerful moves Watch for price – band divergence . This is when the price makes a new high but the band doesn’t widen. This could mean the trend is losing strength and a reversal or slowdown may be near.

2025-06-13T09:18:18,"DeFi platform Altitude launches publicly for collateral-optimized lending","Altitude, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on optimizing collateralized lending, has officially opened its vaults to the public, marking the successful conclusion of its private beta phase. This public launch means DeFi users can now access Altitude’s automated strategies designed to efficiently manage their collateral for both lending and borrowing activities, aiming to enhance capital efficiency and simplify the borrowing process. The transition to a public platform follows a fruitful eight-month private beta period, during which whitelisted participants had the opportunity to test and validate Altitude’s capabilities. The protocol performed smoothly during this phase, attracting a Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $5 million. With this proven track record, Altitude is now inviting the broader DeFi community to experience its innovative lending solutions. At its core, Altitude is engineered to support highly efficient management of on-chain borrowing. The platform’s primary goals are to ensure greater capital efficiency for users while diligently preventing loans from becoming under-collateralized, a common risk in the volatile crypto markets. Its user-friendly dashboard provides a clear indication of the health of each loan, based on its Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, and offers intuitive controls for users to adjust their desired parameters. A key differentiator for Altitude is its pioneering approach to automated rebalancing; it is reportedly the first DeFi protocol to automatically rebalance borrowing positions for users based on fluctuations in the price of collateral assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Tackling capital inefficiency and complexity in DeFi lending Traditional on-chain loans often suffer from capital inefficiency. Many DeFi users typically borrow at an LTV of around 40-50%, which means a significant portion of their deposited collateral remains effectively idle, not generating any returns. Altitude aims to address this by actively managing these positions. Initial users of the Altitude beta have praised the platform for the greater capital efficiency it offers, coupled with a significant reduction in the complexity normally associated with managing DeFi loans. This, in turn, frees them to concentrate on yield generation and exploring other opportunities within the decentralized finance ecosystem. Altitude’s automated system works dynamically. When the value of a user’s underlying collateral increases, the platform can borrow against this increased value. The newly borrowed capital is then deployed to generate yield, which is subsequently used to reduce the outstanding loan balance. Conversely, if the value of the collateral decreases, Altitude automatically returns funds to the lending pool to maintain an optimal LTV ratio, safeguarding against liquidation. Furthermore, Altitude’s automated lending and borrowing solution actively identifies preferable lending rates across different protocols and adjusts user positions accordingly, ensuring that users are consistently financed at the most attractive rates available. Strong backing and a vision for effortless DeFi management Altitude’s innovative approach has garnered significant support from the investment community. The platform successfully raised a total of $6.1 million in funding from a roster of leading Web3 venture capital firms, including Tioga Capital, New Form Capital, and GSR. Investors were reportedly impressed by Altitude’s solution, which aims to provide DeFi borrowers with peace of mind while simultaneously enabling them to safely generate the maximum available yield from their assets. With the private beta now successfully concluded, the opening of Altitude’s lending markets to the general public marks a significant next step in its evolution. Through an intuitive user interface, DeFi users can now take greater control of their lending and borrowing activities without the need for constant manual monitoring of their positions. This empowerment allows them to earn attractive yields on their assets, even amidst the ever-changing and often unpredictable conditions of the crypto market. Altitude operates as a decentralized protocol on the Ethereum blockchain, focused on optimizing collateralized lending by ensuring the lowest possible cost of borrowing and generating yield from users’ otherwise dormant collateral through active, real-time management of debt and collateral.

2025-06-13T09:15:35,"$190,000 Bitcoin Within the ‘Realm of Possibility,’ According to Analyst Kevin Svenson – Here’s His Outlook","Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Kevin Svenson is saying that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could rally by up to 78% from the current level. In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 83,300 YouTube subscribers that a price of $190,000 is within the realm of possibility” for Bitcoin this cycle. While $190,000 is the highest price target that Svenson says Bitcoin could reach during this cycle, the analyst says the most likely level the crypto king could reach is around 33% above the current price. “And the middle, the median ideal target is $142,500. That is sort of where you can expect Bitcoin’s price to top out in this cycle.” According to the crypto analyst, a stock market rally could act as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. “The way that I see it, if the S&P 500 can break out into new all-time highs and continue through the all-time high, that would likely allow Bitcoin to run to at least $124,000 and maybe as high as $142,000. So, that is how I see this playing out.” On when Bitcoin could top out during the current cycle, Svenson says, “We’re on the home stretch here. And this might actually run all the way up towards maybe even October… …80 weeks after each halving is usually where the top comes in and where the bear market begins… …which for this cycle lands you at end of October, beginning of November [of this year].” Bitcoin is trading at $107,017 at time of writing.

2025-06-13T09:15:08,"Bitcoin Dips Toward $100K Amid Israel-Iran Conflict, Long Positions Wiped Out","Bitcoin rally toward a new all-time high was abruptly derailed late Thursday after reports of Israeli airstrikes on Tehran sparked broad market panic. The largest cryptocurrency plunged 2.8% within 90 minutes—from $106,042 to a low of $103,053. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin has recovered to $104,900 at the time of writing, down by around 2.5% in the past day. The sudden drop has brought Bitcoin close to the psychological level of $100,000 , triggering mass liquidations. The airstrikes, which hit the Iranian capital at 22:50 UTC, were confirmed shortly after by Israeli officials. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation was aimed at neutralizing Iran’s nuclear threat, and that further strikes could follow. Iran’s response has been swift, with state media reporting the launch of over 100 drones in retaliation. As tensions escalate, risk assets are under pressure, and Bitcoin—despite being touted as a hedge—has reacted sharply in the red. Bitcoin Bullish Sentiment Collides with Geopolitical Reality The timing of the drop was particularly brutal for traders who had positioned themselves for a breakout above Bitcoin’s previous all-time high of $111,940. On Tuesday, just days before the conflict flared, BTC had rallied to $110,265, stoking bullish sentiment . According to data from CoinGlass, more than $427 million in long positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours as the price plunged, leaving many traders nursing heavy losses. However, not all are pessimistic. Bitcoin advocate Anthony Pompliano pointed out that similar market reactions were seen last October when Iran launched hundreds of rockets toward Israel. Back then, BTC initially dropped 3%, only to outperform traditional safe-haven assets like gold and oil within 48 hours. “The initial reaction is always fear,” Pompliano said, “but Bitcoin has a way of bouncing back stronger.” Buy-the-Dip Mentality Returns Meanwhile, both gold and oil have climbed 1.44% and 11% respectively, highlighting a broader flight to safety. Yet some believe BTC’s time to shine could still come. Among those urging calm is Samson Mow of Jan3, who posted a message to GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen encouraging strategic buying. Mow stated, “This is where you buy it when it feels scary. If it dips lower and you feel even more nervous, buy even more.” GameStop recently allocated part of its $1.5 billion raise to purchase 4,710 BTC, worth $513 million at the time.

2025-06-13T09:15:01,"Bitcoin ($BTC) Price Prediction for June 14, 2025: Bulls Lose $106K as Key Trendline Fails Amid Wider Selloff","After an intense bout of selling pressure across crypto majors, the Bitcoin price today has dropped to around $104,020, down nearly 1.6% over the past 24 hours. This correction comes just days after bulls failed to maintain support above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level near $106,235, leading to a sharp rejection from the upper resistance at $110,000. The downside momentum has accelerated as broader risk sentiment weakens, putting immediate focus on whether the $102,500 zone will hold in the coming sessions. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The recent dip in the Bitcoin price action is part of a broader structure breakdown visible across lower and higher timeframes. On the 30-minute chart, BTC pierced through a key support region between $105,000 and $104,500, following which a breakdown retested the lower Bollinger Band near $104,000.

2025-06-13T09:11:07,"Top reasons why Bitcoin and altcoins like Bonk, Floki, Pepe may rebound","Bitcoin and other altcoins like Bonk, Floki, and Pepe crashed on Friday as concerns about geopolitics rose. BTC price plunged to $102,000, and then bounced back above $105,000. Other top altcoins like Bonk, Floki, and Pepe also plunged, with the total market cap of all coins dropping to $3.2 trillion. This article explains why these tokens may bounce back in the coming days. Bitcoin and altcoin crash was a knee-jerk reaction The first main reason why Bitcoin and altcoins like Pepe, Bonk, and Floki may bounce back is that the crash was a knee-jerk reaction or an overreaction. Historically, risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies plunge whenever there are significant black-swan events. A good example of this is when they crashed at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Most of them plunged as investors predicted the “end of the world.” Most recently, Bitcoin and these altcoins plunged when Donald Trump delivered his “ Liberation Day ” speech introducing “reciprocal” tariffs on all countries, including allies and foes. Bitcoin crashed to $74,500 after Trump introduced tariffs, triggering a bigger dive among other altcoins. Another notable event was the crypto market crash that happened in late 2022 following the collapse of FTX. Bitcoin and other altcoins bounced back after that. Bitcoin demand and supply is supportive The other main reason why Bitcoin and other altcoins may bounce back soon is that the demand and supply is supportive. Data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs had net inflows of over $86 million on Friday, bringing the cumulative total to over $45 billion. BlackRock’s IBIT had net inflows of $288 million on Thursday, which was offset by a $197 million outflow from Fidelity’s fund. IBIT now has over $72 billion in inflows, while Fidelity’s FBTC has $21.1 billion, while Ark Invest has $5 billion. Spot Ethereum ETFs are also attracting substantial inflows. They had net inflows of over $112 million on Thursday, with BlackRock’s ETHA having inflows of $101 million. It has brought its net assets to $4.5 billion. These funds have had inflows in the last five consecutive weeks. At the same time, their supply on exchanges have plunged this year. Bitcoin supply on exchanges has dropped to 1.1 million from the year-to-date high of $1.5 million. The supply of Ethereum also continued to fall this year. Therefore, the ongoing demand and supply metrics mean that Bitcoin price will bounce back this year. If this happens, other altcoins like Pepe, Bonk, and Floki will surge. Bitcoin price cup and handle BTC price chart | Source: TradingView The other main reason why Bitcoin price will bounce back in the coming weeks is its strong technicals. The daily chart shows that the coin formed a double-top pattern at $109,200. It then formed a rounded bottom, confirming the cup section of the cup-and-handle pattern, a popular bullish signal. It is now forming the handle section of this pattern. The cup section has a depth of 30%. Measuring the same depth and the upper side of the cup-and-handle pattern gives it a target of $143,000. It has also moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back in the coming days. Such a move will then trigger more gains among altcoins.

2025-06-13T09:10:39,"Anthony Pompliano Set to Head $750M Bitcoin Investment Vehicle: FT","Anthony Pompliano, a digital assets influencer and podcast host, is set to become CEO of ProCapBTC, a new investment vehicle aiming to acquire large amounts of bitcoin BTC, according to the Financial Times , which cited three people familiar with the talks. Under the proposed deal, ProCapBTC plans to raise $750 million, $500 million in equity and $250 million in convertible debt, in a merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by Cohen & Company, the FT said. A deal could be announced as early as next week, although negotiations are still in progress and final terms uncertain. Bitcoin buying has become an increasingly popular treasury strategy, with 126 publicly traded companies now holding almost 820,000 bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . Strategy (MSTR), the software maker whose Executive Chairman Michael Saylor pioneered the approach now holds $61 billion worth of BTC. If all ProCapBTC's $750 million was spent on bitcoin, it would rank just outside the top 10 holders of the largest cryptocurrency. The move reflects renewed enthusiasm in crypto markets following the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who on Thursday said it's an ""honor"" to be considered a pro-crypto president . His administration's easing of rules governing the industry has prompted a number of companies to consider selling shares to the public. Last week, stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) rose 168% on its first day of trading and the Peter Thiel-backed Bullish , is reportedly pursuing an IPO. Bullish Group is the parent of both CoinDesk and Bullish Exchange. Pompliano declined to comment to the FT, and Cohen & Company did not respond to its request for comment.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/13/anthony-pompliano-set-to-head-750m-bitcoin-investment-vehicle-ft,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|Anthony Pompliano|Bitcoin|SPAC|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T09:09:45,"Sharplink Crash Triggers Confusion Over Ether Treasury Play","This filing increased investor fears despite reassurances from executives that no actual sales occurred. The drop came shortly after Sharplink revealed plans to raise $1 billion to purchase Ethereum as part of its blockchain treasury strategy. GameStop also saw a post-earnings dip as Q1 revenue missed expectations. Despite gaming share drops, there is still interest in gaming companies. Tencent is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Nexon, which recently launched Web3 versions of MapleStory. However, the discussions are still in the early stages, and no formal agreement has been made. Sharplink Crashes as Market Misreads Filing Shares in sports betting platform Sharplink Gaming plummeted by 67% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company's filing to register nearly 58.7 million shares for potential resale. This very clearly caused some concern among investors. The sharp decline followed a 12.25% drop in the stock’s regular trading hours, closing at $32.53 before briefly plunging below $8. It later stabilized somewhat by trading at $10.55. Sharplink Gaming share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) The market reaction was driven by confusion over the nature of the filing. Joseph Lubin, chairman of Sharplink Gaming and CEO of blockchain software company Consensys, took to social media to clarify that the Form S-3 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was standard practice and does not signal that any actual sales of shares took place. He explained that the filing is a procedural step after a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal and does not reflect current or imminent sales. Matt Corva , general counsel at Consensys, shared that the filing merely formalizes details that were already made public two weeks earlier. “It doesn’t reflect anyone’s sales, which may or may not ever happen,” Corva stated. He also mentioned that the filing confirms the previously announced sale of shares to investors, validating the company’s Ethereum-focused treasury strategy. Sharplink revealed on May 30 that it plans to raise up to $1 billion through a stock sale to fund a major Ethereum (ETH) acquisition as part of its new blockchain-based treasury strategy. Despite the clarification, the abrupt drop in share price proved that investors are very cautious of the large resale filings. Charles Allen , CEO of BTCS Inc., talked about the psychological impact such filings can have on shareholders. “This creates a prisoner’s dilemma,” he said, referencing the rush among investors to sell before others do. However, Allen speculated that the situation could turn around quickly if Sharplink follows through on its promise and announces the anticipated $1 billion Ether purchase soon. “If they played cards right,” he suggested, “this could be a brilliantly timed move to reignite investor confidence and the stock’s momentum.” GameStop Shares Slide After Mixed Q1 and Bitcoin Bet GameStop Corp (GME) shares also slipped in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the release of its first-quarter earnings , which painted a mixed picture of operational recovery despite declining revenue. The video game retailer reported $732.4 million in revenue for the quarter ending May 3. This fell short of analyst expectations of $754.2 million and was a 17% year-over-year decline. The company attributed the revenue drop to persistent headwinds in physical game sales. Overview of GameStop’s Q1 performance (Source: GameStop ) Despite the weaker top-line figure, GameStop recorded some improvements in profitability. Net income reached $44.8 million, a turnaround from a net loss of $32.3 million during the same period last year. Operating losses also narrowed to $10.8 million, compared to $50.6 million in Q1 of 2024. Still, the market reacted negatively to the revenue miss, with GME shares dropping more than 3.5% in after-hours trading to just above $29. GameStop share price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) The company’s stock performance has been relatively stagnant over the past month and is down approximately 3.8% year-to-date. This modest decline comes shortly after GameStop entered the world of digital assets by confirming in late May that it purchased 4,710 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at around $513 million at the time. The firm said the Bitcoin acquisition was funded through a $1.3 billion convertible note offering. GameStop has not revealed just how much more Bitcoin it plans to purchase but indicated that it has some flexibility in its strategy. This means that it may sell its holdings if necessary. The company reported a robust $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which is an impressive increase from $1 billion a year ago. This gives it more than enough firepower to expand its Bitcoin reserve in the future. Tencent Explores Nexon Deal Despite the recent gaming stock drops, there is still some interest in gaming companies. Tencent, one of China’s largest tech conglomerates, is reportedly in discussions to acquire South Korean game developer and publisher Nexon, the company behind the popular MapleStory franchise. According to a Bloomberg report , representatives from Tencent reached out to the family of Nexon founder Kim Jung-ju to explore a possible deal. However, the discussions are still in the early stages, and no formal agreement has been made. Nexon has long been a dominant force in the online gaming industry, and MapleStory gained massive popularity in the early 2000s. More recently, Nexon has been active in the Web3 gaming space by launching blockchain-integrated versions of its flagship series. In May of 2025, the company rolled out MapleStory N and MapleStory Universe, both of which allow players to earn and trade in-game items as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Web3 gaming, while still a niche segment in the gaming industry, experienced a dramatic uptick in activity. A February 2025 report from DappRadar indicated that blockchain gaming saw a 368% year-over-year surge in January, driven in part by the popularity of games like Off The Grid — a AAA-quality shooter by Gunzilla Games — and anticipation around MapleStory N. These new titles aim to merge high-end graphics and gameplay with blockchain-based economies. This is a departure from earlier Web3 games that focused more on rewards and often lacked gameplay depth. (Source: DappRadar ) Despite this excitement, the sector still has to reach mainstream adoption. DappRadar reported a 10% drop in daily unique active wallets by early 2025, which suggests that the initial surge of interest may be tapering off. There are also still some challenges to overcome, including the complexity of setting up crypto wallets and widespread skepticism among traditional gamers, many of whom vsee monetization mechanics like play-to-earn with suspicion . While Tencent’s potential acquisition of Nexon could energize the Web3 gaming landscape, it also sheds some light on the sector’s ongoing struggle to balance innovation with accessibility and player trust.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9556/sharplink-crash-triggers-confusion-over-ether-treasury-play,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
