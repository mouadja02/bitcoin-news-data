It was particularly noteworthy that despite the rising prices of Bitcoin, investors did not see the expected increase in profit taking. Commenting on the profit realization ratio (SOPR) obtained from on-chain data, Alphractal said: “This is surprising. Normally, when prices rise, the profit-taking rate increases and peaks at each new price level. However, right now, although the Bitcoin price is rising, profit-taking is not keeping pace. On the contrary, it is falling. This tells us that investors still see $100,000 as cheap.” Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson drew attention to two important metrics that stand out on technical analysis screens: “The vast majority of altcoins are still in the bearish zone on the 24-hour timeframe, with the MACD indicator. On the other hand, according to the weekly RSI data, some coins are in the overbought zone: TRX, SPX, XMR, GT, and even BTC. In contrast, the coin with the lowest RSI in the oversold zone is CTK, followed by Melania.” Related News: BREAKING: Company that Previously Announced Plans to Purchase $1 Billion of This Altcoin Withdraws Application Wedson drew particular attention to one altcoin in the market: “RENDER is in oversold territory and the increase in open interest on the 5-minute to 1-hour timeframe suggests that whales are long.” *This is not investment advice.

The recent air strikes by Israel on Iran have created geopolitical pressure, which has intensified the sell-offs. Meanwhile, the BTC price and the entire market have witnessed numerous pressures like these in the recent past and hence are believed to withstand the ongoing sell-off and turn out victorious soon. The crypto markets witnessed over $1.1 billion in liquidations, while S&P 500 futures fell 1.9% and crude oil & Gold surged. Meanwhile, from the technical point of view, the BTC chart pattern shows some worrying patterns that point towards more downside. The token printed 3 consecutive daily bearish candles and wiped out the gains incurred earlier this week. With this, the token has reached a crucial level where a rebound could trigger a strong upswing, while a pullback could cause some concerns. The daily chart of Bitcoin shows the formation of an inverse head and shoulder pattern, which is largely considered bullish. However, to validate the price, it is required to trigger a rebound from the lower support and rise along the curve to reach the neckline at around $110,500. If this happens, then the price is more likely to breach the neckline and form a new ATH. However, the technicians suggest a diverse price action showing the possibility of a pullback while the volume continues to drop. The CMF has dropped below 0, suggesting an outflow of money or sell-off, while the RSI is maintaining a steep descending trend. With this, the RSI has reached the ascending support, and hence a drop below the levels could initiate a fresh bearish trend, leading the price lower. To prevent excess drain, probably close to $100K or below, a daily close above the current levels is required, which may hinder the momentum of bears and eventually offer room for a consolidated ascending trend. Therefore, the upcoming weekly close could have a huge impact on the next Bitcoin (BTC) price rally.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-btc-tests-critical-support-amid-geopolitical-uncertainty-will-it-rebound-to-105k-or-drop-to-102k/,"BTC|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T06:33:33,"Fact Check: Is Ripple Dumping XRP Every Month?","The post Fact Check: Is Ripple Dumping XRP Every Month? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Each month, Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP from escrow , and this routine action often fuels rumors of a price dump. But is Ripple flooding the market? According to crypto analyst Vincent Van Code , the truth behind Ripple’s escrow system is far less dramatic—and far more strategic. How Ripple’s Monthly XRP Escrow Works Ripple uses a pre-programmed escrow system built into the XRP Ledger. Every month, 1 billion XRP is unlocked, but only a small portion enters the market . Vincent Van Code explains that more than 80% of the XRP is re-locked into new escrows immediately. The remaining XRP, typically 10% to 20%, is allocated to Ripple’s operational expenses, liquidity needs, and strategic partnerships. This method prevents sudden supply shocks and ensures long-term sustainability. Where Does the Unlocked XRP Go? The XRP that gets re-locked is placed into new time-locked escrows on the blockchain. These are not held by Ripple directly but governed by the XRP Ledger’s built-in escrow protocol. This design ensures XRP cannot be accessed or sold prematurely , eliminating concerns over sudden large-scale dumps. XRP’s Role in Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity System Ripple uses XRP to power its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, enabling fast and low-cost international transactions. When financial institutions use ODL, they convert fiat into XRP, transfer it across borders, and then convert it back into local currency—all within seconds. This use case means the XRP is not held for speculation; it is rapidly bought and sold to complete real transactions. As a result, it has minimal impact on long-term price movements. Ripple’s Sales Are a Small Fraction of Market Volume Van Code also points out that Ripple’s XRP sales represent less than 1% of daily market volume. Given the 24-hour volume exceeding $212 billion, the idea that Ripple is crashing the price through these sales doesn’t hold up. Factors like Bitcoin price , regulatory news, and institutional activity play a far greater role in market movements. He adds that if Ripple had been trying to dump XRP, the market would have reacted much more severely by now. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For June 13 , XRP Market Performance in 2025 Despite market volatility, XRP has outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum , showing a 335.1% annual gain. Here’s how XRP has moved in 2025: January: +46% February: -29.3% March: -2.52% April: +4.98% May: -0.80% June (so far): -2.38% Last 7 Days: -0.8% Last 24 Hours: -6.1% While short-term corrections exist, XRP’s long-term growth and expanding real-world use case remain promising. Fact Check: Is Ripple Dumping XRP? No, Ripple is not dumping XRP. Ripple does unlock 1 billion XRP each month, but over 80% is re-locked into new escrow contracts. Only 10–20% is used for operations and liquidity, mostly powering On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) transactions—not for market dumping. The XRP Ledger ensures this process is transparent and time-locked. Ripple’s sales make up less than 1% of daily volume, so claims of price manipulation are false. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-13T06:30:24,"Missed Litecoin’s Peak? Qubetics Could Be the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy Heading Into 2025","In 2011, Litecoin ($LTC) entered the crypto industry with a modest launch price of around $0.30. Back then, few believed it could hold a candle to Bitcoin, let alone go on to command a value above $80 in 2025 with a market cap in the billions. Those who took early positions in Litecoin now sit on massive gains. But for many others, the regret of missing out on that early entry remains sharp. The question echoing across crypto circles today is: where’s the next Litecoin-level opportunity hiding, is it Qubetics ? Crypto’s track record of life-changing returns has triggered waves of new buyers in search of the next high-potential digital asset. As the market matures and more capital flows into real-world utility tokens, attention is quickly shifting from legacy coins to next-generation projects. Among these, Qubetics ($TICS) is now standing out as a popular crypto coin to buy in 2025—especially for those looking for functionality, innovation, and long-term value. Qubetics ($TICS), with its strong utility focus and fast-rising momentum, is emerging as a leading contender. Qubetics ($TICS) – Building Beyond Hype with Real Utility Unlike many speculative tokens, Qubetics has grounded its momentum in something substantial: its Decentralized VPN. While data privacy becomes a growing concern across the globe, Qubetics offers a real-world solution for individuals and businesses looking to navigate online environments securely, free from centralised control or surveillance. Its blockchain-powered VPN eliminates the need for centralised servers, meaning that no single authority can track or compromise a user’s online activity. For a small business handling sensitive client data, this solution offers a non-negotiable upgrade in security. A professional dealing with high-stakes contracts or intellectual property can access confidential material from any location without fear of interception. Even average users—content creators, gamers, remote workers—stand to benefit from faster, private connections routed through decentralized nodes rather than legacy VPN providers who might store logs or share user data. And that’s just one pillar of the Qubetics infrastructure. It’s not just about offering anonymity; it’s about putting digital control back into the hands of the people—where it belongs. Qubetics is currently in the 37th and final public stage of its crypto presale . So far, over 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 27,800 holders, raising more than $17.9 million. Tokens are priced at $0.3370, but the moment the presale ends, that price jumps to $0.40 with a 20% uptick. But the value here goes well beyond that initial bump. Following a sharp tokenomics overhaul, Qubetics reduced its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, instantly increasing token scarcity. Moreover, 38.55% of the total supply is now earmarked for public distribution, meaning decentralized control is more than a promise—it’s protocol-deep. Analysts are already noting the potential upside. If $TICS hits $5 post-listing, an $18,000 investment at the current presale rate would be worth over $266,000. Should the token reach $10 or $15 post-mainnet—as several credible forecasts now suggest—that same investment could skyrocket to $532,000 or even $798,000. Utility, timing, and architecture—that’s what separates Qubetics from typical presale projects. It’s not just another altcoin vying for visibility; it’s an ecosystem crafted for long-term relevance. With momentum accelerating and scarcity increasing, Qubetics isn’t just worth watching, it’s a project worth backing. Litecoin ($LTC): The One That Got Away for Many Litecoin has earned its spot in the pantheon of legacy crypto assets. Known as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” it brought faster transaction speeds and a more accessible mining algorithm to the table at a time when Bitcoin was starting to scale. It didn’t promise the moon—but over time, it quietly delivered. What started at $0.30 ballooned over the years. Its network upgrades, such as the integration of the Lightning Network and MimbleWimble privacy features, strengthened its case as a reliable and private digital cash alternative. Litecoin’s longevity alone is a testament to its architecture and adaptability. But while $LTC remains a respected name in crypto, it no longer offers the same exponential growth upside as it once did. The ship has largely sailed for those looking to make outsized returns from a low entry point. For backers hunting for the next standout with a strong use case and a timely entry price, Litecoin today doesn’t hold the same allure it once did. Legacy matters. Stability matters. And for those seeking a hedge with historical relevance, Litecoin continues to be a dependable choice. It may not 10x from here, but it remains a key part of the broader crypto ecosystem. However, for those who missed Litecoin’s prime, Qubetics may now be the next best option—and in many ways, a more innovative one. Final Thoughts – Which is One Of The Popular Crypto Coins To Buy? Based on current market dynamics and performance metrics, Qubetics stands out as the popular crypto coin to buy in today’s fast-shifting blockchain space. While Litecoin proved its worth and brought in major returns to early adopters, Qubetics is creating a new category altogether—built on decentralized privacy tools and public-first tokenomics. With less than 10 million tokens left in its presale, the window is closing. Those looking to position themselves for the next cycle may want to take a long, hard look at what Qubetics is building. Because in a space where timing and utility rule, $TICS might just be the rare blend of both.

2025-06-13T06:21:05,"Philippines SEC Unveils New Crypto Regulation","The post Philippines SEC Unveils New Crypto Regulation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On Thursday, the Philippines enacted stricter crypto rules under the new SEC Memorandum Circulars Nos 4 and 5, mandating a CASP license with a capital requirement and reporting of AML. Experts say this new framework in the Philippines lays the groundwork for broader crypto adoption in the country. Key Components of the New SEC Crypto Regulation No License- No Business All crypto asset service providers in the Philippines are now required to obtain a CASP license and adhere to strict disclosure requirements. The disclosure includes information on asset ownership, risks, and operations; crypto companies are required to submit these documents at least 30 days before beginning marketing. Investment requirement policy SEC is ensuring that only eligible firms enter the market, so it has set a minimum paid capital requirement of PHP 100 million. However, the SEC has also provided a mechanism for smaller companies to apply. Physical office SEC has stated that crypto companies seeking to provide services are required to have a physical office in the Philippines and pay an initial PHP 50,000 filing fee. An additional annual supervision fee on revenue will be levied by the officials. Consumer Protection The SEC and the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) council will monitor the CASP. They will ensure security, professionalism, KYC policy, and fair access for investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Brazil’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill passes first committee , Penalty For Non-Compliance The bill was initially issued on May 30th and later took effect on June 12. It states that if a token/ crypto behaves like a financial product or security under federal law of the country, it is subject to SEC regulation. Therefore, the SEC holds the authority to suspend or revoke the CASP license for noncompliance. Guilty CASP will face a fine of up to PHP 100 million and imprisonment for up to five years. Challenges in Implementing The New Crypto Regulations Luis Buenaventura, head of crypto finance at super-app GCash, said there will be substantial challenges implementing the new CASP rules. “Regulation is rarely perfect on day one, but as long as the regulatory authority takes a progressive approach and stays open to refining the framework over time, then I think this signals the Philippines,” said Nathan Marasign, Partner at MLaw Office. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-13T06:10:05,"Crypto Liquidations: Shocking $321 Million Wipeout Rocks Futures Market","BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations: Shocking $321 Million Wipeout Rocks Futures Market Wow, what a rollercoaster! If you’ve been watching the charts lately, you’ve likely seen some dramatic price swings. These movements, while exciting for some, can be brutal for others, especially those involved in crypto futures trading. We just witnessed a staggering event: over $321 million worth of crypto futures positions were liquidated in a single hour across major exchanges. Looking at the bigger picture, the past 24 hours saw total liquidations exceed a massive $636 million . These numbers aren’t just statistics; they represent significant losses for traders and highlight the inherent risks in the volatile crypto market . What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? Let’s break down what these dramatic crypto liquidations actually mean. In simple terms, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange because they no longer have sufficient margin to keep the trade open. Think of margin as the collateral you put down for a loan (in this case, the leverage). If the market moves against your position, and your losses start eating into your margin, the exchange will automatically close your position to prevent your balance from going below zero. This prevents the exchange from losing money. It’s a swift, automated process designed to manage risk, but it can be devastating for the trader whose position is liquidated. Understanding Crypto Futures and Leveraged Trading The massive numbers we’re seeing are directly linked to crypto futures and the use of leveraged trading . Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) at a specific price on a future date. They are popular tools for speculation and hedging. Leverage is where things get amplified. Leveraged trading allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. For example, with 10x leverage, you can open a $10,000 position with only $1,000 of your own money. This magnifies potential profits if the market moves in your favor. However, it also magnifies potential losses if the market moves against you. This is the core mechanism that leads to liquidations. Here’s a quick look at how leverage impacts your risk: Low Leverage (e.g., 2x-5x): Requires a larger margin percentage. More room for the market to move against you before liquidation. High Leverage (e.g., 20x-100x or more): Requires a much smaller margin percentage. Very little room for the market to move against you. A small price swing can trigger liquidation. The recent $321 million liquidation hour suggests that many traders were using high leverage, making their positions extremely vulnerable to even minor market fluctuations. The Role of Crypto Market Volatility The crypto market volatility is the fuel that drives these large-scale liquidation events. Cryptocurrencies are known for their rapid and unpredictable price swings. Unlike traditional markets, crypto can experience double-digit percentage moves in a single day, or even an hour. When many traders have leveraged long positions (betting the price will go up), a sudden sharp drop in price can trigger a cascade of liquidations. As positions are closed, selling pressure increases, potentially driving the price down further, which then triggers even more liquidations. This is often referred to as a ‘liquidation cascade’ or ‘long squeeze’. Conversely, a rapid price surge can cause a ‘short squeeze’, liquidating traders who were betting on the price falling. The recent event seems to be a result of a significant price drop, catching many leveraged long traders off guard. This highlights a key challenge of trading in this space: managing the extreme volatility. Navigating Trading Risk: Lessons from the Wipeout The recent liquidation event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent trading risk involved in leveraged crypto futures. While the potential rewards of leverage are high, the risks are equally, if not more, significant. So, what can traders learn from this? Challenges of Leveraged Trading: Magnified Losses: A small market move can wipe out your entire margin. Liquidation Risk: The constant threat of your position being forcibly closed. Emotional Toll: High leverage can lead to stressful decision-making and impulsive actions. Funding Rates: Holding leveraged positions overnight can incur costs. Actionable Insights for Managing Trading Risk: For anyone engaging with crypto futures or considering leveraged trading , here are some crucial steps to mitigate the trading risk : Understand Leverage: Don’t use leverage you don’t fully comprehend. Start small and understand the margin requirements and liquidation price for your specific position. Use Stop-Loss Orders: This is perhaps the most critical tool. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position if the price hits a certain level, limiting your potential loss and preventing liquidation. Avoid Excessive Leverage: Just because you can use 100x leverage doesn’t mean you should. Lower leverage gives your position more breathing room against crypto market volatility . Risk Management is Key: Never risk more capital than you can afford to lose on a single trade. Consider position sizing relative to your overall portfolio. Stay Informed: Keep track of market news, technical indicators, and sentiment. While volatility is inherent, sudden news or shifts can trigger rapid moves. Consider the Funding Rate: Understand the cost of holding leveraged positions, especially during periods of high market demand for leverage. Examples of good practice include setting stop-losses immediately after opening a leveraged position and using a trading journal to track decisions and outcomes. The Broader Impact on the Crypto Market While painful for individual traders, these large liquidation events can also have broader effects on the crypto market . They can contribute to price volatility in the short term, potentially leading to temporary price bottoms as forced selling exhausts itself, or conversely, accelerating downward trends. They also serve as a reset, sometimes clearing out over-leveraged positions and potentially setting the stage for more sustainable price movements later. However, they underscore that the market remains susceptible to sharp, rapid moves driven by leveraged positions. Conclusion: Navigating the Storms of Crypto Futures The recent event, seeing hundreds of millions in crypto liquidations within hours, is a powerful illustration of the amplified risks in crypto futures trading, especially when using high leveraged trading . It’s a direct consequence of the intense crypto market volatility colliding with aggressive positions. While the potential for profit is a draw, the reality of trading risk means that caution, education, and robust risk management strategies are not optional – they are essential. Understanding how liquidations happen and implementing tools like stop-losses can be the difference between weathering a market storm and being swept away by it. Trade smart, manage your risk, and respect the power of leverage in this dynamic market.

2025-06-13T06:06:36,"GameStop raises planned convertible note offering to $2.25B from initial $1.75B","GameStop has raised the size of its planned convertible note sale to $2.25 billion from the original $1.75 billion. According to the company’s June 12 press release , the notes, which do not pay interest and are due in 2032, will be sold privately to large institutional investors. GameStop also gave buyers the option to purchase an extra $450 million worth of notes, which could bring the total to $2.7 billion. The company expects the sale to close on June 17. After fees and costs, GameStop says it will receive about $2.23 billion, or $2.68 billion if the additional notes are sold. The funds will go toward general business needs, including investments and possible acquisitions. While GameStop has not confirmed plans to buy more Bitcoin ( BTC ), the move follows an earlier sale in April where it raised $1.5 billion and used part of the funds to buy 4,710 BTC worth $512 million. As previously reported by crypto.news, the June 11 announcement of the initial $1.75 billion offering triggered a sharp 20% selloff in GameStop shares.

With a dwindling retail footprint and declining core revenues, which dropped 17% quarter-over-quarter in Q1, the company has been doubling down on digital assets. GameStop is one of several public companies that now hold large amounts of Bitcoin. Its May purchase made it the 13th largest corporate holder, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. The company’s broader strategy appears to echo Strategy’s shift, where aggressive Bitcoin accumulation became central to market valuation despite stagnant product revenues. The newly priced notes carry a conversion rate equivalent to $28.91 per share, a 32.5% premium over the average June 12 trading price. The notes do not bear interest, and GameStop cannot redeem them until June 2029, unless certain thresholds are met. Investors may convert early under specific conditions or demand redemption in 2028. The offering gives GameStop more time and flexibility as it looks for ways to recover from declining sales and changing demand in the gaming and retail space.

2025-06-13T06:00:49,"China Tariffs: Lutnick Issues Urgent Warning on Pause Ending","BitcoinWorld China Tariffs: Lutnick Issues Urgent Warning on Pause Ending The world of global finance and trade is often subject to shifts influenced by geopolitical tides. A recent statement attributed to prominent figure Howard Lutnick suggests one such significant shift may be on the horizon, potentially impacting everything from traditional stock markets to the volatile realm of digital assets. The core message? The current pause on China tariffs is unlikely to last. Who is Howard Lutnick and Why Does His View on China Tariffs Matter? Before diving into the implications, it’s important to understand the source. Howard Lutnick is a highly influential figure in the financial world, serving as the Chairman and CEO of BGC Partners and Cantor Fitzgerald. These are major players in global financial services, market brokerage, and real estate. Lutnick’s positions give him unique insights into global capital flows, market sentiment, and macroeconomic trends. When someone with his access and perspective speaks about major trade policy like China tariffs , markets and analysts tend to pay close attention. His comments, reportedly shared via Solid Intel on X, signal a potential change in the landscape that could have far-reaching consequences. Understanding the US-China Trade Context The history of recent US-China trade relations has been marked by periods of tension and negotiation, particularly concerning tariffs. Introduced primarily during the Trump administration, these tariffs imposed significant taxes on various goods imported from China, aiming to address trade imbalances and intellectual property concerns. While there have been phases of de-escalation or pauses on implementing new tariffs, the existing ones have remained a point of contention and a factor influencing supply chains and global economic planning. A ‘pause’ suggests a temporary hold or a lack of new escalations, but Lutnick’s view indicates this temporary state is nearing its conclusion. What Happens if the China Tariff Pause Ends? The potential end of the pause on China tariffs isn’t just a technical trade adjustment; it’s a policy shift with tangible economic effects. If new tariffs are imposed or existing ones are increased, several outcomes are likely: Increased Costs: Importers in the US would face higher costs for goods from China, which could be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. Supply Chain Disruption: Businesses might accelerate efforts to diversify supply chains away from China, a process that is complex, costly, and can lead to short-term disruptions. Retaliation: China could respond with its own tariffs on US goods and services, harming American exporters, particularly in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. Reduced Trade Volume: Overall trade between the two economic giants could decrease, impacting businesses reliant on this exchange. This scenario paints a picture of increased economic friction between the world’s two largest economies, creating uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. How Could Renewed Tariffs Impact Global Markets? The potential re-escalation of the US-China trade conflict is a significant macroeconomic factor that directly influences global markets . Financial markets dislike uncertainty, and renewed trade tensions inject a large dose of it. Here’s how markets could react: Stock Market Volatility: Sectors heavily reliant on trade with China (e.g., technology, manufacturing, retail) could see increased volatility and potential downturns. Broader market indices might react negatively to the prospect of reduced corporate profits and economic slowdown. Investor Sentiment: A breakdown in trade relations can sour investor sentiment globally, leading to a more risk-averse approach. This might cause a rotation out of riskier assets into perceived safe havens. Currency Fluctuations: The US dollar and the Chinese Yuan could see movements based on trade flows and central bank interventions. Other currencies tied to global trade might also be affected. Commodity Prices: Demand for certain commodities could shift based on supply chain changes and industrial activity in both countries. Monitoring statements from figures like Howard Lutnick becomes crucial for market participants trying to navigate this complex environment. Exploring the Cryptocurrency Impact For those focused on digital assets, the potential end of the China tariffs pause raises questions about the cryptocurrency impact . While crypto markets often operate on their own unique drivers, they are not entirely immune to macroeconomic forces and shifts in global sentiment. Here are a few ways renewed trade tensions could play out: Safe Haven Narrative: In times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty, assets outside the traditional financial system, like Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as potential safe havens. Increased trade tensions could bolster this narrative, potentially driving some capital into crypto. Risk-Off Sentiment: Conversely, if renewed tariffs trigger a broader ‘risk-off’ sentiment across global markets , cryptocurrencies, which are still considered high-risk by many traditional investors, could see outflows alongside stocks and other growth assets. Inflation Hedge? If tariffs contribute to inflation in the US by increasing import costs, assets perceived as inflation hedges, including Bitcoin, might gain attention. Capital Flight: In some scenarios, increased economic friction or capital controls related to trade could potentially lead to capital seeking alternative avenues, some of which might flow into cryptocurrencies, although this is a more speculative outcome. The relationship is complex and not always direct, but it’s clear that major shifts in US-China trade relations add another layer of macro uncertainty that crypto investors must consider. Challenges and Opportunities Arising from Trade Shifts The end of the tariff pause presents significant challenges but also potential opportunities: Challenges: Increased costs for businesses and consumers. Disruption of established supply chains. Reduced profitability for companies reliant on US-China trade. Heightened geopolitical risk. Potential for slower global economic growth. Opportunities: Incentive for companies to diversify supply chains to other countries. Potential boost for domestic industries that compete with Chinese imports. Increased focus on technological innovation to reduce reliance on imports. Possible increased interest in alternative assets (like certain cryptocurrencies) if traditional markets face sustained pressure. Navigating these requires careful analysis and strategic planning. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the potential for renewed China tariffs and their impact on global markets and the potential cryptocurrency impact , what steps can investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on official announcements regarding trade policy and expert opinions like those from Howard Lutnick . Review Portfolio Diversification: Assess exposure to sectors and companies heavily involved in US-China trade. Consider diversifying across different geographies and asset classes. Evaluate Supply Chain Risk: For stock investors, understand how companies in your portfolio manage their supply chains and their vulnerability to tariff changes. Consider Alternative Assets: If you believe trade tensions will increase market volatility or inflation, research how assets like gold or certain cryptocurrencies might fit into your strategy (understanding the risks involved with crypto). Long-Term Perspective: Trade disputes can create short-term noise. Focus on your long-term investment goals rather than reacting impulsively to daily headlines. Understanding the interplay between geopolitics, trade policy, and financial markets is key in uncertain times. Conclusion: Preparing for Potential Trade Headwinds Howard Lutnick’s reported comments serve as a timely reminder that the pause in China tariffs is not a permanent state. The potential return or escalation of these tariffs could introduce significant headwinds for US-China trade , disrupt global markets , and have an indirect but notable cryptocurrency impact . While the exact timing and nature of any policy changes remain to be seen, staying informed about the views of influential figures like Howard Lutnick and understanding the potential consequences is essential for navigating the complex economic landscape ahead. Investors across all asset classes should prepare for potential increased volatility and consider how renewed trade tensions might affect their portfolios.

2025-06-13T06:00:19,"Bitcoin Could Jump 20% For Every 1% Liquidity Boost: Expert","Bitcoin’s blistering second-quarter advance is tracking the strongest expansion in global liquidity on record, according to Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts, who argues that every additional percentage point of liquidity injected into the financial system “should” translate into a 20% gain for the cryptocurrency. 1% Liquidity = 20% Bitcoin? Writing on X, Coutts observed that his proprietary Global Liquidity Index broke to a fresh all-time high on 10 April after three years of drift and that, in the nine weeks since, Bitcoin has rallied about 40 percent. “Bitcoin has rallied 40% since April 10 which was when my global liquidity aggregate (GLI) after 3 years broke out to new all time highs on the back of a plummeting US dollar. Since then the aggregate is up 2%. Bitcoin’s Q2 rally is entirely consistent with liquidity regimes of this nature.” He added that “while Bitcoin’s sensitivity to GLI moderates over time, for every extra 1 percent of liquidity added to the system we should expect to see a > 20 percent move in the price of Bitcoin,” he said, further claiming that the steady inflow of capital “doesn’t account for the inevitable ‘oh shit’ moment of panic buying that is going to happen… eventually. It will be best of times, it will be the worst of times.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet—But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos The chart he shared, reproduced above, overlays his GLI (white) with daily Bitcoin prices (orange) from 2018 through June 2025. It shows the index pressing to roughly $138 trillion while Bitcoin changes hands near $108,000, underscoring the tight directional relationship between the two series across several liquidity cycles. Coutts builds the indicator by combining G4 central-bank balance sheets, broad money aggregates such as M2, and key US liquidity accounts including the Treasury General Account and the Federal Reserve’s reverse-repo facility. Since the April breakout the GLI has added only about two percentage points, yet Bitcoin’s market value has already risen by twice the elasticity implied by his model—an outcome he considers “entirely consistent” with prior liquidity regimes, which tend to produce the sharpest price response early in the cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: ‘Fair Price’ Today Is $230,000 For now, he sees little evidence that the GLI’s momentum is cresting; with the Federal Reserve still draining its reverse-repo facility, the People’s Bank of China quietly expanding its balance sheet, and the European Central Bank hinting at renewed long-term refinancing operations, the backdrop remains structurally bullish even if it won’t be a straight line. Looking further out, mainstream liquidity research suggests modest but persistent growth: most macro desks expect the global aggregate to rise roughly one to six percent over the next twelve months, three to eight percent cumulatively by mid-2027, and on the order of ten to fifteen percent by the turn of the decade as governments roll over record debt loads and central banks normalise balance-sheet policies. If Coutts’ rule of thumb holds, even the low end of those projections would leave ample headroom for triple-digit percentage gains in Bitcoin before 2030. At press time, BTC traded at $107,676.

The Galaxy Digital founder and CEO made the prediction on CNBC’s Power Lunch on Thursday. He cited institutional adoption and a growing preference for Bitcoin over gold as possible catalysts for this uptrend.This comes as Bitcoin corrects further from the weekly high of $110,300. The premier asset is down 5.5% from the Tuesday high to $104,269 at the time of writing but remains up 1.48% in the past seven days.Bitcoin Becoming an Institutionalized Macro Asset: NovogratzNovogratz suggested that Bitcoin is becoming an institutionalized macro asset and now sits alongside assets like gold, silver, and the S&P 500. He highlighted that one of the enablers for this newfound traction was partly fueled by the global loss of interest in the US dollar and diversification into assets like Bitcoin.Furthermore, he cited BlackRock’s involvement as a significant turning point for Bitcoin and a catalyst for the institutional interest. For context, $11.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock launched its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) fund in January 2024, following the US SEC’s approval, providing an easier means of exposure to Bitcoin.Novogratz stressed that this shift in attention to Bitcoin occurred as wealth managers and institutions began piling into the macro asset under BlackRock’s influence. Now, he noted that everyone is buying Bitcoin, viewing the pioneering cryptocurrency as a store of value. “Now we've got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin; there’s easier ways to get it,” Novogratz told CNBC.Interestingly, Strategy's playbook has become a new trend as public companies take a page from the business intelligence firm’s Bitcoin strategy. New entrants, including Metaplanet, the Blockchain Group, GameStop , and Trump Media, are raising millions to purchase Bitcoin, contributing to the asset’s scarcity and increasing its appeal.Bitcoin to Slowly Replace Gold, Hit $1MMeanwhile, Novogratz described Bitcoin’s adoption as a means of financial preservation as a “ball rolling down the hill,” predicting that this will ensure it matches toe-to-toe with gold in the near future. He stated that the new generation of investors would buy Bitcoin over gold, with the limitedly capped digital currency replacing the precious metal over time.The CEO also noted that Bitcoin has more room to grow relative to gold, predicting a 10-fold increase in its market cap to reach $1 million per coin. Notably, the price mark is becoming a commonplace outlook for Bitcoin enthusiasts as many grow increasingly confident that it is attainable. Michael Saylor , Binance’s Changpeng Zhao, and Brandon Green have all predicted that it would happen during this bull cycle.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/13/galaxy-digitals-novogratz-says-bitcoin-would-10x-to-1-million-to-rival-gold/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=galaxy-digitals-novogratz-says-bitcoin-would-10x-to-1-million-to-rival-gold,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|ZRX","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T05:30:00,"Trident Plans Major XRP Reserve While Ripple Nears Final Deal with SEC","Singapore-based Trident Digital Tech Holdings has announced plans to establish a $500 million XRP treasury reserve, reflecting growing institutional interest in the Ripple-associated digital asset. At the same time, Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission may soon conclude, as both parties seek court approval to finalize a $125 million settlement and dissolve a long-standing injunction. Trident Digital Tech Holdings to Launch $500 Million XRP Treasury Reserve Amid Growing Corporate Crypto Trend Trident Digital Tech Holdings, a Web3 technology firm headquartered in Singapore, announced on Thursday that it will establish an XRP treasury reserve of up to $500 million, marking one of the largest single corporate allocations to the Ripple-created cryptocurrency to date. The initiative sheds light on a deepening shift in how forward-looking companies are beginning to engage with decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based assets for treasury management and yield generation. In a statement released with the announcement, Trident’s founder and CEO Soon Huat Lim emphasized the company’s long-term strategic vision for blockchain integration. “This initiative reflects our belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology for capital allocation and cross-border value transfer,” said Lim. “Through this initiative, Trident aims to demonstrate how public companies can thoughtfully and responsibly participate in the ongoing development of decentralized finance.” Unlike traditional treasury approaches that often center around passive buy-and-hold strategies, Trident plans to actively engage with its XRP reserve. The company revealed it will deploy the assets through staking mechanisms and other yield-generating strategies. Additionally, Trident intends to form deeper ties within the Ripple ecosystem, signaling a long-term commitment that could include partnerships or collaborations with RippleNet participants or decentralized applications built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The XRP reserve will be rolled out in the second half of 2025, contingent on regulatory clarity and favorable market conditions. Notably, Trident will fund this ambitious plan through a combination of stock issuance, strategic placements, and other financing instruments. Market Reaction and Financial Backdrop Despite the bold move, the market did not initially react favorably. Trident’s shares plunged by 37.6% on Thursday following the announcement. Investor concerns appear to stem from the company's financial performance rather than its crypto strategy. According to its latest financial disclosures, Trident reported a net income loss of $3.1 million as of December 2024. The company’s revenue declined a staggering 91.4% year-over-year, while operational expenses rose by over 100%, underscoring the financial strain it faces heading into this new initiative. Trident share price on June 12 (Source: Google Finance ) While some analysts view the XRP reserve strategy as a bold pivot aimed at repositioning Trident within a fast-evolving digital economy, others have questioned whether the timing and scale of the reserve are appropriate given the company’s current financial standing. Trident is not alone in its move to incorporate XRP into its corporate treasury. The past several months have seen a surge in similar announcements, highlighting a new trend where XRP joins the ranks of Bitcoin and Solana as a strategic crypto asset held by public and private companies alike. Chinese AI firm Webus recently unveiled a $300 million XRP reserve, while renewable energy conglomerate VivoPower has plans to allocate $100 million. Health logistics company Wellgistics Health also announced a $50 million XRP treasury commitment. Together, these reserves signal a significant shift in institutional perception of XRP—from a utility token used primarily for payments to a strategic digital asset. XRP’s growing role in corporate finance parallels earlier trends seen with Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin’s popularity as a corporate treasury asset began with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) in August 2020, a move that was followed by firms like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific. In 2025, Solana has gained momentum in the same space, with firms like DeFi Development (formerly Janover) and SOL Strategies actively building SOL reserves in anticipation of broader DeFi and NFT adoption on the network. A New Era for Corporate Crypto Strategy? As corporate treasuries begin to resemble diversified crypto portfolios, the emergence of XRP as a reserve asset represents a new frontier. With its roots in real-world payments, and growing support within regulatory discussions, XRP offers a different value proposition compared to Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative or Solana’s high-performance DeFi positioning. Trident’s move may prove to be a defining case study in how Web3-native firms can integrate blockchain assets beyond speculative exposure. However, the steep share price drop and looming financial pressures mean that the company will need to execute flawlessly to win back investor confidence. Whether Trident’s gamble will yield long-term strategic returns or serve as a cautionary tale remains to be seen—but one thing is clear: the age of blockchain-based corporate finance is accelerating, and XRP is staking its claim alongside Bitcoin and Solana. Ripple and SEC Propose $125 Million Settlement Split to End Years-Long Legal Battle The nearly five-year-long legal standoff between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may finally be approaching resolution, as both parties submitted a joint motion on Thursday to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York outlining a proposed settlement. In the motion, Ripple and the SEC asked Judge Analisa Torres to approve a plan that would dissolve the existing injunction against Ripple and allocate the $125 million penalty imposed in the case—$50 million would go to the SEC, while the remaining $75 million would be returned to Ripple. “Doing so would promote efficiency and the policy favoring settlements, obviate the need for additional litigation in this Court and the Court of Appeals, and be consistent with the SEC’s recent actions in other crypto registration cases,” lawyers for both sides stated in the joint court filing. Ripple’s Long Legal Road Nears Its End The case began in December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple, alleging the blockchain company had unlawfully raised $1.3 billion through the sale of its native cryptocurrency XRP, which the agency argued qualified as an unregistered security. The lawsuit instantly became one of the most high-profile crypto enforcement actions in SEC history, setting the tone for regulatory battles throughout the industry. In a landmark ruling in July 2023, Judge Torres handed down a split decision. She ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP , executed through blind bid processes on exchanges, did not constitute securities offerings. However, she found that Ripple’s direct institutional sales did fall under the purview of securities law, making the company liable for a $125 million penalty related to those transactions. Since the court’s decision, the legal process has shifted focus from liability to remedy. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse declared in March 2025 that the company’s legal fight with the SEC was “effectively over,” after the agency dropped its planned appeal. However, procedural hurdles have continued to delay final closure. Just last month, Judge Torres rejected a request from the parties for an indicative ruling under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs relief from a final judgment. She noted that Ripple and the SEC had failed to meet the “heavy burden” required to vacate an injunction and emphasized that such actions should only be granted under “exceptional circumstances.” Thursday’s filing attempts to clear that bar, citing significant developments in the regulatory landscape since the case began. Chief among them is the SEC’s recent policy shift under the Trump administration, which took office in January. Since then, the SEC has disbanded several ongoing investigations into crypto firms, dropped high-profile enforcement actions, and launched a new crypto-focused task force aimed at crafting a more pragmatic regulatory framework. Implications for the Broader Crypto Landscape If the court approves the proposed $50 million/$75 million split and lifts the injunction against Ripple, it would not only bring a long and expensive legal saga to a close but also signal a dramatic de-escalation of tensions between US regulators and major crypto firms. Since the exit of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler earlier this year, the agency’s crypto posture has notably softened. Several cases against leading firms—including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken—have either been scaled back or settled, and roundtable discussions are now guiding future regulatory frameworks instead of courtroom battles. Ripple’s case has long been viewed as a litmus test for how securities law applies to digital assets, and any settlement would likely be referenced in future enforcement and compliance strategies across the crypto industry. While XRP’s legal status remains partially resolved, the proposed compromise may allow Ripple to resume full-scale operations without further legal uncertainty—and reclaim significant funds to reinvest in its ecosystem and international expansion. Judge Torres will now review the joint motion and determine whether the proposed settlement meets the legal standards necessary to amend the final judgment. If granted, it could mark the end of one of the most closely watched legal battles in cryptocurrency history. Until then, both Ripple and the SEC appear aligned in wanting to put the past behind them and look forward to a regulatory environment that is clearer, more collaborative, and better suited to the evolving dynamics of the digital asset space.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9555/trident-plans-major-xrp-reserve-while-ripple-nears-final-deal-with-sec,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|SOL|XRP","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

This event is very similar to last week’s options expiry, so the impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal. They have already tanked by more than 7% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.95, meaning that the longs and short sellers are pretty evenly matched. There is also a max pain point of $107,000, around $3,000 above current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at strike prices between $110,000 and $140,000, with more than $1.5 billion at each price, as bullish speculators remain confident, according to Deribit.

Bitcoin dropped 2.3%, Ethereum shed 4.5%, XRP lost 3.24%, and Solana slid 4.9% against the U.S. dollar. But it was Dogecoin that took the steepest plunge among the top ten, tumbling 5.9% in a single day. Over $320 million in bullish bets were wiped out within a single hour, signaling a harsh wake-up call for overly optimistic traders. BTC & ETH in Red, Altcoins Hit Harder? Bitcoin bore the brunt of the crash, with nearly $317 million in long positions liquidated in a day. The majority, over $306 million, were long bets. Prices slid nearly 4% in 24 hours, pulling BTC below $104K. While it’s still holding a 5% gain for the week, the momentum shifted after it peaked above $110,000 on Tuesday. One massive $201 million long on Binance alone got rekt in the plunge, according to CoinGlass data . Meanwhile, ETH fell over 6% on the day, crashing down to $2,650. Despite this drop, it’s still up about 9% on the week, thanks to an earlier surge. Daily liquidations for ETH totaled $151 million, second only to Bitcoin. While altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin were hit next, as bearish pressure swept across the altcoin market. Solana tumbled over 6% to $152.80, XRP dropped 4% to $2.20, and Dogecoin was the day’s worst performer, down 7% to $0.181.

How did geopolitical events contribute to the crypto market dip?

2025-06-13T05:18:32,"BlackRock to Eventually File for an XRP ETF: ETF Store President","Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, says he firmly believes BlackRock will eventually file for a spot XRP ETF. In his most recent comments , Geraci pointed out that BlackRock has led the way in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and would have no reason to let other companies take the lead when it comes to XRP or Solana, the next two largest crypto assets.He also expects BlackRock to roll out an index-style crypto ETF. Recall that the industry commentator also recently suggested that the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which contains XRP, could be the next ETF up for approval.Geraci Convinced BlackRock Will Enter the XRP ETF MarketGeraci's latest comments follow a series of earlier predictions. Back in March 2025, he stated that a filing could come as soon as Ripple's legal battle with the SEC concluded. At the time, he argued that major institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity wouldn't want to give others the chance to dominate the growing altcoin ETF space. Meanwhile, last month, he also highlighted a milestone that could support the case for a spot XRP ETF: the launch of regulated XRP futures on the CME. Geraci viewed this as a major step toward making an XRP ETF more likely, as futures contracts often pave the way for spot ETF filings. https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1924468915259732402BlackRock Remains QuietStill, despite the growing chatter, BlackRock hasn't made any official move yet. Its focus remains on its existing crypto products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which have both performed strongly.Recall that BlackRock's head of ETF strategy, Samara Cohen, said in mid-2024 that only Bitcoin and Ethereum met the firm's standards due to their higher liquidity and maturity. It's unclear if that view has changed.Given XRP's newer legal clarity and its less-developed futures market, BlackRock may hold off until the regulatory and market signals are more established. For one, Ripple and the SEC are still waiting for the court's approval of their settlement.Developments Around XRP ETF FilingsMeanwhile, the XRP ETF scene has continued to see major developments. Bitwise, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton have all filed applications for spot XRP ETFs. However, the SEC has not made any major decision. The SEC pushed its decision on 21Shares' spot XRP ETF to October 2025, following the usual 240-day review timeline. Grayscale also hit a major deadline on May 22, but the SEC didn't issue a decision. Just days later, on May 28, the SEC began its formal review of the WisdomTree XRP Trust, the first U.S.-based spot XRP ETF to reach this stage, while asking the public to weigh in on potential risks like market manipulation and investor protection.Interestingly, outside the U.S., XRP-based exchange-traded products are already gaining traction. In Europe, 21Shares already has an XRP ETP, the AXRP ETP, which is trading in Switzerland. Meanwhile, Brazil has approved the first-ever spot XRP ETF globally.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/13/blackrock-to-eventually-file-for-an-xrp-etf-etf-store-president/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackrock-to-eventually-file-for-an-xrp-etf-etf-store-president,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","Market|Latest BlackRock News Updates Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|Latest XRP ETF News Market Insights",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T05:15:07,"Coinbase Releases Its Latest Report on the Future of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies","According to a new report published by Coinbase Research, a more optimistic macroeconomic environment, increasing interest in digital assets at the institutional level, and clearer regulations present a positive outlook for cryptocurrency markets in the second half of 2025. The first quarter of the year was marked by volatility in the markets due to a short-term contraction in U.S. GDP and trade disruptions. However, recent data suggests a recovery. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracking data rose to 3.8% quarter-on-quarter as of early June, a significant increase from expectations at the beginning of the year. This development, combined with the expectation that the Fed will cut interest rates and adopt a more lenient trade policy, has eased recession concerns and boosted investor confidence. According to the Coinbase report, the weakening of the dollar’s global dominance and the rise of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation could also increase interest in crypto. However, high long-term US bond yields could limit this interest. The performance of altcoins will largely depend on specific catalysts such as ETF approvals or protocol-based developments. Another development that stands out in the report is the increasing tendency of public companies to include crypto assets in their balance sheets. The regulation that will come into force in 2024 and that will allow the transition to the “fair value” accounting method for digital assets supports this trend. However, this trend also brings new systemic risks. In particular, companies that finance crypto purchases with convertible debt may be forced to sell if refinancing opportunities narrow or market prices decline sharply. Related News: List of the 20 Altcoins That Crypto Developers Have Focused On the Most in the Last Year Has Been Revealed - There's a Big Surprise at the Top Significant steps are also being taken on the regulatory front. The Senate recently sent the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that passed with bipartisan support, to the House of Representatives. In addition, a more comprehensive market structure bill called the CLARITY Act is also on the agenda. The bill aims to clarify the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over digital assets. If passed, it would significantly reduce uncertainty for both issuers and investors. Meanwhile, the SEC is evaluating more than 80 crypto ETF applications, including multi-asset funds, staking and altcoin-based products. The first decisions are expected in July, with the rest expected by October. Overall, Bitcoin could perform strongly in the second half of the year, with macroeconomic and structural headwinds behind it, according to the Coinbase report. For altcoins, success will depend on navigating a more complex environment, including regulatory uncertainty and liquidity conditions. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T05:13:07,"Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Altcoins Dropped Hard! What's the Reason for the Drop? Here's All You Need to Know!","Just when Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins were recovering and starting to rise again, new declines occurred today. At this point, cryptocurrency markets triggered a flight from risky assets after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran and intensified regional conflicts, leading to sharp declines in Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and altcoins. The cryptocurrency market took off after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran, The Block reported. An unnamed Israeli military official confirmed to local reporters that the strikes targeted Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure. Historically, risky assets like cryptocurrencies tend to decline following tensions in the Middle East. According to the data, Bitcoin fell more than 4% in the last 24 hours, falling below the $104,000 level. BTC then recovered and rose to $104,400 levels. This decline also had a negative impact on altcoins other than Bitcoin. The largest altcoin, Ethereum, fell by 10% to $2,500. Popular altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Avalanche (AVAX) also followed BTC and ETH with declines between 6% and 15%. The biggest reason behind the decline in Bitcoin and altcoins, apart from geopolitical tensions, was the fact that the possibility of a FED rate cut has almost disappeared. The fact that the core CPI is still above expectations and the latest inflation data showing that producer prices are rising has almost eliminated the possibility of a rate cut in June. After this week’s data, the probability that the FED will leave interest rates unchanged in June has been priced in at 97.3%. This situation has also shown itself in a decline in cryptocurrency prices. According to Coinglass data, $1.14 billion worth of leveraged trades were liquidated in the last 24 hours. $1.04 billion of these were in long trades and $101 million in short trades. While 246,993 investors liquidated in the last 24 hours, the largest liquidation occurred in the BTC/USDT trading pair on Binance. *This is not investment advice.

The crypto crash followed news reports that Israel had launched a missile attack on Iranian nuclear sites in a pre-emptive strike. Israel has declared a state of emergency, saying the country expected counter-attacks “in the immediate future,” reported the BBC. Meanwhile, Iranian media claims that residential areas in Tehran were hit and civilians were among those killed. BREAKING: Iran says it will respond “harshly” against Israel and the US following tonight’s attacks. — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 13, 2025 Crypto Assets Crash Liquidation data from Coinglass shows that there has been $1 billion in liquidations over the past 12 hours, and almost 250,000 traders were liquidated over the past 24 hours. More than 90% of those positions were long, and the majority of them were in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin led the losses , tanking hard and fast in a $5,000 dump from an intraday high of $108,350 to bottom out at $103,000 during Asian trading on Friday morning. The asset found support there and had reclaimed $104,000 at the time of writing, remaining within its six-week range-bound channel. Ethereum prices crashed more than 9%, tumbling from $2,760 to bottom out at $2,470 in a matter of hours. The asset had crept back over $2,500, where solid support lies at the time of writing. Altcoins suffered even more pain with Solana getting smashed 12% in a fall back to $140, Dogecoin dumping 10% in a dip to $0.17, and Cardano crashing 9.5% in a slide to $0.62. Other altcoins deep in the red include Sui, Chainlink, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, and Hedera. Nevertheless, losses were not so bad for BNB and Tron, which dipped a couple of percentage points. Total crypto market cap is down 7.9% to $3.34T amid Middle East tensions. Meme and Layer 2 categories saw the steepest declines, each falling over 12%. View breakdown here: https://t.co/YqL9362eES pic.twitter.com/58V3Ob712L — CoinGecko (@coingecko) June 13, 2025 Bullish Background Remains Despite the geopolitical-driven drop, a bullish background prevails, so a rebound could be likely as Bitcoin and its brethren are often seen as safe havens during periods of turmoil. “As geopolitical conflicts rise, investors often flee to fiat-based sovereign debt for ‘safety’. This, of course, is ultimately a mistake, as inevitable money printing and monetary debasement soon follow. Smart investors will flee to assets that cannot be debased. The smartest will buy Bitcoin,” said former hedge fund manager James Lavish. The pro-crypto narrative from the United States continues to strengthen with the Securities and Exchange Commission withdrawing a tranche of Gary Gensler-era rules on June 12. Additionally, the US and China struck a trade deal this week as tariff tensions eased. However, benchmark Brent crude oil prices spiked by more than 8% and gold prices ticked up to $3,440 per ounce on the specter of all-out war.

2025-06-13T05:00:37,"Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge","According to recent technical analysis, Ethereum (ETH) may be gearing up for a major breakout that could propel the cryptocurrency close to the $4,200 mark. Meanwhile, ETH continues to attract growing institutional interest, with Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) outperforming their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts. Ethereum Headed For A Breakout? In a recent X post, noted crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted that ETH is climbing within a massive weekly broadening wedge structure. The analyst shared the following chart and suggested that ETH could be targeting the $4,200 level – marking the top of the wedge. For the uninitiated, a broadening wedge is a chart pattern characterized by diverging trendlines, where price makes higher highs and lower lows, forming a megaphone-like shape. It typically indicates increasing market volatility and can signal a potential breakout, with the direction depending on the prevailing trend and breakout confirmation. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto echoed a similar outlook, stating that ETH is “setting up for a big move,” especially with over $2.2 billion in short positions clustered near the $3,000 level. If Ethereum breaks above $3,000, it could trigger a short squeeze, potentially accelerating ETH’s rally. At the time of writing, ETH is trading 43.7% below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Capital flows also indicate rising institutional interest in Ethereum. Crypto market commentator Ted Pillows recently pointed out that spot ETH ETFs attracted $240.3 million in inflows yesterday, compared to $164.6 million for spot BTC ETFs. The stronger performance of ETH ETFs suggests that capital may be rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum. It’s worth noting that while BTC is up 54% since June 2024, ETH is still down 24.6% during the same period. Crypto trader Merlijn the Trader shared the following monthly BTC/ETH chart showing two consecutive red candles, signaling a potential shift in momentum as BTC weakens relative to ETH. The trader noted that a similar capital rotation in 2020 preceded a “monster altseason.” Things Look Positive For ETH While altcoins like Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and SUI created fresh ATHs in 2024, ETH’s performance did not live up to expectations. As a result, the broader sentiment in the Etheruem ecosystem took a hit. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Insanely Undervalued’ As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking – Is A Rally Imminent? However, 2025 appears to be ushering in a more favorable outlook. On-chain data reveals that ETH faces no major resistance until the $3,417 level. Additionally, ETH recently flashed a golden cross on the daily chart – a bullish technical signal that could indicate an impending rally. At press time, ETH trades at $2,756, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-13T05:00:17,"Bitcoin Whales Steadily Pulling Funds From Binance – What’s Fueling The Action?","Even as bearish pressure builds, Bitcoin’s price continues to hold above the $109,000 mark after its recent rebound that pushed its price beyond $110,000. BTC’s rebound has triggered a wave of renewed conviction, as evidenced by massive outflows by whales on the Binance crypto platform. Large BTC Holders On Binance Draining Holdings As Bitcoin surges toward its current all-time high, key investors on the largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, are exhibiting a positive sentiment toward the flagship asset. Darkfost, an on-chain expert and verified author, reported that Bitcoin whales are steadily but silently withdrawing their holdings from the leading crypto exchange . In the Quick-take post shared by the leading on-chain data analytics platform CryptoQuant, the expert stated that this behavior of BTC whales on Binance is “quite surprising at the moment.” This might be due to the fact that the trend is gaining momentum in light of a maturing market landscape. Particularly, the consistent withdrawals by key players coincide with Bitcoin’s recent display of tenacity by remaining above the $100,000 threshold. The notable resiliency of the asset is likely the main factor fueling this steady outflow of large-scale BTC on the Binance platform, which challenges the notion of a sell-off during strong price spikes. Historically, BTC whales on Binance seize the chance to sell coins and make profits when the flagship asset moves close to or exceeds its all-time high. Such an action is indicative of a notable increase in capital or inflows into the crypto exchange. After examining and contrasting the monthly inflow volumes on Binance, Darkfost revealed large inflows into the platform as BTC reached a top in early 2024. During the period, large-scale BTC inflows rose to a value of $5.3 billion. In addition, a significant amount of $8.45 billion and $7.24 billion BTC inflows were recorded at the height of the preceding cycle, which were succeeded by short-term to medium-term corrections. Meanwhile, in recent market trends, Bitcoin’s rally toward a new all-time high is being met by strong conviction above further growth. Data shows that BTC inflows into Binance are currently down to about $3 billion, suggesting that whales would rather stay on their investments and are anticipating even bigger profit chances in the future. Overall, Darkfost has warned that the current position of Binance whales should not be disregarded. This is because it clearly signals a bullish sentiment on their end, considering the significant market impact that these whale inflows can produce. A Huge Drop In BTC Exchange Reserves Interestingly, these withdrawals are spotted among all cryptocurrency exchanges in the sector. Market expert Kyle Doops highlighted that over 550,000 BTC, valued at approximately $59.67 billion at current price levels, have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges’ reserves over the past year. According to Kyle Doops, the substantial outflows are a sign of panic, but of conviction. With BTC constantly leaving exchanges, supply becomes limited , and demand rises, which could pave the way for continued price increases.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whales-pulling-funds/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Darkfost|Exchange Reserve",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T04:28:56,"Why is The Crypto Market Going Down Today?","The post Why is The Crypto Market Going Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is in the red today, with the global market cap slipping by 4.32% to $3.25 trillion. Most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, are seeing sharp losses. Bitcoin is trading below $104,000 at the time of writing. There is support near $101,000 to $102,000. Ethereum (ETH) has dropped over 9% in the past 24 hours, falling to around $2,501. XRP has also taken a hit, slipping by more than 5% to trade at $2.11. Popular altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) aren’t spared either — SOL is down over 10% while DOGE has fallen by nearly 9%. Even large-cap tokens like BNB and Cardano (ADA) have lost ground, dropping 2.89% and 8.6% respectively. Geopolitical Tensions Shake Markets The biggest reason for today’s crypto sell-off is a sudden escalation in Middle East tensions. Israel reportedly launched an airstrike on Iran’s nuclear facilities on June 13 and this geopolitical shock spooked global investors, sending them rushing toward safer assets like gold, which jumped 5%. Historically, whenever there’s unrest in the Middle East, risky assets like cryptocurrencies tend to fall. Bitcoin alone dropped by nearly 4% intraday, a move similar to what happened during the U.S.-Iran conflict in 2020. Macro and Regulatory Pressure U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs could push U.S. inflation up to 3%. This could lead the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer — bad news for risk assets like crypto. Coinbase’s recent launch of CFTC-compliant perpetual futures contracts has pulled short-term liquidity away from spot markets, adding to the downward pressure. The next big event for the markets is the upcoming interest rate decision, due in a few days. Right now, there’s a 99% chance rates will stay the same. The market’s hoping Fed Chair Jerome Powell will sound more confident about future economic stability, hinting at rate cuts later. If not, and if the Fed sticks to its “wait and see” stance, markets might stay weak for now.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-going-down-today/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL","News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Bitcoin, which was recently aiming for a breakout above $109,000, has dropped back to around $104,000. That’s a 3.6% decline in just 24 hours. And it’s not just Bitcoin—Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and even meme coins like Dogecoin have followed, falling anywhere between 6% to 15%. So, what’s behind this sudden crash? Fed Rate Cut Hopes Crushed The biggest reason seems to be new signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve. After the latest inflation data came out, showing core CPI still above expectations and producer prices rising, the chances of a rate cut in June have nearly vanished. According to Fed CME tools, the market now has a 97.4% chance that the Fed will not lower interest rates this month. That’s made investors nervous, and it’s showing in crypto prices. Bitcoin ETFs See Big Outflows Another major blow came from the spot Bitcoin ETFs. After several days of strong inflows, June 12 saw a sudden reversal, with $202 million flowing out. Leading the charge was Fidelity’s ETF alone saw a $197 million withdrawal, while ARK Invest’s ETF lost over $10 million. Surprisingly, BlackRock stayed flat with zero inflows or outflows. $1.15 Billion in Crypto Liquidations Leverage traders took a big hit. In the last 24 hours, over 247,000 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations hitting $1.15 billion . The largest single liquidation order was a $201 million long on Binance. If Bitcoin drops further to around $95,800, nearly $11.76 billion worth of long positions are at risk. That could trigger another wave of sell-offs. Technical Charts Hint More Pain Meanwhile, technically, indicators hint at more struggle for Bitcoin as charts show rejection near the $106K resistance zone. Meanwhile, the MACD is showing a slight bullish crossover, but the momentum is weakening. If Bitcoin fails to hold $104K , we could see a retest of $102K or even $100K soon. Altcoin Market Suffers Too Altcoins are taking a big hit, closely following Bitcoin’s downward trend. The Altseason Index has dropped to 16, showing that Bitcoin still holds market dominance. Among the biggest losers, Ethereum (ETH) fell by over 9.29% , now trading near $2,508. While XRP, Solana, and Cardano all saw major declines, with no signs of recovery just yet.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-are-bitcoin-and-altcoins-down-today-heres-why/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T04:10:56,"Why is crypto down today? Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana sink as Israel strikes Iran","The cryptocurrency market plunged on Friday, June 13, as rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East rattled investors. Following news that Israel had launched a major military operation against Iran, digital assets tumbled sharply. The total crypto market capitalization dropped 7% over the past 24 hours to $3.3 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) declined around 5%, trading at $103,464 as of press time. Ethereum ( ETH ) fell 10% to $2,471, while Solana ( SOL ) dropped 11% to $141. XRP ( XRP ) and BNB ( BNB ) also lost ground, down 6% and 4% respectively. Data from CoinGlass shows that crypto liquidations surged 125% in a single day, reaching $1.2 billion. Open interest across crypto futures markets fell 9.7% to $142 billion, while the relative strength index sank to 28, indicating the market had entered oversold territory. Despite the selloff, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, compiled by software firm Alternative, remained in the “Greed” zone at 61, though down 10 points from the previous day. The drop in sentiment reflects investor uncertainty, as traders assess the risk of broader conflict. You might also like: Five altcoins to watch on Thursday and Friday: Memecoins and DeFi lead this week’s rally The market turmoil followed an early morning attack by Israel on Iran. According to a Reuters report , Israeli forces hit multiple high-value targets, including uranium enrichment facilities in Natanz, ballistic missile production sites, and the headquarters of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps in Tehran. Iranian state media reported the death of General Hossein Salami and civilian casualties, including children. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes marked the beginning of “Operation Rising Lion,” a campaign aimed at neutralizing Iran’s nuclear threat. Israel has declared a state of emergency, closed its main airport, and raised air defenses in anticipation of retaliatory attacks. Iran has promised a “harsh response.” U.S. secretary of state Marco Rubio confirmed the United States was not involved in the strike, emphasizing that American priorities lie in protecting its forces in the region. Apart from cryptocurrencies, traditional financial markets bore the brunt as well. U.S. stock futures dropped 1.5% across major indexes, and European markets opened lower by a similar margin. Meanwhile, safe-haven assets surged slightly. Gold rose 0.75% to $3,428 per ounce, and the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.32%. Crude oil, often seen as a geopolitical risk proxy, surged about 10% to $74 per barrel, according to data from Market Watch. With tensions climbing and the potential for regional war rising, both crypto and global markets could see continued volatility. Risk appetite may weaken further, pushing capital into safer, more liquid assets until the situation stabilizes.

The company has filed a Tesla lawsuit against a former engineer, alleging the theft of critical trade secrets related to its highly anticipated humanoid robotics program, Optimus . What are the Allegations Behind the Tesla Lawsuit? The lawsuit, which came to light recently, centers on accusations against Zhongjie “Jay” Li, a former engineer who worked on the Optimus project. According to the complaint, Li is alleged to have stolen confidential information concerning Tesla’s development of “advanced robotic hand sensors.” The company claims this proprietary information was then used to establish a competing enterprise. Key allegations detailed in the complaint include: Li downloaded confidential data related to Optimus onto two personal smartphones. During his final months at Tesla, Li allegedly researched “humanoid robotic hands” on his work computer. He also reportedly conducted internet searches regarding venture capital and startup funding sources while still employed at Tesla. The timeline presented in the lawsuit is striking: Li worked at Tesla from August 2022 to September 2024. The complaint states that Proception, the rival company, was incorporated less than a week after his departure from Tesla. Within just five months, Proception publicly claimed to have successfully built advanced humanoid robotic hands, which Tesla alleges bear a “striking resemblance” to the designs Li worked on while at the company. How Does This Relate to Trade Secret Theft and Robotics Startups? The core of the Tesla lawsuit is the accusation of trade secret theft . Trade secrets are confidential information that provides a business with a competitive edge. In the rapidly evolving field of robotics, particularly for complex systems like humanoid hands, the design and development details of sensors and mechanics can be highly valuable intellectual property. The lawsuit highlights the risks companies face when employees move to competing ventures, especially in cutting-edge sectors. Proception, described as a robotics startup backed by Y Combinator, aims to “revolutionize human-robot interaction by building the world’s most advanced humanoid hands.” Tesla’s legal action suggests a belief that Proception’s rapid progress was facilitated by the alleged misuse of Tesla’s confidential information. Challenges for Optimus and the Humanoid Robots Market The timing of this lawsuit adds another layer to the narrative surrounding Tesla’s Optimus program. The development of humanoid robots has proven to be a complex undertaking. Since unveiling the concept in 2021, Tesla has faced delays, with the initial target of introducing the bot in 2023 pushed back. Elon Musk most recently indicated sales might begin in 2026. Public demonstrations, like the “We, Robot” event in October 2024, have sometimes shown bots primarily controlled remotely, underscoring the ongoing development challenges. This legal dispute underscores the intense competition and high stakes involved in the race to develop viable humanoid robots . The potential for trade secret theft is a significant concern for companies investing heavily in R&D in this space. As more robotics startup companies emerge, leveraging advancements in AI and hardware, protecting intellectual property becomes paramount. Bitcoin World has reached out to both Proception and Tesla for comment on the lawsuit. Summary: Tesla has filed a significant lawsuit against a former engineer, alleging he stole trade secrets related to the Optimus humanoid robot’s hand sensors and used them to launch a rival robotics startup, Proception. The case highlights the challenges of protecting intellectual property in the competitive field of advanced robotics and adds another dimension to the ongoing development story of Tesla’s Optimus program.
