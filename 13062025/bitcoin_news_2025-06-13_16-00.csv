2025-06-13T13:50:32,"Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows Surge: $113M Boost Continues","BitcoinWorld Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows Surge: $113M Boost Continues The world of crypto is buzzing with exciting news! U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF products are showing remarkable strength, recording their 19th consecutive day of net inflows on June 12, totaling an impressive $113.32 million. This consistent positive flow into these regulated investment products signals growing investor confidence and increasing participation in the Ethereum ecosystem. What Are Spot Ethereum ETFs and Why Do Inflows Matter? Before diving into the numbers, let’s quickly touch on what a Spot Ethereum ETF is. Simply put, it’s an investment fund traded on traditional stock exchanges that holds actual Ether (ETH) as its underlying asset. This allows investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without the complexities of buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency directly. For many, especially large institutions, this regulated wrapper is the preferred way to access the crypto market. So, why are inflows significant? Net inflows mean more money is coming into these ETFs than is leaving. This indicates demand from investors who are buying shares of the fund. Consistent inflows, like the streak we’re seeing, suggest sustained buying pressure and a potentially bullish sentiment towards the underlying asset – in this case, Ethereum. Breaking Down the Latest Ethereum ETF Inflows On June 12, the combined net inflows for U.S. Ethereum ETF inflows reached $113.32 million. This isn’t just a one-off event; it’s part of a trend that has now seen positive net flows for 19 consecutive trading days. This sustained demand is a powerful signal coming from the traditional finance world into the crypto space. Looking at the specifics for the day: Total Net Inflows (June 12): $113.32 million Consecutive Inflow Days: 19 Key Contributors on June 12: BlackRock’s ETHA: $102.49 million Fidelity’s FETH: $10.83 million Other ETFs: No reported change in holdings for the day. As the numbers show, BlackRock and Fidelity are currently leading the charge, capturing the vast majority of the daily inflows. This highlights the significant role that major asset managers play in attracting capital to these new investment products. What Does Growing Institutional Ethereum Interest Mean? The substantial contributions from financial powerhouses like BlackRock and Fidelity underscore the growing trend of Institutional Ethereum adoption. These firms represent massive pools of capital, and their decision to invest heavily in ETH ETFs provides a significant validation for Ethereum as an asset class. For many large investors, including pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers, participating through regulated ETFs offered by trusted names is crucial. Increased institutional participation can have several positive effects on the Ethereum ecosystem: Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into the market can improve trading volumes and make it easier to buy and sell ETH. Enhanced Legitimacy: Institutional adoption signals that Ethereum is being taken seriously by traditional finance, which can attract even more investors. Potential for Price Stability: While crypto remains volatile, a broader base of large, long-term investors could potentially contribute to greater market stability over time. Analyzing the Performance of Various ETH ETF Products With the approval of several U.S. ETH ETF s, investors now have choices. However, the current inflow data clearly shows that capital is concentrating in the funds offered by the largest and most reputable asset managers, like BlackRock and Fidelity. The fact that other approved ETFs saw no change in holdings on June 12 suggests that, at least initially, investors are flocking to the most established names in the traditional finance world to gain their ETH exposure. This early concentration could lead to a competitive landscape where only a few ETFs capture the lion’s share of the market. Asset managers will likely compete on factors like fees, liquidity, and brand recognition to attract investors. The Broader Impact of Crypto ETFs on the Market The successful launch and sustained inflows into both Bitcoin and now Crypto ETFs represent a significant evolution for the digital asset market. They act as bridges, connecting the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency with the established infrastructure of traditional finance. These products offer accessibility and regulatory clarity that was previously unavailable to many investors. However, it’s important to remember that investing in crypto ETFs still carries risks. The value of the ETF is directly tied to the volatile price of the underlying cryptocurrency. Regulatory landscapes can change, and market sentiment can shift rapidly. While ETFs provide a convenient wrapper, the fundamental risks of investing in a volatile asset class like Ethereum remain. What to Watch For Next The 19-day streak of inflows is a strong positive signal. Moving forward, key indicators to watch include: Continued Inflow Streak: Will the positive trend continue? A prolonged streak would further solidify confidence. Volume and Value of Inflows: Are the daily inflow amounts increasing, decreasing, or staying consistent? Participation Across ETFs: Will other ETH ETFs start seeing significant inflows? Impact on ETH Price: While inflows don’t directly cause price increases dollar-for-dollar, sustained buying pressure through ETFs can be a bullish factor. Regulatory Developments: Any new guidance or rules from regulators could impact the ETF market. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal from Spot Ethereum ETFs The recent surge in Ethereum ETF inflows , culminating in over $113 million on June 12 and marking 19 consecutive days of positive flow, is a clear and powerful signal. It demonstrates robust demand for regulated Ethereum exposure, particularly from large institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity. This trend not only highlights growing confidence in the Ethereum network but also signifies the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance through the accessible and familiar structure of Spot Ethereum ETF s. While the crypto market remains dynamic, these consistent inflows are undoubtedly a positive development for the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader world of Crypto ETFs and Institutional Ethereum adoption.

2025-06-13T13:48:37,"The threat of selling by corporate BTC holders is a ‘systemic risk’ to markets: Coinbase","Public companies using leveraged positions to acquire Bitcoin could put the markets at a systemic risk, according to the Coinbase monthly outlook for June. The crypto exchange stated that there’s a possibility of both forced and discretionary selling pressure in the crypto market, even as overall sentiment appears positive for the second half of 2025. Coinbase’s research team has identified roughly 228 publicly traded companies that now hold over 820,000 BTC collectively. Only 20 financial firms have a subset actively mimicking the high-risk, debt-financed accumulation model used by firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). These companies issue debt, often in the form of convertible notes, to raise capital used almost exclusively for crypto accumulation. Institutional leveraged crypto holdings could lead to sell-offs According to Coinbase, these firms have little to no operating revenue outside of their digital asset holdings and are trading at a premium relative to their underlying net assets. Accounting standards introduced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in December 2023 allow companies to report digital assets at fair market value. It removed prior constraints that required marking down losses without recognizing unrealized gains. The accounting change, effective from December 2024, helped companies create Bitcoin-focused treasury strategies and what Coinbase terms “publicly traded crypto vehicles” (PTCVs). Coinbase mentioned two risks with PTCVs, the first being forced selling, where companies may have no choice but to offload holdings to service debt if refinancing is unattainable. Much of this debt, issued during periods of low interest rates, will come due between 2029 and 2030, but some notes have early redemption features as soon as 2026. Chart data in the report shows that firms like Strategy, Riot, and Semler Scientific have billions in outstanding convertible notes. Debt of corporations and maturity dates. Source: Coinbase monthly report Long-term maturity may reduce the immediate risk, but Coinbase warns that if market conditions deteriorate or interest rates spike, they may be forced to sell assets as they would likely fail to refinance debts. The second risk is motivated discretionary selling, where firms might choose to sell portions of their crypto to fund operations or cash flow needs. Even without financial distress, given their large accumulation numbers, such liquidations could trigger negative market sentiment. If prices fall, other entities may rush to exit. “Even a relatively small unexpected sale by one of these entities could destabilize investor confidence and lead to a broader liquidation event,” Coinbase wrote. Relief from economic stability Coinbase reiterated that the US economy has shown stronger-than-expected growth, with recession fears largely receding. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow estimate rose from 1.0% in early May to 3.8% by June 5. Coinbase believes the change supports asset prices and reduces the likelihood of an economic downturn. That said, the US Treasury yield curve, especially with 30-year bond yields, clocked 5.15% on May 21, a two-decade high. Rising long-term rates could tighten financial conditions, increase borrowing costs, and stifle the growth of debt-heavy PTCVs. According to a chart within the report, there is a correlation between macroeconomic stress and crypto market volatility. If long-dated yields rise too quickly, equity and credit markets could experience a slump, indirectly affecting leveraged crypto firms. Number of standard deviations based on 180d average of period prior to recession. Source: Coinbase monthly report Still, Coinbase insisted that the outlook for Bitcoin is mostly positive, owing to the decline of the US dollar’s dominance and a boost in global liquidity. On the flipside, altcoins may struggle to match Bitcoin because they have weaker institutional demand and higher volatility.

2025-06-13T13:40:29,"Shocking Oil Prices Surge Over 10%: Urgent Crypto Market Impact Revealed","BitcoinWorld Shocking Oil Prices Surge Over 10%: Urgent Crypto Market Impact Revealed Geopolitical tensions have once again sent shockwaves through global markets, with a dramatic surge in Oil prices taking center stage. For anyone tracking financial assets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, understanding these shifts is paramount. This significant jump in energy costs isn’t just about the price at the pump; it has far-reaching implications that could directly influence the performance and perception of digital assets. Why Did Oil Prices Skyrocket? Understanding the Trigger The immediate catalyst for the sharp increase in Brent WTI futures was a specific geopolitical event. Reports of an Israeli airstrike in Iran triggered immediate concerns about potential supply disruptions in a critical oil-producing region. The Middle East remains a linchpin in global energy supply chains, and any instability there directly threatens the flow of oil, impacting prices globally. Here’s a breakdown of the factors at play: Geopolitical Event: The specific incident involving Israel and Iran heightened fears of escalating conflict in a region vital for oil production and transit. Supply Concerns: Markets reacted swiftly to the possibility that conflict could disrupt oil production facilities or crucial shipping lanes like the Strait of Hormuz. Risk Premium: Traders immediately priced in a higher ‘risk premium’ due to the increased uncertainty and potential for future supply shocks. Market Psychology: Fear and speculation often amplify price movements in volatile situations, leading to rapid buying. This event occurred within an already tense global environment, adding fuel to existing anxieties about energy security and supply-demand balances. The Scale of the Surge: Brent and WTI Futures React The reaction in the oil futures market was immediate and substantial. Both major benchmarks saw significant gains: Brent Crude Futures: The international benchmark surged by more than 10%. WTI Crude Futures: The U.S. benchmark also experienced a jump exceeding 10%. A 10%+ move in a major commodity like oil within a short period is highly unusual and underscores the severity of the market’s reaction to the perceived increase in Geopolitical risk . This level of volatility hasn’t been seen frequently outside of major global crises. Historically, oil prices have shown a strong correlation with geopolitical instability in the Middle East. Past conflicts and tensions in the region have often led to sharp, albeit sometimes temporary, price spikes as markets grapple with potential supply disruptions. This latest event fits a pattern of markets reacting nervously to regional flare-ups. Economic Fallout: Inflation Fears Take Center Stage One of the most significant consequences of rising Oil prices is their direct impact on inflation. Energy costs are a major component of consumer price indices (CPI) in most economies. When oil goes up, it directly increases the cost of transportation, manufacturing, and countless goods and services. This surge intensifies existing Inflation fears around the globe. Central banks have been working to control inflation, and a spike in energy prices complicates this effort. Higher inflation can erode purchasing power, impact corporate earnings, and potentially lead to tighter monetary policies (like interest rate hikes) from central banks. Potential economic consequences include: Higher Consumer Prices: Increased costs for fuel, heating, and goods manufactured using oil. Reduced Consumer Spending: As essential costs rise, discretionary spending may decrease. Increased Business Costs: Companies face higher expenses for logistics, production, and energy. Pressure on Central Banks: May force monetary authorities to maintain or implement stricter policies, potentially slowing economic growth. Supply Chain Issues: Higher transportation costs can exacerbate existing supply chain pressures. The ripple effects of expensive oil are vast and can slow down economic activity, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as ‘stagflation’ if combined with stagnant growth. How Does This Oil Price Surge Affect the Crypto Market? Now, let’s bridge the gap to our world. While oil and crypto seem disparate, global macroeconomic forces connect them. The surge in Oil prices and the resulting increase in Inflation fears are critical factors for the Crypto market impact . Here’s how the connection works: Inflation Hedge Narrative: Bitcoin, in particular, has been championed by some as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. When inflation fears rise due to factors like soaring oil prices, this narrative can gain traction, potentially increasing demand for Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Risk-Off Sentiment: Geopolitical instability and economic uncertainty often lead investors to move away from perceived ‘riskier’ assets towards ‘safer’ ones. This ‘risk-off’ sentiment can negatively impact the broader crypto market, especially smaller altcoins, which are often seen as more speculative than Bitcoin. Macro Correlation: In recent years, the crypto market has shown increasing correlation with traditional financial markets, particularly tech stocks. If rising inflation fears lead to concerns about interest rate hikes or an economic slowdown, this could weigh on the stock market, and crypto might follow suit. Investor Behavior: Global uncertainty can lead to increased market volatility across all asset classes as investors react emotionally and strategically to developing events. The Crypto market impact is not always straightforward or immediate. It’s a complex interplay of narratives, correlations, and investor sentiment reacting to the evolving macroeconomic landscape shaped by events like the oil price jump. Is Bitcoin the New Safe Haven Amidst Geopolitical Risk? The narrative of Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ or a safe haven asset resurfaces during times of heightened Geopolitical risk and economic uncertainty. When traditional financial systems seem vulnerable or inflation looms, proponents argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative. Evidence for this is mixed and debated: Arguments for Safe Haven: Decentralization away from government control, finite supply (21 million cap), censorship resistance. Some argue its performance during specific crises supports this (e.g., capital flight during certain geopolitical events). Arguments Against Safe Haven: High volatility compared to traditional safe havens like gold or government bonds, relatively short history as an asset class, increasing correlation with risk-on assets (like tech stocks). The recent surge in Oil prices provides another test case for this narrative. While some investors might turn to Bitcoin fearing inflation and instability, others might view it as too risky during a period of general market caution. The market’s reaction will likely be a key indicator of how widely the ‘safe haven’ narrative is currently accepted. Navigating the Volatility: What Crypto Investors Should Consider The surge in Brent WTI futures and the broader implications for inflation and geopolitical stability mean that crypto investors need to be particularly vigilant. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on global news, not just crypto-specific news. Events in the Middle East or changes in central bank policies directly impact the macro environment influencing crypto. Understand Correlations: Be aware that crypto prices don’t exist in a vacuum. They are increasingly influenced by traditional markets, commodity prices, and macroeconomic indicators like inflation. Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Periods of heightened Geopolitical risk often bring increased market volatility. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. Consider Diversification: While tempting to focus on one asset, a diversified portfolio across different asset classes can help mitigate risk during uncertain times. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term price swings driven by geopolitical events can be significant. For long-term investors, focusing on the fundamental value and adoption trends of cryptocurrencies might be more productive than reacting to every piece of news. Inflation Hedges: If Inflation fears are a primary concern, research assets traditionally considered inflation hedges, including but not limited to Bitcoin, and understand their pros and cons. Ignoring events in traditional markets, especially those as significant as a 10%+ jump in Oil prices , would be a mistake for any serious crypto investor. The world is interconnected, and financial markets reflect this reality. Conclusion: Oil’s Surge and Crypto’s Crossroads The dramatic surge in Oil prices following the recent events in Iran is a stark reminder of how quickly geopolitical tensions can disrupt global markets and reignite Inflation fears . This significant movement in Brent WTI futures highlights the inherent volatility introduced by Geopolitical risk . For the cryptocurrency market, this situation presents both challenges and potential opportunities. It tests the narrative of Bitcoin as a safe haven and underscores the growing interconnectedness between traditional finance and digital assets. While short-term volatility may increase, understanding the underlying macroeconomic forces at play – driven partly by events like the oil price jump – is crucial for making informed decisions in the crypto space. As the situation evolves, the crypto market’s reaction will provide valuable insights into its maturity, its correlation with traditional assets, and the prevailing investor sentiment regarding its role in a volatile world.

Because of this quick rise in share price (driven by the rise in Bitcoin), I am actually downgrading my view of shares of Strategy from a buy to a hold. While Strategy’s plan to accumulate more Bitcoin could still turn out to be a solid one, I am concerned by the series of preferred stock the company has added to their capital stack. None of this was on their capital stack when I first wrote on the company back in January. My fear now is that their growth of debt could exceed the growth of their Bitcoin equity. The company’s stock has grown by more than 20% since the last time I wrote on them in mid-January, and I was very impressed by Q1 execution. However, I think shares are now fairly valued. I don’t see a ton of upside from here. This aligns well with my upside prediction from my writing back in January. Strategy adding preferred stock to their balance sheet may not end up being sustainable. I think this will be a tough pill for current common shareholders to swallow. Shares of Strategy are downgraded to a hold. Why I’m Doing Follow-Up Coverage As I mentioned earlier, Strategy stock has rallied about 26% since I last wrote on the company in early January. Over just 5 months, Strategy shares have risen from about $310 to roughly $391 a piece. In this same time frame, the S&P 500 has risen just 4.44%. As the price of Bitcoin has done well year to date, Strategy shares have followed (and frankly outperformed). Despite this, my concern going forward is not that shares have outperformed. My concern is that future growth is going to be fueled by unsustainable preferred stock. The company has raised a total of $10 billion in fresh capital in 2025, ($6.6 billion in equity, $3.4 billion in debt), building on a record $18.1 billion in Q4 2024 and bringing total Bitcoin holdings closer to 600,000 coins. Strategy owns nearly 3% of all 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist. I’m tracking institutional demand for yield-bearing crypto products. Strategy’s Bitcoin-linked preferred shares (STRK, STRF, and STRD) offer a compelling yield. But will this yield turn out to be unsustainable given this is often a cash payment when the company cannot support cash payments with little revenue? This is my major concern. At the core of why I am doing follow-up coverage, I want to talk about what, I think, is a flip in their capital structure. Previously, MicroStrategy (now Strategy), was what, I believe, was ‘well capitalized.’ The company has no preferred shares, and convertible notes that convert into common stock once shares go above a certain price. Now, Strategy has Preferred shares (which pay a dividend unless this dividend is suspended). I think this sets a dangerous precedent. This is the opposite of the capital structure I originally saw that made me fascinated by the asset acquisition model (can’t really call it a ‘business model’). With this, I am doing follow-up coverage because I believe that Strategy may be at a turning point (and not for the better). Strategy needs to keep its preferred shares in check, which will slow its Bitcoin yield per share. This is a major issue. Unsustainable Debt At the heart of my downgrade on Strategy is my view of their now increasingly leveraged balance sheet. To review, when I last wrote on Strategy back in January, their capital structure consisted of two main securities: Common stock owned by shareholders. This trades under “MSTR” here in the US. Issuing common shares has little impact on the long run viability of the company (leverage wise). Convertible notes, many of which pay 0% interest, are non-recourse loans, and often will convert into stock. These also have not concerned me because they don’t bleed capital (in terms of interest payments) in the event of a Bitcoin drawdown with the company still having to service their debt. In essence, common shares (and convertible notes) cost the company zero on an accounting or cash basis until the convertible notes mature. Their new instruments (STRF), ( STRK ), and ( STRD ) all have their host of interest payments). These are all forms of preferred stock. So, unlike their convertible bonds that have a maturity date (but no interest payments), these have no maturity date (but have a ton of interest payments). (STRD) is the newest of the three preferred share offerings. The first two are summarized nicely by the company’s most recent 10Q (table from 10Q below). Preferred Stock Share classes Q1 (Seeking Alpha) For “STRD,” their most recent offering, preferred shares yield 10% per annum. Dividends are not cumulative; meaning if the board does not declare a dividend, then no backpay of dividends is owed. To me, the net result of this is a catch 22 now for Strategy. Either they pay the 8-10% nominal yield on these securities per annum (and see a huge cashflow drag that is not supported by revenue and will require more stock issuances), or don’t pay these cumulative dividends and make investors of the preferred shares question if there is going to be some sort of liquidity risk with their investments. After all, preferred shares theoretically are outstanding forever. So, if Strategy fails to pay a dividend, what are the odds new investors will finance new preferred shares? I say all of this because I believe that while Bitcoin’s price has touched all-time highs in the last few weeks, Strategy common shares have been lagging. I think common shareholders are starting to wonder if the Bitcoin yield per share is sustainable (or if all of this will need to be paid back to creditors eventually). While I am not a shareholder, I am wondering this too. Valuation To be clear, I have no idea what strategy is worth at this point (hence why I am rating them a hold vs. a buy or a sell). When I last wrote on them, I implied that there could be up to roughly 30% upside in shares. Since then, we have seen shares jump by 26% pricing in most of this upward swing. According to Strategy’s valuation metrics , the company has a trailing twelve months price-to-book ratio of 3.24, which is 5.56% lower than the sector median of 3.43. Seeking Alpha Quant gives the company a grade of a C+ on this metric. The biggest issue is the knockout risk that comes from MicroStrategy/Strategy failing to refinance debt and this leading to the collapse in shares of the Bitcoin treasury company. Since there is now billions of dollars of convertible debt and preferred stock on top of common shares, the effective “Bitcoin yield” to shares is a little bit skewed and maybe misrepresenting what the actual Bitcoin yield is. For example, if Strategy buys Bitcoin now and finances it using preferred stock that costs them 10% in annual preferred dividend payments, this means that for the Bitcoin per common share yield to increase, the price of Bitcoin would need to increase by more than 10% per annum. This is technically possible since Bitcoin has compounded at roughly 57% CAGR over the last 5 years according to Strategy chairman Saylor. This is not guaranteed going forward, however. In fact, if we were to see Bitcoin compound at a rate less than 10% per annum over any period of time, technically the Bitcoin yield would turn negative. Since it appears we may be near the end of the 4-year bull run cycle in Bitcoin, I think there is a real risk it underperforms over the next few years. This is a huge risk now with preferred stock on their capital stack. It’s the main reason why shares are a hold now. Bull Thesis Even though I am downgrading shares of Strategy, this doesn’t mean that there is not a bull thesis. At the end of the day, the whole story with Strategy comes down to execution. With this, the main question: can the firm execute its innovative 21/21 plan and create net shareholder value with the combination of debt plus far more equity. The 21/21 plan is a now shareholder approved proposal to raise $21 billion of equity and $21 billion of fixed income over the next three years. On the surface, I still believe buying up large amounts of Bitcoin via equity and leverage is a bullish play if the network can figure out its Quantum hacking risks (more on this another time with an article that focuses on Bitcoin directly). The risk now is regulatory. The biggest risk with this plan is not even the interest on the debt that Strategy now has to pay. The biggest risk (I believe) is the 15% corporate AMT on unrealized gains under the Inflation Reduction Act could force Strategy to sell Bitcoin starting in 2026. This would be a very concerning outcome. Saylor, a Bitcoin enthusiast, has been arguing for years he would never sell any of Strategy's Bitcoin. It could create a sticky situation for Saylor and Strategy. In essence, this AMT tax works as a minimum tax on “adjusted financial statement income” which includes unrealized gains from (among other things) cryptocurrency investments. This is Strategy’s whole business. While some cryptocurrency firms have requested exemptions from the AMT, there is no guarantee that Strategy will earn an exemption. Starting in 2026 , companies will be forced to pay this AMT (unless they get an exemption). This could be a multi-billion dollar tax bill for Strategy alone. Bottom Line While Strategy may remain one of the purest equity proxies for Bitcoin upside, I think the biggest risk now is that the preferred stock the company has on its balance sheet may get too metaphorically heavy. Historically, as Bitcoin grew, Strategy grew along with it, simply because of how much Bitcoin the company owns and how Saylor sliced the risk appetite up based on the company’s different share classes/convertible notes. The biggest risk with preferred stock is not even that it's perpetual. The biggest risk is that the debt pays an interest rate that (depending on the specific tranche of preferred stock) may have to be a cash dividend. This is a tough pill to swallow. Bitcoin will inevitably have its drawdowns in the future. Saylor will have to fund these interest payments with either the sales of Bitcoin (bad idea for investor trust) or via issuing more debt. At this point, you’re talking about issuing new principal debt to pay off the interest on the previous debt. While this is how the US government runs, this is not sustainable for a single company. It frankly is probably not stable for the US government either. For long-term Bitcoin bulls, Strategy may still offer a high-conviction, high-reward vehicle. Its currently expanding Bitcoin treasury could really be the only paths to justify the risk diffusion complexity and common share volatility. With this, shares are downgraded from a buy to a hold.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794657-strategy-debt-now-unsustainable-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|STRK","STRK|STRD|STRF|MSTR",cryptocompare

But Analyst Says ""Interest in XRP and This Altcoin Continues"", Reveals Price Predictions!","Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market have been negatively affected by the tension between Israel and Iran. At this point, cryptocurrency markets fell sharply as investors reacted to renewed military activity in the Middle East and Israeli airstrikes on Iran led to broader risk aversion. Bitcoin fell to $103,000 before recovering to $104,600, while Ethereum and altcoins also experienced significant declines. ETH is down 8.8% in the last 24 hours, while XRP is down 5% and Solana (SOL) is down 9%. However, one analyst said that despite the declines and rising geopolitical tensions, XRP and Solana are still seeing positive influence from corporate narratives and continue to attract institutional interest. Speaking to Coindesk, Bitget Research Chief Analyst Ryan Lee said that XRP is attracting attention with its growing share in institutional treasuries. At this point, Ryan Lee stated that companies such as Chinese company Webus International ($ 300 million), VivoPower ($ 121 million), Wellgistics ($ 50 million) and Trident ($ 500 million) are creating XRP buying pressure approaching $ 1 billion. “The increase in institutional XRP treasuries is a sign of greater institutional adoption of XRP due to its low-cost, high-speed payment capabilities.” At this point, Lee said that regulatory clarity around XRP and ETF speculations could push XRP to $5 by mid-2025. However, Lee added that downside risks for XRP also remain. Interest in Solana (SOL) Continues! Ryan Lee, who also outlined his Solana estimates, said institutional interest in Solana remains buoyant, as SOL benefits from solid network fundamentals and ETF demand, with data pointing to further gains. Solana rose to around $165, supported by over $1.2 billion in Q1 execution revenue and increased open interest in the futures markets, Lee noted. This signals renewed confidence in Solana among both retail and institutional players. At this point, the analyst stated that if the current momentum in Solana continues, the SOL price could rise to the $200-250 range or even exceed $300. *This is not investment advice.

The main focus in the past several days was the US-China trade deal, which finally saw a positive breakthrough at the start of the week when the two superpowers met in London to discuss terms. Just a few days later, the POTUS announced on his social media platform that the delegates had reached an agreement that needed to be signed by him and Chinese President Xi Jinping. These developments influenced BTC’s price to a large extent as the asset started the business week at around $105,500 but quickly started to gain traction as the events progressed. By Tuesday morning, the cryptocurrency knocked on the $110,500 door, but it was shut in its face. The scenario repeated a few more times by Wednesday, when Trump said the US is happy with the terms, and the nation’s CPI numbers for May went live, which were slightly better than anticipated. However, bitcoin couldn’t resume its run and started to nosedive. The landscape worsened on Friday morning when Israel hit several Iranian military targets, claiming to have killed numerous high-level generals and nuclear scientists. Trump said he gave Iran “chance after chance” to sign the nuclear deal, and he urged the local authorities to do so “before there’s nothing left.” As the dust is currently settling, BTC’s price managed to recover some ground since the early morning low of under $103,000 and now stands around $105,000. This puts it actually slightly in the green on a weekly scale, but nothing compared to the massive gains registered by HYPE. The high-flyer notched a 15.5% weekly surge and even tapped a new all-time high above $42 earlier this week. The other big gainers on a weekly scale include UNI, AAVE, and BCH, while SOL, SUI, TON, SHIB, ADA, DOGE, and TRX are in the red.

2025-06-13T13:20:58,"Urgent: Iran-Israel Conflict Threatens Cryptocurrency Market Stability","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Iran-Israel Conflict Threatens Cryptocurrency Market Stability The geopolitical landscape is shifting, and a recent report citing an Iranian security source via Reuters suggests a potentially significant escalation. According to Jin10.com, Iran is reportedly preparing a ‘harsh response’ to a recent Israeli strike. While this news focuses on international relations, events of this magnitude rarely stay confined to political arenas; they often send ripples through global financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. For crypto investors, understanding the potential cryptocurrency market impact of rising tensions is crucial. Understanding the Iran Israel Conflict and Its Roots The report points to heightened tensions following an Israeli strike. The Iran Israel conflict is a long-standing, complex rivalry involving regional power struggles, proxy conflicts, and ideological differences. Recent events, such as the alleged Israeli strike Iran is referencing, have brought these simmering tensions to a boiling point. An Iranian security source’s statement about a ‘harsh response’ signals a potential escalation that market participants, including those in the crypto space, must monitor closely. How Geopolitical Risk Impacts Financial Markets Historically, significant geopolitical events introduce uncertainty and often lead to increased volatility across traditional financial markets – stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies. Investors tend to react to the perceived risk, sometimes moving capital to assets considered ‘safer’ or simply reducing exposure to volatile assets. This pattern of reaction can spill over into the cryptocurrency market, even though crypto operates outside traditional financial systems. Increased Uncertainty: Conflict creates unpredictable outcomes, making investors hesitant. Risk-Off Sentiment: During times of high tension, investors may sell ‘riskier’ assets. Commodity Price Spikes: Tensions in the Middle East can significantly impact oil prices, affecting global economic stability. Currency Fluctuations: Geopolitical events can cause shifts in major currency values. Will the Iran Israel Conflict Drive Bitcoin Price Volatility? One of the primary concerns for crypto holders is the potential for Bitcoin price volatility . Bitcoin, being the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, often acts as a barometer for the broader market. When major global events occur, Bitcoin’s price can react sharply. There are differing views on how geopolitical risk affects Bitcoin: Some argue Bitcoin acts as a ‘digital gold’ or a safe haven asset, uncorrelated with traditional markets. In theory, during times of conflict or economic instability, investors might flock to Bitcoin as an alternative store of value, potentially driving its price up. This narrative gained some traction during previous periods of global uncertainty. Others contend that Bitcoin still largely behaves as a risk asset, similar to tech stocks. Under this view, increased geopolitical tension and a general ‘risk-off’ sentiment in traditional markets would likely lead to a sell-off in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as investors prioritize liquidity or less volatile assets. Recent market history shows instances supporting both arguments, making the outcome uncertain. Navigating Geopolitical Risk Crypto Exposure For those invested in the digital asset space, understanding and managing geopolitical risk crypto exposure is vital. The potential for a ‘harsh response’ from Iran introduces a significant layer of uncertainty. While no one can predict market movements with certainty, here are some points to consider: Stay Informed: Monitor not only crypto news but also major international news sources covering the situation between Iran and Israel. Assess Your Portfolio: Understand your risk tolerance. Are you comfortable with potential sharp price swings? Avoid Emotional Decisions: Panic selling or buying based purely on headlines can be detrimental. Stick to your long-term investment strategy. Consider Diversification: While diversification doesn’t guarantee profits or protect against all losses, having a varied portfolio (within crypto or across asset classes) can potentially mitigate risk. Focus on Fundamentals: While macro events cause short-term fluctuations, the long-term value of crypto assets is driven by their underlying technology, adoption, and development. What Do Middle East Tensions Mean for the Crypto Market? Rising Middle East tensions crypto investors should be aware of can manifest in several ways. Beyond direct price volatility, prolonged instability in a key global region can have broader economic consequences that indirectly affect crypto: For example, significant disruptions to oil supply lines could lead to energy price surges. This impacts global inflation, central bank policies (like interest rate decisions), and overall economic growth. Such macro factors inevitably influence investor sentiment and capital flows, which in turn affect the crypto market. Furthermore, increased global instability might prompt governments to tighten regulations on capital flows, potentially impacting crypto exchanges and transactions. While the immediate focus is on the potential for a direct market reaction to the ‘harsh response’ news, the cascading effects of sustained Middle East tensions on the global economy are a critical long-term consideration for anyone holding digital assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders Given the potential for increased Bitcoin price volatility and overall market uncertainty stemming from the Iran Israel conflict , what concrete steps can crypto holders take? Set Price Alerts: Use exchange or tracking tools to set alerts for significant price movements in your key holdings. Review Stop-Loss Orders: If you actively trade, consider setting or adjusting stop-loss orders to limit potential downside in case of a sudden market downturn. Reduce Leverage: If you trade with leverage, consider reducing your positions to minimize liquidation risk during periods of high volatility. Stay Liquid (Partially): Having some stablecoins or fiat currency readily available can allow you to potentially buy dips if the market corrects, or simply provide peace of mind. Conduct Thorough Research: Understand the specific risks associated with the assets you hold, beyond just market-wide volatility. The report of Iran preparing a ‘harsh response’ is a stark reminder that external geopolitical forces can significantly influence the seemingly separate world of cryptocurrency. While the direct impact of the Iran Israel conflict on the cryptocurrency market impact is subject to debate and dependent on the nature of any escalation, the potential for increased Bitcoin price volatility and broader geopolitical risk crypto exposure is undeniable. Investors should remain vigilant, stay informed about Middle East tensions crypto market reactions, and employ sound risk management strategies during these uncertain times. The coming days could be crucial in determining the market’s reaction to this developing situation.

2025-06-13T13:19:23,"HYPE steadies after sharp pullback from ATH amid market tumble","The broader crypto market faced a sharp jolt earlier today as geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran triggered a wave of sell-offs. Among the tokens hit was Hyperliquid’s HYPE, which saw a steep intraday decline. However, the token is now showing signs of recovery. Trading at $39.63 at press time, HYPE ( HYPE ) is gradually rebounding from the sharp drop it suffered earlier.

A Look at Cathie Wood’s Top Innovation ETF Picks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cathie Wood of ARK Invest has long excited investors with her daring strategy toward disruptive innovation. Her flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), targets individuals hoping to profit from companies that are transforming the world. In a recent Yahoo Finance segment, Stocks in Translation host Jared Blikre breaks down ARKK’s key investments from 2020 to 2025, highlighting how Wood’s strategy has evolved – from the explosive highs of 2020 to the ambitious possibilities of 2025. Here’s a closer look at the fund’s journey and what’s driving it today. The 2020 Boom: A Stellar Lineup ARKK saw a 153% increase in 2020 , accompanied by a list of disruptive companies. While Teladoc Health (TDOC) profited from the telemedicine trend, Tesla (TSLA) was the leader in the electric vehicle (EV) market. Roku (ROKU) drove the streaming revolution, Block (SQ) transformed digital payments, and Shopify (SHOP) empowered a new era of e-commerce. These holdings showcased Wood’s sharp instinct for companies redefining their industries, making ARKK a favorite among growth-focused investors. 2025’s New Bets: Crypto, Metaverse, and AI Looking at 2025, ARKK will explore emerging trends. Nevertheless, Elon Musk’s Tesla continues to lead, but Wood has broadened her attention to Gitlab (GTLB) for AI and data analysis, Roblox (RBLX) for the metaverse, and Coinbase Global (COIN) for cryptocurrency investment. This change supports Wood’s ultimate purpose of rapid expansion and emphasizes her beliefs regarding blockchain, virtual realities, and AI as the upcoming major developments. Performance Swings ARKK’s performance has been uneven. Following its peak in 2020, it fell 67% in 2022 due to increasing rates, with assets dropping from $59 billion in 2021 to $11.1 billion by mid-2024. A recovery in 2023 resulted in an 82% increase, surpassing the S&P 500’s 53%. As of May 2025, ARKK has risen only 1% year-to-date, underperforming the market but picking up momentum since April, assisted by stocks such as Palantir. High Risk, High Conviction Critics, including Morningstar, point to ARKK’s $14.3 billion loss in investor wealth over the past decade, citing its volatility. Still, Wood’s early wins, like Tesla and Bitcoin, highlight her long-term vision.

2025-06-13T13:13:45,"Bitcoin crashes as Israel launches attack on Iran, but charts saw it coming first","Bitcoin’s sharp sell-off this week has sparked concerns across the market, with many pointing to escalating tensions between Israel and Iran as the primary catalyst. While macro headlines triggered panic selling, the charts had already laid out the roadmap. A bearish shark harmonic pattern, coupled with a breakdown from key volume levels, suggested that a corrective move was highly probable. Notably, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was consolidating near the value area high earlier this week when tensions in the Middle East began escalating. As news of a military confrontation between Israel and Iran broke, global risk sentiment weakened, leading to widespread liquidation across crypto markets. However, beneath the surface, technical structure had already shown signs of exhaustion. As predicted on June 10 in this analysis article , a shark harmonic pattern hinted at a full market rotation, which ultimately played out in textbook fashion. Key technical points Bearish Shark Harmonic Completed: Pattern projected a retracement from VAH to VAL. Breakdown of Value Area High: Confirmed technical weakness and led to an impulsive sell-off. News of Israel-Iran Tensions Added Volatility: Macro uncertainty accelerated the move but didn’t initiate it. Value Area Low and Key Low Now in Focus: Price has tapped into strong support — a possible bounce zone. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView The move began with price consolidating above the value area high (VAH), a level that had acted as resistance throughout recent trading sessions. The confirmation of the shark harmonic came when Bitcoin lost the VAH, triggering a technical breakdown. From there, price moved quickly toward the point of control and then into the value area low, completing the harmonic structure. While the drop coincided with rising geopolitical tension, particularly the developing military standoff between Israel and Iran, it’s important to note that this was not a random crash. The technical structure had already forecast a bearish expansion, and the news simply added speed and volatility to a move that was already in motion. You might also like: Is it the time to buy Bitcoin? $170,000 setup looks like “a ticking time bomb” Price has now wicked into the VAL, establishing a key swing low. This level is a critical support area. Holding above it may trigger a relief rally or even a full rotation back toward the VAH, provided short-term price action confirms stability. What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin holds above the value area low and builds support here, a recovery toward the POC and VAH is technically reasonable. However, if this key swing low is lost with momentum, further downside may unfold. While the news shook the market, the chart had already warned, and this drop may ultimately serve as another long-term buying opportunity within Bitcoin’s broader trend.

2025-06-13T13:10:53,"Oil Price Surge Explodes Over 7% Amidst Iran Israel Conflict: What it Means for Market Volatility and Crypto","BitcoinWorld Oil Price Surge Explodes Over 7% Amidst Iran Israel Conflict: What it Means for Market Volatility and Crypto The financial world is currently witnessing significant shifts, and one of the most immediate and dramatic reactions came from the energy markets. Following reports of an Israeli airstrike targeting Iran, we saw a swift and substantial oil price surge . This event underscores how quickly geopolitical events can ripple through global markets, creating widespread market volatility that investors across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, need to understand. Understanding the Immediate Oil Price Surge Let’s look at the raw numbers that hit the headlines immediately after the news broke: Brent Crude: This global benchmark saw a significant jump, surging by as much as 7%. Prices momentarily touched $74.47 per barrel, a sharp move indicating market anxiety about potential supply disruptions. West Texas Intermediate (WTI): The US standard wasn’t far behind, also experiencing a strong increase of 7.3%. WTI traded up to $72.62 per barrel. These percentages represent substantial gains in a very short period, reflecting the market’s immediate assessment of increased geopolitical risk in a critical oil-producing region. Why Did the Iran Israel Conflict Impact Oil So Quickly? The Middle East is central to global energy supply. Any significant escalation of tension or direct conflict in this region naturally raises concerns about the flow of oil from major producers. The Iran Israel conflict , particularly direct actions like airstrikes, immediately puts markets on edge because: Supply Disruption Fears: Even if current production isn’t directly hit, the risk of future disruptions, blockades, or expanded conflict impacting shipping lanes (like the Strait of Hormuz) or production facilities increases. Regional Stability: The wider the conflict spreads, the more unpredictable the supply chain becomes. Other nations in the region could be drawn in, amplifying the potential impact. Market Sentiment: Traders react quickly to perceived risk. Fear of future scarcity drives immediate buying pressure, pushing prices higher. This rapid reaction in oil prices serves as a clear indicator of elevated geopolitical risk on the global stage. Broader Market Volatility: Beyond Just Oil While oil was the most immediate responder, increased geopolitical risk doesn’t stay isolated. Higher energy prices have cascading effects: Inflationary Pressure: Energy is a fundamental cost for almost everything. Higher oil prices feed into transportation, manufacturing, and ultimately, consumer prices, potentially fueling inflation. Economic Growth Concerns: Persistent high energy costs can act as a tax on consumers and businesses, potentially slowing down economic activity. Shift in Investor Sentiment: Periods of heightened geopolitical tension often lead investors to move towards perceived ‘safe haven’ assets (like gold or certain currencies) and away from riskier assets. This creates a broader environment of market volatility across stocks, bonds, and commodities, setting the stage for potential shifts in investor behavior that can indirectly affect the cryptocurrency space. How Could the Oil Price Surge and Geopolitical Risk Impact the Crypto Market? This is where the connection becomes particularly relevant for our readers. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not directly tied to oil production or consumption in the same way traditional industries are, they operate within the broader global financial ecosystem. The oil price surge and the underlying increase in geopolitical risk can influence the crypto market impact in several ways: Risk-Off Sentiment: If the broader market moves into a ‘risk-off’ mode due to global instability, cryptocurrencies, which are often still perceived as risk assets (similar to tech stocks), could see selling pressure. Investors might reduce exposure to volatile assets. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Conversely, some proponents argue that Bitcoin, due to its fixed supply, can act as a hedge against inflation caused by rising commodity prices like oil. If inflation concerns mount, this narrative could gain traction, potentially attracting some investors to crypto. However, this is a debated point, and crypto’s correlation with traditional risk assets currently often outweighs its inflation-hedge behavior. Increased Volatility: Higher uncertainty in traditional markets often spills over into crypto. The crypto market impact could be increased price swings as traders react to global news and market sentiment shifts. Mining Costs: While not a direct price driver, sustained high energy prices can impact the profitability of cryptocurrency mining operations, which could have long-term supply-side implications, though this is a less immediate effect. The key takeaway is that the Iran Israel conflict and its effect on oil amplify global economic uncertainty, which is a major factor influencing investment decisions across the board, including within the crypto space. Navigating Increased Market Volatility: Actionable Insights In times like these, characterized by a sudden oil price surge and elevated geopolitical risk , what should participants in the crypto market consider? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of both geopolitical developments and their effects on traditional markets. Understanding the broader context is crucial for anticipating potential shifts in crypto sentiment. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Increased market volatility means prices can move sharply in either direction. Re-evaluate your comfort level with potential losses and ensure your portfolio allocation reflects this. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term reactions to geopolitical events can be significant but temporary. If you are invested in crypto with a long-term horizon, avoid making impulsive decisions based on daily price swings driven by external news. Diversification: Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified, not just within crypto but across different asset classes, if appropriate for your financial goals. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those accumulating crypto, sticking to a DCA strategy can help mitigate the risk of buying at temporary peaks driven by volatility. Understanding the potential crypto market impact stemming from global events like the Iran Israel conflict and the resulting oil price surge is essential for making informed decisions in a turbulent environment. Summary: Geopolitics, Oil, and the Ripple Effect on Crypto The recent Israeli airstrike in Iran triggered an immediate and significant oil price surge , highlighting the sensitivity of energy markets to geopolitical risk in the Middle East. This event contributes to broader market volatility , creating uncertainty that extends beyond traditional assets. For the cryptocurrency market, the crypto market impact is indirect but significant, influenced by shifts in global risk sentiment, potential inflationary pressures, and overall market unpredictability stemming from events like the Iran Israel conflict . Navigating this period requires vigilance, a focus on risk management, and a clear understanding of how macroeconomic and geopolitical forces can influence even the seemingly disconnected world of digital assets.

2025-06-13T13:10:14,"Top corporate ETH holder Sharplink Gaming endures stocks dip after ETH purchase","Sharplink Gaming (SBET) became the largest corporate holder of ETH after completing a financing round, followed by a direct purchase. Sharplink dedicated over $463M for ETH purchases, with the goal of setting up a long-term treasury strategy. Sharplink Gaming (SBET) is the biggest corporate holder of Ethereum, after a financing round to acquire an ETH treasury. Sharplink raised $463M to acquire a total of 176,271 ETH, becoming the biggest ETH buyer as a crypto outsider. The company bought ETH at an average price of $2,626, already suffering from the recent slide to a lower range. The recent purchase has the potential to become the “Microstrategy moment” for Sharplink, although it is tapping the new trend of ETH and altcoin treasuries. Sharplink already announced its plans to raise up to $1B for its eventual treasury, so it has more leeway for future acquisitions. Sharplink Gaming joined the trend of tapping altcoins as reserves, joining DeFi Dev Corp with its SOL strategy and other corporate buyers looking into SOL, XPR, or other assets. Sharplink is the first NASDAQ-listed company to adopt an ETH treasury strategy, with more potential buyers expected. Sharplink shares crash despite ETH treasury hype Despite the announcement, both ETH and the SBET market price showed weakness. ETH traded in the $2,500 range after a market-wide slump. SBET erased its recent gains, sliding by 66% in pre-market hours. Just weeks ago, SBET traded above $124, ending up with a 91% crash since its all-time peak. SBET may have already speed-ran its Strategy moment, as crypto buying is no longer the guaranteed booster for stock prices. SBET shares crashed in pre-market trading, erasing 91% from their all-time high above $124. | Source: Marketwatch One of the main reasons may be the way Sharplink Gaming structured its financing. The first round of funds was raised through a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE), where private investors got shares at a potential discount. The subsequent dilution caused the private buyers to shed their SBET shares, crashing the price for retail holders. The fundraising round was led by Consensys and included a mix of fiat and direct ETH payments in exchange for SBET shares. Other participants included ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital, Pantera Capital, Arrington Capital, Galaxy Digital, Ondo, White Star Capital, GSR, Hivemind Capital, Hypersphere, Primitive Ventures, and Republic Digital. The high-profile fundraising initially boosted SBET, only later leading to the sharp price decline. ETH treasuries are in fact more common, a relic of the ICO era and early distribution. The Ethereum Foundation is currently the biggest holder, with $592.6M in ETH. Building a treasury through shares is one possible tool to use idle ETH, while tapping external share financing. For some companies, the SBET crash can be a warning about dilution. An ETH treasury can also be used for staking or other forms of passive income. SharpLink Gaming expressed its belief in the Ethereum ecosystem as a hub for finance, e-commerce or other applications. The recent stock crash may affect future attempts to expand the treasury. Currently, Sharplink holds an amount of ETH comparable to old ICO projects or investment funds. ETH is seen as a less reliable store of value, especially after its long slide against BTC.

""We could take $100 million of ADA in the treasury, convert it to a blend of stablecoins incumbent in Cardano so USDM and USDA and convert some of it in bitcoin to prime bitcoin DeFi,"" Hoskinson said on a YouTube live stream . He then hit back at critics that claimed a $100 million sale would impact the price of ADA, calling them ""inexperienced"" before adding that the sale ""would not cause any problems at all."" The goal of the sale would be getting the ratio of stablecoin issuance and TVL to around 30% to 40% versus the current roughly 10%. Total value locked on Cardano stands at $356 million with just $31 million worth of stablecoins minted on-chain, DefiLlama data shows . Solana meanwhile has $9.8 billion in TVL and $11 billion worth of stablecoins minted on-chain. In a tweet Hoskinson said that the stablecoin situation is ""killing Cardano"" and that the proposal would generate ""non-inflationary revenue"" and help build the Cardano DeFi economy.

2025-06-13T13:00:49,"Bitcoin’s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed—Next Stop: $170,000","The Hash Ribbon “buy” trigger – a signal embedded in Bitcoin’s network hashrate dynamics – has flashed again, and technical analyst Astronomer Zero believes it could pave the way to at least $170,000 per coin. A chart the analyst posted on X on 12 June overlays every prior weekly‐time-frame Hash Ribbon entry since 2020 on the BTC/USDT perpetual contract at Binance, illustrating why the signal is treated with almost talismanic respect by some quantitative traders. Bitcoin Surge To $170,000 Imminent? The graphic shows five earlier occurrences of the capitulation-to-recovery crossover embedded in the Hash Ribbon algorithm. Each is marked on the price pane by a cobalt-blue “Buy” dot directly beneath the weekly candles and linked to the ensuing rally by a violet measuring arrow. After the signal in late-2020, Bitcoin accelerated by 235% from the $18,000 consolidation floor to challenge the then-all-time-high zone just above $60,000 before any major pull-back unfolded. Mid-2021’s ribbon event proved more modest – roughly 59% from a $30,000 base into resistance near $48,000 – yet it still respected the rule that the market rewards the crossover with significant upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rate Flips Again And History Says A Rally Is Around The Corner The next two signals, printed in late-2022 and early-2023, were far stronger: a 260% surge from the capitulation trough below $18,000, followed by a 175% leg in mid-2023 that carried price cleanly to the long-standing supply shelf in the $60,000 area. In mid-2024, the hash ribbon signal led to a 100% rally above $100,000. Most recently, the ribbon crossed again three weeks ago, with Bitcoin quoted at roughly $105,000 on the weekly close. The analyst annotates current price at $106,873 and draws a fresh horizontal barrier at the $160,000–$165,000 band – the level that would align with the mean magnitude of earlier post-signal advances. Were the market merely to match the smallest historical percentage move (≈ 60%) from the present crossover, spot would extend to the $170,000 region indicated in crimson on the chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: ‘Fair Price’ Today Is $230,000 Hash Ribbon logic is mechanical. When the 30-day moving average of network hashrate climbs back above the 60-day average after a period of miner capitulation, on-chain observers read it as an all-clear that forced selling pressure has exhausted. In the past, that transition has coincided with aggressive spot accumulation visible on-chain and in derivatives positioning. Sceptics will note that correlation is not causation and that a six-figure quote for Bitcoin already bakes in ETF inflows, a looming halving supply shock and a global liquidity cycle that could yet tighten. Still, Astronomer Zero’s chart underscores an objective fact: in the last half-decade the Hash Ribbon “buy” has never mis-fired. Whether history’s rhythm repeats or merely rhymes, traders are watching the $170,000 level marked on the chart as the next test of that record. At press time, BTC was down 3.1% over the past 24 hours, trading at $104,898.

2025-06-13T13:00:49,"Blockchain Group Secures $11.2M for Bold Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","BitcoinWorld Blockchain Group Secures $11.2M for Bold Bitcoin Treasury Strategy In the dynamic world of digital assets, strategic financial moves by companies often grab headlines. One such move involves adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy , where companies hold significant amounts of BTC on their balance sheets. This approach, popularized by early adopters, is now being pursued by The Blockchain Group, a French firm that recently announced a significant funding round specifically for this purpose. What is The Blockchain Group and Their Ambitious Goal? The Blockchain Group, known for its activities in the blockchain sector, has set its sights on becoming a company with a substantial BTC treasury . This isn’t just about holding a small amount of crypto; it’s a deliberate corporate financial strategy aimed at leveraging Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, among other factors. Their recent announcement highlights a clear commitment to this path. To fuel this ambition, The Blockchain Group successfully raised approximately €9.7 million, which translates to about $11.2 million. This funding was secured through a combination of an equity offering and a convertible bond offering. This capital infusion provides the necessary resources to begin executing their plan to accumulate Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. Decoding the Funding: Equity and Convertible Bonds Understanding how The Blockchain Group secured this funding is key to appreciating the move. They utilized two primary mechanisms: Equity Offering: This involves selling shares of the company to investors. By issuing new stock, the company raises capital directly. New shareholders become part-owners of The Blockchain Group. Convertible Bond Offering: This involves issuing bonds that can be converted into shares of the company at a later date, under certain conditions. Convertible bonds offer investors the security of a bond (regular interest payments) while also providing the potential upside of converting to equity if the company’s stock price rises. This blend of financing methods allowed The Blockchain Group to attract a diverse set of investors interested in supporting their strategic shift towards a Bitcoin treasury strategy . The success of this equity offering and bond sale demonstrates investor confidence not only in the company itself but also potentially in the long-term prospects of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. Why Are Companies Adopting a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? The idea of holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet gained significant traction following pioneering moves by companies like MicroStrategy. Several factors drive this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation and quantitative easing. Its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins contrasts sharply with the ability of central banks to print more money. Potential Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term appreciation potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns on treasury assets compared to traditional low-yield investments like cash or bonds. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury can diversify assets away from traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing new types of risk). Technological Alignment: For companies already involved in blockchain or technology sectors, holding Bitcoin aligns with their core business and can signal innovation and forward-thinking to investors and customers. For The Blockchain Group, a company already rooted in the blockchain space, pursuing a BTC treasury strategy seems like a natural extension of their expertise and vision. The $11.2 million raised provides a solid foundation for building this treasury position. What Does This Crypto Funding Mean for The Blockchain Group? This successful crypto funding round is a pivotal moment for The Blockchain Group. It provides them with the capital needed to execute their stated goal of accumulating Bitcoin. While the announcement doesn’t specify the exact amount of BTC they plan to acquire or the timeline, the $11.2 million figure suggests a meaningful initial allocation. This strategy shift could potentially: Enhance the company’s balance sheet value if Bitcoin’s price appreciates. Increase visibility and investor interest, particularly among those bullish on Bitcoin and the digital asset space. Position The Blockchain Group alongside other publicly traded companies that have embraced Bitcoin as a treasury asset. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility of Bitcoin. A Bitcoin treasury strategy exposes the company to market fluctuations, which could impact their financial results. Managing this volatility and determining the appropriate size of the BTC holding relative to their overall assets will be critical for The Blockchain Group. Risks and Rewards of a Corporate BTC Treasury Adopting a BTC treasury isn’t without its challenges. Companies considering this move must weigh the potential rewards against significant risks: Potential Rewards: Significant capital appreciation Inflation protection Portfolio diversification Attracting tech-savvy investors Potential Risks: Extreme price volatility leading to potential impairment losses Regulatory uncertainty and potential changes in accounting rules Security risks associated with holding digital assets Public and investor perception issues The decision by The Blockchain Group to pursue this strategy, backed by a successful equity offering and bond sale, indicates they have assessed these factors and believe the potential long-term benefits outweigh the risks for their specific business context. The Bigger Picture: Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin The move by The Blockchain Group is part of a broader trend of increasing corporate interest in Bitcoin and other digital assets. While still relatively small compared to the total number of global companies, the list of publicly traded and private companies holding Bitcoin is growing. This trend is driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors, technological advancements, and the maturing infrastructure around digital assets. Successful crypto funding rounds like the one completed by The Blockchain Group further validate this trend, showing that investors are willing to support companies making strategic allocations to Bitcoin. Conclusion: A Bold Step for The Blockchain Group The Blockchain Group’s successful raising of $11.2 million through an equity offering and convertible bonds marks a significant step towards implementing their Bitcoin treasury strategy . This funding provides the capital needed to acquire BTC and potentially position the company for future growth in line with the performance of this leading digital asset. While the path involves navigating the inherent volatility and risks of the crypto market, The Blockchain Group’s move signals a strong belief in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin as a corporate asset. It will be interesting to watch how this strategy unfolds and impacts their future financial performance.

The price is testing the lower Bollinger Band near $139 support, hinting at potential downside continuation. The RSI at 38.84 shows weakening momentum and approaches oversold territory. The failure to hold the 20-day SMA at $159 suggests bears are in control. If the $139 level breaks, further downside toward $125 is possible, otherwise, a bounce may retest resistance near $160.

If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-06-13T13:00:35,"When Will The Dogecoin Price Hit $1 In 2025? Machine Learning Algorithm Answers","Despite a rollercoaster few years that have seen the Bitcoin price hit multiple new all-time highs, other high-cap cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin have failed to do the same . In fact, the highest the Dogecoin price has gotten in the last three years is $0.5, which is still a ways away from the $0.74 figure that was hit back in 2021. Calls for $1 for the meme coin have also died down as it continues to decline and struggle along with the rest of the altcoin market. Can Dogecoin Price Reach $1? When it comes to the Dogecoin price, expectations continue to falter, especially as the price remains low with resistance mounting at $0.2. To reach the $1 mark, the price would have to rally by 500% from its current level, and with trading volumes and interest so low, the possibility of this happening grows dimmer by the day. In the same vein, the algorithm at CoinCodex has also followed the bearish school of thought, with a drawn-out timeframe for when it expects the Dogecoin price to hit $1. According to the algorithm, the Dogecoin price will not be hitting the $1 level in the year 2025, or anytime soon after that. The predictions show that the highest level the Dogecoin price could reach this year is $0.289. As the year moves forward, it expects the price to trend lower , not seeing more than a 54% price increase after the month of September. Nevertheless, it does expect the price to be higher than where it is now, with an average 25% increase from the current level. It also signals the current level as a buy point with the possibility of making around a 35% increase in the month of June. DOGE Won’t Hit $1 Until After 2030 The longer-term predictions for the Dogecoin price show more recovery for the price. But reaching the $1 level is not something that the algorithm believes will happen in the next half a decade. In fact, from 2025 through to 2030, it predicts that the Dogecoin price will not rise to its current all-time high of $0.74. For those waiting for the Dogecoin price to hit $1, it shows that the price will hit this level sometime after 2030, putting it above $1 in 2040. This could mean that the meme coin would take almost a decade to reach the coveted $1 target. However, in the short term, the algorithm does see some positive prospects for the Dogecoin price. It predicts that DOGE will rise to $0.236 in the next month, which would be a 17.67% increase from the current level.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-hit-1-in-2025/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt",cryptocompare

Despite this, Bitcoin, with its mature market presence, may not offer the explosive growth potential that newer cryptocurrencies like XYZVerse promise. During a recent analysis session with ChatGPT, the AI highlighted the different trajectories between Bitcoin and XYZVerse. ""Bitcoin shows strength and could soon reach $110,000, yet for those seeking extraordinary gains, XYZVerse presents a compelling case with its early momentum and strategic market positioning,"" explained ChatGPT. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin's Gradual Rise vs. XYZVerse's Potential Explosion Bitcoin's journey through the next decade could see it reach up to $150,000 by 2030, with conservative growth backed by steady demand and institutional investment. However, this trajectory offers a relatively modest return compared to high-flying meme tokens. On the other hand, XYZVerse starts at a significantly lower market cap, providing a massive growth runway. With just a presale price of $0.003333 and ambitions to climb to $0.10, the potential for early investors is substantial. Moreover, post-launch dynamics could propel the token to even higher valuations, ranging from $0.15 to $0.40 in a short period, thanks to strategic marketing and community-driven initiatives. ChatGPT further elaborated on XYZVerse's appeal, noting its integration in trending sectors like sports betting which could enhance its usability and desirability in the cryptocurrency landscape. According to the insights provided, while Bitcoin remains a secure investment with predictable returns, XYZVerse offers an adventurous alternative with potentially higher rewards, especially for those who engage during its initial offering phase. Investment Outlook: Navigating Through High-Risk Crypto Assets For investors, the choice between Bitcoin and a high-risk asset like XYZVerse depends significantly on their risk appetite and investment strategy. While Bitcoin is suited for those seeking stability and moderate growth, XYZVerse appeals to risk-takers aiming for higher gains through aggressive market movements and a rapidly expanding ecosystem. FAQs regarding the pricing, potential, and practical details of purchasing XYZVerse reveal its current allure and speculative nature. With its presale price setting a low barrier for entry, XYZVerse is not just another meme coin; it's a venture into high-stakes, high-reward crypto investing that could either yield substantial returns or serve as a learning curve for crypto enthusiasts.

2025-06-13T12:53:59,"”Bitcoin Eyes $110K, but I Choose This Hot Meme Token for 10,000% Gains” - ChatGPT","With Bitcoin pushing toward $110,000, the market is heating up and confidence is rising. BTC remains the dominant force, backed by institutional inflows, ETF momentum, and strong technicals. But while Bitcoin offers steady growth, the real upside in this cycle may lie elsewhere. That’s when we turned to ChatGPT for insight. “Bitcoin is strong and could hit $110K soon, but if I were chasing 10,000% gains, I’d go with XYZVerse. It’s a high-upside meme token with early momentum, real utility, and presale entry points that Bitcoin can’t match.” Let's take a closer look at why ChatGPT is backing XYZVerse over BTC when it comes to raw return potential—and what that could mean for investors chasing the next big breakout. Bitcoin Long-Term Price Prediction for 2025–2030 2025 Estimated Range: $85,000 – $110,000 Bitcoin pushes higher post-halving but fails to trigger the explosive rally some expected. ETF flows help support price, but macro uncertainty and limited retail interest keep gains controlled. Price tests $110K but struggles to hold above it for long. 2026 Estimated Range: $80,000 – $100,000 Bitcoin experiences a cooling phase after the 2025 high. Market sentiment weakens, and capital rotates into altcoins and other sectors. BTC remains relatively stable but drifts slightly downward as enthusiasm fades. 2027 Estimated Range: $90,000 – $105,000 A mild recovery emerges, supported by stronger institutional infrastructure and steady global demand. Bitcoin slowly climbs back toward six figures but remains in consolidation mode with low volatility. 2028 Estimated Range: $100,000 – $120,000 The next halving renews interest, and supply shock begins to tighten availability again. Price gradually increases, but there is no parabolic move. Investors remain cautious, keeping Bitcoin's growth slow and steady. 2029 Estimated Range: $110,000 – $130,000 Bitcoin maintains a modest upward trend. Adoption by corporations and cross-border finance use cases improve sentiment. Regulatory clarity in major markets supports broader participation, but price action stays moderate. 2030 Estimated Range: $125,000 – $150,000 Bitcoin matures into a globally recognized digital asset, acting more like a reserve commodity than a growth play. Gains are slow but consistent. The market treats BTC as a long-term hedge rather than a speculative tool. XYZVerse vs. Bitcoin: Where the Real Upside Lies Bitcoin may be eyeing $110K, but at this stage in its cycle, BTC is increasingly seen as a stability play—not a growth asset. While its potential gains between 2025 and 2030 could be in the 1.5x–2x range, meme coins like XYZVerse offer far more dramatic upside, especially for early investors entering during the presale phase. Unlike Bitcoin, which already commands a trillion-dollar market cap, XYZVerse is starting from a low base with massive growth potential. At a presale price of just $0.003333, and with an internal target of $0.10, the project is aiming for a 30x return—and that’s just the conservative estimate. If post-launch demand mirrors what we’ve seen with tokens like PEPE, WIF, or BONK, XYZVerse could surge even higher. Realistically, early listings combined with sports-driven marketing could push XYZ to $0.15–$0.25 in the first few weeks, delivering 45x–75x returns for early buyers. Over a 6–12 month window, with major exchange listings and strong ecosystem expansion, a longer-term target of $0.40 isn’t out of the question—marking a potential 100x move from current levels. Bitcoin may be the safer bet, but XYZVerse is built for aggressive growth. With deflationary tokenomics, influencer-driven momentum, and gamified utility in the sports betting niche, it appeals directly to the meme coin crowd chasing the next viral breakout. For those looking at crypto through the lens of high-risk, high-reward investing, XYZVerse isn’t just an alternative to BTC—it’s an opportunity that Bitcoin can no longer offer. Bottom Line Bitcoin remains a cornerstone of the crypto market, offering long-term stability, institutional backing, and slow, steady growth. But for investors hunting exponential returns, it’s no longer the main event. XYZVerse , with its low market entry, sports-integrated utility, and viral meme appeal, represents the kind of high-upside opportunity that defined early Bitcoin cycles—only compressed into a much shorter time frame. If Bitcoin is where capital goes to stay safe, XYZVerse is where capital goes to multiply. For those willing to take on risk in exchange for the chance at 30x, 50x, or even 100x gains, XYZVerse may be the breakout story of this bull run—and the kind of move BTC simply can't match anymore. Frequently Asked Questions What is the current price of XYZVerse, and how high could it go? XYZVerse is currently priced at $0.003333 in presale. The project’s initial target is $0.10 (around 30x), but based on market trends and token hype, it could potentially reach $0.25–$0.40 in the first year—translating to 75x–100x gains. Is XYZVerse just another meme coin, or does it offer real utility? XYZVerse stands out by combining meme coin culture with real-world sports utility. It’s integrated with sportsbook platforms and includes gamified, play-to-earn features. The project also uses deflationary tokenomics and community incentives to support long-term value. How does Bitcoin’s projected growth compare? Bitcoin is expected to gradually rise from current levels to $125K–$150K by 2030, based on macro trends, adoption, and ETF flows. This reflects a conservative 1.5x to 2x return over several years—solid, but far more limited than the early-stage opportunity XYZVerse presents. Can XYZVerse really deliver 10,000% gains? While nothing is guaranteed, meme coins with strong branding, viral marketing, and smart tokenomics have reached similar or greater multiples before. If XYZVerse secures major listings and sustains demand, a 100x gain (10,000%) from presale levels is within the realm of possibility. How can I buy XYZVerse? XYZVerse is available through its official presale site. You can purchase using crypto (USDT, ETH, BNB, etc.) or via Visa/Mastercard. After the presale, it is expected to list on centralized and decentralized exchanges. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-13T12:50:44,"Japan Bitcoin: Strategic Move as Remixpoint Boosts Bitcoin Investment","BitcoinWorld Japan Bitcoin: Strategic Move as Remixpoint Boosts Bitcoin Investment In a significant move within the Asian cryptocurrency market, Japanese energy consulting firm Remixpoint has once again expanded its digital asset reserves. The company announced on June 12th its acquisition of an additional 55.68 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at 887.3 million yen, approximately $6.2 million at the time of purchase. This latest transaction underscores a growing trend among corporations to integrate digital assets into their balance sheets and highlights the increasing relevance of Remixpoint Bitcoin holdings within their overall corporate strategy. This recent purchase isn’t a first for Remixpoint. The company has been steadily accumulating Bitcoin, and this acquisition brings their total reported holdings to around 981.39 BTC. For a company primarily known for energy consulting, this substantial digital asset portfolio is noteworthy and positions them as a significant player in the Japan Bitcoin landscape. Why are Companies Making a Bold Bitcoin Investment ? The decision by a company like Remixpoint to make a substantial Bitcoin Investment might seem unconventional at first glance, especially for one rooted in traditional sectors like energy consulting. However, a deeper look reveals several strategic motivations driving corporate Bitcoin adoption: Inflation Hedge: With global economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, companies are seeking assets that can potentially preserve or grow value over time. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ is seen by some as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation due to its capped supply. Store of Value: Beyond inflation, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, immutable store of value that is not tied to any single government or financial institution. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury provides diversification away from traditional assets like cash and bonds, potentially reducing portfolio risk. Potential Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, attracting investors looking for capital appreciation. Alignment with Business (especially for Remixpoint): As we’ll explore, Remixpoint operates a cryptocurrency exchange, making a Bitcoin Investment strategically aligned with their core business interests in the digital asset space. These factors collectively contribute to the increasing trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, viewing it as a strategic asset for the future. Diving Deeper into the Remixpoint Bitcoin Strategy Remixpoint’s business operations are more diverse than just energy consulting. Crucially, the company is the parent entity of BITPoint Japan, a licensed cryptocurrency exchange. This subsidiary provides essential context for understanding the company’s approach to accumulating Remixpoint Bitcoin. Operating a crypto exchange means Remixpoint is inherently involved in the digital asset ecosystem. Holding a significant amount of Bitcoin can serve multiple purposes related to their exchange business: Liquidity: While not explicitly stated, holding reserves can potentially aid in managing liquidity for exchange operations, although this is typically handled differently. Balance Sheet Strength: A valuable asset like Bitcoin on the balance sheet can strengthen the company’s financial position. Investor Confidence: For investors interested in their crypto subsidiary, a strong Remixpoint Bitcoin holding signals confidence in the asset class they facilitate trading for. Treasury Management: It acts as a form of corporate treasury management, allocating capital to a non-traditional, potentially high-growth asset. The accumulation of nearly 1000 BTC demonstrates a long-term commitment to digital assets as part of Remixpoint’s corporate treasury strategy, closely tied to their operations in the cryptocurrency sector via BITPoint Japan. What Does This Signal for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption ? Remixpoint’s latest purchase is another data point in the ongoing narrative of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . While companies like MicroStrategy have become synonymous with large-scale corporate Bitcoin holdings, moves by other listed companies, especially outside the traditional finance sector (though Remixpoint has a foot in crypto via BITPoint), are significant indicators. This acquisition by a Japanese listed company suggests that the trend of integrating Bitcoin into corporate balance sheets is gaining traction globally, extending beyond the early adopters in North America. It signals to other institutions, both in Japan and internationally, that holding Bitcoin is becoming a more accepted and potentially strategic financial decision. The continuous flow of news regarding companies increasing their Bitcoin reserves reinforces the idea that digital assets are maturing and being considered seriously by corporate treasurers and investment committees as a legitimate asset class for long-term holding, contributing to the broader trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . The Broader Landscape of Japan Bitcoin Japan has a unique relationship with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It was one of the first countries to establish a clear regulatory framework for exchanges, recognizing Bitcoin as a legal property. This environment has fostered a relatively mature crypto market with several licensed exchanges, including Remixpoint’s BITPoint Japan. The news of Remixpoint’s purchase fits into the broader context of the Japan Bitcoin market, which is characterized by: Clear Regulation: Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) oversees cryptocurrency exchanges, providing a level of legitimacy and security for investors. Active Retail Market: Japan has a strong base of retail crypto traders. Growing Institutional Interest: While perhaps not as vocal as in the US, institutional players in Japan, including banks and investment firms, have been exploring crypto-related services and investments. Corporate Involvement: Remixpoint’s move highlights that corporate treasury allocation into Bitcoin is occurring within Japan, adding another dimension to the Japan Bitcoin story. Remixpoint’s significant holding positions them as one of the notable listed companies in Japan with substantial direct exposure to Bitcoin, potentially influencing how other Japanese corporations view the asset class. Key Takeaways from This Important Cryptocurrency News Japan This latest piece of Cryptocurrency News Japan offers several key insights for anyone following the digital asset space or corporate investment trends: Continued Corporate Confidence: Remixpoint’s repeated purchases demonstrate ongoing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, despite market volatility. Strategic Alignment: For companies with existing ties to the crypto industry (like Remixpoint with BITPoint), holding Bitcoin can be a logical strategic move that aligns their balance sheet with their operations. Japan’s Role: The purchase reinforces Japan’s position as a significant market for cryptocurrency activities, with domestic companies actively participating. Sign of Maturation: Each instance of a listed company adding Bitcoin to its treasury contributes to the overall narrative of Bitcoin maturing as an asset class suitable for corporate holdings. While the exact reasons and future plans for Remixpoint’s Bitcoin holdings are best understood by the company itself, their actions provide valuable signals about the evolving relationship between traditional businesses and digital assets in major economies like Japan. Investors and market observers should continue to monitor such corporate moves as they can influence market sentiment and potentially pave the way for further institutional involvement, shaping the future of Cryptocurrency News Japan and globally. Conclusion: Remixpoint’s recent acquisition of an additional 55.68 BTC is more than just a transaction; it’s a strategic statement. It highlights the increasing comfort level of listed companies, particularly those with existing ties to the digital asset ecosystem, in allocating significant capital to Bitcoin. As Institutional Bitcoin Adoption continues to unfold globally, driven by various economic and strategic factors, moves like Remixpoint’s in the Japan Bitcoin market serve as compelling examples of this trend in action. It underscores Bitcoin’s growing role not just as a speculative asset, but as a potential long-term treasury reserve for forward-thinking corporations.

2025-06-13T12:47:23,"Is the crypto bull run still possible after Israel bombed Iran?","Crypto prices crashed Thursday evening as investors embraced a risk-off sentiment following Israel’s attack on Iran’s nuclear sites, which could trigger a wider conflict in the region. Bitcoin ( BTC ) plunged below $105,000, while the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap fell to $3.26 trillion. The 24-hour liquidations jumped by 252% to over $1.15 billion, with 247,950 traders being liquidated. Most altcoins performed worse than Bitcoin. SPX6900 (SPX) token plunged by 20%, while Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), Celestia ( TIA ), and Bonk ( BONK ) fell by over 15%. The stock market also declined, with futures tied to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 falling by over 1%. Is the crypto bull run still possible? Israel’s attack on Iran’s nuclear sites will have some impact on the crypto market. In addition to triggering fear among investors, a prolonged war could push crude oil prices higher over time. Brent and West Texas Intermediate benchmarks rose by over 10% on Friday. Higher crude oil prices could make inflation stickier and push the Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates higher for longer, affecting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. However, a look at past “black swan” events shows that Bitcoin and other altcoins tend to recover after the initial knee-jerk reaction. For example, Bitcoin plunged to a multi-month low of $74,488 in April after Donald Trump delivered his “ Liberation Day ” speech, in which he announced retaliatory tariffs. Bitcoin then surged to a record high of $111,928 two months later. Similarly, Bitcoin dropped from $10,480 to $3,948 in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic began. It then surged a few months later and peaked at $68,897 in November 2021. Bitcoin and other altcoins fell to $34,000 when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, then bounced back to nearly $48,000 a month later. Therefore, there is a likelihood that Bitcoin and other altcoins will bounce back as the current fear subsides. You might also like: USD1 stablecoin launches on TRON amid major governance update Bitcoin fundamentals and technicals The main reason why the crypto bull run may continue is that Bitcoin, which influences the industry, has strong fundamentals and technicals. Fundamentally, demand is rising as ETF inflows grow, with BlackRock’s IBIT now holding over $72 billion in assets. Companies like Trump Media, GameStop, Strategy, and MetaPlanet are accumulating the coin. This demand is soaring as supply on exchanges and over-the-counter venues has plunged. Santiment data shows that supply on centralized exchanges has dropped to 1.2 million, down from 1.5 million in January. Bitcoin supply on exchanges and funding rate | Source: Santiment As the chart above shows, Bitcoin’s funding rate has also surged — a sign that market participants expect it to bounce back. Further, as crypto.news wrote here , this pullback is part of Bitcoin’s handle in the cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern often results in a strong bullish breakout, with Bitcoin’s target projected above $140,000.

2025-06-13T12:45:34,"French legislators present bill to curb kidnaps targeting crypto millionaires","A new bill meant to improve the personal security of French crypto entrepreneurs, targeted in a string of recent kidnapping attacks, has been drafted and filed in Paris. The legislative initiative coincides with ongoing arrests of suspects in multiple cases that are still under investigation, while authorities are working hard to end the wave of violence that shook France and its crypto space this year. French officials scramble to deal with daring kidnappings The series of kidnapping attempts on crypto figures and their close ones over the past few months, including a Ledger co-founder and his partner, has spurred the French society to elaborate measures to ensure their lives and security are sufficiently protected in the face of the still-present threat. Reacting to the criminal phenomenon, officials are now taking concrete steps to strengthen the confidentiality of the personal details of these executives and their families, while trying to maintain balance between security and transparency, the French crypto news outlet Journal du Coin noted. One of the proposals pitched in the public space in response to calls from corporate circles has been gaining support among politicians in Paris. The idea is to remove the addresses of owners and managers of crypto firms from official trade registers. According to the French financial daily Les Echos, the kidnappers may have used the files to identify the places of residence of their victims. On June 11, French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin announced a new decree to swiftly implement the demanded change. Translated post of French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin urging the removal of the addresses of owners and managers of crypto firms from official trade registers. Source: Gérald Darmanin (X/Twitter) New law to preserve the privacy of crypto businessmen Also on Thursday, French lawmaker Paul Midy from the center-right Renaissance party submitted a bill designed to protect the privacy of business leaders by deleting their personal addresses from the publicly available company records. Unlike previous proposals in the same direction, which envisaged removal of the sensitive information upon request and on a voluntary basis, this piece of legislation suggests automating the process, La Tribune explained in an article . Following consultations with industry members, Midy wants to restrict access to the data that is currently freely accessible on online platforms aggregating information from official registers, the business weekly detailed. The provisions concern all business officials in general, but especially those whose personal residence also serves as their corporate address, as is often the case with startups and their owners, particularly those active in the crypto market. The law will oblige the operators of official databases, like Inpi, Infogreffe, and Insee, to share with private platforms, such as Société.com, Pappers, and SociétéInfo, only documents in which personal addresses have been redacted. French authorities are yet to explain the sudden spike in crypto kidnappings, including that of David Balland, co-founder of the crypto wallet firm Ledger, and the attempted abduction of the daughter and grandson of crypto exchange Paymium’s CEO. Eric Larchevêque, business partner of Balland, who had a finger cut off while in captivity, took to X to urge the government to “stop the Mexicanisation of France,” criticizing what he described as the “laxity” of French law enforcement. Halte à la mexicanisation de la France. Depuis plusieurs mois, les affaires sordides d’enlèvements et de tentatives d’enlèvement se multiplient. En plein jour. En plein Paris. Sous les yeux de tous.

This week, France 24 reported that the French police have detained more people over last month’s kidnapping for ransom of a crypto entrepreneur’s father. Prompted by the spate of brazen attacks, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau summoned crypto bosses in mid-May to discuss their security, emphasizing on the need for taking joint measures to protect them and their families.

As Bitcoin edges toward $110k, a new contender, XYZVerse, is drawing attention for its blend of sports fandom and memecoin momentum. Table of Contents XYZ claims G.O.A.T. status: Early investors eye massive returns Bitcoin continues to climb Conclusion As Bitcoin aims for a staggering $110,000, investors are watching closely.

The following article explores the prospects of XYZVerse and why it might outshine even Bitcoin’s impressive rally. XYZ claims G.O.A.T. status: Early investors eye massive returns XYZVerse (XYZ) is redefining the memecoin space by merging the passion of sports fandom with the explosive world of crypto. Tailored for die-hard fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, XYZVerse is more than just a token, it’s a movement built around the spirit of competition and community. With its bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZ is rising far above the typical memecoin hype. Its momentum hasn’t gone unnoticed, XYZVerse was recently crowned Best New Meme Project, solidifying its status as a top contender. What makes XYZ stand out? It’s not a fleeting meme, it’s a fully backed project with a committed community and a long-term roadmap designed for real growth. Fueled by the grit and intensity of the sports world, XYZ is charging ahead as the champion-in-the-making.

Early investors are locking in prime prices before the final push. You might also like: Analysts say XYZVerse beats Shiba Inu for new investors Bitcoin continues to climb Source: TradingView Bitcoin ( BTC ) has shown steady growth over the past six months. Its price has increased by 5.89% in that period. In the last month, Bitcoin rose by 4.48%, and over the past week, it gained 2.47%. Currently, Bitcoin trades between $101,837 and $108,318. Technical indicators suggest Bitcoin might rise further. The Relative Strength Index is at 28.41, which means the coin is oversold. The Stochastic oscillator is at 8.47, also indicating oversold conditions. When assets are oversold, they often rebound. The MACD level is negative at -459.49, but may reverse if momentum improves. Bitcoin’s nearest resistance level is at $110,851. If it breaks this level, it could reach the second resistance at $117,332. That would be gains of about 6% and 13% from current prices. On the downside, support levels are at $97,889 and $91,408. These levels could limit losses to around 4% and 10%. The price is close to the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, suggesting potential for upward movement. Conclusion Bitcoin targets $110k in the bull run, but XYZVerse’s unique sports memecoin and community focus could offer even greater growth potential.

2025-06-13T12:30:53,"Institutional Appetite Grows as Bitcoin ETFs Rebound with $1.07B in 4 Days","Bitcoin’s institutional narrative looks to be back on track, with spot BTC ETFs attracting more than $1 billion in fresh capital against a backdrop of significant market upheavals triggered by Middle East tensions. On-chain data shows a four-day inflow streak into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, decisively reversing a brief period of outflows and signaling strong institutional appetite. Over $1B in Four Days According to the market intelligence platform Santiment, between June 9 and June 11, the BTC-backed financial instruments raked in north of $970 million . Data from the crypto investment research website SoSoValue corroborated this, revealing that spot Bitcoin ETFs flipped from notable outflows late last week to four straight days of positive inflows. The reversal started on Monday this week, when the ETFs absorbed $386.27 million, followed by a much heftier $431.12 million on Tuesday. This coincided with the news that BlackRock’s IBIT had shattered records by becoming the fastest exchange-traded fund to reach $70 billion in assets under management (AUM), having done it in just 341 days. Flows stayed positive on Wednesday, with an additional $164.57 million entering the regulated BTC investment products. Thursday’s more modest $86.31 million brought the four-day total inflow to $1.07 billion. The surge effectively erased the $278.44 million and $47.82 million in outflows recorded on June 5 and June 6, respectively, pushing cumulative net inflows for all spot Bitcoin ETFs to $45.31 billion and total net assets to $130.26 billion as of June 12. Bitcoin Stumbles Amid Middle East Flare-Up Interestingly, the bullish flows arrived during a sharp market shakeup. On June 13, details emerged, confirming Israel’s missile strike on Iranian nuclear sites, triggering fears of wider conflict in the Middle East. The immediate fallout wiped out more than $190 billion in total crypto market capitalization. Bitcoin alone tumbled from an intraday high of $108,369 to a low of $103,081 within hours. It has since clawed back slightly to about $103,971, but was still down 3.6% over 24 hours at the time of this writing. Despite the turmoil, BTC remains 1% higher than a week ago, edging out a global crypto market that dipped 0.6% over the same period. Still, there are signs the king cryptocurrency’s crown may soon face a challenge. Spot Ethereum ETFs have now posted 19 straight days of net inflows, even overtaking Bitcoin for the first time with a record $240 million in daily net additions on June 11. According to some market watchers, this flip may hint at a subtle shift in investor preference as traders diversify into Ethereum following growing regulatory optimism regarding decentralized finance (DeFi) and clarity around ETH’s classification.
