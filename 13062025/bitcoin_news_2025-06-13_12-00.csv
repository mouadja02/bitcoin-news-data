This comes after the court rejected the original proposal on June 4. In response, Zettai filed a formal request on June 6 under case HC/SUM 940/2025 seeking “further arguments,” as confirmed by WazirX on X (formerly Twitter). Update on Proposed Scheme of Arrangement As we shared last week, the Singapore Court has declined Zettai’s application in HC/SUM 940/2025 (“SUM 940”) for the Court’s sanction of Zettai’s proposed Scheme. While we understand this news may bring disappointment to our… pic.twitter.com/fvF5Skl002 — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) June 13, 2025 Hope for 4.4 Million WazirX Users? If the High Court accepts the restructuring plan, Zettai may be required to file a new submission and attend further hearings. The company has been under pressure since WazirX’s hack on July 18, 2024, in which over ₹2,000 crore vanished, leaving 4.4 million users in limbo with no access to their funds. However, the delay in court proceedings has left users frustrated, and if the proposal is not approved, Zettai’s only option will be a longer and more complex appeal process. Silence From WazirX Founder Nischal Shetty Throughout the legal proceedings, WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty has remained noticeably silent. While he has acknowledged the legal case, he has not issued a public apology to affected users nor shared any repayment plans. Despite the ongoing crisis, no refunds have been initiated, and no user funds have been recovered. Shetty Focuses on Shardeum Despite WazirX Collapse Amid WazirX’s ongoing troubles, Shetty appears to be focusing on Shardeum, his new Layer 1 blockchain venture. This week, Shardeum Foundation announced MiCA whitepaper acknowledgment, allowing operations in Europe—an achievement promoted by Shetty on social media. Although Shetty has distanced himself from WazirX publicly, Shardeum is still mentioned in his X bio, raising questions about his true involvement in both ventures. What’s Next for WazirX? Zettai has submitted two proposals so far—both rejected by the Singapore High Court. With June 20 approaching, the crypto community is anxiously awaiting the court’s final verdict. If rejected again, Zettai is expected to file an appeal, but there is no official roadmap for repayment or resolution. Final Thoughts With millions in user funds at stake, the crypto world will be watching closely as Singapore’s High Court delivers its decision on June 20. For now, WazirX users remain in the dark, holding onto hope for a favorable outcome.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/wazirx-news-singapore-court-to-decide-fate-of-user-funds-by-june-20/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T09:58:15,"Ethereum Whale Snaps Up $127M in ETH Amid Market Panic","A deep-pocketed Ethereum whale is defying the current crypto bloodbath, scooping up tens of thousands of ETH while panic grips the broader market. On June 13, blockchain tracking account Lookonchain revealed on X that the mysterious trader bought 48,825 ETH, worth approximately $127 million, from Coinbase and Wintermute, over an eight-hour period at an average price of $2,605 per coin. Opportunity in Turmoil This fresh accumulation came amid a brutal market rout sparked by reports of Israeli missile strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The preemptive move sent shockwaves through equities, commodities, and, most notably, digital assets, with more than $190 billion in crypto market value evaporating within hours, driving the price of Bitcoin (BTC) down nearly 5% to $103,000. Ethereum also suffered a similar fate, plunging from $2,760 to a low of $2,470, to erase gains from its recent surge to a 15-week high of $2,830 just days prior. Currently, ETH is trading at about $2,520, down 8.6% in the last 24 hours. Still, it added an extra 2.3% over seven days, outpacing the broader crypto market’s rather measly 0.1% gain in that time. Yet while retail traders fled for the exits, liquidating more than $1 billion in leveraged positions, this veteran whale saw an opportunity. And it isn’t their first strategic move: Lookonchain’s earlier posts traced their footsteps back to late April. On April 27, the entity bought 600 BTC and 30,000 ETH, with the latter costing just under $55 million. Weeks later, on May 22, they sold that ETH at $2,621 each, netting about $23.73 million in profit. Undeterred by volatility, they plunged back in on May 26, acquiring another 30,000 ETH for $75.39 million at $2,513 per coin. That batch was sold just three days ago on June 10 for $82.76 million, securing a further $7.3 million gain. Today’s $127 million buy marks the whale’s largest single accumulation spree yet, executed as retail traders jettisoned their holdings. Confidence in a Rebound? The move appears to be a calculated gamble that the recent plunge in ETH’s value is an overreaction. The whale often leverages OTC desks for discreet, large-scale moves, avoiding slippage and market impact, a luxury unavailable to retail. Their proven track record of buying fear and selling into strength suggests they may view the dip below key technical and psychological support as a prime accumulation zone, betting on Ethereum’s strong fundamental backdrop, including sustained ETF inflows , a supportive U.S. regulatory shift , as well as Vitalik Buterin’s recently unveiled scaling roadmap updates.

2025-06-13T09:38:40,"Gary Gensler’s Crypto Crackdown Ends: Trump’s SEC Scraps 14 Rules","The post Gary Gensler’s Crypto Crackdown Ends: Trump’s SEC Scraps 14 Rules appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Donald Trump’s return to power is already sending shockwaves through the crypto industry — but this time, in a good way. After promising pro-crypto reforms during his campaign, Trump has now followed through. His administration has officially rolled back at least 14 controversial crypto rules introduced under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler — signaling what many believe is the start of a new deregulatory era for crypto in the U.S. US SEC Under Paul Atkins Withdraws 14 Gensler-Era Crypto Rules In a major move aligning with President Trump’s pro-crypto and deregulatory agenda, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now led by crypto-friendly Chair Paul S. Atkins , has withdrawn multiple rules that were considered harmful to digital asset innovation. Most of these policies, introduced between March 2022 and November 2023 during Gensler’s tenure, were seen as overreaching and restrictive. Why These Withdrawals Matter The previous Biden administration maintained a conservative and skeptical stance toward crypto. Gensler’s SEC took an aggressive regulatory approach that many in the industry labeled as hostile — targeting DeFi platforms, custodians, crypto derivatives, and more. Trump vowed to dismantle these roadblocks. Now, he’s making good on that promise. Top Gensler-Era Rules Now Scrapped Here are the key rules that have been rolled back , bringing relief to the crypto industry: Rule 3b-16 — DeFi in the Crosshairs Would have expanded the definition of “exchange” to include DeFi protocols and platforms facilitating communication between buyers and sellers. Its withdrawal is seen as a win for decentralized finance. Qualified Custodian Rule Would have restricted crypto custody to traditional financial institutions like banks or broker-dealers. This would’ve effectively excluded most crypto-native exchanges and wallet providers. Cybersecurity & Risk Management Rules Aimed at investment advisers and funds, including those handling crypto. Would have imposed stricter cybersecurity frameworks and regular incident disclosures. Large Swap Position Reporting Required firms dealing in crypto-related swaps to report detailed position data. Many crypto funds saw this as onerous and unnecessary. ESG Reporting Mandate Would have forced public companies to disclose extensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics. Critics argued it added non-crypto-related burdens that hinder innovation. Coinbase and Industry Leaders Celebrate Crypto leaders quickly voiced support. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal cheered the move on X, posting: “Down goes 3b-16, qualified custodian, and all the other unfinished Gensler rule proposals.” The sentiment is shared across the crypto industry, as many view this as a turning point for regulatory clarity in the U.S. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. May Issue Crypto Bonds Backed by Bitcoin and XRP, Says Ex-CFTC Chair , What’s Next for US Crypto Regulation? Although these Gensler-era rules are now off the table, the SEC under Atkins may propose new, industry-friendly regulations in the future — but only after open consultation with stakeholders. For now, the message is clear: Crypto has a seat at the table under Trump’s administration, and unnecessary barriers are being dismantled. Bottom Line With Gensler’s policies getting tossed and pro-crypto voices leading the charge, this moment could mark the true beginning of America’s crypto renaissance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-13T09:30:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price surpass previous ATH?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces minor recovery toward $0.63. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious. In this outlook, we’ll assess how Pi’s price has responded to recent events and provide an informative Pi network price prediction model from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.546 Price Change 24h -12% Market Cap $4.1 Circulating Supply 7.44B PI Trading Volume 24h $217.6M All-Time High $2.98 (Feb 26, 2025) All-Time Low $0.4012 (Apr 05, 2025) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.546 Price Prediction $ 0.477123 (-25.39%) Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 22.32% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 41.98 Pi Price Analysis PI Network dropped over 11% in 24 hours, signalling strong bearish pressure. The RSI fell to 31.92, nearing oversold territory and indicating weak buying momentum. The MACD histogram below zero shows bearish momentum with no reversal signal. As of June 13 2025, PI Network faces support near the $0.50 level, where the price briefly bounced off after a sharp decline. This zone could attract buyers looking for a short-term entry. The resistance is at around $0.60, a level previously broken during the recent decline. For any bullish recovery, the price has to break and hold above this resistance area. Pi 1-day chart shows price fall as selling pressure grows Pi Network’s price dropped to $0.5460, losing over 11% in 24 hours. This decline shows strong selling pressure dominating the market. The MACD indicator is in negative territory, with a wide gap between the MACD and signal lines. This suggests bearish momentum is gaining strength with no signs of slowing. The RSI is at 31.92, approaching the oversold zone below 30. This reflects weak buyer interest and a possible continuation of the downward trend unless reversal signals emerge. Pi/Usdt Price Chart Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart The Pi/USDT 4-hour chart reveals bearish pressure as the price dropped by 3.05%, closing at $0.5461. During the session, the price touched a low of $0.5430, showing sellers remain in control. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 14.32, which is in the oversold zone, indicating extreme selling conditions and weak buyer activity. Pi/Usdt Price Chart The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) supports the downtrend, with the MACD line at -0.0136 and the signal line at -0.0048. The growing gap between these lines, along with deep red histogram bars, confirms that bearish momentum is still strong.

Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Is Pi A Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi Price Down Today? Pi Coin is down today due to growing investor exits, as shown by large exchange inflows and insufficient demand to support price stability. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to achieve $10 by 2033.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction it was still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 in over-the-counter or sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. April 2025 Pi network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. May 2025 , the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare

""Trump's Support Won't Make It Easier!""","While US President Donald Trump and his administration have come to the fore with their support for Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies, there has also been a softening in important institutions such as the SEC. While the CFTC is expected to be among these institutions, interim CFTC Chair Caroline Pham made important statements. Pham said the agency will maintain tight control over the cryptocurrency industry despite the Trump administration's support. CFTC interim chairman Pham emphasized that the Trump administration’s cryptocurrency policy does not mean unconditional regulatory ease. Speaking at the Coinbase Summit, Caroline Pham said the agency will not ease its oversight of cryptocurrencies amid the Trump administration’s promise to support the industry. “There is no easy path for anyone and it is not easy for regulators either. Just because we are for innovation and growth doesn't mean you can break the law with impunity. And I'm not talking about twisting the law to criminalize an asset class or technology, I'm talking about lying, cheating and stealing.” Stating that fraud and theft will not be tolerated in the crypto industry at this point, Pham stated that the CFTC has ended its “regulation through enforcement” approach and shifted its focus to fraud and scams. Caroline Pham also recently criticized previous crypto policies under the Joe Biden administration. “Biden’s past laws and regulations have not only harmed cryptocurrencies but also the current derivatives market,” Pham said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T09:18:56,"Chart Decoder Series: Bollinger Bands – How to Trade Volatility Like a Pro","Welcome back to the Chart Decoder Series, where we break down technical charting tools Bitfinex offers. So far, we’ve covered: Moving Averages (SMA & EMA) to spot trends and momentum Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought or oversold zones Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for timing entries and exits with trend shifts Now let’s dive into Bollinger Bands , a flexible tool that helps traders read volatility and spot extremes in price. What Are Bollinger Bands? Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: Middle Band : A 20-period simple moving average (SMA) Upper Band : The SMA + 2 standard deviations Lower Band : The SMA – 2 standard deviations They stretch and contract based on market volatility. When the bands are far apart: high volatility When they’re tight: low volatility (and often a big move is coming) How to Use It: Price exceeds the Upper Band This often signals overbought conditions. A short-term pullback or reversal may follow, though strong momentum can drive further gains. Price dips below the Lower Band This may indicate oversold conditions. A bounce is possible, but it’s best confirmed with additional indicators like RSI or volume. Price moves closely along the Upper Band Known as “walking the band,” this usually reflects a strong trend. While it can persist, traders should watch closely for fading momentum. Bands contract significantly A squeeze suggests the market is in a low-volatility phase. These periods often precede sharp breakouts in either direction. Bands begin to widen Indicates rising volatility. The market may be transitioning into a more active phase with larger price swings. Example in Action: Let’s break down what we’re seeing on a 1-hour BTC/USD chart on Bitfinex, using Bollinger Bands (BB 20, 2) as your main indicator. Current price: 105100 Middle Bollinger Band (20 SMA): 104978 Upper Band: 105619 Lower Band: 104337 In this example, BTC is sitting just above the Middle Band, showing tentative signs of strength. This is often a neutral-to-bullish zone, where price is deciding whether it wants to make a move or hang out sideways for a while longer. What’s interesting is that the Bollinger Bands were wider earlier , reflecting some sharp moves (clearly seen from the recent dips and spikes). But now they’re starting to contract , hinting that the market could be entering a consolidation phase . What Could Happen Next? Bullish Scenario: If BTC can hold above the Middle Band and we see a few strong candles push higher, a test of the Upper Band (~105619) is likely. A clean break above it could signal an incoming breakout (keep an eye on volume). If the price climbs without strong participation, it may just be a fake-out. Bearish Scenario: If BTC slides back below the Middle Band and volume picks up on red candles, we could revisit the Lower Band (~104337) pretty quickly. This would keep BTC in a short-term downtrend channel. Sideways Drift: The most probable scenario for now: consolidation. The slight tightening of the Bands suggests reduced volatility, meaning BTC might just range between the Middle and Upper/Lower bands while traders wait for a macro catalyst. Bollinger Bands work best when used with confirming indicators . If you’re serious about catching breakouts or reversals with more confidence, try pairing this with: RSI for overbought/oversold confirmation Volume for strength validation Candlestick patterns near the bands for entry signals BTC/USD Update with RSI + Bollinger Bands Current RSI (14): 51.47 This puts us right in the neutral zone between overbought (70) and oversold (30). No clear momentum yet, but… RSI has been slowly climbing out of a recent low and just broke above 50. This can sometimes be seen as a shift in short-term momentum , where bears are losing control and bulls are cautiously stepping in. Right now, the chart says: neutral-to-hopeful. BTC is crawling back from recent lows, with RSI nudging toward bullish territory. Still a waiting game. Pro Tips: Use Bollinger Bands with RSI or MACD to confirm signals Don’t assume every touch of the bands = reversal. Context is key Bollinger Band “squeezes” are often followed by powerful moves Watch for price – band divergence . This is when the price makes a new high but the band doesn’t widen. This could mean the trend is losing strength and a reversal or slowdown may be near.

2025-06-13T09:18:18,"DeFi platform Altitude launches publicly for collateral-optimized lending","Altitude, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on optimizing collateralized lending, has officially opened its vaults to the public, marking the successful conclusion of its private beta phase. This public launch means DeFi users can now access Altitude’s automated strategies designed to efficiently manage their collateral for both lending and borrowing activities, aiming to enhance capital efficiency and simplify the borrowing process. The transition to a public platform follows a fruitful eight-month private beta period, during which whitelisted participants had the opportunity to test and validate Altitude’s capabilities. The protocol performed smoothly during this phase, attracting a Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $5 million. With this proven track record, Altitude is now inviting the broader DeFi community to experience its innovative lending solutions. At its core, Altitude is engineered to support highly efficient management of on-chain borrowing. The platform’s primary goals are to ensure greater capital efficiency for users while diligently preventing loans from becoming under-collateralized, a common risk in the volatile crypto markets. Its user-friendly dashboard provides a clear indication of the health of each loan, based on its Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, and offers intuitive controls for users to adjust their desired parameters. A key differentiator for Altitude is its pioneering approach to automated rebalancing; it is reportedly the first DeFi protocol to automatically rebalance borrowing positions for users based on fluctuations in the price of collateral assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Tackling capital inefficiency and complexity in DeFi lending Traditional on-chain loans often suffer from capital inefficiency. Many DeFi users typically borrow at an LTV of around 40-50%, which means a significant portion of their deposited collateral remains effectively idle, not generating any returns. Altitude aims to address this by actively managing these positions. Initial users of the Altitude beta have praised the platform for the greater capital efficiency it offers, coupled with a significant reduction in the complexity normally associated with managing DeFi loans. This, in turn, frees them to concentrate on yield generation and exploring other opportunities within the decentralized finance ecosystem. Altitude’s automated system works dynamically. When the value of a user’s underlying collateral increases, the platform can borrow against this increased value. The newly borrowed capital is then deployed to generate yield, which is subsequently used to reduce the outstanding loan balance. Conversely, if the value of the collateral decreases, Altitude automatically returns funds to the lending pool to maintain an optimal LTV ratio, safeguarding against liquidation. Furthermore, Altitude’s automated lending and borrowing solution actively identifies preferable lending rates across different protocols and adjusts user positions accordingly, ensuring that users are consistently financed at the most attractive rates available. Strong backing and a vision for effortless DeFi management Altitude’s innovative approach has garnered significant support from the investment community. The platform successfully raised a total of $6.1 million in funding from a roster of leading Web3 venture capital firms, including Tioga Capital, New Form Capital, and GSR. Investors were reportedly impressed by Altitude’s solution, which aims to provide DeFi borrowers with peace of mind while simultaneously enabling them to safely generate the maximum available yield from their assets. With the private beta now successfully concluded, the opening of Altitude’s lending markets to the general public marks a significant next step in its evolution. Through an intuitive user interface, DeFi users can now take greater control of their lending and borrowing activities without the need for constant manual monitoring of their positions. This empowerment allows them to earn attractive yields on their assets, even amidst the ever-changing and often unpredictable conditions of the crypto market. Altitude operates as a decentralized protocol on the Ethereum blockchain, focused on optimizing collateralized lending by ensuring the lowest possible cost of borrowing and generating yield from users’ otherwise dormant collateral through active, real-time management of debt and collateral.

In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 83,300 YouTube subscribers that a price of $190,000 is within the realm of possibility” for Bitcoin this cycle. While $190,000 is the highest price target that Svenson says Bitcoin could reach during this cycle, the analyst says the most likely level the crypto king could reach is around 33% above the current price. “And the middle, the median ideal target is $142,500. That is sort of where you can expect Bitcoin’s price to top out in this cycle.” According to the crypto analyst, a stock market rally could act as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. “The way that I see it, if the S&P 500 can break out into new all-time highs and continue through the all-time high, that would likely allow Bitcoin to run to at least $124,000 and maybe as high as $142,000. So, that is how I see this playing out.” On when Bitcoin could top out during the current cycle, Svenson says, “We’re on the home stretch here. And this might actually run all the way up towards maybe even October… …80 weeks after each halving is usually where the top comes in and where the bear market begins… …which for this cycle lands you at end of October, beginning of November [of this year].” Bitcoin is trading at $107,017 at time of writing.

2025-06-13T09:15:08,"Bitcoin Dips Toward $100K Amid Israel-Iran Conflict, Long Positions Wiped Out","Bitcoin rally toward a new all-time high was abruptly derailed late Thursday after reports of Israeli airstrikes on Tehran sparked broad market panic. The largest cryptocurrency plunged 2.8% within 90 minutes—from $106,042 to a low of $103,053. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin has recovered to $104,900 at the time of writing, down by around 2.5% in the past day. The sudden drop has brought Bitcoin close to the psychological level of $100,000 , triggering mass liquidations. The airstrikes, which hit the Iranian capital at 22:50 UTC, were confirmed shortly after by Israeli officials. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation was aimed at neutralizing Iran’s nuclear threat, and that further strikes could follow. Iran’s response has been swift, with state media reporting the launch of over 100 drones in retaliation. As tensions escalate, risk assets are under pressure, and Bitcoin—despite being touted as a hedge—has reacted sharply in the red. Bitcoin Bullish Sentiment Collides with Geopolitical Reality The timing of the drop was particularly brutal for traders who had positioned themselves for a breakout above Bitcoin’s previous all-time high of $111,940. On Tuesday, just days before the conflict flared, BTC had rallied to $110,265, stoking bullish sentiment . According to data from CoinGlass, more than $427 million in long positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours as the price plunged, leaving many traders nursing heavy losses. However, not all are pessimistic. Bitcoin advocate Anthony Pompliano pointed out that similar market reactions were seen last October when Iran launched hundreds of rockets toward Israel. Back then, BTC initially dropped 3%, only to outperform traditional safe-haven assets like gold and oil within 48 hours. “The initial reaction is always fear,” Pompliano said, “but Bitcoin has a way of bouncing back stronger.” Buy-the-Dip Mentality Returns Meanwhile, both gold and oil have climbed 1.44% and 11% respectively, highlighting a broader flight to safety. Yet some believe BTC’s time to shine could still come. Among those urging calm is Samson Mow of Jan3, who posted a message to GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen encouraging strategic buying. Mow stated, “This is where you buy it when it feels scary. If it dips lower and you feel even more nervous, buy even more.” GameStop recently allocated part of its $1.5 billion raise to purchase 4,710 BTC, worth $513 million at the time.

BTC price plunged to $102,000, and then bounced back above $105,000. Other top altcoins like Bonk, Floki, and Pepe also plunged, with the total market cap of all coins dropping to $3.2 trillion. This article explains why these tokens may bounce back in the coming days. Bitcoin and altcoin crash was a knee-jerk reaction The first main reason why Bitcoin and altcoins like Pepe, Bonk, and Floki may bounce back is that the crash was a knee-jerk reaction or an overreaction. Historically, risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies plunge whenever there are significant black-swan events. A good example of this is when they crashed at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Most of them plunged as investors predicted the “end of the world.” Most recently, Bitcoin and these altcoins plunged when Donald Trump delivered his “ Liberation Day ” speech introducing “reciprocal” tariffs on all countries, including allies and foes. Bitcoin crashed to $74,500 after Trump introduced tariffs, triggering a bigger dive among other altcoins. Another notable event was the crypto market crash that happened in late 2022 following the collapse of FTX. Bitcoin and other altcoins bounced back after that. Bitcoin demand and supply is supportive The other main reason why Bitcoin and other altcoins may bounce back soon is that the demand and supply is supportive. Data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs had net inflows of over $86 million on Friday, bringing the cumulative total to over $45 billion. BlackRock’s IBIT had net inflows of $288 million on Thursday, which was offset by a $197 million outflow from Fidelity’s fund. IBIT now has over $72 billion in inflows, while Fidelity’s FBTC has $21.1 billion, while Ark Invest has $5 billion. Spot Ethereum ETFs are also attracting substantial inflows. They had net inflows of over $112 million on Thursday, with BlackRock’s ETHA having inflows of $101 million. It has brought its net assets to $4.5 billion. These funds have had inflows in the last five consecutive weeks. At the same time, their supply on exchanges have plunged this year. Bitcoin supply on exchanges has dropped to 1.1 million from the year-to-date high of $1.5 million. The supply of Ethereum also continued to fall this year. Therefore, the ongoing demand and supply metrics mean that Bitcoin price will bounce back this year. If this happens, other altcoins like Pepe, Bonk, and Floki will surge. Bitcoin price cup and handle BTC price chart | Source: TradingView The other main reason why Bitcoin price will bounce back in the coming weeks is its strong technicals. The daily chart shows that the coin formed a double-top pattern at $109,200. It then formed a rounded bottom, confirming the cup section of the cup-and-handle pattern, a popular bullish signal. It is now forming the handle section of this pattern. The cup section has a depth of 30%. Measuring the same depth and the upper side of the cup-and-handle pattern gives it a target of $143,000. It has also moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back in the coming days. Such a move will then trigger more gains among altcoins.

2025-06-13T09:09:45,"Sharplink Crash Triggers Confusion Over Ether Treasury Play","This filing increased investor fears despite reassurances from executives that no actual sales occurred. The drop came shortly after Sharplink revealed plans to raise $1 billion to purchase Ethereum as part of its blockchain treasury strategy. GameStop also saw a post-earnings dip as Q1 revenue missed expectations. Despite gaming share drops, there is still interest in gaming companies. Tencent is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Nexon, which recently launched Web3 versions of MapleStory. However, the discussions are still in the early stages, and no formal agreement has been made. Sharplink Crashes as Market Misreads Filing Shares in sports betting platform Sharplink Gaming plummeted by 67% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company's filing to register nearly 58.7 million shares for potential resale. This very clearly caused some concern among investors. The sharp decline followed a 12.25% drop in the stock’s regular trading hours, closing at $32.53 before briefly plunging below $8. It later stabilized somewhat by trading at $10.55. Sharplink Gaming share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) The market reaction was driven by confusion over the nature of the filing. Joseph Lubin, chairman of Sharplink Gaming and CEO of blockchain software company Consensys, took to social media to clarify that the Form S-3 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was standard practice and does not signal that any actual sales of shares took place. He explained that the filing is a procedural step after a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal and does not reflect current or imminent sales. Matt Corva , general counsel at Consensys, shared that the filing merely formalizes details that were already made public two weeks earlier. “It doesn’t reflect anyone’s sales, which may or may not ever happen,” Corva stated. He also mentioned that the filing confirms the previously announced sale of shares to investors, validating the company’s Ethereum-focused treasury strategy. Sharplink revealed on May 30 that it plans to raise up to $1 billion through a stock sale to fund a major Ethereum (ETH) acquisition as part of its new blockchain-based treasury strategy. Despite the clarification, the abrupt drop in share price proved that investors are very cautious of the large resale filings. Charles Allen , CEO of BTCS Inc., talked about the psychological impact such filings can have on shareholders. “This creates a prisoner’s dilemma,” he said, referencing the rush among investors to sell before others do. However, Allen speculated that the situation could turn around quickly if Sharplink follows through on its promise and announces the anticipated $1 billion Ether purchase soon. “If they played cards right,” he suggested, “this could be a brilliantly timed move to reignite investor confidence and the stock’s momentum.” GameStop Shares Slide After Mixed Q1 and Bitcoin Bet GameStop Corp (GME) shares also slipped in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the release of its first-quarter earnings , which painted a mixed picture of operational recovery despite declining revenue. The video game retailer reported $732.4 million in revenue for the quarter ending May 3. This fell short of analyst expectations of $754.2 million and was a 17% year-over-year decline. The company attributed the revenue drop to persistent headwinds in physical game sales. Overview of GameStop’s Q1 performance (Source: GameStop ) Despite the weaker top-line figure, GameStop recorded some improvements in profitability. Net income reached $44.8 million, a turnaround from a net loss of $32.3 million during the same period last year. Operating losses also narrowed to $10.8 million, compared to $50.6 million in Q1 of 2024. Still, the market reacted negatively to the revenue miss, with GME shares dropping more than 3.5% in after-hours trading to just above $29. GameStop share price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) The company’s stock performance has been relatively stagnant over the past month and is down approximately 3.8% year-to-date. This modest decline comes shortly after GameStop entered the world of digital assets by confirming in late May that it purchased 4,710 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at around $513 million at the time. The firm said the Bitcoin acquisition was funded through a $1.3 billion convertible note offering. GameStop has not revealed just how much more Bitcoin it plans to purchase but indicated that it has some flexibility in its strategy. This means that it may sell its holdings if necessary. The company reported a robust $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which is an impressive increase from $1 billion a year ago. This gives it more than enough firepower to expand its Bitcoin reserve in the future. Tencent Explores Nexon Deal Despite the recent gaming stock drops, there is still some interest in gaming companies. Tencent, one of China’s largest tech conglomerates, is reportedly in discussions to acquire South Korean game developer and publisher Nexon, the company behind the popular MapleStory franchise. According to a Bloomberg report , representatives from Tencent reached out to the family of Nexon founder Kim Jung-ju to explore a possible deal. However, the discussions are still in the early stages, and no formal agreement has been made. Nexon has long been a dominant force in the online gaming industry, and MapleStory gained massive popularity in the early 2000s. More recently, Nexon has been active in the Web3 gaming space by launching blockchain-integrated versions of its flagship series. In May of 2025, the company rolled out MapleStory N and MapleStory Universe, both of which allow players to earn and trade in-game items as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Web3 gaming, while still a niche segment in the gaming industry, experienced a dramatic uptick in activity. A February 2025 report from DappRadar indicated that blockchain gaming saw a 368% year-over-year surge in January, driven in part by the popularity of games like Off The Grid — a AAA-quality shooter by Gunzilla Games — and anticipation around MapleStory N. These new titles aim to merge high-end graphics and gameplay with blockchain-based economies. This is a departure from earlier Web3 games that focused more on rewards and often lacked gameplay depth. (Source: DappRadar ) Despite this excitement, the sector still has to reach mainstream adoption. DappRadar reported a 10% drop in daily unique active wallets by early 2025, which suggests that the initial surge of interest may be tapering off. There are also still some challenges to overcome, including the complexity of setting up crypto wallets and widespread skepticism among traditional gamers, many of whom vsee monetization mechanics like play-to-earn with suspicion . While Tencent’s potential acquisition of Nexon could energize the Web3 gaming landscape, it also sheds some light on the sector’s ongoing struggle to balance innovation with accessibility and player trust.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9556/sharplink-crash-triggers-confusion-over-ether-treasury-play,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Within just minutes, the asset’s price tumbled by over 35% before staging a recovery. Global uncertainty often impacts the entire cryptocurrency market immediately due to the volatile nature and its 24/7 trading availability. This was certainly the case in the past 12 hours or so as Israel’s strike against Iran caused substantial price drops for all crypto assets. However, while many larger-cap alts posted 7-8% drops and BTC’s plunged by 3-4%, Pi Network’s native token experienced a much more violent correction. Its price stood at roughly $0.62 before a painful candle took it south by 35% to just under $0.4. This flash crash essentially drove the PI token down to its all-time low levels registered in early April. Is $PI powered by Iranian nuclear facilities? It dipped from 0.62 to 0.4 in one minute. But it is already recovering.

Moreover, it has plunged below the May lows of $0.6. Recall that the Pi Network Core Team hinted about a big announcement in early May, which resulted in an immediate and massive price surge that drove PI from $0.6 to almost $1.7 within days. However, the asset started to lose traction fast , even before the announcement went live, and plunged to just over $0.6 after the team launched a new initiative aimed at investing in Pi Network-native projects. The PI token unlocks, which occur on daily scales, can also impact the native coin’s price, and there are certain warnings in its future. According to PiScan, more than 340,000,000 PI will be released in the next month, with June 18, June 26, July 5, and July 7 standing out as the days with the biggest unlocks.

2025-06-13T09:00:57,"ONDO To Repeat 2024’s ‘Parabolic’ Run? Analyst Anticipates 130% Rally Soon","Despite failing to break out of its downtrend, ONDO could be preparing for a surge above the $2 barrier. Some analysts suggest it could repeat its 2024 playbook if it continues to hold its current levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Massive Run After $2,800 Reclaim – ‘Up Only’ Ahead? ONDO Breakout Eyes $2 ONDO, the native token of the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance, is attempting to reclaim a key area amid the market pullback. Notably, the cryptocurrency has struggled to hold the $1 mark since losing the area as support over three months ago. In December, the RWA token hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.14 after US President Donald Trump’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), purchased 134,216 ONDO tokens for 250,000 USDC. This propelled ONDO’s price above the $2 barrier for the first time, but the late 2024 and Q1 2025 corrections halted its bullish momentum, sending its price to the $0.60-$0.70 range. Following the late April market recovery, ONDO’s price reclaimed the $0.85 area and broke out of its multi-month downtrend. The cryptocurrency then hovered between the $0.85-$1.10 levels throughout May, hitting a three-month high of $1.13 nearly a month ago. Since then, the token has been in a one-month downtrend, dipping below its local range after the recent market pullback. However, the cryptocurrency has been attempting to reclaim this range for the past week, hitting a one-week high of $0.92 on Wednesday. Crypto analyst World of Charts highlighted the token’s performance, affirming, “after a long correction, Finally Looking Good For Midterm.” As ONDO attempts to reclaim the $0.90 area, the analyst anticipates that the cryptocurrency will soon break out of its current range and the downtrend line, forecasting a 130% rally toward the $2 barrier. 2024 ATH Repeat Coming? On Thursday, analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted ONDO’s performance over the past year, asserting, “Not sure there are many other charts looking as good on high time frames like ONDO.” He explained that “The King of RWA” is “basically holding a bullish structure since its launch,” making a series of higher lows for over a year while maintaining its ascending support trendline. Meanwhile, analyst Alex Clay suggested that ONDO could see a parabolic run based on its performance in 2024. The market watcher noted that the token is currently accumulating at the bottom of a 15-month ascending channel, which previously served as a crucial bounce point for its rally toward its ATH. As Clay explained, after reaching the channel’s upper boundary last year, ONDO saw a multi-month downtrend toward the lower boundary, before printing a higher low. This was followed by a massive rally toward the channel’s top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Price Retests $109,000, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Pullback This year, ONDO is “following the Bullish Fractal from the previous year” after falling to the channel’s lower boundary, breaking out of the downtrend line, and registering a higher low. “These 2 reasons are more than enough to pump straight up to the channel’s top,” the analyst concluded. If history repeats, the cryptocurrency could surge toward the $2.8-$3 area. At the time of writing, ONDO trades at $0.84, a 5.2% decline in the daily timeframe.

2025-06-13T09:00:00,"ETH: Sudden Surge Should Make Us Think","Summary ETH has lagged BTC, but recent outperformance and technical signals suggest the 'ETH train' might be arriving on the tracks. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust offers a competitive 0.15% expense ratio and Grayscale has strong industry experience, making it my top ETF choice. Institutional adoption is becoming increasingly imperative, and I believe the positive evolution in regulatory clarity is a good sign for the crypto world, and therefore for ETH as well. ETH is in a key technical zone, defined by the 50 and 200 MAs on the weekly chart, my tool for risk management. ETH-USD's price isn’t rising the way you expected, right? We’re used to seeing ETH as a lagging asset compared to BTC, but also more profitable during bull runs. And since it still hasn’t surpassed its previous highs, let’s say the delay is starting to feel odd. Like when you’re waiting for a train, and it starts to be a few minutes late. At first, you don’t worry; but when the delay hits 15 or 30 minutes, you start wondering if the train will actually arrive or be cancelled. This parallel fits well, because while all the impatient DeFi investors are hopping on other trains, even if slower, standing still and waiting for the ETH express to pass could lead to two outcomes: either you’re left stranded (so it’s better to jump on another train ), or the ETH express arrives and gets ahead of the others. Well, assuming that the express is the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( ETH ) , how would you react if the loudspeaker just announced that the ETH express is about to arrive? What is ETH ETF? Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, a distant relative of the better-known ETHE, is an ETF, but not in Trust format. Instead, it’s a Spot version . Not a “mini” version, as the name might suggest, but rather a fully evolved Spot version of Ethereum (aligned with the most recent regulations). It’s a topic that’s been debated for months: to simplify, we’re talking about passive funds with the function of storing the underlying asset, in this case, held by the well-known Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC , just as we saw with its BTC ETF counterpart . Since 2024, an open war has broken out among the new Ethereum Spot ETFs, although we still don’t have a clear winner. If we were to rank them by AUM, ETH ETF would still be among the top performers, alongside its peer table. ETH Peer table (Seeking Alpha) But… On what basis should the choice be made? If this “war” isn’t about performance, given the index-linked nature of all ETFs, and not even much about NAV due to the Spot structure (unlike what happened with ETHE), then how do you choose an ETF? ETH Peer table - Performance (Seeking Alpha) Personally, I focus on track record and industry experience, and on fees: and in this, Grayscale proves very competitive. Active since earlier with the ETHE trust, it’s a well-established player in the market and now offers the mini version ((ETH)) with a 0.15% expense ratio, highly competitive , making it one of the most cost-effective options in my peer table. Back to the train… Following this somewhat extreme parallel, I believe that while BTC has already passed the station, ETH-USD is simply delayed, and that a voice over the loudspeaker has just hinted: “the ETH train is arriving.” Could it be mistaken? That’s what I sense when I look at the 1-month performance between BTC and ETH and see that ETH is clearly outperforming BTC. Data by YCharts And the narrative I personally think the market is following is the same one that, in my view, drove BTC to new highs: a steady increase in institutional adoption, supported by growing regulatory clarity, kicked off by the arrival of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act. Criticized as much as praised, the GENIUS Act is quietly moving through Senate bureaucracy, having passed the closure stage (a procedural step), moving on to debate, and potentially heading toward a final vote. A step that, according to Trump’s own words, aims to integrate stablecoins into the U.S. economy and make the United States the crypto capital of the world. Of course, it’s more of an expectation than a certainty, but in my view, it’s what’s currently driving the bullish narrative around Bitcoin. And yet… Here I raise a strong critique of my own thesis: “it’s wrong to build positions based on political catalysts.” And I truly believe that . In fact, saying the GENIUS Act is the bullish catalyst at work is, in my opinion, just as mistaken as ignoring the fact that something is changing in the monetary system. Because beyond the stablecoin program, it’s impossible not to notice the growing integration of the crypto system into “traditional finance.” And that, yes, in my view, is a long-range catalyst. Just think: in a single year, we’ve seen two major Spot ETF approvals, and now we’re seriously talking about regulating a stablecoin-based monetary system . So… does it really make sense that the ETH train wouldn’t arrive, if the BTC one already has? Data by YCharts In my opinion, no. Ethereum is the primary infrastructure on which most stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI, etc.) operate. So theoretically, no, it doesn’t make sense for ETH to lag behind. And I think the price action is already showing some interest in that direction. ETH - USD (technical analysis) (Seeking Alpha) From a technical standpoint, we’re seeing what, I believe, is a bullish pattern, but what I appreciate most is that the risk appears theoretically manageable. Let me explain: ETH-USD has used the 100-week moving average as textbook support, showing strong buying demand. It has also broken through the faster-moving averages, the 21 and the 50, with conviction. Specifically, this week it broke above the 50-week MA, which it might use as support in the coming weeks if the trend continues. The risk is manageable because, in setups like this, I believe the moving average can act as a dynamic/trailing stop. And the natural question arises: why a dynamic stop? Risk We’ve said that the “failure” of the bill is not a long-term positive catalyst, and therefore not a negative one either. But certainly, it could create short-term volatility. In this sense, Elizabeth Warren’s comment , that the bill can’t work due to weak controls on corruption, foreign influence, and various conflicts of interest, brings real issues to light (as I discussed here). If these opinions were to start gaining traction, I’d expect significant volatility, and why not, even some downward moves driven by profit-taking. Conclusion To sum it up, overall, I believe the narrative behind ETH ETF justifies a BUY rating. The “ETH train” is on the tracks, and the crypto market is rising, judging by ETH’s outperformance over BTC in the past month. The doubt remains: where is it heading? Because I hate relying on political catalysts, they’re as disruptive as they are unreliable. But given the way I operate, I greatly value technical confirmation: the “alignment” of the 200 and 50 moving averages on the 1W chart, and the fact that there’s a clear technical reference point to rely on in case the trend reverses.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794592-eth-sudden-surge-should-make-us-think?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","ETH-USD|ETH",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T08:58:21,"Trump media BTC ETF filing spurs market optimism: is MUTM about to rally?","Trump Media, a company that runs Trump’s Truth Social, recently filed for a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. This marks the latest effort to capitalize on growing enthusiasm for digital assets. The ETF would be operated by Yorkville America Digital, an asset management firm, and would directly hold Bitcoin according to the SEC filing. If approved, the shares of the ETF fund would be listed on the NYSE Arca ETF exchange. Why this ETF matters The Spot Bitcoin ETF market is crowded, with the biggest one being the BlackRock fund that is worth over $72 billion in net assets as of June 10, 2025. This ETF filing comes amid a wave of planned digital asset-friendly laws in the US that are in line with Trump’s goal of making America the global crypto capital. Trump once doubted Bitcoin and called it a scam. However, he has since changed his mind, and is now behind the TRUMP meme coin for which he hosted a gala dinner for its largest holders. Since taking office, Trump has worked to revoke Biden-era policies that had placed a stranglehold on the crypto sector. Growing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) optimism The current US administration has been extremely crypto-friendly, which has led to some massive gains in June 2025. Amid this rising interest in crypto, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to be one of the main beneficiaries. This is due to the high-octane discussions going on around MUTM tokens and their potential for bombastic returns. According to analysts, MUTM tokens could rise by as much as 2,567% in a few days after the public launch. A major reason for the optimism is the unique design of the protocol and its many safeguards for users. The Mutuum Finance protocol allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When they sign up as lenders, they have a chance to earn interest on their deposits in the pools at a rate determined by the pool utilization rate. Protocol protections In the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) framework, there are numerous protections that are designed to preserve the long-term viability of the ecosystem. Additionally, they ensure that users of the protocol can continue to make profits. One of the requirements is overcollateralization of all assets used as collateral on the platform. That is designed to ensure prompt liquidations, helping to always keep lenders’ capital safe. If assets have high volatility, the over-collateralization requirements and liquidation thresholds will be cranked up to ensure optimal protection in case of sudden spikes in the utilization rate or capital shortages. Market conditions play an important role in the design of the interest rate structure. If yields on external markets become more attractive, it will entice arbitrage traders to raid Mutuum Finance and siphon away liquidity. To prevent this situation, the protocol will adjust key parameters, including the utilization rate for each asset, and could implement interest rate slopes as well. The goal is to ensure borrowing costs are in line with the overall market, discouraging losses to arbitrage. Raising interest rates sharply or lowering the optimal utilization rate for certain assets can help the ecosystem achieve balance. It ensures that yield opportunities on Mutuum Finance align with the rest of the market, which mitigates the possibility of running out of capital during high market demand. One of the tools that Mutuum Finance uses to maintain liquidity is liquidity mining. This is where the protocol uses some of the MUTM tokens to reward liquidity providers. The system is designed to ensure inflows of liquidity, even when market conditions are volatile. However, not all assets can get the liquidity rewards. Instead, the incentives will be strategically directed towards tokens that encourage protocol stability, while keeping token inflation in check. Tokens with high stability, like stablecoins, will be given priority, while small tokens like meme coins, which can introduce volatility into the ecosystem, will not be added. Bug bounty on Mutuum Finance The Mutuum Finance ecosystem will organize and launch a bug bounty program. This will be an open invitation to developers, researchers, ethical hackers, and security experts to hunt for vulnerabilities on the platform. The bounty program will cover all aspects of the ecosystem, including the smart contracts, libraries, and off-chain services that impact protocol functionality. MUTM token presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token presale has been a massive success so far. Over $10.45 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,000 participants. In the current phase of the presale, tokens are priced at $0.03, which is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the price is set to rise by 16.67% to $0.035. It will mark a reduction in a guaranteed ROI from 100% to 71.43% based on the 40.06 listing price. Not wanting to miss out on this huge ROI, investors have been rushing to secure their tokens. So far, over 35% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold. That is an impressive feat, especially considering that the current phase launched less than two weeks ago.

2025-06-13T08:57:59,"Bitcoin (BTC) surges above $109K: will MUTM lead the next spike?","Bitcoin has been surging again in June 2025, rising to above $110,000 before falling back to around $109,900. At the current price, many analysts forecast it will keep rising for the next few days. One of the catalysts for the rise of Bitcoin is the current progress of US-China talks as trade tensions ease. Bitcoin roars again Over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) is up nearly 5%; a massive rise after it dropped to around $100,000 on June 5, 2025. At this point, Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to retrace its recent all-time high of $111,814 in late May 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to lead next surge Amid the resurgence of Bitcoin (BTC) amid positive trade deal news, wise investors know the real gains are hidden at the bottom of the market. For instance, the ongoing Mutuum finance (MUTM) presale represents an opportunity for massive gains. A good demonstration of this is Bitcoin, which has risen from $100k to $110k, while that is impressive in real figures, it only represents a 10% increase. Meanwhile, analysts forecast that MUTM tokens could rise from $0.03 to $3. While that might seem like a small increase, it represents a massive 9,900%. Based on these calculations, a $100 investment in BTC when it was at $100k would be worth $110 right now. However, the same $100 invested in MUTM tokens will be worth $9,900 when the MUTM tokens go live. In the crypto sector, it is important to keep this clear perspective in mind when making investment decisions. Details of the MUTM token MUTM is the native token of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. The token is essential to the long-term success of the ecosystem, particularly since Mutuum Finance is new. As such, it must meet investor expectations, which will boost trust in the ecosystem. To start with, Mutuum Finance plans to use most of the protocol revenue to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and distribute them to stakers in the safety module. That will help to absorb some of the selling pressure, while balancing the liquidity mining emissions needed to ensure favorable participation conditions. Once the initial pressure goes down, they will transition to a model where protocol profits go to growing the pools, boosting the safety funds, and marketing work. However, they plan to continue buying MUTM tokens off the open market. They will implement a cap on the maximum number of rewards to ensure that it does not slow the growth and expansion of the protocol. That program will provide a massive boost in visibility for MUTM tokens, which are listed on CoinMarketCap. This listing could potentially allow MUTM to be visible to millions of people, considering that there are over 350 million monthly visitors to CoinMarketCap. Additionally, the team expects to list MUTM tokens on several top-tier crypto exchanges, which will serve as another source of major growth. As the token price increases, it will rise in the various exchange metrics, which is expected to boost interest in the overall ecosystem, which will deepen protocol liquidity as participation grows. Safety on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) places a premium on security. It has already secured a CertiK audit, where it was given a Token Scan Score of 80. The audit is a mark of trust in the project and has been a major catalyst for presale participation. Besides the CertiK audit, Mutuum Finance will take numerous other measures to protect its users and their assets. One of these measures will be asset caps for tokens that show price instability. These caps will be used to prevent the unlimited minting exploit, which could be used to deplete liquidity from the protocol. Additionally, the team will monitor Oracle services to ensure that they are not manipulated. If a project is using an oracle that is prone to manipulation, trading activity may be stopped until the issue has been resolved. If a token shows high volatility, its collateral options may be limited, ensuring that it cannot access the high-value assets in the communal pools. Overall, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will take numerous measures that aim to diversify the number of assets listed, weighed against the need to protect the protocol. MUTM presale detail Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will rise by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, over $10.45 million has been raised from around 12,000 participants in the presale. As the overall crypto market has begun surging again, the MUTM presale has seen an increased level of participation. For instance, over 35% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have already been sold, barely two weeks after it started. That pace is expected to remain high, especially with the bonus of a $100,000 giveaway looming at the back of the minds of investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that has the potential to turn your fortunes around in 2025. With the crypto market looking up once more, this DeFi token gives you a chance to ride the wave to the top while making massive gains.

2025-06-13T08:56:09,"MicroStrategy Insider Sells $10M in Stock —MSTR Shares Drop by 8%","The post MicroStrategy Insider Sells $10M in Stock —MSTR Shares Drop by 8% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) continues to double down on Bitcoin, some of its top insiders are quietly heading for a big sell-off. One of the company’s member just sold his entire $10 million stake in MSTR stock. What’s more surprising? Not a single insider has bought any shares in 2025. This has raised concerns that this could hurt Bitcoin price and MSTR stock performance. $10M Sell-Off by MicroStrategy Insider Carl Rickertsen, a board member of MicroStrategy, recently sold all of his MSTR shares, worth over $10 million. This move is raising eyebrows, especially because Rickertsen has been with the company since 2022. He originally bought $700,000 worth of MSTR stock when the price was under $25. Since then, the stock has skyrocketed, making his exit highly profitable. Reports from Protos reveal that Rickertsen didn’t just sell, he exercised stock options and dumped the shares on the very same day. This kind of move often signals a lack of long-term confidence in a company. Carl Rickertsen isn’t the only insider selling MSTR stock. On June 5 and 6, MicroStrategy’s Vice President Jeanine Montgomery also sold 340 shares of Class A stock. The sale price ranged between $370 and $377 per share, bringing her total earnings to about $127,000. Zero Insider Buys MSTR Shares in 2025 What’s even more worrying is that no insiders have purchased MSTR shares so far in 2025. According to Protos, there have been 26 insider sales this year, with total sell-offs outpacing purchases by over $864 million. “Insiders might sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one: they think the price will rise” – Peter Lynch. Well, ZERO insiders have bought $MSTR in 2025. Instead, there have been 26 insider sales this year alone. 5 year score: Insider sales exceed purchases by $864M. pic.twitter.com/nZSzqFcWZe — Protos (@Protos) June 12, 2025 This trend paints a concerning picture for small investors, especially as the stock has dropped 10% in the past month. That’s a huge red flag for many retail investors, especially when the company’s own executives are not backing the stock they help run. Strategy: Continue To Accumulate Bitcoin This comes at a time when Michael Saylor, the face of Strategy, continues to promote the firm’s Bitcoin-first strategy. The company now holds a staggering 582,000 BTC worth over $63 billion. But despite all that, MSTR shares are down by 8% , currently trading around $379. Peter Schiff Slams MicroStrategy Famous economist and long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff didn’t hold back. He called MicroStrategy’s business model a “complete fraud,” and claimed bankruptcy was only a matter of time.

Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Price Alert, Key Levels To Watch According to top crypto analyst Daan Crypto, the Bitcoin price has been trading within a narrow window after losing the range high located at $108,385. While the cryptocurrency has been able to withstand the sell-off, the analyst drew important levels to watch. As seen on the chart below, and according to the analyst, the Bitcoin price is likely to stay on its bearish course and potentially touch the mid area of its current range. This price action would put BTC at around $99,600 in the coming days. If buyers can’t hold the sell pressure around this level, then BTC is more than likely to keep bleeding into its range low of $90,000. This bearish price action, the analyst clarified, would become the norm for the rest of June. Key Levels to watch as the Bitcoin price shows weakness on low timeframes. Source: Daan Crypto via X Daan Crypto stated the following regarding the Bitcoin price action: Quick move after that which was obviously “helped” by the headlines although the news was looming already with the past 48 hours of headlines which is also why price started selling of prior. I’ve said it a couple of times before but I’ll say it again. Bulls had no business going back down below $108K and I’m treating this as another deviation and move back into the larger range. This is reason enough for me to be cautious and not add on exposure that was derisked (…). In this context, the analyst advised his followers to wait for clear confirmation that the bull trend is returning if Bitcoin can retake its range high around the previously mentioned level. Otherwise, the best course of action is to remain cautious. Optimism Fades as Bitcoin Aims for Lower On a separate note, trading desk QCP Group noted that the biggest risk for Bitcoin and the crypto market comes from the rising tensions between the US and China, and the growing tensions in the Middle East.

2025-06-13T08:55:31,"Best crypto presales to buy as meme coin market crashes 10%","Bitcoin briefly fell below $104,000 for the first time in a week on Thursday following explosions in Tehran that heightened geopolitical tensions and triggered a sharp sell-off across the cryptocurrency market. The leading digital asset plunged from $106,042 to $103,053 within 90 minutes after reports emerged of blasts in Iran’s capital at approximately 22:50 UTC. Israel later claimed responsibility for the strikes, intensifying risk aversion across global markets. At the time of publication, Bitcoin had recovered modestly to $104,370, according to CoinMarketCap. The fall was evident among the top meme coins, with Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) trading lower on Friday, mirroring the broader market downturn. The correction comes just days after Bitcoin climbed to $110,265 on Tuesday, approaching its all-time high of $111,940 reached on May 22. With tensions in the Middle East escalating, market volatility remains elevated as traders monitor further developments. Amid this turmoil, one meme coin has shown strong resilience. Since its February launch, Bitcoin Pepe ’s presale has sustained strong momentum, emerging as a notable standout in the crowded meme coin market. Meme coins fall hard The combined market capitalisation of meme coins has fallen nearly 10% amid rising token supply and escalating risk-off sentiment. Technical indicators point to the possibility of a deeper correction across these assets, suggesting the current weakness may extend if market conditions remain unstable. Dogecoin, the dominant player in the meme coin segment with a market capitalisation of $26 billion, is down nearly 8% over the past 24 hours. Despite a brief recovery earlier this week, DOGE failed to break above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average at $0.1976, triggering a three-day selloff that has erased more than 15% from the recent high of $0.2067. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1747, marking its third consecutive daily loss. Shiba Inu also extended its bearish reversal, following a rejection at a key resistance trendline connecting peaks from December 8, May 10, and May 22. The token is down 7% on the day, hitting a new 30-day low of $0.00001138. Bitcoin Pepe presale stays strong The past few months have been turbulent for the crypto market. Major digital assets have seen sharp swings, and meme coins, typically known for their explosive rallies, have been no exception. Dogecoin, PEPE, and Shiba Inu have largely flatlined, failing to deliver any sustained upward momentum. Yet, amid this cooling-off period, the Bitcoin Pepe presale has steadily gained traction. Its ability to draw investor interest while the rest of the meme coin segment struggles suggests it may be better positioned to weather the ongoing market storm. Unlike conventional meme tokens that rely heavily on hype with little technical backing, Bitcoin Pepe is introducing a different approach. It is said to be the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, combining the network’s robust security with Solana-like scalability. This hybrid model of technical infrastructure and meme culture is aimed at setting a new standard in the space. To expand its Layer 2 ecosystem, the project has announced strategic tie-ups with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. This combination of utility and meme appeal appears to be resonating. Bitcoin Pepe ‘s ongoing presale has already brought in over $14 million. With just four days remaining before a listing announcement on June 17, attention around the project continues to build.

Speaking at the XRPL Apex 2025 conference in Singapore, former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo said the concept of government bonds backed by assets like Bitcoin and XRP is “more than a possibility.” Here’s everything you need to know! Trump’s New Approach: Hold Crypto, Don’t Sell Giancarlo, who led the CFTC under President Trump and is widely known in the industry as “Crypto Dad,” revealed that the current administration is taking a very different approach to digital assets compared to its predecessors. In past years, federal agencies typically sold off seized crypto. Under Trump, that strategy has changed. According to Giancarlo, the administration now believes that holding digital assets could strengthen the U.S. financially. Had the government held onto Bitcoin seized years ago, it could have made a serious dent in the national debt, he noted during the interview with Bradley Kimes of Digital Perspective. Importantly, Giancarlo clarified that this shift doesn’t need new laws. Federal agencies already have the authority to hold confiscated digital assets and that power is now being used. Crypto as a Strategic Reserve Beyond simply storing digital assets, the government is looking at ways to use them strategically. Giancarlo compared the move to how the U.S. manages its Strategic Petroleum Reserve – a stockpile used not just for emergencies, but as a tool to stabilize markets. When oil prices are manipulated by global producers, the U.S. can release supply to push back. That same thinking is now being applied to crypto, especially with all the geopolitical changes! As BRICS nations develop alternatives to the U.S. dollar, and countries like China continue to stockpile resources, Giancarlo said the U.S. should do the same but with digital commodities. An interesting approach, wouldn’t you say? The U.S. Already Holds Billions in Crypto Well, the administration is already building out reserves. In March, President Trump signed an executive order creating the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which now holds over 200,000 BTC, worth more than $22 billion at current prices. These assets were collected through criminal and civil forfeitures and are treated as long-term holdings, similar to gold. Alongside that, the Digital Asset Stockpile was launched to manage other tokens like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Unlike the Bitcoin reserve, this pool is more flexible, allowing the Treasury to make calculated sales or acquisitions as needed. Kimes closed the conversation by noting that if the U.S. starts using crypto reserves the same way it uses oil, it could influence market behavior. Giancarlo agreed. Here’s what we can see: crypto’s not on the sidelines anymore.

2025-06-13T08:53:25,"Bitcoin słabnie, a cena ropy wystrzeliła w związku z napięciami na linii Izrael-Iran","W obliczu eskalacji napięć na Bliskim Wschodzie i gwałtownego wzrostu cen ropy zwiększył się popyt na opcje sprzedaży, kosztem opcji kupna BTC. Jeszcze na początku tygodnia krótkoterminowe prognozy ceny Bitcoina napawały inwestorów optymizmem, kluczowa okazała się jednak nieprzewidywalność i zmienność rynków i sytuacji międzynarodowej. Handlowcy krypto bacznie obserwują rynek i szukają tanich alternatyw, gotowych do eksplozji jeszcze w tym roku. Cena Bitcoina spada – ryzyko masowej wyprzedaży Cena bitcoina spadła do 50-dniowej prostej średniej kroczącej (SMA) na poziomie 104 493 USD, wydłużając 24-godzinne straty do 3,00% (według danych z Coingecko). Ceny na krótko przekroczyły poziom 110 000 USD na początku tego tygodnia – byki mogą mieć nadzieję, że 50-dniowa SMA się utrzyma, ponieważ potencjalny spadek poniżej SMA może zachęcić do większych wyprzedaży (czyli sytuacji, którą zaobserwowano po załamaniu się wsparcia w lutym 2025 r.). W momencie pisania tego tekstu cena baryłki ropy zaczęła spadać i wynosi 72,38 USD. We wczesnych godzinach porannych cena baryłki ropy wynosiła aż 78,4 USD osiągając najwyższy poziom od 16 stycznia 2025 r. Ruch ten nastąpił po tym, jak Izrael przeprowadził ataki powietrzne na Iran, z dużym prawdopodobieństwem ściągając na siebie odwetowe ataki rakietowe ze strony Teheranu. Nadchodzi impuls inflacyjny? Nagłe skoki cen ropy naftowej wywołują impuls inflacyjny, w którym zwiększona cena ropy prowadzi do wzrostu kosztów produkcji i transportu. To z kolei może przyczynić się do ogólnego wzrostu cen w gospodarce. Wzrost cen ropy naftowej ma bezpośredni wpływ na wiele sektorów, w tym na transport, przemysł i rolnictwo. Sytuacja jest o tyle poważna, że wojna handlowa prowadzona już przez prezydenta Donalda Trumpa nieustannie grozi zachwianiem gospodarki i wzrostem inflacji, zwłaszcza w krajach będących importerami netto. Wszystko to może obniżyć oczekiwania dotyczące obniżek stóp procentowych przez Fed, zwiększając zmienność spadkową akcji i kryptowalut. W chwili pisania tego tekstu kontrakty futures powiązane ze S&P 500 spadły o 1,3% w ciągu ostatniej doby. Inwestorzy poszukują alternatywy dla Bitcoina Inwestorzy, niezależnie od tego, czy wierzą w optymistyczne prognozy Bitcoina, czy są co do nich bardziej sceptyczni, chętnie rozglądają się za innymi możliwościami inwestycyjnymi. Najlepiej, jeśli są one dopasowane do indywidualnych możliwości finansowych oraz wykazują się konkretną użytecznością. Dzięki rozwiązaniu problemu ze skalowalnością sieci Bitcoin przez Bitcoin Hyper oraz airdropom bitcoinów w ramach projektu Bitcoin Bull Token , potencjał wzrostu tokenów jest na tyle duży, że nie mógł zostać niezauważony przez łowców okazji przedsprzedażowych. Bitcoin Hyper – wprowadza Layer 2 na Bitcoinie Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) wprowadza pionierską sieć Bitcoin Layer-2, która ma przyspieszyć transakcje na całym blockchainie Bitcoin, zwiększyć skalowalność i otworzyć drogę do nowych możliwości, takich jak natychmiastowe płatności i bardziej funkcjonalne aplikacje zdecentralizowane dApps. Będzie to możliwe dzięki integracji z Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) oraz zdecentralizowanemu Canonical Bridge. Kluczową rolę w ekosystemie pełni token $HYPER, umożliwiając płacenie za transakcje, uczestniczenie w głosowaniach DAO (w przyszłości) oraz korzystanie z aplikacji DeFi. Od razu po zakupie tokenów $HYPER można je przeznaczyć do stakingu, otrzymując roczne nagrody na poziomie do 732% APY. Warto jednak zauważyć, że wysokość APY będzie stopniowo maleć w miarę wzrostu liczby inwestorów. Bitcoin Bull Token – organizuje airdropy BTC Projekt Bitcoin Bull Token jest ściśle powiązany z ruchami ceny Bitcoina. Jego celem jest zapewnienie posiadaczom tokenów realnych zysków związanych z umacnianiem się Bitcoina – kluczowym elementem projektu jest możliwość zdobywania airdropów Bitcoina, gdy cena BTC przekroczy określone poziomy: 150 000 USD, 200 000 USD, 250 000 USD itd. Tuż po zakupie tokenów $BTCBULL można je przeznaczyć do stakingu, który jest nagradzany pasywnymi zwrotami na poziomie APY 57%. Token $BTCBULL ma być też odporny na inflację, dzięki mechanizmowi spalania tokenów. Również w tym przypadku, gdy Bitcoin osiągnie nowe ATH (np. 125 000 USD, 175 000 USD itd.), część tokenów zostanie trwale spalona, co zmniejszy podaż i wpłynie na wzrost wartości pozostałych tokenów.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-slabnie-a-cena-ropy-wystrzelila/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|Poland",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T08:45:28,"Institutional buyers inject billions into crypto: Could MUTM be their DeFi pick?","Crypto investments continue to rise, with inflows from institutional investors continuing to rise. The crypto asset got a boost when the US and China partially resolved their trade dispute, increasing appetite for crypto. According to recent data, the crypto market experienced $7.05 billion in net inflows in May 2025, the highest since December 2024. Meanwhile crypto assets under management rose to $167 billion. Why Bitcoin (BTC) inflows are rising One of the main reasons why Bitcoin is rising amongst institutional investors is the loss of faith in US treasuries. Analysts forecast uncertainty in the equity markets, while Bitcoin is holding strong. While crypto has experienced net inflows, data shows that equity funds saw net outflows in May 2025. Meanwhile, gold saw its first outflow in 15 months, pointing to changing portfolio diversification. According to analysts the inflows will hold steady. They say it is a sign of crypto becoming a permanent fixture in portfolio diversification strategies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) poised for explosive gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi project that could be on the cusp of great things. It is built as a lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit assets into the pools for a chance to earn a passive income based on an annualized percentage yield. The interest rate that lenders earn is determined by the pool utilization rate. To determine the pool utilization rate, the protocol measures the assets in the pool that are actively borrowed against the total assets in a pool. When the interest rate rises, it encourages borrowers to pay back their loans. At the same time, it encourages lenders to deposit more assets in the pools to benefit from increasing yields. These two actions have a two-fold impact. First, they raise the liquidity in the pools, and second, they lower the interest rate as the utilization rate metric changes. The result is that the protocol achieves optimal capital efficiency overall. Managing market volatility on Mutuum Finance On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), serious effort goes into managing on-chain liquidity, and trading volume, which have a huge impact on the price volatility of an asset. If the protocol has enough liquidity, it ensures that a position can be quickly shut down without massive slippage. The protocol also used caps, and liquidation requirements to control exposure. For example, if an asset has low liquidity, the protocol may raise incentives to liquidators to maintain coverage. Price volatility can impact the collateral underpinning the borrow positions. If market volatility leads to the value of collateral dropping to below what is owned, the solvency of the entire ecosystem could be challenged. As such, the team has created a framework that maintains the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio at the right level. Besides the LTV ratio, they use a liquidation threshold, which is at a level that ensures there is enough headroom for a liquidator to make a profit when stabilizing distressed positions. Assets that are known to be stable like ETH, and stablecoins, will be assigned a high LTV of up 75%, while their liquidation threshold can be set as high as 80%. For assets that display high levels of volatility, the LTV can be set as low as 40%, while the liquidation threshold is set around 65%. Using these parameters help to balance the need for diverse asset participation in the protocol against the need to mitigate the impact of sudden price movements that lead to liquidation events. The protocol also assigns each asset a reserve factor based on its overall stability. Assets like stablecoin, known for being stable, get a reserve factor of around 10%, while more unstable ones can reach up to 35%. This design is used to find a balance between protocol health, and broadening market participation. Details of the presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5. So far, over $10.45 million has been raised in the presale. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will rise by 16.67% to $0.035. In the ongoing phase 5 of the presale, MUTM tokens have seen a massive surge in demand as the crypto market heats up. So far, over 35% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have been sold, barely two weeks after it began. If you are looking to be part of one of the most exciting crypto projects of 2025, the MUTM token presale is a great place to start.

2025-06-13T08:44:09,"Critical Ethereum Report from 21 Industry Experts: Is There Still Hope for ETH?","The largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has been under a lot of criticism for its poor performance against Bitcoin (BTC) and its failure to surpass its previous ATH. Despite this, some analysts stated that they still maintain bullish expectations for Ethereum, while industry experts published a comprehensive report on Ethereum. The report was contributed by 21 notable figures, including Consensys Founder and Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin, Etherealize co-founders Vivek Raman, Danny Ryan and Grant Hummer, and Ether.fi founder and CEO Mike Silagadze. Accordingly, prominent Ethereum supporters argued that ETH was seriously undervalued. Leading Ethereum tech experts and industry figures have argued in their “Bullish Case for ETH” report that ETH is significantly undervalued and has the potential to reach $740,000 per token in the long term. Stating that Ethereum is more than just a store of value, the report said, “ETH is the fuel, collateral and reserve asset that feeds the financial system of the future.” “ETH is the digital oil that powers the financial digital economy. And it is significantly mispriced.” The report noted that ETH secured $767 billion worth of assets, and stated that ETH should be positioned not just as a technology stock, but as a fundamental layer of the on-chain economy. Vivek Raman, co-founder of ETH think tank Etherealize, said that it is correct to compare ETH to global reserve assets such as oil, bonds, or M2 money supply to more accurately reflect Ethereum’s potential. Raman added that the eventual adoption of ETH could rival or even surpass the transformative impact of the internet. “Ethereum is becoming the indispensable asset at the heart of a digitally native financial system. Simply put, ETH is digital oil. Once adopted, it will be as big as the internet, maybe even bigger. At this point, ETH lagging behind BTC is a mispricing, not a structural weakness.” They Focused on Bitcoin, They Overlooked Ethereum! Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin compared Bitcoin to Ethereum, saying: “Institutional investors have been so focused on Bitcoin and its narrative as a store of value that they have overlooked an asset with much greater growth potential. Not only does ETH share the same store of value properties that made Bitcoin popular, it also has a broad utility, offers more predictable scarcity, and provides a steady return, making it the ultimate productive reserve asset. As Ethereum further establishes itself as the backbone of the digital economy, ETH becomes even more indispensable.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T08:37:28,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as tensions in Middle East rattle crypto market","Bitcoin briefly fell below $104,000 for the first time in a week on Thursday, as geopolitical tensions flared following explosions in Tehran. The sharp decline triggered widespread liquidations across the crypto market, with Ethereum and Solana also falling by about 9% in the past 24 hours. The drop in Bitcoin, from $106,042 to $103,053 within 90 minutes, coincided with reports of explosions in Iran’s capital around 22:50 UTC. Israel later claimed responsibility for the strikes, further rattling global risk sentiment. Bitcoin has since recovered slightly to $104,370 at the time of publication, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The market reaction resulted in approximately $1.15 billion in crypto futures liquidations, including $427.84 million in long positions, according to data from CoinGlass. The sudden correction caught many traders offside, just days after Bitcoin touched $110,265 on Tuesday, nearing its May 22 all-time high of $111,940. Volatility remains elevated amid escalating geopolitical uncertainty, with traders closely watching developments in the Middle East. With Bitcoin facing renewed volatility amid escalating tensions in the Middle East, retail investors are increasingly shifting capital into high-upside, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe — now in the final stretch of its presale. Since its launch in February, Bitcoin Pepe’s presale has maintained consistent traction, positioning the project as a standout in the crowded meme coin market. Bitcoin may weather the storm Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano noted that while oil and gold are currently gaining and Bitcoin is declining, historical precedent suggests the trend may soon reverse. Citing market behaviour during a similar geopolitical flare-up in October, when Iran launched hundreds of rockets at Israel, Pompliano recalled that Bitcoin initially dropped 3%, only to rebound sharply. Anthony Pompliano 🌪 @APompliano · Follow Oil up.Gold up.Bitcoin down.Initial reaction follows exactly what happened when Iran shot 300 missiles at Israel.Bitcoin ended up outperforming the other two over the first 48 hours in that situation.Will be interesting to see what happens here. 5:59 am · 13 Jun 2025 3.2K Reply Copy link Read 134 replies “Bitcoin ended up outperforming the other two over the first 48 hours in that situation,” he said, implying the current market reaction could follow a similar trajectory. “Will be interesting to see what happens here,” he further added. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale has stayed resilient The crypto market has witnessed significant volatility over the past few months — sharp rallies, deep pullbacks, and shifting investor sentiment have all played their part. Yet amid this turbulence, the Bitcoin Pepe presale has managed to hold steady, consistently attracting capital. If the trend is any indication, the project may have what it takes to weather the current storm as well. Positioning itself as the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe is attempting to redefine meme tokens by fusing Bitcoin’s foundational security with the scalability typically associated with chains like Solana. This blend of infrastructure depth and cultural appeal distinguishes it from the vast pool of meme tokens lacking technical merit. To scale its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has secured a series of strategic partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. The project’s hybrid strategy — combining real-world utility with meme-driven virality — appears to be gaining traction. Its presale has already raised over $14 million, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0416. With four days left until the listing announcement on June 17, investor focus on the project is only intensifying.

2025-06-13T08:37:01,"Pi Network Crashes 13% After Israel Strikes: What’s Next?","The post Pi Network Crashes 13% After Israel Strikes: What’s Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market slipped into the red zone today, after Israel’s latest strike on Iran. This has triggered widespread sell-offs, and Bitcoin is down 3.5% to $104,209, while major altcoins have fallen between 6% and 9%. Pi Coin has also dropped around 13% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $0.5506. Analyst Dr. Altcoin said that the strike has had a direct impact on Pi and the broader market. He warned that if Iran retaliates, prices could fall even further. Over the past week, Pi is down 11%, and it has lost 56% of its value over the past month. Technical Analysis – Trend Still Bearish The conflict in Iran, combined with delays in the Pi mapping migration in Chinese-speaking regions, could have contributed to the sharp drop. However, this could also be an opportunity to stack Pi at a discount. But Pi coin appears to be in a clear downtrend, due to both macro tensions and technical weakness. Most technical indicators are signaling a sell. It is currently trading below all major short-term and mid-term EMAs and SMAs (from the 10-day to the 100-day range), all of which are signaling sell. The MACD and Momentum indicators also suggest further downside, while the RSI at 32 shows that Pi is nearing the oversold territory. Unless market sentiment improves or strong buying returns, the bearish trend is expected to continue. There have been rising doubts around its valuation model. Dr. Altcoin has dismissed the idea of a Global Consensus Value (GCV) as completely unrealistic, and an “economic impossibility.” Many users expect the Core Team to break its silence on the GCV debate on the upcoming Pi2Day on June 28, 2025, as the Pi open mainnet launch is expected within the same timeframe. Pi Price at Risk of New Lows Analysts warn that without a major update, the price could fall further to $0.40 by late August. But a recovery may follow as token unlocking slows down during the same period, which could reduce selling pressure and help restore investor confidence. If updates on mainnet activation, merchant tools, or GCV clarity are shared, they could reshape how Pi is perceived and valued. A broader crypto market rally could help lift Pi along with other altcoins. Rising social media activity is another positive signal. Furthermore, a possible exchange listing could also trigger a short squeeze similar to what was seen with other coins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-crashes-13-after-israel-strikes-whats-next/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T08:30:00,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin price faces surge toward $108K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $104,808 (-1.7%) Market cap $2.19 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $56.76 Billion (-38%) Circulating supply 19.86 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $108,592.69 24-hour low $102,822 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $104,808 Price Prediction $116,908 (+10.8%) Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Price Volatility 2.2% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $101,295 200-Day SMA $87,277 14-Day RSI 54.42 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin triggered a bearish pressure below $105K.

If BTC’s price holds momentum above $111,960, it will fuel a bullish rally to $115,562. BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $102,519, beginning a bearish trend to $100,331. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure as sellers defended further surges. This plunged the BTC price below $105K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

The selloff began in the early hours before Israeli forces launched Operation Rising Lion , targeting what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as the “heart” of Iran’s nuclear program, including strikes on the Natanz enrichment facility and military infrastructure near Tehran and Tabriz. This unexpected geopolitical war affected global financial markets, with Bitcoin dropping from a 24-hour high of $108,500 as investors fled risk assets amid escalating Middle East tensions. Source: Cryptonews The liquidation data reveals the severity of the market panic, with long positions bearing the brunt of the damage at $1.16 billion compared to just $113.97 million in short liquidations. Source: Coinglass The cascading effect intensified throughout the day, starting with $20 million in liquidations within the first hour and exploding to nearly $1 billion over 12 hours as algorithmic trading systems and leveraged positions were quickly wiped out. Geopolitical Catalyst Exposes Crypto Market Leverage The Israeli strikes, which began around 3:30 AM local time in Tehran, revealed the cryptocurrency market’s dangerous overleverage as what started as a geopolitical war quickly morphed into a technical breakdown. Netanyahu’s announcement that the operation would continue “for as many days as it takes to remove the threat” created sustained uncertainty that prevented any meaningful recovery attempts throughout the trading session. However, if the war escalates, the cryptocurrency as we know it has always served as digital gold during global uncertainty. The speed and magnitude of the decline, amplified by algorithmic trading systems treating crypto as a risk-off asset, quickly shifted sentiment in an already overleveraged market. Iran’s immediate counterattack, launching approximately 100 drones toward Israel while declaring a state of emergency, further amplified market fears and sustained the selling pressure across all major cryptocurrencies. For Instance, ETH is down over 8% from a week high of $2,700 to $2,500. Similarly, XRP has been down 6%, SOL 9%, and Dogecoin 9%, all in the past 24 hours. This indicates that the selloff was indiscriminate across the entire market rather than concentrated in Bitcoin alone. Technical Analysis Reveals Bitcoin Might Dip Further The price action across multiple timeframes revealed that the geopolitical development triggered technical breakdowns that had been building for weeks, suggesting the market was vulnerable to external catalysts. The hourly chart showed Bitcoin breaking decisively below critical support at $106,500, with three distinct rejection points in the supply zone between $109,500 and $110,500 indicating heavy institutional selling pressure. The bearish breakout pushed Bitcoin below the psychological $105,000 level, with the next major demand zone sitting around the round-number $100,000 target. The four-hour analysis also exposed a descending channel pattern constraining Bitcoin since its peak above $112,000. The recent break below the channel’s lower support line signaled an acceleration of the bearish trend. The volume profile showed increased selling activity coinciding with the geopolitical news flow, while the resistance level around $112,000 now appears formidable for any recovery attempts. The technical structure suggests that rallies will likely be met with renewed selling pressure, with the channel breakdown targeting the $100,000-$102,000 demand zone. Most concerning was the Ichimoku rising wedge breakdown on the four-hour timeframe, which revealed Bitcoin trading below the cloud and indicated a shift from bullish to bearish momentum. Rising wedges represent diminishing buying pressure despite higher prices, and the breakdown typically leads to sharp declines with measured move targets around $96,000. This technical objective aligns with previous significant support levels and would represent approximately a 10% decline from current levels, suggesting further downside pressure if geopolitical tensions remain elevated or additional macro factors emerge to pressure risk assets.

2025-06-13T08:11:56,"Single Bitcoin Trader Loses $200M as Crypto Bulls See $1B Liquidations","Crypto bulls took a heavy beating on Thursday with over $1.15 billion in liquidations wiping out leveraged positions across major exchanges, marking one of the bloodiest days for crypto markets in recent months. The largest single liquidation was a bitcoin BTC long position on Binance, valued at $200 million, making it one of the biggest one-off losses in the year so far. It is unclear which trading firm or individual was behind that position, as exchanges don’t make that data public. Data from Coinglass shows over 247,00 traders were liquidated in the 24-hour span. Long traders bore the brunt, accounting for over $1 billion in losses — reflecting overly optimistic positioning after a week of bullish sentiment fueled by Circle’s high-profile IPO and a resurgence in U.S.-focused DeFi narratives. BTC lost more than 3% to trade at $104,700 in Asian afternoon hours, while ether ETH sunk 8% to $2,530. Tokens like solana's SOL SOL and dogecoin DOGE also slid over 8%, while XRP XRP fell to $2.20. Crypto exchanges Binance and Bybit accounted for more than $834 million in liquidated trades, the most among counterparts. Liquidations occur when traders use borrowed funds to bet on asset prices and fail to maintain a sufficient margin to cover their positions. Exchanges then forcibly close positions to prevent further losses, a built-in risk feature that often results in chain reactions during volatile moves.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/13/single-bitcoin-trader-loses-200m-as-crypto-bulls-see-1b-liquidations,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Trading|Top Stories|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T08:10:15,"Bitcoin sees the biggest movement into accumulation wallets","Inflows of Bitcoin into accumulation wallets continue, with no pressure to capitulate or take profits. Buying from wallets with over 10 BTC reached their highest levels in the year to date. Bitcoin accumulation addresses saw rapid inflows in the past few days, despite the price spike. Over 30K BTC were bought up and sent to addresses that were extremely conservative about moving their coins. In total, accumulation addresses absorbed $3.3B, or 30,754 BTC. Currently, accumulation and even occasional buying are absorbing all newly mined coins, while also drawing down the reserves of OTC desks and exchanges. The recent wave of buying continued even at prices above $109,000. Bitcoin is still in accumulation mode, though sinking slightly to $104,578. Accumulation is happening while anticipating a larger rally in 2025, with $120,000 the next target. Accumulation addresses are relatively old, and have an average accumulation price of $64,000. However, newer accumulation addresses are also added, even near peak prices. Based on CryptoQuant data, over 2.91M BTC are now held in accumulation addresses with different ages. In 2025, inflows to accumulation addresses exhibited a higher baseline, with more regular stacking. There is also a growth trend in buying more Bitcoin , as inflows reached peak levels for the year to date. Bitcoin accumulation wallets had higher baseline activity in 2025, recently reaching peak inflows for the year to date. | Source: CryptoQuant The recent data confirms the trend where despite the near-peak valuations, whales are not taking profits. BTC spot markets still show long-term confidence, despite the short-term volatility with derivative trading. The crypto fear and greed index switched to 51 points, signaling a neutral attitude, down from the recent levels of extreme greed. However, spot accumulation can continue under different market conditions. BTC accumulation boosted by the treasury narrative The recent Bitcoin buying is a mix of anonymous whales and high-profile corporate buyers. Previous trends showed retail was hardly active above $90,000 per BTC, with most of the accumulation coming from whales and other large-scale wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC. Corporate buyers and funds can also afford to keep absorbing Bitcoin even near peak prices. Treasuries already contain 3.41M BTC, with active buying from some of the high-profile holders in the past week. Even smaller corporate buyers have taken up to 5,000 BTC off the market in a single day. In the past month, 20 companies added Bitcoin to their public balances, with more announcements and plans to finance Bitcoin acquisitions with debt or equity. The idea of a Bitcoin strategic reserve is also brought back to crypto projects. Recently, the Polkadot community raised a proposal to build a tBTC reserve, buying and holding wrapped coins for the long term. Part of the Bitcoin accumulation may also be due to DeFi protocols and other types of collateral wallets. As Bitcoin becomes more valuable, on-chain activity is slower, while some protocols are offering a way to tap the Bitcoin value without selling. Solana is also becoming one of the venues for wrapped Bitcoin. A total of 4,726 BTC is now held on Solana in the form of tBTC , with 75% growth for the whole of 2025. Additionally, Bitcoin staking and other DeFi protocols are holding up coins with no intention to sell.
