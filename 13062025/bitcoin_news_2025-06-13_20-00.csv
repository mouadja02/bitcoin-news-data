2025-06-13T17:51:36,"Ethereum ETFs See Record Inflows as ETH Closes on $3K","BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the charge with $80 million in net inflows, signaling strong investor demand. Why is Ethereum Witnessing an Uptick in ETF Inflows The last time Ethereum ETF inflows topped $125 million was on February 2, when investors poured $276 million into BlackRock’s ETHA with the altcoin trading at $2,900 then. Spot Ethereum ETFs have raked in $745 million during an 11-day surge, pushing total net inflows since their July debut to $3.5 billion. Product and regulatory milestones are part of the factors igniting the Ethereum ETF fire. For instance, Invesco recently filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking within its ETH ETF, which would give investors both price exposure and yield. Furthermore, Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade has the potential of boosting ETF interest by improving wallet usability and transaction efficiency. Therefore, a mix of regulatory optimism like staking in ETFs, technical upgrades, and consistent institutional flows are propelling Ethereum into the spotlight right now. Coupled with its dominant DeFi infrastructure and strong price dynamics, Ethereum ETFs are attracting fresh capital at scale. Ethereum’s Institutional Momentum Gains Steam Even though ETH is experiencing a pullback at the $2,530 level, the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization continues eyeing the psychological price of $3,000 . Where is Ethereum getting its backing from? Well, institutional demand is surging as Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin in derivatives markets, with sophisticated investors betting on ETH’s long-term growth and its pivotal role bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The COO of crypto exchange OKX Lennix Lai acknowledged, “Ethereum is overshadowing BTC on our perpetual futures market, with ETH accounting for 45.2% of trading volume over the past week. BTC, by comparison, sits at 38.1%.” Ethereum Futures Open Interest Smashes $20B Barrier Ether futures open interest has surged to an unprecedented all‑time high, now exceeding $20 billion. Leading on-chain metrics provider Glassnode acknowledged , “ETH futures open interest (cash-margined) just hit a new all-time high - topping $20B. Despite a slight pullback from the $2.8K levels, leverage continues to build as traders load up using stablecoins.” What’s Driving the Spike? Heavy Leverage & Speculation Traders are increasingly employing cash‑margined futures with stablecoins, layering on more leverage. This can be shown by the fact that open interest is at historic-high levels. Institutional Inflows & Whale Activity Institutional investors, most notably BlackRock, are ramping up ETH accumulation—some $163.6 million in the last two weeks alone. On‑chain analytics firm Lookonchain reports major whale distributions and withdrawals from exchanges, indicating a shift toward long-term stakeholding. Retail Engagement Retail traders appear to be returning, with futures trading frequency among small investors climbing above the one-year average. This resurgence is in stark contrast to diminished activity in Bitcoin’s on‑chain metrics. Price Context and Outlook Despite the surge in open interest, ETH remains below its key resistance of $2,800–$3,000, trading at the $2,500 zone . Analysts suggest that breaking above $2,800 could open the way toward $3,000 and beyond, though heightened risk awaits should the market cool. Conclusion With all eyes glued to ETH $3,000, the largest altcoin continues to enjoy various bullish on-chain metrics ranging from skyrocketing ETF inflows to historic high open interest. Even though a bullish June 2025 outlook is taking center stage, thanks to robust sentiment and potential upside, holding the psychological price of $2,500 will be key when it comes to determining the next move that Ethereum makes.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9566/ethereum-et-fs-see-record-inflows-as-eth-closes-on-3-k,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T17:49:16,"Charles Hoskinson floats $100m ADA treasury reboot to stabilize Cardano ecosystem","With just $31 million in stablecoins against $356 million in total value locked, Cardano’s founder has proposed unprecedented treasury diversification into Bitcoin and native dollar-pegged assets to boost the network’s decentralized finance and stablecoin ecosystem. On June 12, Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson proposed the idea in a YouTube video of swapping $100 million worth of Cardano ( ADA ) tokens for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and native stablecoins USDM and USDA to strengthen the ecosystem. Hoskinson framed the treasury overhaul as a strategic bet on Cardano’s future as a multi-asset financial ecosystem. Drawing inspiration from sovereign wealth funds in Norway and Abu Dhabi, he argued that converting a portion of ADA’s treasury into yield-generating assets would unlock liquidity and signal serious confidence to institutional players. You might also like: Bitcoin is oversold after Israeli strike on Iran: analyst A strategic fix for Cardano’s liquidity imbalance In his remarks, Hoskinson addressed the stark disparity between Cardano’s treasury composition and its decentralized finance ambitions. His argument stemmed from what he termed Cardano’s “stablecoin drought”, a glaring imbalance that’s stifling development. “We have a treasury with about $1.5 billion of ADA, and yet there’s only about $30 million of stablecoins in the entire Cardano ecosystem,” he said. “That’s a problem.” For context, while Ethereum boasts $190 in stablecoins for every $100 of TVL, Cardano lags far behind with just $9. “This isn’t just lagging behind; it’s choking our ecosystem,” Hoskinson argued. According to him, the proposed conversion aims to boost stablecoin reserves by targeting a 33% to 40% stablecoin-to-TVL ratio and to prime Bitcoin-focused decentralized finance by allocating $25 million to $50 million to Bitcoin to attract yield-seeking holders. Hoskinson also believes the move could improve the chances of Cardano-native stablecoins being listed on tier-two and tier-three exchanges. While some traders on X voiced concern that liquidating $100 million in ADA would crash the market, Hoskinson dismissed the skepticism with a chuckle, claiming, “ADA’s liquidity can swallow this without a 1% price blip.” He emphasized that the proposed treasury shift wouldn’t be a reckless exchange dump but a carefully managed operation using time-weighted average price algorithms and over-the-counter desks, the same tools institutional players use to quietly shift nine-figure positions. “This isn’t some meme coin we’re talking about,” he stressed. Whether the move turns Cardano into a decentralized finance powerhouse or backfires depends largely on timing and sentiment management.

2025-06-13T17:37:51,"India cracks down on crypto tax evasion in enforcement push","India’s Income Tax Department has launched a fresh crackdown on potential tax evasion and money laundering tied to virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. According to government officials and local reporting , the department has identified individuals and entities engaging in crypto transactions who failed to comply with the Income Tax Act, 1961. The Central Board of Direct Taxes recently sent emails to thousands of individuals, urging them to review and update their income tax returns if crypto income was misreported or omitted. The initiative is part of CBDT’s broader NUDGE campaign, aimed at encouraging voluntary compliance. This marks the third NUDGE campaign in six months, following earlier drives that focused on foreign asset disclosures and false political donation deductions. Although India does not recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender, income from VDA transfers has been taxable since April 2022. Under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act, crypto income is taxed at a flat 30% without deductions, except for the cost of acquisition. Losses cannot be offset or carried forward. You might also like: Monero crypto remains bullish as price corrects into high-probability value zone India’s mismatching tax documents Officials say discrepancies are being uncovered through data analytics, including mismatches between income tax returns and tax deducted at source filings by crypto exchanges, or Virtual Asset Service Providers. Some taxpayers reportedly failed to file the mandatory Schedule VDA or declared crypto income at lower tax rates, while others wrongly claimed deductions. The crackdown comes amid broader concerns over the use of unaccounted income in high-risk crypto investments. While the government is working on a discussion paper to explore regulatory options for VDAs, including a possible ban, it has clarified that taxation does not imply formal approval of cryptocurrencies.

Both of these assets are arguably the premier safe-haven flights to safety. With the Middle Eastern conflict possibly about to escalate, can these assets rebound to all-time highs? Poorly correlated but heading in the same direction Even though both gold and Bitcoin can be categorised as safe-haven assets, the correlation between the two of them could be said to be volatile and inconsistent. Even so, while gold has been rising of late, as Bitcoin has been undergoing a correction, a recent bounce from Bitcoin has put the king of the cryptocurrencies back into the reckoning for a return to all-time highs. Gold confirms bull flag breakout Source: TradingView The daily chart for gold illustrates how it was moving inside of a rising channel for a long period of time. A breakout of this channel and confirmation have contributed to the development of a bull flag, a breakout of which has been confirmed and now the price is climbing higher. The measured move out of the bull flag is to $3,700. Bitcoin bounces sharply from support Source: TradingView The daily Bitcoin chart shows the relatively sharp climb up from $74,000 to the $112,000 all-time high. Following such a climb it was only natural for the price to consolidate sideways for an extended period. This resulted in the price going as low as $100,400. Since then, the price spiked, and more recently with the Middle Eastern conflict, it fell back down to support at $102,800. However, the collapse was bought back up very quickly, leaving a long candle wick behind and a bullish pinball candle. Gold or Bitcoin to take the lead from here? Source: TradingView The Bitcoin/Gold chart in the daily time frame reveals a real battle between the two sound money assets. Going back a lot further than the above chart shows, Bitcoin has been winning that battle hands down for most of its history. That said, Bitcoin has been unable to consistently stay above the Bitcoin/Gold price of 37 ounces, last set in April 2021. With central banks still buying a lot of gold, and with Bitcoin treasuries being set up left, right, and centre, it remains to be seen which of the two assets will take the lead from here.

It will focus on integrating financial services with innovation and expanding real-world application scenarios for digital assets. At the 2025 Caixin Summer Summit, Chan confirmed that the city had already launched licensing systems for digital asset trading platforms and stablecoins. Hong Kong was also advancing new regulations for custody and OTC services. Chan previously said the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) was reviewing virtual asset derivatives for professional investors, starting with BTC and ETH Perpetuals. Hong Kong released its first policy statement on the development of digital assets in October 2022, covering the regulation of crypto exchanges and the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Chan believes that the future of digital tech growth in Hong Kong will be powered by blockchain and Web3 technologies. The Financial Secretary also said that legislation for stablecoin regulation was set for imminent passage. He added that he and his colleagues at the Financial Services & the Treasury Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) were working hard to get the relevant licensing regime to go live this year. Chan says it is essential to explore digital finance in the real economy Chan said financial innovation was where Hong Kong must win in order for the city to become a financial powerhouse. He added that it was essential to explore ways of utilizing digital finance to better support the real economy’s development, including in finance and cross-border financial services. Chan explained that the convergence of Web3 and AI was unlocking new frontiers in finance. Decentralized AI algorithms enhanced credit assessments, audited smart contracts more precisely, and delivered personalized investment strategies. Beyond finance, the technology streamlined supply chains transformed healthcare data management, and created new immersive gaming experiences. Web3 and AI were transforming businesses and public services, driving innovation and efficiency at every turn. “We will unveil a second policy statement on the development of virtual assets. It will cover how to make use of Web3 to fast-track the development of traditional financial services, empower the real economy, and strengthen the application of digital asset technologies.” – Paul Chan , Financial Secretary of Hong Kong The Financial Secretary also said the city offered a stable environment for investors amid a complicated geopolitical landscape. He added that the HK government was also proactively attracting more established mainland enterprises to list in the SAR (Special Administrative Region) to support its overseas expansion plans.

The city’s financial and technology sectors were also positioning themselves to use stablecoins in traditional modes of finance. The HK Legislative Council passed the bill regulating stablecoins on May 21, but the government did not announce when it would take effect until the June 6 statement. Daniel Tse, Managing Director of Futu Securities International, said investors were becoming increasingly interested in stablecoins, adding that his company’s platform had seen a surge in stablecoin-linked investments. Daniel Tse also said his company viewed stablecoins as a promising avenue for growth and innovation in the brokerage industry. He added that clients could trade tokenized intellectual properties or paintings in the future, creating new opportunities for investors and brokers. Wu Tianhua, founder and CEO of Tiger Brokers, disclosed that his company was very optimistic about the increasing demand for a connection between Web2 and Web3, prompting the development of its one-stop platform.

Notably, Nvidia fell 1.5%, and Apple declined 1% following the attacks. Simultaneously, investors rotated into traditional safe havens such as gold and the dollar. Consequently, crypto was among the most affected asset classes by Middle East tensions. The overall crypto market cap was down 2.7%, while Bitcoin (BTC) was down 2.19%, falling to $105k.

2025-06-13T17:22:21,"Monero crypto remains bullish as price corrects into high-probability value zone","Monero has posted a powerful bullish breakout, shifting its market structure and confirming a change in the character of price action. Following the impulsive rally, XMR is now undergoing a correction, one that may provide the ideal foundation for a continuation toward higher targets. After breaking market structure with a strong upward surge, Monero ( XMR ) has entered a corrective phase, which is natural and expected following such impulsive price action. The key to the current move lies in where the correction finds support. Technical confluence zones offer valuable insight into where buyers may re-enter the market, and for Monero, that zone appears to be forming around the $269 region. Key technical points Bullish Breakout Confirmed: XMR broke above key resistance and confirmed a shift in trend with higher highs and higher lows. Healthy Pullback in Progress: A correction is now underway, setting up for a potential higher low formation. $269 Support Confluence Zone: This level aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, VWAP support, and the 200-day moving average. Upside Targets at $338 and $417: These resistance levels remain open if the bullish structure continues from support. XMRUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Monero’s impulsive rally signaled a clear shift in market behavior, breaking the prior range and confirming bullish intent. With price now pulling back, this phase should not be viewed as weakness, but rather a viable correction in a strong uptrend. The $269 level is now the critical support area to monitor. It brings together several high-probability technical factors: 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the recent swing VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) support The 200-day moving average, which serves as a long-term dynamic support Historical high-timeframe structure This confluence creates a strong foundation for bulls to defend. A bounce from this region would confirm a higher low formation, in line with the newly established bullish structure.

This zone acts as the likely candidate for a higher low, setting the stage for another leg upward. Confirmation from this level could propel XMR toward $338 and eventually $417.

It will cross the $10 mark in 2027 and the $20 mark in 2029. TON (The Open Network) is a decentralized protocol designed by Telegram and created by the community. The protocol is designed as a distributed supercomputer, or “super server,” that consists of TON Blockchain , TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. The native token for the network is called Toncoin. “Will TON ever go up? Can TON reach the $10 mark? Where will TON be in five years?” These are the questions traders and investors ask.

Recent news Telegram’s deal with xAI, which would see Elon Musk’s AI company integrate into Telegram, is a work in progress despite an announcement from Pavel Durov. While Durov confirmed that the deal is yet to be signed, the Telegram founder said there is an “agreement in principle,” which might be why TON still has significant support at the $3.0. Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Why is TON up? The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market, which saw Bitcoin rise above $100,000. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Will TON reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. Does Toncoin have a future? TON has had a bullish run since its inception despite seasonal market corrections.

2025-06-13T17:17:08,"Former CFTC Chairman Talks About Bitcoin and XRP! ""BTC and XRP Are More Than a Possibility for the US!""","Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo, appointed by US President Donald Trump during his previous presidency, spoke about Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP. Speaking at the XRPL Apex 2025 conference in Singapore, Chris Giancarlo noted that the US government is increasingly interested in the idea of issuing crypto-backed bonds. Bitcoin and XRP Are More Than a Possibility for the US! At this point, Chris Giancarlo stated that the US could issue Bitcoin and XRP-backed crypto bonds, and said that BTC and XRP-backed US crypto bonds are more than a possibility. Known as the “Godfather of Crypto” for his early support of the industry, Giancarlo said the current Trump administration has taken a very different approach to digital assets than its predecessors and sees their long-term value. At this point, Giancarlo pointed out that in recent years, federal agencies have often sold seized cryptocurrencies and said, “This strategy has changed during the Trump era. The administration now believes that holding digital assets can strengthen the United States financially.” Stating that he supports the strategic Bitcoin reserve, Giancarlo argued that the BTC sales were a great loss for the United States. “If the US government had not held on to the Bitcoins it seized a few years ago and sold them, it could have reduced its national debt by a significant amount. “In fact, the government could do this without changing any relevant laws. Federal agencies already have the authority to hold seized digital assets, and that authority is now being actively used.” As is well known, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which currently contains over 200,000 BTC worth approximately $22 billion. These assets were seized through criminal and civil forfeitures and will be held as long-term assets similar to gold. Trump also launched a Digital Asset Stock to hold other altcoins besides Bitcoin, such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T17:15:10,"Qubetics, Stellar, Monero: Top Crypto to Invest in for Short Term After Bitcoin’s $645M Liquidation Shock","Is the latest market shakeup a sign of what’s ahead or just a reset before the next leg up? Bitcoin’s dramatic fall below $106K has sent shockwaves across the digital asset sector, triggering over $645 million in liquidations and prompting short-term participants to seek immediate gains with reduced exposure risk. This kind of volatility doesn’t just test market sentiment—it filters out tokens with no real purpose. In this environment, only projects with concrete use cases, technical strength, and sound economic models are drawing serious capital. Among the few turning heads, Qubetics ($TICS) is standing out for offering utility that meets current market demands—especially when rising gas fees and sluggish networks are becoming more than just an inconvenience. Qubetics directly addresses longstanding cross-chain limitations by creating a Web3 aggregator that removes the isolated silos most networks still operate in. This protocol enables seamless interoperability across major chains, allowing users and businesses to move value and data in real time. While Qubetics gears up for its final presale stage, Stellar is pushing forward by onboarding PayPal’s stablecoin PYUSD, giving its network a meaningful adoption milestone. Meanwhile, Monero maintains strong bullish indicators with projections pointing to double-digit short-term returns. These trends highlight how select tokens—those driving clear utility or chart-backed performance—are stepping up. For those searching for the top crypto to invest in for short term, the right plays are no longer based on speculation—they’re anchored in functionality and timely market movement. How Qubetics Delivers Functional Use Cases That Compete in Today’s Market The promise of blockchain has always been about decentralization and transparency, but most protocols still fall short when it comes to uniting networks into one usable system. Qubetics flips that narrative by becoming the first Web3 aggregator that allows major chains like Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and more to work together through a unified protocol. This removes the need for redundant systems, duplicate wallets, or manual swapping processes that create inefficiency for both users and enterprises. Use cases are broad and grounded in real-world functionality. A logistics firm in Germany can initiate payment in BTC, instantly move funds via Qubetics into Solana for smart contract-based delivery verification, and then close the transaction using Ethereum. Similarly, healthcare providers transmitting sensitive data across decentralized cloud infrastructure can rely on Qubetics to bridge data securely between compliance-specific chains. For content creators receiving global payments, the ability to instantly convert stablecoins and deploy royalties via any supported blockchain makes Qubetics not only competitive—it’s necessary. These applications support the token’s positioning as the top crypto to invest in for short term by solving issues that competitors still struggle with: network isolation, speed, and real-time settlement. Why Qubetics Presale Is the Top Crypto to Invest in for Short Term Qubetics has officially entered its final presale phase—Stage 37. With a fixed price of $0.3370, over 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold and the project has raised more than $18 million to date. More than 27,900 token holders are already on board, and just 10 million tokens remain before the listing price increases to $0.40. That pricing structure alone offers early adopters an instant 20% return once it goes live. The recent overhaul of Qubetics’ tokenomics has cut total supply from over 4 billion down to 1.36 billion, while increasing public sale allocation to 38.55%. This ensures wider access, stronger decentralization, and long-term scarcity. With these updates, early buyers at the $0.3370 mark stand to see immediate gains and potential exponential growth. For example, a $5,000 allocation today will purchase approximately 14,846 tokens. Once listed at $0.40, this holding jumps to a value of around $5,938—an instant boost. And if $TICS climbs to projected figures between $5 and $10 in the next market cycle, the same $5K investment could grow to between $74,230 and $148,460. This combination of token scarcity, active demand, and high functionality underscores why Qubetics presale stands out as the best crypto presale and remains the top crypto to invest in for short term right now. PYUSD Launch on Stellar Network Could Expand Real-World Stablecoin Adoption PayPal has confirmed that its USD-backed stablecoin, PYUSD, will be integrated onto the Stellar network pending approval from the New York Department of Financial Services. This move unlocks low-cost, fast-settlement payments across Stellar’s infrastructure—an important shift as businesses demand faster merchant solutions. By rolling out PYUSD on Stellar, PayPal aims to allow users to fund wallets, send payments, and receive merchant settlements with a level of flexibility previously out of reach on traditional rails. The integration will also support corporate working capital functions, such as bulk payouts and financial liquidity services for vendors. With Stellar’s known strengths in speed and near-zero fees, this collaboration with PayPal marks a step toward institutional-scale adoption. These developments bring value to Stellar not just from a branding perspective but from tangible use case integration, making it part of a short list of protocols benefiting directly from fiat-stablecoin bridges in real commerce. Technical Indicators Suggest Monero Could Deliver Double-Digit Short-Term Gains Monero is currently trading near $309.50 and holds a short-term bullish outlook. Based on current models, the token is forecasted to reach as high as $324.06 by June 23—representing a potential upside of 6.22%. The Fear & Greed Index registers at 61, reflecting market confidence. More importantly, Monero has posted a 79.52% increase over the past year, and has stayed in the green 53% of the days over the last month. That’s a performance few privacy tokens can match in the current environment. Further analysis shows a price potential of between $304.64 and $455.64 over the next 12 to 18 months, which places Monero as a contender for short-term movement with long-term benefits. Its consistent trading patterns and positive sentiment across multiple indicators suggest this token is still earning real traction. The projected 38.33% surge into 2026 makes it a compelling case for participants seeking stable charts paired with active community support. Why These Three Tokens Are Leading This Month’s Watchlist Bitcoin’s liquidation wave forced market participants to take a harder look at which assets hold structural integrity. Amid that scrutiny, Qubetics delivers with its Web3 aggregator model and active final-stage presale. Stellar gains traction via a real-world partnership with PayPal and stablecoin access, while Monero continues to ride strong technicals and forecasted upside. Each coin addresses current market demands through distinct advantages—be it Stellar’s real-time scalability, Monero’s proven privacy framework, or Stellar’s rapidly expanding footprint in global payments. For those seeking the top crypto to invest in for short term, Qubetics delivers a rare early-access opportunity through its engineered scarcity, cross-chain functionality, and ongoing public allocation. With its presale approaching completion, now is the time to join this best crypto presale before its listing phase reshapes its valuation profile. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the top crypto to invest in for short term? Qubetics currently leads based on its final presale phase, functional use case, and immediate return on listing. Why is Qubetics presale attracting attention now? With a fixed price of $0.3370 and a listing at $0.40, it offers a 20% ROI at launch and long-term value based on reduced supply. What’s driving Monero’s short-term price potential? Bullish forecasts, a strong technical pattern, and 79.52% annual growth make Monero a solid short-term pick.

The company aims to kick off the project in the second half of 2025, subject to regulatory clearance and market conditions. It will tap equity sales, strategic investments and structured deals to gather funds. Trident’s $500 Million Plan Trident wants to sell shares and work with big investors. It hopes to snag $500 million. That money will go straight into buying XRP tokens. Along with that, the company will set up staking to earn extra returns on its stash. Based on reports, talks are already under way with major crypto groups to lock in the best deals. Singapore-based Trident Digital (NASDAQ: TDTH) plans to raise $500M to establish the world’s first large-scale corporate XRP reserve, involving long-term XRP holding, staking, and deep engagement in the Ripple ecosystem to strengthen its decentralized finance strategy.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 12, 2025 Building A Corporate Reserve The goal is to keep XRP as a long-term reserve. Trident’s CEO, Soon Huat Lim, feels that using blockchain tools can modernize how companies handle cash. He has promised clear updates to shareholders at every step. Those updates will follow the strict rules that public firms must meet. This push could show other businesses how to blend new tech with regular finance. Joining The Treasury Trend Other firms are doing the same. Webus International, which is also on Nasdaq and based in China, filed to set up a $300 million XRP fund. It plans to use loans and credit lines rather than issue new shares. VivoPower International, a sustainable energy group, has already pledged $100 million to buy XRP through a private round of $120 million. Then there’s Wellgistics Health, a US-based drug distributor. It grabbed a $50 million credit line for XRP purchases. Hyperscale Data Inc., via its Ault Capital arm, will add up to $10 million by year-end. Challenges Ahead For Trident Big token buys can shake up the market and push prices higher. There’s also ongoing legal debate over XRP in markets around the world. Investors are watching closely. Trident’s stock dipped almost 40% after the initial news broke, as some worried about share dilution and token swings.

2025-06-13T17:00:52,"Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000 Imminent As Fibonacci Resistance Is At Stake","Bitcoin’s recent price action has shown signs of fading momentum three weeks after reaching a new all-time high of $111,814. The leading cryptocurrency climbed back above $110,000 on Monday off the back of cooling U.S. inflation data and a temporarily weaker dollar. However, the rally was short-lived. Profit-taking, compounded by geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, has contributed to a risk-off environment that pushed Bitcoin down below $105,000 in the past 24 hours. This sharp reversal highlights a significant technical level that could decide whether Bitcoin sustains its uptrend or enters a crash towards $94,000. Final Fibonacci Resistance Holding The Line According to a new analysis shared by pseudonymous crypto analyst XForceGlobal on the social media platform X, Bitcoin’s current corrective structure could deepen if it fails to overcome the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance level. The analyst highlighted that the bullish impulse that carried Bitcoin now appears to be losing steam. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000 The price zone around $110,500, which is marked by the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance, has not been convincingly breached, casting doubt on the strength of the current wave structure. Bitcoin tested this level twice earlier this week, and, as noted by the analyst, if this resistance level fails to break soon, there is a slight possibility of a deeper pullback. If this pullback does occur, this would lead to the formation of a corrective wave C, and with distinct symmetry in an ABC corrective pattern. In this case of the corrective Wave C playing out, the next central area of interest lies around the $94,000 level, an area that aligns with the completion of a larger impulse Wave 2. Wave 2 Dip To $96,000 Before Bullish Wave 3 Begins The rundown of a corrective Wave 2 and a bearish impulse Wave 2 is based on the outlook of Bitcoin failing to clear the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance at $110,000. Applying the Elliott wave count on the current price action shows that the recent push to $111,814 all-time high was a larger bullish impulse Wave 1. However, the ensuing correction since then has also played out in the form of a sub-wave 123 structure, and an ABC corrective pattern. Altogether, these are expected to make up a larger corrective impulse Wave 2. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Crash To $31,000 Amid 5-Wave Impulse Completion Nevertheless, XForceGlobal noted that Bitcoin is still in a highly bullish structure on the macro level. If the price action plays out this way, the next move after the impulse Wave 2 to $94,000 would be a reversal upwards with bullish impulse Wave 3. In this case, the analyst projected an expansion move that would send Bitcoin to another all-time high. Notably, the price target in this case would be a surge above $118,500. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,000, down by 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-13T17:00:39,"Is BlockDAG the Best Crypto ICO of 2025? Bitcoin Hyper, SUBBD, and Snorter Try to Keep Up as BDAG Nears $300M","Crypto presales in 2025 are on fire, but only a few projects show the kind of real traction and breakout potential that truly define the best crypto ICO of the year. As the landscape fills with bold promises, BlockDAG, Bitcoin Hyper, SUBBD, and Snorter show potential. BlockDAG, however, is delivering something far more tangible: infrastructure, adoption, and momentum. Forget the hype cycle, BlockDAG is building something foundational. It’s not a fleeting meme coin, but a high-throughput Layer 1 blockchain with full EVM compatibility and a growing user base. With $299 million raised already and over 22.4 billion BDAG coins sold, the numbers speak for themselves. The project’s current Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, with a launch target of $0.05. If you’re scanning for the best crypto ICO with real-world traction and deep market interest, this one’s at the top of the list. 1. BlockDAG: Leading the Charge as 2025’s Best Crypto ICO Candidate BlockDAG is rapidly becoming one of the most closely watched names in the 2025 presale cycle. Having already raised $299 million and sold 22.4 billion coins, BDAG is drawing serious attention from those looking for the best crypto ICO to get behind. The project’s Batch 29 price is currently $0.0276, with the launch price set at $0.05. That kind of pricing gap sets the stage for huge gains. But BlockDAG’s value goes beyond numbers. Its Layer 1 architecture merges DAG scalability with Proof-of-Work security, creating lightning-fast, low-cost transactions. Full EVM compatibility allows Ethereum-based apps to migrate without hurdles, giving developers more freedom to scale. The X1 Miner app is another key highlight. With 1.5 million downloads already, it’s enabling mobile-based mining that puts real coins into the hands of users daily. With its combination of tech, traction, and timing, BlockDAG is setting the pace for the best crypto ICO race in 2025. 2. Bitcoin Hyper: Fast and Focused Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper is gaining momentum as it introduces smart contract functionality and DeFi capabilities to Bitcoin via a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) foundation. By fusing Solana-speed confirmations with Bitcoin’s brand trust, this Layer 2 solution offers a compelling model. Its presale crossed $1 million in under a week. That kind of growth comes from serious features like up to 2000% staking APY, decentralized bridging, and zero private-sale dilution. A whale recently scooped $139K in tokens, signaling early institutional interest. Though it lacks BlockDAG’s scale, Bitcoin Hyper delivers a unique Layer 2 niche that might appeal to those looking for the best crypto ICO with Bitcoin roots and DeFi upside. 3. SUBBD: Web3 for the Creator Generation SUBBD is offering creators more than just a platform, it’s building a Web3 economy around content engagement. Using AI-enhanced features and smart contracts, the project allows users to monetize videos, live streams, and even real-time chat. So far, SUBBD has raised over $615K. Its $SUBBD token supports staking at 20% APY, and its presale price of $0.055 is aimed at early supporters ahead of a potential rise toward $0.30 post-launch. The roadmap is detailed, with a beta platform coming soon, and audits in place to verify integrity. For those interested in creator-focused platforms with solid tokenomics, SUBBD could emerge as one of the best crypto ICO picks for a Web3 content economy. It’s not at BlockDAG’s level of volume or reach, but it’s clearly carving a niche. 4. Snorter: Solana Trading Automation Inside Telegram Snorter is tapping into the red-hot Telegram bot trend, offering automated trading inside the app with Solana blockchain speed. It includes MEV protection, copy-trading features, and sniping tools that bring pro-level functions to retail traders. The project has raised over $650K, and more than 5 million $SNORT tokens are already staked with yields exceeding 500% APY. Backed by audits from Coinsult and SolidProof, Snorter is preparing for a Q3 launch with a goal of merging convenience with performance. While it may not have the infrastructure breadth of BlockDAG, Snorter brings serious utility to a growing crypto niche and could be a worthy addition to any best crypto ICO watchlist. Final Verdict: Which ICO Stands Out in 2025? The race to find the best crypto ICO of 2025 is heating up fast, but not all projects are built for the same outcome. Bitcoin Hyper delivers speed and Bitcoin-layer innovation. SUBBD empowers creators through tokenized tools. Snorter brings powerful automation to everyday traders. Yet only one project is ticking every major box: BlockDAG. With $299 million raised, 1.5 million users actively mining through the X1 app, a working EVM-compatible Layer 1 testnet, BlockDAG isn’t just promising, it’s already executing. If you’re looking for the best crypto ICO that offers infrastructure, scale, vision, and near-term upside, BlockDAG is leading the field, and the opportunity window is closing fast.

The increase is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1, 2025. The price increase comes at a testing time for the broader crypto ecosystem thanks to an escalation in Middle East tensions after Israel conducted preemptive strikes against Iranian military and nuclear sites. Husky Inu (HINU) Registers Latest Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) has just registered the latest price jump of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00017941 to $0.00017993. The jump is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The pre-launch phase allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date draws closer. It is the next strategic step in the Husky Inu roadmap, designed to raise additional capital to fund ongoing development, platform improvements, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase began with the HINU token priced at $0.00015000. Thanks to a dynamic pricing mechanism, the HINU token has seen regular price increases. The pre-launch phase will end once the project meets its stated goal of $1.2M or the HINU tokens sell out. Husky Inu (HINU) is also closing in on the $800,000 milestone as interest in the project soars. Surging investor interest has seen HINU emerge as a viable alternative to enter the crypto space, allowing it to position itself as a viable alternative to players like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Dogwifhat (WIF). The project has raised $799,521 so far and is expected to cross $800,000 over the weekend. Crypto Market Plunges As Middle East Conflict Escalates Bitcoin (BTC) plunged into bearish territory late on Thursday/early Friday as Israeli airstrikes on major Iranian centers escalated tensions in the Middle East. Hopes of a move to a new all-time high were dashed as investors attempted to grapple with geopolitical realities, triggering a sharp retreat across the crypto market. The sell-off also led to the liquidation of over $427 million in long positions in the past 24 hours. BTC is down 2%, trading around $105,500. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $100,424 before rising to current levels. Meanwhile, ETH is down nearly 7%, struggling to stay above $2,500. Ripple (XRP) is down 4.50%, while Solana (SOL) is down over 7%, having slipped below $150. Polkadot (DOT), Toncoin (TON), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have also registered significant declines.

2025-06-13T16:55:02,"Trump Calls Fed Chair Jerome Powell a ‘Numbskull,’ Claims Lack of Rate Cuts Are Costing US $600,000,000,000 a Year","US President Donald Trump has more insults for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. At a bill signing ceremony on Thursday, Trump claimed the government would save $600 billion a year in short-term debt payments if Powell lowered the federal funds rate by 2 percentage points. In May, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it planned to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5%, arguing that it was the most suitable level to achieve both maximum employment and controlled inflation. The Fed has held interest rates steady since December, when it cut the rate by 0.25%. Trump says he’s not planning on firing Powell, but he slammed the Fed chair for not adjusting course. “We’re going to spend $600 billion a year – $600 billion – because of one numbskull that sits there [and says] ‘I don’t see enough reason to cut the rates now.’ And the problem he’s got, and I explained to him… cut your rates now, there’s no inflation. We got it down, we got prices down.” Inflation rose by 2.4% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was slightly less than the 2.5% increase predicted by economists, CBS reports . Powell met with Trump last month following a barrage of insults from the president. The Fed, however, noted in a statement following the meeting that Powell did not discuss interest rate expectations with the president. “At the President’s invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments, including for growth, employment, and inflation. Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook. Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not slashing interest rates, saying earlier in May that communicating with the Fed chair was “like talking to a wall.” “The Bank of England cut. China cut. Everybody’s cutting but him. I don’t know, we’ll see what happens. It’s a shame. I call him ‘Too Late.’ Too Late Powell, that’s his nickname. And it’s a shame, it’s ridiculous… he’s always too late. But in this case, it’s not going to matter that much because our country is so strong, we’re so powerful in terms of economic strength and what we’ve done.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-13T16:36:16,"Why Doesn’t Ripple Adopt an XRP Reserve Strategy If XRP Is Going to $8,000 and Replacing SWIFT: Gary Cardone","Bitcoin critics are raising questions about the growing trend of crypto treasury strategies involving assets like XRP and Ethereum, in addition to BTC. The debate gained momentum after SharpLink Gaming, one of the first companies to adopt an Ethereum-based corporate reserve model, suffered a shocking 73% drop in after-hours trading. The collapse has reignited discussions about which digital assets are truly suitable for institutional treasuries.In a tweet, Bitcoin proponent Steven Lubka pointed to SharpLink’s plunge as evidence that BTC remains the only reliable reserve asset. His statement suggests that altcoins like Ethereum are unsuitable for long-term corporate balance sheets, and financial expert Gary Cardone agrees with this opinion. Cardone weighed in on the conversation by turning the spotlight on Ripple. He questioned why Ripple has not transitioned into a company with an XRP reserve strategy, especially if the token is expected to appreciate dramatically and replace SWIFT as the global payments backbone.Specifically, Cardone argues that if XRP truly has the potential to reach heights like $8,000, as suggested by some, then Ripple should already be leveraging the token as its core reserve asset. For him, the fact that Ripple has not done so raises doubts about how much confidence the company itself places in XRP's long-term value.XRP Army ReactsUnsurprisingly, Cardone's comments did not go unanswered by XRP enthusiasts. Jason Jude called the criticism both contradictory and uninformed. He pointed out the irony of demanding that Ripple move to an XRP reserve model while critics often complain that Ripple already owns too much XRP.This commentary highlighted the inconsistency among critics who question Ripple's 40% XRP holdings yet expect the company to rely even more heavily on it as a reserve strategy.Others accused Cardone of letting his Bitcoin-only bias cloud his judgment. Several community members argued that dismissing XRP could become one of his biggest investment regrets.Corporate Momentum Builds Behind XRPDespite the criticism, XRP continues to gain traction as a treasury asset among Nasdaq-listed firms. Several companies actively integrate XRP into their financial strategies, aligning with the push to diversify beyond Bitcoin.For instance, Trident Digital Tech Holdings is raising $500 million to build one of the first major XRP treasuries. Also, Webus International in China is seeking $300 million in credit and plans to integrate Ripple's payment solutions.VivoPower International has earmarked $100 million from its latest private round, while Wellgistics Health has secured a $50 million credit line for XRP accumulation.This growing institutional interest suggests that some companies are betting on XRP as a payment utility and a long-term store of value.Treasury Strategy Works for AltcoinsMeanwhile, the broader crypto community is also challenging Lubka’s claim that BTC is the only viable treasury asset in the wake of SharpLink Gaming's fallout. Specifically, Solana enthusiasts cited data showing that DeFi Development Corp has experienced a massive 3,657% year-to-date gain after adopting a SOL-based strategy months ago. Even SharpLink Gaming’s monthly chart shows an impressive 882% gain, undermining the narrative that Bitcoin proponents are pushing.https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1933340615808594160",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/13/why-doesnt-ripple-adopt-an-xrp-reserve-strategy-if-xrp-is-going-to-8000-and-replacing-swift-gary-cardone/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-doesnt-ripple-adopt-an-xrp-reserve-strategy-if-xrp-is-going-to-8000-and-replacing-swift-gary-cardone,"BTC|ETH|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare

In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $7.77 Market cap $163.07 24-hour trading volume $104.07M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $8.77 24-hour low $7.38 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 10.72% 50-day SMA $9.37 200-day SMA $17.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 61 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) ORDI price analysis: ORDI turns bearish On the day of writing (June 13), ORDI’s price dropped by 10.37% in 24 hours and 33.30% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume rose by 54.04% in 24 hours, as more traders positioned themselves in the bear market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDI/USD 1-day price chart. Source TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the William alligator trendlines, signaling a bearish market sentiment. The move comes as Bitcoin pulls back from $106,000. The signal and MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, with the histograms in negative territory signaling a bearish market. At the same time, the relative strength index shows that the price is in neutral territory at 41.15. It is oversold when it drops below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDI/USD 4-hour chart. Image source: TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI has reversed from last month’s high at $13.61 and is at $7.78, losing over 40% of its value. Its volatility is rising on the 4-hour timeframe.

ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is falling further as it corrects from the month’s high. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T16:22:26,"2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF Vs Competing Bitcoin Leverage","Summary BITX offers strong short-term returns and liquidity, but is not suitable for long-term holding due to leverage decay and high fees. Compared to peers, BITX leads in assets and volume, but lower-fee competitors like BITU and BTCL have outperformed on total return since July 2024. MSTR stock has delivered better long-term Bitcoin leverage than any 2x ETF, without the high management fees of BITX. While still bullish on Bitcoin, I advise caution with leverage now, as rising global conflict may pressure risk assets, including BTC. When I first covered the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BATS: BITX ) for Seeking Alpha back in late 2023 , I noted the fund offered juicy returns but that buyers of the ticker should be careful. As a leveraged fund, BITX is not intended for long-term holding and is designed for shorter-term trading. Still, given the sustained uptrend that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been in since the launch of BITX back late-June 2023, the fund's total return has actually been quite impressive for holders who have been hanging on this entire time. Data by YCharts While holding BITX since inception hasn't generated double the 250% return of BTC since it has certainly outperformed the coin itself. I have to repeat again that holding BITX this long is not what the fund is intended for. And buying the fund during large price surges can actually be quite detrimental to investor returns. But as the chart above shows, there are times when going long BTX offers a sizable upside. Could we be at another one of those times right now? In this update, we'll look at BITX compared to several other 'leveraged Bitcoin' options that the market has to offer. We'll also get into my technical view of BTC at this point in time and look at how Bitcoin reacted to the escalation in the Middle East during the morning hours of June 13th. BITX vs. Peers BITX is not the only leveraged Bitcoin fund in the market. For this comparison, we'll stack BITX up against the following funds: Proshares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ) T-Rex 2x Long Bitcoin Daily Target ETF ( BTCL ) CoinShares/Valkyrie Bitcoin Futures Leveraged Strategy ETF ( BTFX ) Fund Comparison BITX BITU BTCL BTFX Issuer Volatility Shares Trust ProShares Rex Valkyrie ETF Trust II Inception 06/27/2023 04/01/2024 07/09/2024 02/21/2024 Expense Ratio 1.90% 0.95% 0.95% 1.86% AUM $2.85B $1.17B $51.83M $16.91M Source: Seeking Alpha, June 13th In terms of assets under management, BITX is the clear winner of the four funds, with nearly $3 billion in AUM. BITU has just under $1.2 billion, while BTCL and BTFX don't even crack the $100 million threshold. BITX also happens to be the most expensive of the funds at 1.9%. My view is the expense matters more if you're planning to hold something for a long period of time. For leveraged funds like these, as long as the fees are somewhat close, holders shouldn't feel much of a difference in terms of total return. We'll get into that metric shortly. I think one of the reasons why BITX has such a large AUM advantage over the other funds - beyond simply benefiting from first mover advantage - is that it pays out monthly dividends: Dividends BITX BITU BTCL BTFX Dividend Yield (TTM) 11.61% 5.06% 3.96% - Dividend Rate (TTM) $6.32 $2.61 $2.12 - Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth 0 Years 0 Years 0 Years - Dividend Frequency Monthly Monthly None - Source: Seeking Alpha, June 13th At a trailing twelve-month yield of 11.6%, BITX might be more appealing to potential buyers due to its larger payout than each of the other funds. BTFX is the only one that doesn't pay a yield at all. Given three of these four funds pay out a yield and the varying expense ratios of the products, total return is an important consideration. In the chart below, I'm showing the total return of the four funds since the inception of the newest one, which is BTCL. If designed properly, these funds should generally perform in close tandem, and they do: Data by YCharts The out-performers are BITU and BTCL - given these are the two funds with the smallest expense ratios, this should not be surprising. What this tells us is that the yields offered by these funds are not strong enough reasons to hold leveraged funds longer than shareholders perhaps should. Another consideration is liquidity. As trading instruments, I would argue this matters far more than any dividend yield these products have to offer. Fund Liquidity BITX BITU BTCL BTFX AUM $2.85B $1.17B $51.83M $16.91M Average Daily Share Volume 7,499,749 2,231,130 82,910 6,615 Share Price $54.42 $51.53 $53.49 $52.78 Average Daily Dollar Volume $408.14M $114.97M $4.43M $349.16K Avg Vol/AUM* 14.3% 9.8% 7.7% 2.4% Source: Seeking Alpha, June 13th, *analyst's calculation Here, BITX has another large edge over the rest of the leveraged funds in the market. At 14.3% average daily volume to AUM, traders who buy BITX have a better chance of getting in and out of their trades at the prices they want due to the stronger level of liquidity that the fund has over peers. Just for kicks, we can also compare the total returns of these tickers to something like Strategy ( MSTR ) common stock. That company is using leverage to orchestrate a massive Bitcoin flywheel that is currently working quite well to positive feedback loop BTC prices higher. Data by YCharts Here we see that MSTR shares have actually worked better as 2x leverage on Bitcoin than any of the actual 2x leveraged funds have. While all of the leveraged funds have outperformed Bitcoin since the inception of BTCL in July 2024, only MSTR shares have generated price returns double that of BTC. In fact, the 190% return has actually been more than double the 83% return of Bitcoin. And the real kicker is, MSTR doesn't charge a 1.9% management fee. Price Action Indications While there are exceptions, I generally prefer to look at Bitcoin through the weekly chart rather than anything shorter when I'm assessing directional cues: Bitcoin Weekly Chart (TrendSpider) Something that I've been pointing out for years is the relationship between the 8 and 20-week simple MAs. These levels are still favoring bulls in my view, but the conviction is becoming concerning in the 20-week MA. Unlike the 8 weeks, the 20 is no longer in a clear uptrend. This could indicate that we're getting closer to a short-term top in the coin. I should also point out the fairly obvious negative divergence in the weekly RSI. New highs in coin price are accompanied by lower highs in RSI. This is typically viewed as bearish behavior. As was the early morning action on June 13th: 5-day BTC vs XAU (Seeking Alpha) As tribal as these investment communities can be, I'll reiterate that I've long been of the view that investors with an anti-fiat philosophy haven't had to choose between Bitcoin and Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) when they can simply buy both. Though I've primarily covered Bitcoin and Digital Assets for Seeking Alpha over the last several years, I've been an advocate for Gold for longer. The escalation between Israel and Iran was met with action in the financial markets. For better or worse, Gold was viewed as the safe, risk-off asset, while Bitcoin was viewed as the opposite. Closing Summary BITX will work perfectly fine as a short-term trade for Bitcoiners or speculators who want leverage on Bitcoin's price moves. Despite the fund not experiencing the level of decay that has been seen in other leveraged ETF products, I maintain that BITX is not a product that should be held long-term. For long-term Bitcoin leverage, MSTR has been a far better alternative. Whether that remains the case is unknowable. Finally, while I'm still bullish on Bitcoin and have my core position, I don't think this is the time to be playing around with leverage on top of what is already a volatile asset. Given the increasing level of global conflict, I suspect we'll see pressure on risk assets broadly. I doubt Bitcoin will be immune from that.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794712-2x-bitcoin-strategy-etf-bitx-vs-competing-leverage?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD|BITU|BTCL|BTFX|MSTR|BITX",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T16:20:15,"Israel Iran Conflict: Urgent Warning for Crypto Market Amid Geopolitical Risk","BitcoinWorld Israel Iran Conflict: Urgent Warning for Crypto Market Amid Geopolitical Risk The world is watching the Middle East with heightened concern. Recent reports indicate a significant escalation in rhetoric, with Israel’s Prime Minister’s office stating the country is prepared for a possible full-scale war with Iran. This statement, conveyed to Russian news agency TASS according to Walter Bloomberg on X, underscores the increasing geopolitical risk in a critical global region. While this news originates from political and military spheres, the interconnected nature of global finance means that such tensions inevitably cast a long shadow over various markets, including the dynamic and often volatile world of cryptocurrency. Understanding the Israel Iran Conflict: What Was Said? The core of the recent news revolves around a direct statement from the Israeli Prime Minister’s office. According to reports citing TASS and shared by Walter Bloomberg: The statement explicitly mentioned Israel’s readiness. It referred to the potential outbreak of a full-scale war. The potential adversary named was Iran. The communication was reportedly made to a Russian news agency. This kind of official communication, even relayed through third parties, signals a serious assessment of the current security situation and potential future scenarios by the Israeli government. It’s a stark reminder of the underlying tensions that have long existed between the two nations and their proxies in the region. How Does Geopolitical Risk Influence the Crypto Market? Geopolitical events, from regional conflicts to global pandemics, have a documented history of impacting financial markets. The cryptocurrency market, despite its decentralized ethos, is not immune to these external pressures. Here’s why: Investor Sentiment: Uncertainty breeds caution. When major international crises emerge, investors often move away from riskier assets, which crypto is generally perceived to be, towards perceived safer havens. Global Economy: Conflicts can disrupt supply chains, impact energy prices, trigger inflation, and influence central bank policies. These macroeconomic shifts directly affect liquidity and investor appetite for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Responses: Increased geopolitical tension can lead to new sanctions or stricter financial controls, potentially impacting how crypto is used or regulated internationally. Narrative Shifts: Crises often fuel narratives around alternative financial systems or ‘safe haven’ assets, which can sometimes benefit assets like Bitcoin, though this is debated. The Israel Iran conflict represents a significant source of geopolitical risk that market participants must consider. Analyzing the Potential Crypto Market Impact Predicting the exact impact of a potential Israel Iran conflict on the crypto market impact is complex, but we can outline potential scenarios based on historical reactions to similar events: Scenario 1: Initial Risk-Off Reaction Likely immediate effect: A sell-off across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Reasoning: Traders and investors reduce exposure to volatile assets during periods of high uncertainty. Historical parallel: Similar reactions were seen at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the initial stages of the conflict in Ukraine. Scenario 2: Bitcoin as a Contested Safe Haven Potential effect: After an initial dip, Bitcoin’s price might stabilize or even see inflows if the ‘digital gold’ or ‘safe haven’ narrative gains traction. Reasoning: Some investors view Bitcoin as an asset outside traditional financial systems and government control, potentially preserving value during geopolitical or economic turmoil. Challenge: Bitcoin’s volatility and correlation with traditional tech stocks often undermine its safe haven claim compared to assets like gold or government bonds. The narrative is not universally accepted or consistently proven during crises. Scenario 3: Broader Economic Fallout Potential effect: Sustained conflict could lead to significant disruptions in global energy markets, potentially spiking oil prices. This could fuel inflation, forcing central banks to maintain or even raise interest rates. Reasoning: Higher interest rates generally make risk assets less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Persistent inflation erodes purchasing power, potentially directing funds towards perceived inflation hedges, though crypto’s effectiveness here is also debated. Overall crypto market impact: A challenging environment characterized by reduced liquidity and cautious investor behavior. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is also influenced by internal factors like technological developments, regulatory news specific to crypto, and market cycles (like the Bitcoin halving). Geopolitical events add another layer of complexity. Is Bitcoin a True Safe Haven Amid Middle East Tension? The question of whether Bitcoin safe haven status holds during times of Middle East tension is a subject of ongoing debate within the financial community. Proponents argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, limited supply, and independence from traditional banking systems make it an ideal store of value when geopolitical or economic instability threatens fiat currencies and traditional assets. Arguments for Bitcoin as a Safe Haven: Decentralization: No single government or entity can seize or control Bitcoin. Limited Supply: The fixed supply (21 million coins) makes it potentially resistant to inflation caused by excessive money printing during crises. Accessibility: Can be accessed and transferred across borders relatively easily, potentially useful in regions facing capital controls or financial disruption. Arguments Against Bitcoin as a Safe Haven: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings are significantly larger than traditional safe havens like gold or the US dollar. This volatility undermines its reliability as a stable store of value in times of panic. Correlation with Risk Assets: Bitcoin has often shown high correlation with tech stocks and other risk-on assets, particularly during market downturns. It tends to fall when traditional markets fall. Market Maturity: The crypto market is still relatively young and less tested by prolonged, severe global crises compared to traditional assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto remains uncertain in many parts of the world, adding another layer of risk. While there have been instances where Bitcoin’s price surged during specific regional currency crises or periods of high inflation, its performance during broader global risk-off events (like early COVID-19 or the initial Ukraine invasion) has often mirrored that of other risk assets, experiencing sharp declines. Therefore, relying on Bitcoin safe haven status during significant Middle East tension carries considerable risk. Navigating Geopolitical Risk: Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders Given the potential for increased geopolitical risk stemming from the Israel Iran conflict and its potential crypto market impact, what steps can crypto investors consider? It’s important to approach this with caution and a long-term perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much volatility you can withstand. Geopolitical events can cause sudden and significant price swings. Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Consider whether your current allocation aligns with your risk tolerance in light of potential increased market instability. Are you overexposed to volatile assets? Stay Informed, But Avoid Panic: Follow reliable news sources regarding both the geopolitical situation and crypto market impact. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or hype. Diversification: While crypto itself is an asset class, consider diversification within crypto (e.g., not solely holding one coin) and across different asset classes if appropriate for your overall financial strategy. Consider Stablecoins: In periods of high volatility, some investors move a portion of their holdings into stablecoins to preserve capital, though stablecoins carry their own risks (e.g., counterparty risk, regulatory risk). Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term geopolitical shocks can be viewed as noise. However, sustained conflict with significant global economic repercussions could impact even long-term outlooks. Revisit your investment thesis. Security: Ensure your crypto holdings are stored securely in hardware wallets or reputable exchanges, especially during uncertain times. There are no guarantees in markets, particularly when unpredictable geopolitical factors are at play. The key is to be prepared, informed, and disciplined. The Middle East Tension and Broader Market Implications The Middle East tension, exacerbated by statements like the one from the Israeli PM’s office, doesn’t just affect crypto in isolation. It’s part of a larger global picture. Increased conflict in the region could lead to: Higher energy prices (oil, gas). Disruption of shipping routes. Increased defense spending by nations. Potential shifts in international alliances and trade relationships. These factors collectively contribute to a global economic environment that can be challenging for risk assets. The crypto market impact is filtered through these broader economic channels as well as direct investor sentiment. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in the Crypto Landscape The statement from the Israeli Prime Minister’s office regarding readiness for a full-scale war with Iran is a serious development that highlights significant geopolitical risk. While the news is not directly about cryptocurrency, the potential for conflict in the Middle East tension has clear implications for global financial markets, including the volatile crypto space. Investors should be aware of the potential crypto market impact, which could include initial downturns driven by risk aversion, followed by a possible (though uncertain) test of Bitcoin’s safe haven narrative. The broader economic consequences of a major Israel Iran conflict, such as inflation and energy price spikes, also pose headwinds for risk assets. Staying informed about both geopolitical developments and market reactions is crucial. Rather than reacting impulsively, investors should consider their risk tolerance, review their portfolio, and focus on a disciplined approach. The coming period may test the resilience of the crypto market against significant external pressures.

Will ADA Price Drop?","Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson, who attracted the market's attention with his statements, announced his $100 million proposal. According to Coindesk, Charles Hoskinson proposed converting $100 million worth of ADA reserves into Bitcoin (BTC) and local stablecoins USDM and USDA to revitalize and strengthen the DeFi and stablecoin ecosystem. “We can take the $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury, convert it into a mix of stablecoins on Cardano, namely USDM and USDA, and convert some of it into Bitcoin, which makes it Prime Bitcoin DeFi.” Hoskinson stated that with this proposal, he aims to increase the stablecoin-TVL ratio from 10% to 30-40%. Hoskinson said that the current 10% stablecoin-TVL ratio is killing Cardano. According to DefiLlama data, Cardano’s total TVL is $356 million, while the value of minted stablecoins is only $31 million. In comparison, Solana has $9.8 billion in TVL and $11 billion in stablecoins minted on-chain. There was criticism that the proposed $100 million sale would affect the price of ADA, but Hoskinson dismissed concerns about the price impact as unfounded. Hoskinson hit back at critics for being inexperienced, adding that the sale would not cause any problems. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) is going mainstream, as both governments and public companies continue accumulating the asset. On Friday, June 13, Matador Technologies published a weekly report on institutional Bitcoin adoption. According to the Canada-based financial technology firm, public companies are accelerating their Bitcoin accumulation. 1/ 🏛️ Regulatory momentum in U.S. Congress •CLARITY (crypto market structure) and GENIUS (stablecoin framework) bills are advancing, with bipartisan support and a bitcoin‑friendly CFTC chair nominee Brian Quintenz. •This marks a turning point: clearer regulation unlocking… — Matador Technologies (@buymatador) June 13, 2025 The company reports that 22 public firms accumulated approximately $11.3 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past month. GameStop led the wave, acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin with its $1.75 billion convertible note. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet is targeting a 210,000 Bitcoin treasury. According to the Matador Technologies report, the main driver of corporate adoption is the regulatory momentum around crypto in the U.S. Currently, U.S. legislators are reviewing two bills: the CLARITY Act, which addresses the overall crypto market structure, and the GENIUS Act, which focuses on stablecoins. You might also like: Citigroup sees stablecoin issuers among top US Treasury holders by 2030 U.S. moves forward with reserves, other countries follow Another key development, according to Matador Technologies, is the rise of sovereign Bitcoin reserves. The U.S. is taking the lead, with President Donald Trump formalizing a Bitcoin strategic reserve on March 6. The federal government currently holds around 200,000 Bitcoin, mostly originating from asset seizures. In addition, U.S. states including Texas and Arizona are considering their own Bitcoin reserves — signaling strong political momentum behind Bitcoin adoption. Other countries, including Japan, Brazil, Czech Republic, Pakistan, are also considering their own Bitcoin treasury allocations. Still, a recent scandal in the Czechia related to a Bitcoin donation highlights the political risk of such moves. Rising adoption, both at the corporate and governmental level, is making Bitcoin increasingly resilient to volatility.

The buying wick printed on the latest daily candle confirms a strong reaction from what appears to be a maximum value zone. Pi Network’s ( PI ) price action took a steep hit as it fell below the value area low and traded directly into a macro swing low support. However, this flush was met with immediate demand, leading to a sharp intraday recovery and a strong close back above high-timeframe support. The technical bounce was characterized by a prominent buying tail, a classic signature of value-based demand, now placing Pi in a potential reversal zone Key technical points Break Below Value Area Low: Price dipped under the VAL and found strong buy-side pressure at the swing low region. Impressive Recovery Candle: The wick and close above support confirm aggressive market interest and demand. Reclaiming the Value Area Low: Sustained closes above this level confirm validation of the demand zone. Key Resistance at $0.65: Breaking this dynamic resistance would confirm a trend shift and open room for a move toward $0.80. PiNetwork (6H) Chart, Source: TradingView The drop below the value area low initially looked like a breakdown, but Pi Network’s price quickly reversed after reaching a key swing low, a high-interest liquidity pocket. The strong buying tail formed on the candle reflects not only rejection of lower prices but also signals the presence of maximum value buyers stepping into the market. Price has now closed back above the high-timeframe support and is showing signs of acceptance above the value area low. This reclaim is critical. From a market profile perspective, acceptance back above the value area low after a failed breakdown often signals a trap and provides high-probability long setups.

2025-06-13T16:10:11,"Anthony Pompliano’s ProCapBTC Pursues Massive $750M Bitcoin Investment via SPAC","BitcoinWorld Anthony Pompliano’s ProCapBTC Pursues Massive $750M Bitcoin Investment via SPAC Big news is circulating in the crypto world, and it involves a familiar name: Anthony Pompliano . The founder of Pomp Investments is reportedly embarking on an ambitious venture aimed squarely at acquiring a substantial amount of Bitcoin. This development signals a potential new avenue for significant Bitcoin investment , particularly through traditional financial structures. Who is Anthony Pompliano and What’s ProCapBTC’s Plan? Anthony Pompliano, widely known as “Pomp,” is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space. He’s an entrepreneur, investor, and commentator who has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and digital assets for years. His firm, Pomp Investments, focuses on building and investing in companies within the crypto industry. Now, according to a report by the Financial Times, Pomp is set to take the helm as CEO of a new public entity called ProCapBTC . The core mission of ProCapBTC is straightforward yet significant: to raise a substantial war chest specifically for purchasing Bitcoin. The target amount is a staggering $750 million. This move positions ProCapBTC as a dedicated vehicle for large-scale exposure to the leading cryptocurrency, potentially attracting investors who prefer accessing digital assets through publicly traded companies. Leveraging a Crypto SPAC for the Bitcoin Investment How does ProCapBTC plan to raise this considerable sum? The strategy involves merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) named Columbus Circle Capital 1. This mechanism is essentially a shortcut for a private company (ProCapBTC) to become publicly traded without going through the traditional initial public offering (IPO) process. The SPAC merger is intended to facilitate the capital raise in two parts: $500 million: Expected to be raised through equity, likely from investors participating in the SPAC transaction. $250 million: Planned through convertible debt, which can later be converted into equity under certain conditions. This approach highlights the increasing use of financial engineering, including the Crypto SPAC structure, to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset market. SPACs offer speed and a degree of certainty compared to traditional IPOs, although they also come with their own set of risks and complexities. The Significance of a $750M Institutional Bitcoin Purchase A planned $750 million purchase of Bitcoin is a significant event, regardless of who is behind it. When a public company is specifically formed and capitalized with the explicit goal of holding Bitcoin, it underscores the growing trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. This isn’t just another fund allocating a small percentage; it’s a company built around the asset itself. Why is this happening? Several factors likely contribute: Demand: There is clear and growing demand from institutional investors and potentially retail investors via public markets for exposure to Bitcoin. Accessibility: A public company structure makes it easier for many types of investors, including institutions with strict mandates, to gain exposure compared to buying and holding Bitcoin directly. Belief in Bitcoin: Pomp and his associates are strong believers in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a store of value and digital gold. If successful, ProCapBTC would join a growing list of publicly traded companies holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets, although its model appears to be primarily focused on being a Bitcoin acquisition vehicle rather than an operating business that happens to hold Bitcoin. Challenges and Opportunities for ProCapBTC While the plan is ambitious, executing a $750 million Bitcoin investment through a SPAC merger isn’t without its hurdles. Potential challenges include: Market Volatility: The price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. The value of ProCapBTC’s holdings would fluctuate significantly, impacting its share price. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and public companies dealing with them is still evolving. Execution Risk: Completing the SPAC merger and successfully raising the targeted $750 million requires navigating complex financial and legal processes. Premium to NAV: Publicly traded Bitcoin holding companies often trade at a premium or discount to the actual value of the Bitcoin they hold (Net Asset Value – NAV), which can add another layer of complexity for investors. However, the opportunities are also significant. If successful, ProCapBTC could become a major player providing accessible exposure to Bitcoin for a wide range of investors. The involvement of a well-known figure like Anthony Pompliano could lend credibility and attract investor interest. What to Watch For For those interested in this development, several key milestones are worth monitoring: Completion of the SPAC merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1. Successful execution of the $750 million capital raise (equity and debt). Confirmation of Pomp’s role as CEO. Details regarding the timing and strategy for the actual Bitcoin investment purchases. This initiative by ProCapBTC , led by Pomp, is a clear indicator of the continued drive to integrate digital assets into traditional financial frameworks and facilitate large-scale Institutional Bitcoin adoption. Conclusion The reported plan for Anthony Pompliano to lead ProCapBTC in a $750 million Bitcoin investment via a Crypto SPAC merger is a compelling development in the ongoing story of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. It represents a bold attempt to create a dedicated, publicly traded vehicle for significant Bitcoin exposure. While challenges exist, the potential for providing traditional investors with easier access to the world’s leading cryptocurrency is substantial. This move underscores the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset and the innovative ways the market is finding to meet investor demand.

2025-06-13T16:04:08,"Bitcoin Remains Above $100K For a Month: Nexchain Gains Huge Momentum in Crypto Presale","Bitcoin’s sustained price above $100K has sent a wave of bullish energy across the entire crypto market. While Bitcoin continues to solidify its position as a store of value, altcoin investors are hunting for the next big breakout. One presale project making waves during this bull run is Nexchain, an AI-powered Layer 1 blockchain that has raised over $4.4 million and is emerging as a standout name in the crypto presale space. Nexchain Crypto Presale Momentum Grows With $4.4M Raised In a sea of token sales, Nexchain is rapidly becoming the leading crypto presale to watch in 2025. The project has already raised $4.4 million in its Stage 18, offering tokens at $0.07 with a projected listing price of $0.30. That’s a promising 429% return on investment (ROI) for early adopters. But Nexchain isn’t just about numbers; it’s built on solid fundamentals. It’s an AI-integrated Layer 1 blockchain capable of processing 400,000 transactions per second, thanks to its hybrid consensus mechanism. It also introduces a unique reward system: holders earn daily gas fee revenue, creating a sustainable incentive model. From a security perspective, Nexchain scores major credibility points. Certik , a leading blockchain security firm, audits the platform. The doxxed team, public roadmap, and an active Telegram and X (formerly Twitter) community demonstrate that Nexchain is here for the long term. With an intuitive 3-click buy process, Nexchain has made it incredibly simple for retail investors to participate in its crypto presale, eliminating the need for technical expertise. In an era where scam concerns prevail, Nexchain stands out with its transparency, usability, and tangible progress. Bitcoin Above $100K Creates Bullish Environment Bitcoin’s strong performance has long been a bellwether for broader market behavior. Now, as it holds above the $100,000 mark for over a month, confidence in the crypto space is soaring. Institutional capital is flowing in again, and retail investors are returning with optimism. In this bullish climate, presales are gaining renewed attention. Investors who missed the early Bitcoin gains are now turning to high-potential ICO opportunities with strong fundamentals and promising upside. This is where Nexchain fits perfectly. The current Bitcoin rally isn’t just boosting BTC; it’s revitalizing the entire altcoin ecosystem. And among hundreds of presales, Nexchain’s performance stands out. While other projects hype up vague promises, Nexchain already offers a testable framework, ongoing development, and verified team credentials. It’s in the right place at the right time, and that’s creating serious momentum in its crypto presale. Why Nexchain May Be a Smart Diversification Move Smart investors know the value of diversifying during bull markets. While Bitcoin remains a blue-chip asset, the real gains in 2025 may come from well-positioned early-stage projects with utility, and that’s exactly what Nexchain offers. Being early in a project like Nexchain means maximizing upside. At $0.07 per token, the potential for exponential growth is substantial, especially when considering the $0.30 listing price and the limited token supply. That’s a powerful incentive for both short-term speculators and long-term believers. Nexchain also brings something BTC doesn’t: real-world blockchain utility. From daily gas-sharing rewards to high-speed Layer-1 architecture, this isn’t a meme token. The transparent roadmap, steady progress updates, and Certik audit give it the credibility many presales lack. In today’s market, many tokens are fueled purely by speculation. Nexchain, however, is a functioning tech with visible milestones, backed by a real team. For those already holding BTC, adding Nexchain to the portfolio may be a smart hedge with huge growth potential. It’s more than hype, it’s a solid diversification play in an increasingly bullish market. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Final Window Before the Listing Bitcoin’s continued strength has reignited investor interest across the board. But the biggest opportunity may lie in early-stage projects that are already delivering results, and Nexchain is proving to be one of them. With over $4.3 million raised, a working blockchain product, and a Certik-audited foundation, Nexchain is building a track record of transparency and real progress. As its crypto presale nears its final stages, experts are urging investors not to miss out on what could be the last opportunity before its listing on major exchanges. The time to act is now, before Nexchain moves out of presale pricing and into the spotlight.

2025-06-13T16:00:14,"Ethereum Faces Stress As Israel-Iran Conflict Shakes Sentiment – ETH/BTC Support In Focus","Ethereum faced intense selling pressure earlier today as geopolitical tensions flared following Israel’s attack on Iran, shaking global markets and triggering risk-off behavior across crypto. The sudden spike in volatility pushed Ethereum away from its recent highs, as it retraced after failing to break above the critical $3,000 resistance level. This marks a pivotal moment for ETH, which had shown strong momentum in recent sessions before being hit by the broader market downturn. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeats History – Key Support Holds Again Ahead Of Potential Rally Despite the sharp correction, top analyst Quinten Francois remains optimistic. He pointed to the ETH/BTC pair, which continues to look strong relative to other assets. According to Francois, this pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle—a pattern that often precedes a breakout to the upside if support holds. With Bitcoin holding near its range highs, Ethereum’s performance against BTC could serve as a leading indicator for the broader altcoin market. Now, Ethereum stands at a crossroads. A bounce from current levels could renew bullish momentum and re-establish the $2,800–$3,000 range as the launchpad for higher prices. But failure to hold support may trigger another wave of downside pressure. All eyes are on ETH/BTC as markets brace for what comes next. Ethereum Holds Key Level Against BTC Ethereum has been leading the crypto market with impressive strength since April, posting a remarkable surge of over 100% from its lows near $1,400. This steep recovery highlights Ethereum’s growing momentum, positioning it as a potential frontrunner in triggering the next altseason. The asset’s consistent performance above key support levels and its resilience during market dips have renewed bullish sentiment, with traders increasingly focusing on ETH as the key asset to watch. Many analysts believe Ethereum could be the spark that reignites capital rotation into altcoins. Its breakout from a month-long range, combined with increasing DeFi activity and improving on-chain metrics, has added to the bullish case. However, caution remains. Ongoing geopolitical tensions—particularly the recent escalation between Israel and Iran—are injecting volatility into global markets, including crypto. These developments have disrupted otherwise promising technical setups across the board, leading to uncertainty and risk-off sentiment. Quinten Francois commented on the current climate, noting that “some charts don’t look good, others are holding on by a thread.” However, he singled out the ETH/BTC pair as a relative strength signal, stating that it “still looks good.” This pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle—a structure that, if defended, could pave the way for a continuation of ETH’s dominance over Bitcoin. In this environment, Ethereum’s performance—especially relative to BTC—could determine the broader market’s next phase. If ETH/BTC holds and breaks higher, the door opens for a full altseason run. But a failure to hold could reinforce caution and signal a pause across the crypto market. For now, Ethereum remains the most important chart to watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Previous Resistance As Support – Can Bulls Defend This Level? ETH Faces Sharp Rejection After Tagging Range Highs Ethereum is facing a crucial technical test after a strong rejection near the $2,830 resistance level. The chart shows ETH failing to hold above the highlighted supply zone between $2,700 and $2,830, where sellers stepped in aggressively. This resulted in a sharp breakdown that sliced through the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) on the 4-hour timeframe, now positioning ETH around $2,512. What’s more concerning is the spike in volume during the breakdown. This confirms the strength behind the move, signaling panic among bulls and potential distribution by short-term holders. ETH is now holding just above a previous support zone from early June, but the current setup suggests uncertainty and risk of further downside. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tests Ascending Channel Resistance – Breakout Or Breakdown? Unless Ethereum can reclaim the $2,600–$2,620 area soon, the next likely target could be the $2,400 level, where the next strong demand cluster sits.

2025-06-13T15:58:09,"Solana’s $400 Price Target Gets Bold Confirmation as Analyst Predicts “VIOLENT” Breakout Despite 60% Drop","Major cryptocurrency Solana is looking to shrug off a recent price pullback to continue its bullish price activity. The 6th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is among the most widely used digital currencies, with significant use cases emerging in recent years. The Solana ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) is slowly inching towards a $10 billion valuation, making it the center of attention for crypto investors. However, despite being one of the most developed and used cryptocurrency networks, SOL is struggling to translate this impressive on-chain performance into price gains. It set a new All Time High (ATH) of around $294 in December, but that came and went, with SOL reporting more than 60% losses in the ensuing months. Currently trading at $147, the digital currency is somewhat in the middle of things, prompting investors to scratch their heads regarding the coin’s future. SOL to Rise to $400? However, a popular crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), @AltcoinGordon, has tweeted that SOL is looking to post a massive price breakout after Bitcoin posted a new ATH earlier this week. He stated: “The next leg up for $SOL is going to be VIOLENT. My blue lines NEVER fail. Bitcoin just made an ATH, but that is NOTHING compared to what is coming for Solana. Do you understand?” SOL Recent Price Action Solana is known as the “blockchain that never sleeps,” but its recent price performance is one to forget, especially in a bullish setup. Here is the graph from the last 30 days: The last four weeks or so have been a story of a dogged price performance. The cryptocurrency was flat for a large part of May, and it had just started to appreciate a week ago, and got close to $190. However, even that bullish action didn’t last long, and the bears forced it back below $180. This happened even as Bitcoin and several altcoins posted new ATHs amid a recent surge in the general altcoin market. SOL is still quite a distance away from its $295 ATH, and even then, it struggles to hold on to any small gains. SOL TVL Forecasts Better Times Ahead The TVL of the SOL’s ecosystem has reached a new high of $9.6 billion and is set to breach the $10 billion valuation in the near future. This important indicator and a string of on-chain analytics show that it is only a matter of time before SOL reignites its much-anticipated bull market.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/solanas-400-price-target-gets-bold-confirmation-as-analyst-predicts-violent-breakout-despite-60-drop/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T15:48:29,"Ripple’s XRP Crazy Explosion to $10 Price In The Cards As Metrics Show Insane XRP Momentum","XRP, one of the most recognized names in the digital asset space, may be approaching a decisive moment. Recent technical analysis suggests that XRP’s six-year consolidation period mirrors the pattern that led to its dramatic surge in 2017. Could this setup ignite another breakout? XRP Six Years of Compression: A Setup or a Stall? Since 2018, XRP price has traded within a compressed range, fluctuating between $0.20 and $0.60 for long periods. At the time of writing, XRP was priced at around $2.14. This prolonged stagnation has frustrated investors waiting for a decisive move. However, analysts on X argue that extended consolidation phases often precede explosive moves to the long-awaited $10 price. Amelie noted on May 25 that XRP’s chart setup closely mirrors its 2017 breakout pattern. In 2017, XRP skyrocketed from under $0.30 to above $3.30 within weeks, delivering one of crypto’s most dramatic rallies. The principle of “the longer the consolidation, the stronger the breakout” underpins this comparison. XRP’s current consolidation began around early 2018, following the broader crypto market’s correction from its 2017 highs. Unlike then, today’s environment features matured infrastructure, greater regulatory clarity, and expanding use cases for XRP . As noted in the U.S. Faster Payments Council’s 2025 report, Ripple’s partnerships with global financial institutions signal that XRP is not just riding technical patterns but also benefiting from real-world adoption. According to CoinShares’ recent fund flows report (May 20), XRP witnessed $37.2 million in outflows, ending an 80-week inflow streak. This shift in sentiment underscores how external factors, including legal decisions and regulatory actions, continue to impact XRP’s price dynamics . These outflows occurred against a backdrop of consolidation and building momentum, suggesting the market may be repositioning. Key Levels and Market Sentiment XRP’s trading volume jumped 18% over the past week, reflecting growing trader interest. Meanwhile, open interest in XRP futures contracts on major exchanges has risen to $1.5 billion, signaling that leveraged traders are preparing for a potential move. While the echoes of 2017 are undeniable, today’s market is far from identical. Regulatory pressures remain a wildcard, with Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC last year providing some relief but leaving uncertainties unresolved. XRP/USDT| Source: TradingView The broader macroeconomic environment, including U.S. interest rates and Bitcoin’s movements, will also influence XRP’s trajectory. For traders watching XRP, the key lies in whether it can break through its resistance levels and sustain upward momentum. As Amelie’s analysis suggests, the long wait might finally be nearing an inflection point, but traders must remain cautious given the complex interplay of technical, regulatory, and macro factors.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-crazy-explosion-to-10-price-in-the-cards-as-metrics-show-insane-xrp-momentum/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T15:47:11,"Gold and Silver Gained Value While Risky Assets Including Crypto Market Dropped After Israel Attacked Iran! Here is All the Data","Cryptocurrency markets fell sharply after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear and missile infrastructure, sparking a broader sell-off in global risk assets. Crypto Markets Fall as Geopolitical Tensions Rise as Israel Attacks Iran While Bitcoin remained stable despite the decline in the overall crypto sector, the SOL ETF lost about 10% of its value despite expectations. Bitcoin (BTC) lost 2.9% and traded around $102,664. In contrast, gold, considered a traditional safe haven, rose 1.3% and approached an all-time high of $3,445 per ounce. The Israeli attack, which reportedly targeted senior Iranian military officials, came shortly after the International Atomic Energy Agency accused Iran of violating limits on uranium enrichment. Iran retaliated by launching 100 suicide drones into Israeli territory. Although the US denied involvement, the attack rattled markets and sent stocks plunging worldwide. Market Impact Across Asset Classes The ripple effect has spread far beyond cryptocurrencies: Japan's Nikkei index fell 0.89%. Euro Stoxx 50 lost 1.37%. U.S. futures were broadly lower, with the E-mini Nasdaq-100 down 1.42%. Oil prices rose and settled after Brent crude gained more than 14%. Gold and silver gained, reflecting the risk aversion trend. In the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) was more affected than Bitcoin and fell by 8.81% to $2,523. Solana ETF Momentum Overshadowed The SEC reportedly requested an update to the Solana ETF S-1 filing, causing a brief spike, according to Wintermute OTC trader Jake Ostrovskis. Bloomberg analysts rate the probability of approval by the end of the year at 90%. But the geopolitical shock quickly erased those gains. “Markets appear to be underexposed to SOL and related assets, which could create interesting opportunities once volatility subsides,” Ostrovskis said. Derivatives and the Liquidity Shake There was a significant easing in the derivatives markets: Total open interest (OI) fell from $55 billion to $49.3 billion. Binance alone lost $2.5 billion worth of OI overnight. Put/call ratios on Deribit have risen, indicating a defensive shift among investors (BTC: 1.28, ETH: 1.25) Funding rates turned negative and altcoins like DOT, LINK, and 1000SHIB showed sharp declines. Despite the sell-off, BTC leverage remains high, with $84 million of long-side open positions between $102,000 and $104,000 still at risk if downward pressure resumes. Spot ETF Flows Continue to Support Crypto As markets react to tensions in the Middle East, flows into crypto ETFs remain strong: BTC spot ETFs have seen inflows of $939 million since the beginning of the month. ETH spot ETFs recorded $811 million in inflows, including $112 million on June 12 alone, marking 19 consecutive days of positive flows. *This is not investment advice.
