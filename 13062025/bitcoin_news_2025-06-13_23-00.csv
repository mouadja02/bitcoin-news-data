2025-06-13T20:50:42,"Bitcoin Rally Alert: John Bollinger Signals Potential Exhaustion After $110K Resistance","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Rally Alert: John Bollinger Signals Potential Exhaustion After $110K Resistance Hey crypto enthusiasts! Have you been watching the incredible Bitcoin rally ? It’s been quite the ride, but a recent signal from a legendary figure in technical analysis has traders paying close attention. John Bollinger, the brilliant mind behind the widely used Bollinger Bands indicator, suggests that this powerful upward move might be losing steam, especially after encountering significant resistance around the $110,000 mark. Decoding the Signal: What John Bollinger Saw in the Bitcoin Rally According to reports, John Bollinger pointed to a specific pattern emerging on Bitcoin charts. He noted what’s often referred to as a ‘three pushes up’ pattern following a ‘W’-shaped bottom. If you’re new to technical analysis, this might sound a bit complex, but let’s break it down simply: W-shaped bottom: This is typically seen as a bullish reversal pattern, suggesting a potential upward move after a downtrend. It looks like a ‘W’ on the price chart. Three pushes up: After the W-shaped bottom, the price makes three distinct attempts or ‘pushes’ higher. The Signal: When these three pushes occur, especially after a significant run-up like the recent crypto market activity, it can often indicate ‘trend exhaustion’. Think of it like a runner sprinting – after three big bursts, they might start to tire out. This pattern, according to Bollinger’s analysis, suggests that the buyers who have been driving the price up might be losing momentum. The $110,000 level acted as a strong ceiling, and the inability to decisively break through it reinforces this idea of exhaustion. Why Are Bollinger Bands and John Bollinger So Important? For anyone involved in market analysis , the name John Bollinger is synonymous with one of the most popular and effective trading tools available: Bollinger Bands . These bands are lines plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average of a security’s price. They adapt to market volatility, widening during periods of high volatility and narrowing during low volatility periods. Traders use Bollinger Bands to: Identify potential overbought or oversold conditions. Spot potential price targets. Measure volatility. Look for ‘squeeze’ patterns (low volatility) that might precede a significant price move. John Bollinger isn’t just the creator; he’s a seasoned market technician whose insights carry significant weight in the trading community. When he points out a specific pattern or potential shift, many traders take notice, making his observations crucial for understanding potential future price movements in the crypto market . What Could This Mean for the Bitcoin Price Action? Bollinger’s signal of trend exhaustion doesn’t necessarily mean the price is going to crash immediately. He indicated two primary possibilities following this pattern: Reversal: The rally could end, leading to a significant price decline. Sideways Movement: The price could enter a period of consolidation, trading within a relatively narrow range as buyers and sellers battle it out. Both scenarios imply a pause or end to the strong upward momentum we’ve recently witnessed. For traders and investors, understanding this potential shift is key to managing risk and planning their next moves. The $110,000 level now stands out as a critical resistance point that the market struggled to overcome. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Crypto Market After Bollinger’s Signal So, what should you do with this information? Here are a few things to consider based on this Bitcoin rally analysis: Review Your Positions: If you’ve been riding the rally, consider whether it’s time to take some profits or tighten your stop-loss orders to protect against a potential reversal. Prepare for Volatility: Exhaustion can sometimes precede increased volatility as the market decides its next direction. Be prepared for potentially sharper price swings. Look for Confirmation: Bollinger’s signal is one piece of the puzzle. Look for confirmation from other technical indicators (like volume, RSI, MACD) or fundamental factors before making significant trading decisions. Consider Sideways Strategies: If the market enters a sideways phase, strategies like range trading might become more effective than simply buying dips. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on further analysis from experts like John Bollinger and monitor key price levels. Remember, no indicator or analyst is right 100% of the time, especially in a dynamic market like crypto. Bollinger’s signal is a heads-up based on historical chart patterns, prompting caution and diligent market analysis . Challenges and Considerations While Bollinger’s insights are valuable, it’s important to remember the unique nature of the crypto market . It can be highly susceptible to news, social media sentiment, and rapid shifts in momentum. A pattern that works reliably in traditional markets might behave differently in crypto. False signals are always a possibility. Furthermore, the specific resistance level of $110,000 mentioned highlights a potential future scenario or a significant psychological barrier that was tested in the context of the analysis. Summary: The Bitcoin Rally at a Crossroads? John Bollinger’s observation of a ‘three pushes up’ pattern following a ‘W’-shaped bottom, particularly after failing to sustain momentum above $110,000, provides a strong signal that the recent Bitcoin rally might be reaching a point of exhaustion. This doesn’t guarantee a crash, but it certainly raises the probability of either a significant reversal or a period of consolidation. Traders and investors should approach the market with increased caution, perform their own due diligence, and consider how this potential shift aligns with their own trading strategies and risk tolerance. Keeping a close watch on key price levels and market sentiment will be crucial in the days and weeks ahead as the crypto market navigates this potential turning point.

2025-06-13T20:40:42,"US Dollar: Persistent Confidence in Short Positions, BofA Reveals","BitcoinWorld US Dollar: Persistent Confidence in Short Positions, BofA Reveals In the dynamic world of finance, shifts in major currencies like the US Dollar ripple across markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Understanding these macro trends is crucial for investors navigating volatility. Recently, a notable perspective emerged from Bank of America (BofA) regarding prevailing market sentiment towards the greenback, specifically highlighting the continued conviction in Short Dollar Positions . Why the Confidence in Short Dollar Positions? When traders take a short position on a currency, they are essentially betting that its value will decrease relative to another currency or a basket of currencies. The fact that market participants are maintaining these bets against the US Dollar , according to the latest BofA Outlook , suggests underlying factors are reinforcing this view. This isn’t a fleeting trend; the confidence appears persistent. Several elements typically contribute to a bearish outlook on the US Dollar : Interest Rate Expectations: If markets anticipate the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates sooner or more aggressively than other central banks, the yield attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets can diminish, weakening the currency. Inflation Trends: High or persistent inflation can erode purchasing power, but market focus is often on how central banks respond. If the Fed is seen as less aggressive on inflation than others, it can pressure the dollar. Global Economic Growth: Stronger growth outside the U.S. can boost demand for other currencies and shift investment flows away from dollar safety. Risk Appetite: In periods of high market confidence or ‘risk-on’ sentiment, investors might move capital into riskier assets or currencies of faster-growing economies, reducing demand for the safe-haven US Dollar . Fiscal and Trade Balances: Large deficits can weigh on a currency over time. The BofA Outlook , reflecting client positioning and sentiment surveys, indicates that despite potential short-term fluctuations, the conviction among many participants holding Short Dollar Positions remains strong. This suggests the collective market view is that the factors favoring dollar weakness are likely to persist for some time. Understanding Market Sentiment in the Forex Market Market sentiment is the overall attitude of investors and traders towards a particular security, market, or economy. In the Forex Market , sentiment is a powerful force. It’s not just about economic data; it’s about how traders interpret that data and what they expect future events to be. A prevailing sentiment, like the confidence in Short Dollar Positions , can become a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent, as positioning reinforces the trend. The BofA Outlook serves as a gauge of this sentiment among a significant segment of institutional players. Their assessment that confidence is ‘intact’ implies that recent economic releases or market events haven’t significantly shaken the bearish view on the US Dollar that has been building. How Does This Affect the Forex Market and Beyond? The strength or weakness of the US Dollar has profound implications across the global financial system. In the Forex Market , it directly impacts major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY. A weaker dollar means it takes more dollars to buy one unit of the other currency in the pair. Beyond traditional currencies, a weaker US Dollar can influence commodity prices (often priced in USD), making them cheaper for holders of other currencies, potentially increasing demand. It can also affect international trade dynamics and corporate earnings for multinational companies. For cryptocurrency investors, a weaker US Dollar is often seen as a positive catalyst. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are sometimes viewed as alternative stores of value or hedges against traditional currency devaluation or inflation. When the dollar weakens, assets perceived as alternatives or risk-on plays can see increased interest. Actionable Insights from the BofA Outlook The key takeaway from the BofA Outlook for traders and investors is the persistence of the bearish sentiment towards the US Dollar . While sentiment can change rapidly, the report suggests the current positioning is robust. This doesn’t guarantee future dollar weakness, but it highlights the prevailing bias in the market. Traders holding Short Dollar Positions might feel validated, while those long the dollar might reconsider their strategy or hedge their exposure. New entrants to the Forex Market might look for opportunities in pairs where the dollar is the quote currency (e.g., EUR/USD, AUD/USD) or consider the potential impact on dollar-denominated assets. It is crucial, however, to remember that market sentiment is just one factor. Unexpected economic data, shifts in central bank communication, or geopolitical events can quickly alter the landscape and challenge even deeply held convictions like the current confidence in Short Dollar Positions . What Could Challenge This Sentiment? Despite the reported confidence, several factors could cause a shift in market sentiment regarding the US Dollar : Unexpectedly Strong U.S. Data: Persistent strong jobs reports or higher-than-expected inflation could force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer than anticipated, supporting the dollar. Weakness Elsewhere: Economic slowdowns or political instability in other major regions could drive capital back into the safe-haven US Dollar . Hawkish Fed Pivot: Clear communication from the Federal Reserve indicating a less dovish stance than priced in by the market would likely strengthen the dollar. Risk-Off Events: Major global crises or market crashes typically lead to a flight to safety, benefiting the dollar. The BofA Outlook reflects the current state, but monitoring these potential catalysts for change is essential for anyone trading in the Forex Market or assets influenced by dollar movements. Conclusion: Persistent Bets Against the Greenback The assessment from Bank of America underscores a significant theme in current financial markets: the continued, strong conviction among participants holding Short Dollar Positions . This persistent market sentiment is driven by a confluence of factors, including expectations around interest rates, global growth dynamics, and overall risk appetite. While the BofA Outlook highlights the robustness of this view, the ever-changing nature of the Forex Market means vigilance is required. Understanding this dominant sentiment provides valuable context for navigating not just currency markets but also related asset classes like commodities and cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-13T20:30:28,"Crypto degens are taking wagers on global conflict via Polymarket","As global tensions escalate following the Israel-Iran conflict and traditional investors seek safety in safe haven assets like gold, crypto punters are seeking action on the crypto-based betting platforms, Polymarket. The crypto betting platform rose to prominence for predicting President Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory before other traditional news outlets and polls. It has also become the leading venue for punters making bets on the escalating crisis between Israel and Iran, becoming something of a high-stakes casino for the geopolitical drama in the Middle East. Crypto punters wager on the Israel-Iran conflict and outcomes As geopolitical tensions rise, Polymarket has become an unlikely casino, where crypto degens are taking wagers on global conflict. Its top active markets are centered on the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. Polymarket predicted an 88% chance of Israel striking Iran in June, a 71% chance of the strike hitting Iranian nuclear facilities, and an astonishing 99% chance of the strike happening by Friday, the 13th. Following the accurate prediction of the strike, punters took to Polymarket to place more wagers. This resulted in the top prediction markets being dominated by the wagers placed on the conflict. The market went as high as a 99% chance that Iran would strike Israel in June, pulling in over $1 million in volume. Iran struck Israel in a military attack later on the same day, June 13. Source: Polymarket It also estimates a 42% chance of the U.S. taking military action against Iran before July. That market has now pulled in over $1.7 million in volume. Source: Polymarket Another market that has sprung up with the Middle East conflict is the spike in the price of Brent crude. It currently predicts a 44% chance that Iran will close the Strait of Hormuz, which could further lead to global oil prices skyrocketing. Source: Polymarket Another market that could soon gain momentum is the prediction about whether Iran will confirm the possession of a nuclear weapon by 2025. This follows Israel’s claims that its preemptive strikes were on Iran’s nuclear facilities. This market has gained over $154,000 in volume. Source: Polymarket These markets operate in a regulatory grey area. After being fined $1.4 million by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2022, Polymarket banned U.S. users from its platform. Placing wagers on real-time geopolitical crises raises ethical concerns. Critics argue that it could be seen as trivializing suffering and incentivizing misinformation. Also, there are concerns of market manipulation, with the CFTC saying prediction markets are vulnerable to manipulation. Israel-Iran conflict shakes global financial markets On Friday, 13, 2025, Israel declared a special emergency following preemptive strikes on Iran, which are reported to have hit Iranian nuclear facilities and killed top Iranian generals. This event sent ripples through the global financial market. With fears of broader conflicts arising, assets such as gold are seeing inflows. An ounce of gold has gained 1.2% to $3,444.70. Bitcoin dropped sharply, falling below $103,000 as investors fled risk assets; however, it quickly gained $105,700, a little bit off its intraday high. Brent crude surged about 14% intraday, settling at about $75.54/barrel, driven by fears of disruption around the Strait of Hormuz, which is responsible for about a fifth of global consumption flows and bordered by Iran, which also happens to be one of the world’s largest exporters of oil. Global stocks were hit ; the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.4%, with the Dow industrials losing about 600 points. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $757.91, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,249.89 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for Solana ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $147.32 (-6.96%) Market Cap $77.64 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $6.45 Billion Circulating Supply 520.28 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $160.43 24-hour Low $141.44 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Neutral 50-Day SMA $160.92 200-Day SMA $175.91 Price Prediction $321.69 (117.52%) F & G Index 14.55 (extreme fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 14-Day RSI 39.78 Solana price analysis: SOL faces bearish pressure below $150 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows a bearish trend below $150. Resistance for SOL is at $150. Support for SOL/USD is at $145. The price analysis of Solana for June 13 shows that SOL tried and failed at crossing past the $160 level. The price is still trading at $147 but may retrace further. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL fails to cross past $160 Solana showed significant bearish pressure on the daily chart, as the bulls could not climb past the $160 level, and the price headed towards $140. The bulls still hold strong at the level but the exhaustion might cause SOL to retrace further. Solana price 1-day chart analysis : SOL falls to $150 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 40.13, showing room for further downwards movement across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line dives downwards, suggesting declining bullish momentum. Moreover, the MACD histogram shows rising bearish pressure in the cryptocurrency market as bulls struggle to hold above $145.00. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish momentum halts SOL at $160 The 4-hour chart for Solana reveals a steady fall as the bulls failed to rise past the $160 price level, and SOL fell to the $143.00 mark before recovering towards the $150 level. The high trading volume has caused high volatility in the last few days. Solana price analysis : SOL struggles in initiating uptrend From a technical perspective, the MACD shows growing bearish momentum at -1.82, with the indicator showing rising bearish momentum with recent candles. This suggests that the bulls are yet to find a foothold at the level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 36.12, indicating that Solana has little room for further movement in downwards direction across the short term and the selloff may continue towards $140. Solana technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 144.54 BUY SMA 5 $ 153.34 SELL SMA 10 $ 153.73 SELL SMA 21 $ 160.89 SELL SMA 50 $ 162.43 SELL SMA 100 $ 146.46 BUY SMA 200 $ 163.21 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 159.54 SELL EMA 5 $ 156.00 SELL EMA 10 $ 146.63 BUY EMA 21 $ 138.91 BUY EMA 50 $ 144.14 BUY EMA 100 $ 159.52 SELL EMA 200 $ 168.03 SELL What to expect from Solana price analysis? SOL/USDT 4-hour price chart: TradingView The Solana price analysis across the daily and 4-hour charts indicates a notable decay after rising towards the $160 price level. The 4-hour chart reinforces this downward trend with a bearish dominance in the MACD and the RSI falling into unfavorable territory, signaling potential continued downward momentum as SOL retraces to $144. The bulls find strong support at $145 suggesting the price may bounce back. The bullish market sentiment supports the notion and the increasing trade volume is also bullish. However, if the price falls below $145, the next support is at $140. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability and speed, boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down? Solana failed to rise past the $160 price level, and the following selloff caused a drop to $140 before recovering towards the $147 level. However, the increasing bearish pressure might create a drop below $145. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of $331.81. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset’s adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential roi due to its high scalability, low transaction costs, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana’s forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T20:00:53,"Ethereum Price Could Rally To $10,000 If This Major Resistance Is Broke","Ethereum’s price action this week has been very notable, with the leading altcoin breaking above $2,800 again for the first time in four months. Ethereum managed to break above the $2,800 mark for the first time since February, briefly touching $2,870 before pulling back slightly. Related Reading: Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin’s 2021 Cycle? Here’s The Target Two separate analyses by crypto strategist Crypto Patel on the social media platform X suggests Ethereum is now on the right track. The first, based on an 8-hour chart, highlights a rally toward $4,000. The second, using a long-term two-week timeframe, outlines a bullish setup that could send Ethereum soaring to $10,000 and beyond. Ethereum’s Breakout From Sideways Consolidation Zone In a recent analysis shared on X, a crypto analyst known as Crypto Patel highlighted Ethereum’s attempt to break out of its established range. Using the 8-hour candlestick chart, he pointed out how the Ethereum had spent many weeks since early May trading between clear support at $2,366 and resistance around $2,734. The breakout seen on the chart occurred just above this resistance zone, when Ethereum briefly pushed past $2,800 before facing some rejection. If this breakout holds above $2,800, Ethereum could initiate a steep upward rally toward the $3,500 to $4,000 region in the coming weeks. Crypto Patel noted the importance of watching whether Ethereum sustains above the $2,750 breakout line, as a successful confirmation could trigger an influx of bullish momentum. Ethereum’s To $10,000 In The Long-Term In a follow-up post analyzing a much larger timeframe, Crypto Patel shared a two-week candlestick chart that mapped Ethereum’s longer-term structure since 2018. The chart revealed a well-defined bullish setup, including a bounce from a key bullish order block around $1,400 in April. This bounce acted as a support level, with the resulting candlestick being a bullish one that broke through another order block between $1,700 and $2,500. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Patel pointed out that Ethereum is now showing signs of a long-term bullish continuation pattern. With support levels already locked in for the next bear market, the analyst projected a target above $10,000, citing a 438% upside potential from current price levels. The chart also marks $2,500 as a structural pivot point, with Ethereum’s ongoing upward trajectory expected to strengthen if this support level continues to hold. Therefore, the path to $10,000 will depend on Ethereum’s ability to turn its recent resistance break into sustained momentum. The $2,800 region must now serve as a support base rather than a resistance ceiling. However, this has failed to really materialize in the past 24 hours, as Ethereum is currently down by a massive 9.6%. The ensuing price action has seen the leading altcoin now back trading within this consolidation range. Failure to hold above $2,500 could cascade to more losses over the weekend until it closes on $2,366 again and probably initiate another bounce from here.

2025-06-13T20:00:00,"Two Key Signals Emerge That Could Trigger a Major Crypto Rally","A potential price reversal in gold is being watched as a bullish trigger for altcoins. Bitcoin’s chart is repeating a “descending broadening wedge” pattern from past rallies. These two distinct signals are both pointing to a potential upcoming crypto rally. Two key market signals – a price reversal in gold and a recurring historical pattern in Bitcoin’s chart, are leading analysts to forecast that the crypto market could be preparing for its next major upward movement. The analyses suggest that despite the latest consolidation, underlying technical structures are pointing to a bullish future for both Bitcoin and the broader altcoin sector. I've mentioned this before. Gold breaking upwards = #Altcoins breaking downwards, independent of news. Gold broke a crucial level upwards and is currently consolidating.

2025-06-13T19:44:47,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Hit Hard by Geopolitical Tensions: Binance Funding Rates Signal Deep Bearish Shift","In the early hours of Friday, June 13th, the cryptocurrency market faced intense downward pressure following a surprise military strike by Israel on Iran. The geopolitical shock sent global risk assets tumbling, with Ethereum (ETH) experiencing a sharp drop below the crucial $2,600 support level. Geopolitical Shock According to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant, this sudden plunge triggered a cascade of long liquidations on Binance, where data from liquidation heatmaps revealed concentrated wipeouts in the $2,650-$2,430 range. Many traders had opened long positions at around $2,800, expecting continued upside, only to be caught off guard by the sell-off. As prices fell through key levels, stop-losses and liquidation orders were triggered en masse, which resulted in a rapid flush of overleveraged positions. Bitcoin also felt the impact, as Binance’s funding rates for BTC perpetual contracts fell to deeply negative levels not seen since June 8. This drop in funding rates reflects a market-wide shift in sentiment, which means that traders are now heavily shorting BTC amid fears of continued downside. The panic-driven trading behavior suggests extreme caution across crypto markets, and derivatives data are pointing to increased bearish expectations. However, the aggressive liquidation of ETH longs and the return of negative BTC funding rates may indicate an overly pessimistic market stance. Such conditions often precede a potential price rebound, as excessive leverage is cleared out and markets stabilize. While uncertainty remains high due to the geopolitical backdrop, the removal of speculative build-up could create a healthier setup for recovery. Flight to Safety Grips Markets In a note released Friday, QCP Capital also echoed these concerns and stated that the digital asset complex remains tightly tethered to geopolitical tail risks, and markets now appear to be poised to trade “headline to headline.” Bitcoin fell around 3% while Ethereum posted a sharper 9% drop, as risk sentiment evaporated across Asia and safe-haven assets like oil and gold surged. Interestingly, crypto volatility spiked, with front-end BTC risk reversals flipping decisively in favor of puts, which indicated a sharp rise in demand for downside protection. While over $1 billion in long liquidations rattled major crypto assets, Bitcoin’s relatively muted decline indicated underlying institutional support. However, the firm warned that any escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict could threaten oil supply corridors and add to inflationary pressure, thereby complicating the Fed’s rate trajectory. Exacerbating the uncertainty, a widespread internet outage involving Google Cloud and Cloudflare added further stress to equities and tech-linked crypto sentiment. With Tehran’s response pending, the outlook for crypto remains fragile, which is currently not shaped by fundamentals but by geopolitical volatility and macro headline flow.

Institutions, whales and other large-scale buyers keep shaking down retail, taking signs from social media. Retail sentiment on BTC goes counter to the inflows of smart money. Based on Sentiment data, social media chatter often signals bearish attitudes among retail buyers. Santiment tracked messaging across X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, BitcoinTalk, and Farcaster, seeking out the mention of extremely low predictions below $70K, as well as bullish predictions for a rally above $120K. According to Santiment, the peak signal arrived around the time of the April 8 price crash, where retail predicted a fall to $70K. Whales and institutions only accelerated their buying. Since May, BTC has also exhibited a signal of predominant market takers , indicating a domination of buying demand. For the second time since 2022 market takers have continued buying up coins during a rally, showing peak exuberance. Previous periods of market taker activity happened at lower price ranges, with more conservative accumulation. This time, buyers are still highly active near peak valuations. Most of the sellers originated from the wallet cohort that held for 3-6 months, based on the hodl waves indicator. Experienced traders often choose a dual strategy of holding and trading to accumulate more BTC. Overall, no holders are pressured to sell, as over 98% of addresses are in profit, and long-term accumulators and miners have a much lower average entry price. Whales still accumulate at any price range The latest episode of bearish predictions lasted from June 4 to June 6, when BTC fell to just above $101,000. During that time, bear-posting accelerated, predicting another dip to a lower range. Despite the temporary price drop, accumulation from whales and large-scale wallets did not skip a beat, with near-peak inflows . Even during the recent sideways trading around $104,000, crowd sentiment remains bearish, while smart money is bullish on BTC. $BTC Sentiment CROWD = Bearish 🟥 MP = Bullish 🟩 Check out sentiment and other crypto stats at https://t.co/HQDyBNuzek pic.twitter.com/aOm2ImXyvk — Market Prophit (@MarketProphit) June 13, 2025 Retail traders have often heard the adage of not selling their coins to whales, ETFs or institutions. However, the ability to realize profits at a higher price was appealing to retail and their share of holdings decreased. The ratio of retail to whale holdings has been sliding in most of 2025, from 2.1 points to 2.0 points. The ratio has been rising in all of the history of BTC, since institutions only arrived in the past two years. BTC retail holders gradually declined in 2025, with the balance shifting toward institutions and whale buyers. | Source: MacroMicro The addition of corporate treasuries further added buyers capable of mopping up all newly mined BTC. Institutions and buyers with borrowed funds can afford to risk even near the price top, while retailers are more wary due to crashes from the previous bull cycles. The current bull cycle also looks different, with a more gradual BTC price expansion. At the same time, the types of investors are shifting, and BTC continues to change hands. Retail traders are also wary of overall demand, as institutional buying and ETF demand have also reversed. During some of the rallies, whales also sold BTC for profit and re-bought lower.

Based on the agreement, the real estate platform-turned Solana treasury company will have the right—but not the obligation—to sell up to $5 billion in shares to stock up on the altcoin . 1/ Today, we announce that DeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: $DFDV ) has secured a $5 BILLION equity line. This gives DFDV the flexibility to raise capital when it’s most strategic, fueling continued accumulation of $SOL and accelerating growth in $SOL Per Share (SPS). pic.twitter.com/3ep3QxuRTT — DeFi Dev Corp. (@defidevcorp) June 12, 2025 The purchase is set to have a trickle effect, opting to “raise capital gradually, when it’s strategically advantageous, rather than locking in one-time pricing during volatile markets.” However, accumulation could begin sooner rather than later. With Solana still trading 50% below its February all-time highs, current levels may offer a compelling entry point. With a recent SEC request for SOL ETF issuers to submit amended S-1 filings within a week, putting approval on track for July, the doors may soon open to inflows from traditional markets. Solana Price Analysis: Could Institutional Demand Push a New SOL High? Demand from traditional investment markets could give Solana the push it needs to break out of a massive cup-and-handle pattern forming since 2021. The Solana price currently trades within the descending channel forming the handle, with its last upward attempt falling short, it remains locked in a downtrend. SOL / USDT 1-week chart, 2021 cup-and-handle pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. That said, with potential support at the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level—a zone typically viewed as a prime accumulation range—$140 could prove a potential bottom for the next leg up. This level also aligns with the lower support of a smaller ascending channel forming since the mid-April market bottom. A bounce here would affirm the structure and establish a key confluence zone for a breakout attempt. In the weakest bullish scenario, a confirmed cup-and-handle breakout projects a technical target of $430, in line with the 3.618 Fibbonaci level—a 128% gain from current levels. While momentum indicators have weakened, they have yet to flip decidedly bearish. The MACD line still holds a narrow lead above the signal line, and the RSI has stalled just below neutral at 45. While their current downtrends are both indicative of building bearish momenumn, the balance remains delicate. Neither buyers nor sellers have full control. A potential SOL ETF approval in July—and the institutional demand it may unlock—could tip the scales in favor of a bullish continuation. $ETH Staking ETF is just around the corner. $SOL spot ETF is expected to be approved in 3-5 weeks. The setup for a massive altcoin season is there. Bulls about to full send alts to Valhalla. pic.twitter.com/pyIhFrBStE — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) June 11, 2025 While this bullish case is a far cry from overtaking Bitcoin, it sets a long-term precedent that could set Solana on the path to flip Ethereum to challenge the leading cryptocurrency. In the meantime, continued sell pressure could see the ascending channel break down, forming a new downtrend to retest lower supports or the handle’s base.

2025-06-13T19:08:33,"Shiba Inu Price Prediction as SHIB Burn Rate Skyrockets 112,839% in 24 Hours – $1 SHIB Possible?","The Shiba Inu price (SHIB) has gone down by 7.1% in the past 24 hours as global markets react to Israel-Iran tensions. Trading volumes have surged by nearly 72% and currently account for more than 5% of the token’s circulating supply. Other tokens in this category like Pepe (PEPE) and SPX6900 (SPX) have experienced much more dramatic pullbacks of 20.2% and 17.5% during this same period respectively. Despite this latest weakness, one metric could favor a bullish Shiba Inu price forecast . According to Shib Burn , a website that tracks how many Shiba Inu tokens are burned in real time, the token’s burn rate experienced a 112,839% increase in just 24 hours as nearly 112 million SHIB were put out of circulation during this period. SHIB tokens are burned automatically when transactions like swaps occur within this blockchain. This significant amount of burned tokens implies that transaction volumes skyrocketed lately, possibly as sales picked up their pace during this recent pullback. That said, this number of burned is just a tiny fraction of the token’s circulating supply of nearly 590 trillion SHIB. In the near term though, it may help shrink the available supply to cushion SHIB’s decline. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Could Rise to $0.00001500 If It Bounces Off This Key Support Looking at the daily chart, the price action broke below its trend line support a few days ago and, since then, SHIB has been dropping quite sharply. The price already tried to move above its short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) once and failed to do so. SHIB continues to trade below its 200-day EMA as well, which favors a bearish mid-term outlook. However, as the token approaches a key support at $0.00001050, the price could bounce off this level and find a way back to retest its former trend line support, which coincides with the 200-day EMA at $0.00001546. Traders should keep an eye on how the price action behaves once the price gets to that support as a strong bounce could favor a bullish short-term Shiba Inu price prediction. So, maybe not $1 for SHIB for now but the token does offer some promising upside if this key support holds. In the meantime, one of the most promising crypto presales of the year has arrived. Its name is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) and it is the first layer-2 scaling protocol for the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Hyper Surpasses $1M Raised Just 15 Days After Its Launch Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to unlock billions of dollars of untapped potential within the Bitcoin blockchain by enabling investors, developers, and users to execute transactions safely through a layer-2 side chain. This project leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and uses smart contracts to automatically settle transactions made through its L2. It then bundles them into a single transaction sent to Bitcoin’s L1. This makes Bitcoin-based dApps scalable and cheaper to launch and operate and it opens up the door for the launch of meme coins and DeFi applications. Once the solution becomes widely adopted, the demand for $HYPER will explode. To buy this token at its discounted presale price, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

In the past 24 hours, BTC price dropped over 3 percent to trade about $105k on Friday, June 13, 2025, during the mid-North American trading session.

As a result, crypto traders have been mixed with some remaining optimistic while some waiting for a clear signal to re-enter. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Issues a Bold Bitcoin Prediction The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a stablecoins summer following the ongoing regulatory goodwill from major jurisdictions, led by the United States. As the global money supply (M2) grows exponentially, more institutional investors have proliferated into the stablecoins market, thus significantly improving the crypto liquidity. Following the Bitcoin and wider altcoin drop in the past few days, Matt Hougan, the CIO at Bitwise, highlighted that an accumulation is more likely in the coming weeks before a parabolic rally before the end of this year. “I think this is the ‘Summer of Accumulation’, a moment for long-term investors to build positions ahead of an epic EOY run,” Hougan noted . What the Chart is Saying? After enjoying an impressive rally following the end of the trade wars in the past two months, BTC price experienced a significant resistance level of about $112k. The flagship coin failed to rally beyond $112k and has since retraced to a crucial buy zone of around $105k.

The company’s shares have plummeted amid reports that investors plan to offload their stocks following the creation of the ETH Treasury. Sharplink Gaming’s Stock Plummets Following Ethereum Treasury Move In an X post , Steven Lubka, the VP of investor relations at Nakamoto, drew the crypto community’s attention to the 72% drop in Sharplink Gaming’s stock after hours. Based on the SBET stock crash, he opined that a Bitcoin Treasury Reserve is a better strategy than an Ethereum Treasury Reserve. Bitcoinist reported that Sharplink had launched a $425 million Ethereum reserve plan and, in the process, became the first public company to establish an ETH reserve. The company had completed the private placement offering earlier this month to raise this sum for the reserve plan. The company also appointed Joseph Lubin, the founder and CEO of Consensys, as the Chairman following the deal. Rumors had emerged that participants in the private placement offering were looking to offload the shares that they had bought. In an X post , Journalist Steven revealed that basically every participant in SBET’s private placement has filed to dump all their shares less than a month after the Ethereum Treasury Strategy move . Revelation of this filing may have caused panic, which contributed to the SBET stock crash after hours. It is worth mentioning that Sharplink Gaming plans to further boost its ETH Treasury Reserve. The company has filed a $1 billion shelf offering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to accumulate more Ethereum. The company will raise this sum through the sale of its common shares. Joseph Lubin Addresses Stock Sale Rumors In an X post , Joseph Lubin addressed rumors that his company was planning to sell SBET stocks from the private placement offered by the Ethereum Treasury company. The Consensys CEO explained that some people were misinterpreting the S-3 filing, noting that the filing registers shares for potential resale by prior investors. Lubin added that the “Shares Owned After the Offering” column is hypothetical, assuming the full sale of the registered shares. He remarked that this is standard post-PIPE procedure in traditional finance (TradFi) and not an indication of actual sales. In line with this, the Consensys CEO clarified that they have not sold any shares, while declaring support for the Ethereum Treasury company. Despite the setback for the ETH Treasury company, MarketWatch data shows that the SBET stock is up over 300% year-to-date (YTD). The stock is also up over 1,000% since Sharplink Gaming adopted Ethereum as a reserve asset. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,500, down over 8% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-first-ever-treasury/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve|Coinmarketcap|ConsensYs|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum treasury|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Joseph Lubin|MarketWatch|SBET|Sharplink Gaming|Stephen Lubka|TradiFi|Year-To-Date|YTD",cryptocompare

Altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), which have low liquidity compared to Bitcoin, were among the assets that lost the most value in this process. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest asset in the cryptocurrency market, is trading sideways at $105,600 at the time of writing, despite falling by as much as 3%. “The crypto market is reacting negatively to the news of Israel’s attack on Iran, in line with other risk assets. Technically, support is expected at $101,000, but geopolitical developments will determine price action in the short term,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets. Related News: Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Offers $100 Million Bitcoin (BTC) and ADA Swap Proposal! Will ADA Price Drop? Following the developments, investors turned to safe havens such as government bonds, while stocks fell, oil prices rose more than 9% and gold gained value. “While Bitcoin is sometimes traded as a macroeconomic hedge, in high-risk moments like military conflict, investors prioritize liquidity over narrative. Positions are closed to generate cash, dollars are diverted, and leverage is reduced in volatile assets,” said Sean McNulty, head of derivatives Asia-Pacific at FalconX Ltd. IG analyst Tony Sycamore said there was likely to be a “further deterioration in risk appetite” heading into the weekend. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-13T18:52:18,"Bitcoin Bounces to $106K After Iran-Israel Jitters, but Analysts Warn of Deeper Pullback","The crypto market is slightly bouncing back from early Friday’s jitters on escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. After slumping to the $102,600 mark, bitcoin BTC rebounded to around $106,000 before fading lower in the U.S. afternoon hours with reports about a fresh wave of airstrikes targeting Iran. The top cryptocurrency was down 1.6% in the last 24 hours, changing hands at $105,200 and still less than 6% shy of its all-time high price. Meanwhile, the CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding memecoins, stablecoins and exchange coins — has lost 4.4% in the same period of time. Tokens such as ether ETH, avalanche AVAX and toncoin TON were the hardest hit, slumping between 6% and 8%. Crypto stocks, however, aren’t doing too hot. Most equities are in the red, especially bitcoin miners MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), down 5% and 4% respectively. A notable exception is stablecoin issuer Circle (CIRCL), which is still benefiting from the windfall of its recent IPO; the stock is up 13% today, with news of retail giants Amazon and Walmart reportedly exploring stablecoins adding to the momentum. Traditional markets don’t seem overwhelmingly concerned by the war. While gold is up 1.3%, potentially gearing up for new all-time highs, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are only down 0.4% each. What's next for bitcoin? ""Nice bounce thus far and lack of follow-through lower,"" well-followed crypto trader Skew said in a Friday X post . Market participants will likely remain cautious through the weekend with BTC tightly correlated with traditional markets amid heightened geopolitical risks, Skew added. On the longer timeframe, some analysts see risks of a deeper pullback. 10x Research founder Markus Thielen noted that BTC's drop below $106,000 translates to a failed breakout, and traders should wait for more favorable setups before rushing to buy the dip. He highlighted the $100,000-$101,000 zone as key support, warning that a break below could mark a return to the broader consolidation phase similar to last summer. John Glover, chief investment officer at bitcoin lender Ledn, argued that bitcoin entered a corrective phase from its record highs that could see the largest digital asset drop to $88,000-$93,000. He said the $90,000 level could offer a favorable entry for opportunistic investors before BTC resumes its uptrend. ""Once this pattern has played out, the next move higher to the $130,000 area is expected to begin,"" he said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/13/bitcoin-bounces-to-106k-after-iran-israel-jitters-but-analysts-warn-of-deeper-pullback,"AVAX|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Circle|Israel|Iran|Market Wrap|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T18:45:05,"Remixpoint HODLing 1,000 Bitcoin Amid Global Firms Embrace","Japanese tech company Remixpoint has recently expanded its Bitcoin treasury with a massive purchase of BTC. The firm recently added 56.87 BTC to its holdings, spending about ¥887 million, equivalent to about $6 million. This latest move pushes Remixpoint’s total Bitcoin stash past 1,000 BTC, a major milestone for the company. This move reflects a growing trend among businesses worldwide, adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as part of long-term financial strategies. Remixpoint Increases Bitcoin Holdings Remixpoint’s purchase of 56.87 BTC was made at an average price of $104,000 per coin. This latest buy pushes Remixpoint’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,038.27 BTC, marking the first time the firm has held over 1,000 BTC in its reserve. The market value of Remixpoint’s crypto assets is now around ¥17.25 billion, valued at $115 million. Bitcoin alone makes up about ¥16.1 billion, valued at $107 million of this amount. The Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed company currently holds an unrealized profit of ¥2.32 billion. This highlights its belief in Bitcoin’s long-term growth. The money for the recent purchase came from a stock acquisition rights exercise completed on June 10. A Growing Trend in Japan and Beyond Remixpoint is not the only Japanese company increasing its exposure to Bitcoin. Metaplanet, another Tokyo-listed firm, now holds 8,888 BTC, valued at over $921 million. To buy more Bitcoin, the company plans to issue 555 million shares through special warrants in a capital raise worth about $5.4 billion . In the U.K., Smarter Web Company also made a major Bitcoin purchase. The firm bought 74.27 BTC at an average price of £80,454, valued at $109,256 per coin, spending a total of £5.975 million. This brings Smarter Web’s total holdings to 242.34 BTC, with an average purchase price of £78,793, equivalent to $107,002. The purchase is part of Smarter Web’s “10-Year Plan,” which is focused on building Bitcoin as a long-term reserve. Bitcoin Finds Its Place in Corporate Strategy The trend goes beyond Japan and the UK. Companies like Mercurity Fintech plan to raise $800 million to grow their Bitcoin treasuries. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, remains the biggest corporate holder, holding about 3% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply . Financial institutions are also getting involved. Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, recently launched a structured bond linked to Bitcoin. This shows that digital assets are becoming more accepted in mainstream finance. By holding over 1,000 BTC, Remixpoint joins a growing list of companies using Bitcoin to store value and protect against financial risks. Interest from businesses and banks continues to rise, making Bitcoin a critical part of today’s financial planning.

In a new company blog post, Coinbase says it’s launching Coinbase Business, a regulatory-compliant all-in-one financial platform for start-ups and small firms that would allow them to manage crypto assets, receive payments, and automate financial workflows. According to Coinbase, traditional finance serves as a barrier to success for smaller businesses, with crypto assets being the solution. “Startups struggling to hire and reliably pay global talent, small family-owned businesses taken through the wringer by credit card fees, interest rates and chargebacks, a new restaurant’s books wrecked by long settlement cycles – all factors that eat into the efficiency and earning potential of almost all businesses today. Crypto and stablecoins solve this exact problem for all of the above with fast, global, and low-cost money movement.” Coinbase Business will offer business owners a quick and easy way to settle payments using digital assets, trade and manage their crypto portfolios, earn passive income via stablecoin rewards, streamline accounting using third-party software, and onboard new users. “We’re bringing [our] security, scale, and compliance to everyday businesses with Coinbase Business – a modern financial stack built with the speed and scale of crypto. Coinbase Business is purpose-built for modern operations and designed to streamline financial workflows for small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and startups.” Customers can currently apply for early access to the Coinbase Business alpha, a preliminary version of the platform.

2025-06-13T18:40:31,"Former Wex exchange chief to face charges in the U.S.","Officials in Poland have agreed to hand over the former chief executive of Wex, once Russia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to the United States. The Russian national was arrested in Warsaw at the end of 2024 at a U.S. request issued within a criminal case over alleged fraud and money laundering. Former Wex exchange chief to face charges in the U.S. Polish authorities have approved the extradition of Dmitry Vasiliev, former director of the now defunct Russian digital asset exchange Wex, to the United States, Russia’s official news agency reported late on Thursday, quoting his lawyer, Alexander Surzhin. In an interview, Surzhin explained that the Russian national will be transferred to U.S. custody as part of the case that was initiated against Alexander Vinnik, co-founder of the infamous BTC-e exchange, succeeded by Wex. The lawyer told Tass: “The Polish Minister of Justice has signed a permission to extradite to the United States my client, Dmitry Vasiliev, who was detained in Warsaw last year as part of an American investigation into a criminal case, in which Alexander Vinnik was also a defendant.” Surzhin, who represents Vasiliev at the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ), expects that his client may find himself in the United States in the near future to face charges that may bring him a 25-year prison sentence. Vasiliev’s odyssey takes him to America after Vinnik’s return to Russia Wex’s ex-head was arrested in Warsaw in December 2024. At the time, the Polish police said they were acting on a U.S. request, adding that the Russian was in custody awaiting the completion of the extradition procedure. A statement quoted by Reuters detailed: “Dmitry V. is suspected of numerous frauds, money transfers and money laundering in connection with running one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.” But that wasn’t Vasiliev’s first time in jail. Polish law enforcement detained him in 2021 when he was wanted by and subsequently sent to Kazakhstan . The Central Asian nation was accusing him of fraud related to the crypto exchange he had been running. Earlier that year, Vasiliev was apprehended in Italy but released several weeks later, with Italian authorities citing faults in the extradition request. Then in 2022, he was also arrested in Croatia, according to local media reports, which revealed that Zagreb acted on a red warrant issued by Interpol. The case in Kazakhstan was based on the accusations of three crypto investors who alleged that in 2018, the Russian took their dollars but never sent them the Bitcoin they wanted to buy. It was closed in October 2024 after the court established that they were too incompetent to work with crypto wallets. Another chapter in the Vinnik-Wex-BTC-e saga Wex launched in September 2017 after BTC-e shut down earlier that year. The former was considered the successor of the latter, as it took over its customer database. Vasiliev was managing the new trading platform until its collapse in 2018. His arrests were preceded by the disappearance of almost $500 million from accounts hosted on Wex, including some that belonged to European investors. BTC-e’s alleged operator, Alexander Vinnik, was arrested in Greece in 2017. He was later extradited to France, where he was sentenced to five years in prison in December 2020. Vinnik was then handed over to the U.S. in 2022, where he was held accountable for laundering up to $9 billion through the exchange. In May 2024, he pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Eventually, the United States exchanged Vinnik, in a prisoner swap with Moscow under President Trump, for American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who had been held in a Russian prison since 2021 and had received a 14-year sentence for allegedly carrying medical cannabis in his luggage. Earlier in June this year, Bloomberg Law reported that another suspected BTC-e operator, Belarusian national Aliaksandr Klimenka, has asked a U.S. judge to dismiss the case against him, arguing he could no longer have Vinnik testify on his behalf since his return to Russia.

2025-06-13T18:32:11,"As BTC swings, smart money eye RUVI with audit incoming and $1.7M raised","Bitcoin’s well-documented price volatility has always been a double-edged sword for investors. While its swings create significant opportunities for short-term growth, they also introduce a level of risk that can deter those seeking more stable long-term returns. This volatility has prompted smart investors to look for emerging projects with strong fundamentals. One name rising to the top of these alternative opportunities is Ruvi AI, an innovative blockchain platform powered by artificial intelligence. With over $1.7 million raised in its ongoing presale, a global partnership with WEEX Exchange, and an incoming third-party audit, Ruvi AI is proving to be more than just hype. Here’s why industry analysts believe this project is set to skyrocket. Bitcoin’s volatility drives investors to alternatives Bitcoin’s significant price fluctuations are nothing new. For some, this volatility is part of its charm, providing traders with frequent profit-taking opportunities. For others, however, the lack of predictability calls for safer investments with clearer growth paths. Ruvi AI stands out in this regard as it offers a transparent growth roadmap alongside its affordable entry price, making it appealing for investors cautious of Bitcoin’s unpredictable behavior. By combining blockchain and AI technologies, Ruvi AI addresses real-world challenges in industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance. Unlike speculative cryptocurrencies, it offers long-term scalability and utility, positioning itself as a standout option in today’s crypto market. A closer look at Ruvi AI’s presale success Currently in Phase 2, Ruvi AI’s presale is a testament to its growing popularity. The project has raised an impressive $1.7 million and sold over 145 million tokens, all at a remarkable entry price of just $0.015 per token. This early-stage opportunity offers a way for investors to secure significant allocations while creating a foundation for exceptional returns. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its structured valuation plan. Unlike Bitcoin, whose pricing depends on fluctuating market dynamics, Ruvi AI guarantees a post-presale price of $0.07 per token, as outlined in its roadmap. Analysts are even more bullish, with projections placing the token’s value at $1 post-listing, representing a potential 66x return for those who join during the presale. Ruvi AI’s VIP tiers reward early commitment For investors ready to make a commitment, Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers are an enticing opportunity to amplify returns. Here’s how the tiers break down: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers are ideal for investors aiming to maximize returns while the presale remains open, allowing substantial gains when values increase post-listing. Transparency and security take center stage A defining feature of Ruvi AI is how it prioritizes investor security and transparency. To affirm its credibility, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, ensuring token liquidity and seamless accessibility for investors worldwide. Furthermore, Ruvi AI is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope, a respected entity in blockchain security audits. This evaluation aims to certify the platform’s technical integrity, reassuring investors of its robustness and trustworthiness. Analysts predict this upcoming audit will significantly boost momentum for the project, serving as a launching pad for future growth.

The breakdown at $3.20 — a previously firm support zone—unleashed heavy sell pressure and marked a turning point in short-term sentiment, with over 50 million tokens traded during the selloff. After briefly breaching the $3.00 level, SUI found support around $2.997, where buyer interest began to surface. Price has since recovered into a narrow $3.00–$3.05 consolidation band, though momentum remains fragile. Lower highs continue to form, suggesting that sellers are still in control unless bulls can reclaim levels above $3.05 with conviction. The sharp move follows a wave of broader crypto weakness and a brief spike in BTC prices tied to U.S. inflation data earlier this week. While the macro backdrop remains uncertain, SUI’s price behavior appears primarily technical: the $3.20 breakdown triggered cascading stop-losses and panic selling, while psychological support near $3.00 has temporarily stemmed the decline. Volume patterns suggest cautious accumulation, with a notable spike at 14:00 UTC when over 1.2 million tokens changed hands. However, unless buyers can reclaim key resistance levels, the current bounce may prove short-lived. A confirmed close above $3.05 would be the first step toward invalidating the current downtrend. Technical Analysis Highlights UI dropped from $3.343 to $2.9556 in 24 hours, a 12.9% decline before partial recovery. Sell pressure intensified after the $3.20 breakdown at 00:00 UTC, with 50M+ tokens traded. Price has stabilized in a $3.00–$3.05 consolidation band. A minor recovery lifted price from $2.997 to $3.017 in the most recent hour. Volume at 14:00 UTC topped 1.2M, signaling short-term accumulation near support. Resistance sits at $3.05; support remains firm at $2.94.

In a new thread, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 116,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC may revisit the lower bound of a trading range at the $100,000 level, after a possible weekend bounce. “Possible scenario for BTC following Thursday’s $106,600 failure. Pull back/consolidate on Friday, weekend rally (because that’s what retail does) into $106,000-$107,000, and then revisit the $100,000 lows. Invalidation on a sustained break (high time frames) above $107,000… Personally, I wouldn’t be a buyer here, not after losing $106,600. It’s shorts only for me, but only if BTC gives me the opportunity on a bounce.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett also says that BTC whales exiting long positions in favor of building short positions against retail is causing the flagship crypto asset to weaken. “Whales were shorting into retail strength all day Thursday. It was a scam BTC pump from the start.” Lastly, the analyst warns that the USDT dominance chart (USDT.D) may start flashing bearish for Bitcoin. Many traders closely watch the USDT.D chart as it shows how much of the crypto market cap is comprised of the stablecoin USDT. A bullish USDT.D chart is generally considered bearish for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it indicates traders are unloading their crypto holdings in favor of the stablecoin. “Not ready to call it just yet, but the USDT.D weekly chart is starting to look primed for another push back to 5%. I’ll wait for Friday’s two-day close to get a more definitive answer on this idea, but it looks decent so far. (Tether dominance moves inversely to BTC and ETH).” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,658 at time of writing, down 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, USDT.D is at 4.79% at time of writing.

Inflation data could either fuel more selling or pave the way for relief if numbers come in cooler than expected.

Over the past weeks, markets were already on edge amid chatter of higher interest rates and global conflicts. Now, with the Middle East front in focus again, big swings may stay in place.

2025-06-13T17:51:36,"Ethereum ETFs See Record Inflows as ETH Closes on $3K","BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the charge with $80 million in net inflows, signaling strong investor demand. Why is Ethereum Witnessing an Uptick in ETF Inflows The last time Ethereum ETF inflows topped $125 million was on February 2, when investors poured $276 million into BlackRock’s ETHA with the altcoin trading at $2,900 then. Spot Ethereum ETFs have raked in $745 million during an 11-day surge, pushing total net inflows since their July debut to $3.5 billion. Product and regulatory milestones are part of the factors igniting the Ethereum ETF fire. For instance, Invesco recently filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking within its ETH ETF, which would give investors both price exposure and yield. Furthermore, Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade has the potential of boosting ETF interest by improving wallet usability and transaction efficiency. Therefore, a mix of regulatory optimism like staking in ETFs, technical upgrades, and consistent institutional flows are propelling Ethereum into the spotlight right now. Coupled with its dominant DeFi infrastructure and strong price dynamics, Ethereum ETFs are attracting fresh capital at scale. Ethereum’s Institutional Momentum Gains Steam Even though ETH is experiencing a pullback at the $2,530 level, the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization continues eyeing the psychological price of $3,000 . Where is Ethereum getting its backing from? Well, institutional demand is surging as Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin in derivatives markets, with sophisticated investors betting on ETH’s long-term growth and its pivotal role bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The COO of crypto exchange OKX Lennix Lai acknowledged, “Ethereum is overshadowing BTC on our perpetual futures market, with ETH accounting for 45.2% of trading volume over the past week. BTC, by comparison, sits at 38.1%.” Ethereum Futures Open Interest Smashes $20B Barrier Ether futures open interest has surged to an unprecedented all‑time high, now exceeding $20 billion. Leading on-chain metrics provider Glassnode acknowledged , “ETH futures open interest (cash-margined) just hit a new all-time high - topping $20B. Despite a slight pullback from the $2.8K levels, leverage continues to build as traders load up using stablecoins.” What’s Driving the Spike? Heavy Leverage & Speculation Traders are increasingly employing cash‑margined futures with stablecoins, layering on more leverage. This can be shown by the fact that open interest is at historic-high levels. Institutional Inflows & Whale Activity Institutional investors, most notably BlackRock, are ramping up ETH accumulation—some $163.6 million in the last two weeks alone. On‑chain analytics firm Lookonchain reports major whale distributions and withdrawals from exchanges, indicating a shift toward long-term stakeholding. Retail Engagement Retail traders appear to be returning, with futures trading frequency among small investors climbing above the one-year average. This resurgence is in stark contrast to diminished activity in Bitcoin’s on‑chain metrics. Price Context and Outlook Despite the surge in open interest, ETH remains below its key resistance of $2,800–$3,000, trading at the $2,500 zone . Analysts suggest that breaking above $2,800 could open the way toward $3,000 and beyond, though heightened risk awaits should the market cool. Conclusion With all eyes glued to ETH $3,000, the largest altcoin continues to enjoy various bullish on-chain metrics ranging from skyrocketing ETF inflows to historic high open interest. Even though a bullish June 2025 outlook is taking center stage, thanks to robust sentiment and potential upside, holding the psychological price of $2,500 will be key when it comes to determining the next move that Ethereum makes.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9566/ethereum-et-fs-see-record-inflows-as-eth-closes-on-3-k,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T17:49:16,"Charles Hoskinson floats $100m ADA treasury reboot to stabilize Cardano ecosystem","With just $31 million in stablecoins against $356 million in total value locked, Cardano’s founder has proposed unprecedented treasury diversification into Bitcoin and native dollar-pegged assets to boost the network’s decentralized finance and stablecoin ecosystem. On June 12, Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson proposed the idea in a YouTube video of swapping $100 million worth of Cardano ( ADA ) tokens for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and native stablecoins USDM and USDA to strengthen the ecosystem. Hoskinson framed the treasury overhaul as a strategic bet on Cardano’s future as a multi-asset financial ecosystem. Drawing inspiration from sovereign wealth funds in Norway and Abu Dhabi, he argued that converting a portion of ADA’s treasury into yield-generating assets would unlock liquidity and signal serious confidence to institutional players. You might also like: Bitcoin is oversold after Israeli strike on Iran: analyst A strategic fix for Cardano’s liquidity imbalance In his remarks, Hoskinson addressed the stark disparity between Cardano’s treasury composition and its decentralized finance ambitions. His argument stemmed from what he termed Cardano’s “stablecoin drought”, a glaring imbalance that’s stifling development. “We have a treasury with about $1.5 billion of ADA, and yet there’s only about $30 million of stablecoins in the entire Cardano ecosystem,” he said. “That’s a problem.” For context, while Ethereum boasts $190 in stablecoins for every $100 of TVL, Cardano lags far behind with just $9. “This isn’t just lagging behind; it’s choking our ecosystem,” Hoskinson argued. According to him, the proposed conversion aims to boost stablecoin reserves by targeting a 33% to 40% stablecoin-to-TVL ratio and to prime Bitcoin-focused decentralized finance by allocating $25 million to $50 million to Bitcoin to attract yield-seeking holders. Hoskinson also believes the move could improve the chances of Cardano-native stablecoins being listed on tier-two and tier-three exchanges. While some traders on X voiced concern that liquidating $100 million in ADA would crash the market, Hoskinson dismissed the skepticism with a chuckle, claiming, “ADA’s liquidity can swallow this without a 1% price blip.” He emphasized that the proposed treasury shift wouldn’t be a reckless exchange dump but a carefully managed operation using time-weighted average price algorithms and over-the-counter desks, the same tools institutional players use to quietly shift nine-figure positions. “This isn’t some meme coin we’re talking about,” he stressed. Whether the move turns Cardano into a decentralized finance powerhouse or backfires depends largely on timing and sentiment management.

2025-06-13T17:49:08,"Weekly Recap: Milestones Galore for Stablecoins","First slowly, then all at once. For years, crypto toiled in the darkness, a band of outlaws frowned upon by elites in Washington and in the media. Then came the market rallies, and Trump, and legislation like the GENIUS Act. Now crypto is finally everywhere. Look at the big news this week. Amazon and Walmart – companies about as mainstream as they come – are considering launching their own stablecoins. You read that right. According to the Wall Street Journal, the world’s biggest retailers are tired of paying merchant fees and other unaccountable costs to the likes of VISA and Mastercard. They want to use their own blockchain-based tokens to do their own transactions, their way. This is contingent on the passage of the GENIUS Act, which now appears a near certainty after this week’s Senate vote. Jesse Hamilton had the news. And that wasn’t the only big stablecoin news this week. Societe Generale, a lion of European finance, announced its own stablecoin on Ethereum and Solana . And Jack Ma’s Ant Group applied for stablecoin issuer licenses in Hong Kong and Singapore. The whole world is going stablecoin crazy. And why not? These mostly dollar-pegged tokens are a vastly better form of money, allowing quicker settlement times and lower fees particularly on cross-border transactions. GENIUS wasn’t the only crypto legislation moving forward in Congress. The market structure bill – known as CLARITY – emerged from key House committees . If enacted, the law would provide long-sought guardrails for crypto companies particularly around securities laws and the roles of the SEC and CFTC. The market reacted well to the Congressional tailwinds and we saw several new announcements for bitcoin accumulation vehicles (AKA “digital asset treasuries”). Anthony Pompliano, a crypto influencer and investor, will head a new $750 million fund , for instance. If you’re not impressed by all this, then crypto really may not be your thing. But legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones disagrees with you.

2025-06-13T17:37:51,"India cracks down on crypto tax evasion in enforcement push","India’s Income Tax Department has launched a fresh crackdown on potential tax evasion and money laundering tied to virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. According to government officials and local reporting , the department has identified individuals and entities engaging in crypto transactions who failed to comply with the Income Tax Act, 1961. The Central Board of Direct Taxes recently sent emails to thousands of individuals, urging them to review and update their income tax returns if crypto income was misreported or omitted. The initiative is part of CBDT’s broader NUDGE campaign, aimed at encouraging voluntary compliance. This marks the third NUDGE campaign in six months, following earlier drives that focused on foreign asset disclosures and false political donation deductions. Although India does not recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender, income from VDA transfers has been taxable since April 2022. Under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act, crypto income is taxed at a flat 30% without deductions, except for the cost of acquisition. Losses cannot be offset or carried forward. You might also like: Monero crypto remains bullish as price corrects into high-probability value zone India’s mismatching tax documents Officials say discrepancies are being uncovered through data analytics, including mismatches between income tax returns and tax deducted at source filings by crypto exchanges, or Virtual Asset Service Providers. Some taxpayers reportedly failed to file the mandatory Schedule VDA or declared crypto income at lower tax rates, while others wrongly claimed deductions. The crackdown comes amid broader concerns over the use of unaccounted income in high-risk crypto investments. While the government is working on a discussion paper to explore regulatory options for VDAs, including a possible ban, it has clarified that taxation does not imply formal approval of cryptocurrencies.

Both of these assets are arguably the premier safe-haven flights to safety. With the Middle Eastern conflict possibly about to escalate, can these assets rebound to all-time highs? Poorly correlated but heading in the same direction Even though both gold and Bitcoin can be categorised as safe-haven assets, the correlation between the two of them could be said to be volatile and inconsistent. Even so, while gold has been rising of late, as Bitcoin has been undergoing a correction, a recent bounce from Bitcoin has put the king of the cryptocurrencies back into the reckoning for a return to all-time highs. Gold confirms bull flag breakout Source: TradingView The daily chart for gold illustrates how it was moving inside of a rising channel for a long period of time. A breakout of this channel and confirmation have contributed to the development of a bull flag, a breakout of which has been confirmed and now the price is climbing higher. The measured move out of the bull flag is to $3,700. Bitcoin bounces sharply from support Source: TradingView The daily Bitcoin chart shows the relatively sharp climb up from $74,000 to the $112,000 all-time high. Following such a climb it was only natural for the price to consolidate sideways for an extended period. This resulted in the price going as low as $100,400. Since then, the price spiked, and more recently with the Middle Eastern conflict, it fell back down to support at $102,800. However, the collapse was bought back up very quickly, leaving a long candle wick behind and a bullish pinball candle. Gold or Bitcoin to take the lead from here? Source: TradingView The Bitcoin/Gold chart in the daily time frame reveals a real battle between the two sound money assets. Going back a lot further than the above chart shows, Bitcoin has been winning that battle hands down for most of its history. That said, Bitcoin has been unable to consistently stay above the Bitcoin/Gold price of 37 ounces, last set in April 2021. With central banks still buying a lot of gold, and with Bitcoin treasuries being set up left, right, and centre, it remains to be seen which of the two assets will take the lead from here.

At the 2025 Caixin Summer Summit, Chan confirmed that the city had already launched licensing systems for digital asset trading platforms and stablecoins. Hong Kong was also advancing new regulations for custody and OTC services. Chan previously said the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) was reviewing virtual asset derivatives for professional investors, starting with BTC and ETH Perpetuals. Hong Kong released its first policy statement on the development of digital assets in October 2022, covering the regulation of crypto exchanges and the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Chan believes that the future of digital tech growth in Hong Kong will be powered by blockchain and Web3 technologies. The Financial Secretary also said that legislation for stablecoin regulation was set for imminent passage. He added that he and his colleagues at the Financial Services & the Treasury Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) were working hard to get the relevant licensing regime to go live this year. Chan says it is essential to explore digital finance in the real economy Chan said financial innovation was where Hong Kong must win in order for the city to become a financial powerhouse. He added that it was essential to explore ways of utilizing digital finance to better support the real economy’s development, including in finance and cross-border financial services. Chan explained that the convergence of Web3 and AI was unlocking new frontiers in finance. Decentralized AI algorithms enhanced credit assessments, audited smart contracts more precisely, and delivered personalized investment strategies. Beyond finance, the technology streamlined supply chains transformed healthcare data management, and created new immersive gaming experiences. Web3 and AI were transforming businesses and public services, driving innovation and efficiency at every turn. “We will unveil a second policy statement on the development of virtual assets. It will cover how to make use of Web3 to fast-track the development of traditional financial services, empower the real economy, and strengthen the application of digital asset technologies.” – Paul Chan , Financial Secretary of Hong Kong The Financial Secretary also said the city offered a stable environment for investors amid a complicated geopolitical landscape.

Dow Jones Industrial Average heatmap | Source: TipRanks Markets are rattled by the potential economic fallout of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.

Notably, Nvidia fell 1.5%, and Apple declined 1% following the attacks. Simultaneously, investors rotated into traditional safe havens such as gold and the dollar. Consequently, crypto was among the most affected asset classes by Middle East tensions. The overall crypto market cap was down 2.7%, while Bitcoin (BTC) was down 2.19%, falling to $105k.
