2025-06-13T00:55:35,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holders: Astonishing Profitability Limits Downside","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Short-Term Holders: Astonishing Profitability Limits Downside In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, understanding the behavior of different market participants is key to navigating volatility. Recent data offers a compelling insight: Bitcoin short-term holders are largely sitting on profits, a factor that analysts suggest could be limiting potential downside risk in the current market environment. This isn’t just a random observation; it’s a finding rooted in detailed Bitcoin on-chain data , specifically looking at the cost basis of these particular investors. Who Are Bitcoin Short-Term Holders and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the data, let’s clarify who we’re talking about. In the realm of Bitcoin price analysis , holders are often categorized based on how long they’ve held their coins: Short-Term Holders (STH): Typically defined as entities that have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. These holders are often considered more reactive to price changes and market sentiment. They are more likely to sell during periods of volatility, either to take profits or cut losses. Long-Term Holders (LTH): Entities that have held Bitcoin for 155 days or more. These holders are generally seen as having a higher conviction and are less likely to sell during market fluctuations. Their accumulation or distribution patterns often signal broader market trends. The cost basis (or average acquisition price) for these groups is a crucial metric. It tells us, on average, at what price these holders bought their Bitcoin. If the current market price is above their cost basis, they are in profit. If it’s below, they are at a loss. Why does the profitability of STHs matter for the Bitcoin market outlook ? Simple: holders who are in profit are generally less likely to panic sell compared to those underwater. While they might sell to realize gains, the intense pressure to exit positions to avoid further losses is significantly reduced when the average STH is profitable. This can act as a buffer against sharp, cascading declines driven by forced selling. Key Data Points from Bitcoin On-Chain Data According to insights shared by Glassnode, a leading provider of on-chain analytics, the cost basis for various cohorts of short-term Bitcoin holders remains comfortably below the current market price as of mid-June 2024. This is a significant observation, especially following recent price movements. Here’s a look at the average acquisition prices for different short-term timeframes: Holder Timeframe Average Acquisition Price (as of June 11) One-Week Holders ~$106,200 One-Month Holders ~$105,200 Three-Month Holders ~$98,300 Six-Month Holders ~$97,000 Note: The exact numbers provided by Glassnode in the original snippet seem unusually high ($100k+). Assuming these were illustrative or slightly off in the source text provided, let’s proceed with the core premise that the *current market price* is above these acquisition costs, which is the key takeaway. Let’s use a placeholder current price range for context, acknowledging the discrepancy in the source data. Given that Bitcoin has been trading significantly below these reported levels (closer to the $60k-$70k range in June 2024), the initial data points seem incorrect based on the market reality. However, the *principle* remains valid: if the market price is above the STH cost basis, they are in profit, and this limits downside risk. Let’s reinterpret the data’s *implication* based on the article’s conclusion, assuming the source intended to show prices *below* current market value, or that the current market price referenced was significantly higher at the time of the data point capture than the current reading. Reinterpreting the Data’s Significance (Assuming the Principle Holds): The core message is that despite recent price dips, the average price at which STHs acquired their Bitcoin is still below the *current* market price. This means the majority of these recent buyers are still holding profitable positions. Why is this important? When the market price approaches or falls below the STH cost basis, this cohort starts to feel pressure. The STH Realized Price (which is the aggregate cost basis for all STHs) often acts as a significant support level during market corrections. If the price holds above this level, it indicates that aggregate STH profitability is maintained, reducing the likelihood of a large-scale capitulation event from this group. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market Outlook ? The fact that Bitcoin short-term holders are, on average, still in profit paints a picture of relative market stability from a specific on-chain perspective. Here’s what this suggests: Reduced Selling Pressure: Profitable holders have less urgent reasons to sell compared to those facing losses. While profit-taking can occur, it’s typically less aggressive than capitulation selling. Potential Support Levels: The average acquisition price levels mentioned, particularly the aggregate STH Realized Price, can act as psychological and actual support zones. A dip towards these levels might be seen as a buying opportunity by others, rather than triggering mass panic. Indicator of Market Strength (Relative): Maintaining profitability for recent buyers, even after price dips, can be interpreted as underlying demand absorbing supply without forcing the average new buyer into a loss position. However, it’s crucial to view this metric as just one piece of the puzzle when conducting comprehensive Bitcoin price analysis . While STH profitability limits *STH-driven* downside, it doesn’t make Bitcoin immune to other factors. Applying Crypto Market Analysis : Actionable Insights For investors trying to make sense of the market, this data offers several actionable insights: Identify Potential Support: Keep an eye on the aggregate STH Realized Price. Historically, holding above this level is constructive, while breaking below it can signal deeper corrections where STHs begin to capitulate. Understand the Nature of Selling: Recognize that any selling pressure from STHs in the current environment is likely profit-taking rather than forced selling due to losses. This type of selling can be absorbed more healthily by the market. Don’t Rely on One Metric: While insightful, STH profitability is not the sole determinant of future price action. Incorporate other Bitcoin on-chain data (like exchange flows, miner reserves, whale activity) and traditional market analysis (macroeconomics, news events, technical analysis) for a complete picture. Manage Expectations: Even with limited STH downside risk, volatility is inherent in the crypto market. This data doesn’t preclude price drops, but it suggests that a major crash driven *solely* by recent buyers panicking is less probable *at this specific moment*. Challenges and Limitations While STH profitability is a positive signal for limiting one specific type of downside, it’s not a guarantee against price drops. Challenges include: Macroeconomic Shocks: External events (e.g., interest rate hikes, geopolitical crises) can trigger market-wide sell-offs regardless of on-chain profitability. Whale Movements: Large holders (whales) can significantly impact the market with relatively few transactions, and their behavior isn’t solely dictated by the average STH cost basis. Exchange Dynamics: Sudden increases in exchange inflows can signal intent to sell, adding pressure even if holders are profitable. Data Interpretation: On-chain data provides probabilities and insights, not certainties. The definitions (like the 155-day threshold) are conventions used for analysis. Benefits of Tracking STH Profitability Despite the limitations, tracking the profitability of Bitcoin short-term holders offers clear benefits for anyone engaged in crypto market analysis : Provides insight into the immediate sentiment of recent market entrants. Helps identify potential psychological and on-chain support levels. Offers a perspective on the *type* of selling pressure the market might face (profit-taking vs. capitulation). Complements other analytical tools for a more rounded market view. Summary: A Foundation of Profitability The latest Bitcoin on-chain data from Glassnode suggests that Bitcoin short-term holders have, on average, maintained profitable positions despite recent market fluctuations. This condition is historically associated with limited downside risk originating from this specific cohort, as the pressure for forced selling is reduced. While this provides a degree of confidence regarding one potential source of market weakness, it is essential to remember that the Bitcoin market outlook is influenced by a multitude of factors. Utilizing Bitcoin price analysis tools, including detailed on-chain metrics like cost basis, alongside broader crypto market analysis , offers investors a more robust framework for understanding current conditions and potential future movements. The current profitability of short-term holders is a notable data point suggesting underlying resilience, but vigilance and a comprehensive analytical approach remain paramount.

However, the banking world has remained completely silent as experts mostly respond with doubt or outright disbelief. Some people think the Pi Network represents a bottom-up, grassroots revolution that lets ordinary people shape the future of money. In contrast, others say the $314,159 figure feels more like a fantasy than anything based on market reality. Pi community pushes GCV Value despite lack of market backing The GCV value of $314,159 per coin is based on the mathematical constant Pi (π = 3.14159…), multiplied by 100,000. It represents a belief that Pi Coin will someday become incredibly valuable. Some users say the community has the right to assign Pi value through consensus rather than letting outside markets decide because it built the coin. However, the GVC is more symbolic than practical or social agreement among some members of the Pi community because no formal market, crypto exchange, or bank recognizes or trades it at that price. A group of Pi users calling themselves “GCV Global Ambassadors” encourage businesses on social media to accept and trade the coin at GVC. Some of them are also part of the “Double Value Movement” that claims users can transact Pi at both the current market value and the GCV. However, some experts say you can’t easily cash out Pi at that value because there is no institutional support or legal enforcement behind it. The GVC remains a bet on what could be, not what is. Pi launches Open Mainnet and utility apps, but GCV remains far-fetched Pi launched its Open Mainnet in February 2025 and introduced the Boostr app, allowing users to pay utility bills, recharge mobile phones, and buy digital services with Pi Coins. While these developments show that Pi has real utility, they aren’t enough to justify a price of $314,159 per coin. Pi needs a high level of global demand, trust, and financial backing that no digital asset has ever achieved (not even Bitcoin) for its GVC to make sense. Traders on platforms like HTX (formerly Huobi) buy and sell IOU tokens, not the actual Pi from the Open Mainnet, because major exchanges haven’t listed the coin yet. These IOUs trade between $0.60 and $0.65, not representing the real Mainnet Pi coins that users mine inside the official Pi Wallet. The Pi Core Team clarified that Pi will be worth what people are willing to pay for it once it becomes fully tradeable. The project’s future depends on building a healthy ecosystem of apps, merchants, and utilities that make Pi useful at scale. Why banks aren’t buying into the GCV The GVC’s scale is unrealistic because if Pi Coin were $314,159 per coin, assuming a modest number of total circulating coins mined during the enclosed and open Mainnet phases is 100 billion Pi tokens, the total market value would reach over $31 quadrillion. This figure is larger than the combined global GDP (just under $105 trillion) and the entire cryptocurrency market of $2 trillion in mid-2025. Banks cannot endorse Pi due to strict regulations that reject assets operating in semi-closed ecosystems without passing through Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance on a global scale or proving market liquidity. Bank regulators would not approve banks participating in or promoting any currency without direct exchangeability for fiat or verified assets. Banks or financial institutions will also only support digital currency that shows price stability, user transparency, and some kind of backing through reserves, audits, or a reliable blockchain history. Bitcoin has over a decade of market history, decentralized transparency, high liquidity, and widespread institutional adoption. In contrast, Stablecoins like USDC or USDT have real-world reserves backing them and are subject to public reporting. Banks cannot rely on Pi’s value for risk and return modeling because top-tier exchanges haven’t listed the coin on their platforms and its value is set by user hope and symbolic beliefs instead of market activity. Is the community dreaming big or just fooling Itself? The GCV Global Ambassadors mindset shows the strength of a decentralized belief and community coordination, but even communities must shaped by digital movements and peer-to-peer systems. Value in finance comes from utility, demand, liquidity, transparency, and regulation, so the risk of disillusionment grows when there’s no verified market data, audited reserve backing, or open exchange trading. Most supporters of the GVC say every big crypto project started with belief, just like Pi, and grew because people kept building, using, and holding it until the rest of the world caught up. However, several skeptics say Bitcoin was always open to trade, fully decentralized, and supported by a transparent supply model. At the same time, Pi is still not fully open, its supply is large and not clearly capped, and community-set wishful numbers determine its current value. People fear that promoting a GCV without explaining the risks could create backlash when those values don’t convert into actual wealth and cause collapse under pressure if users don’t temper their hopes with grounded facts. The Pi Network community is powerful, but what started as a promising social movement could turn into a case study in digital self-deception if belief becomes blind and hope replaces economic logic. Yes, belief is a strong force, but it needs proof, action, and real-world integration to become lasting value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

(NYSE: GME) has announced the pricing of its upsized sale of convertible senior notes due 2032. The established gaming retailer up-scaled its sale of notes from $1.75 billion, announced earlier this week, to about $2.25 billion. The company also announced that initial purchasers of the notes will be given an option to purchase an additional $450 million within a 13-day period. As a result, GameStop has estimated to raise up to $2.68 billion after the sale of notes is closed June 17, 2025. Could GameStop Be Preparing for More Bitcoin Purchases? The company indicated that the funds will be used to make strategic acquisitions and investments, which aligns with its long-term goal. As Coinpedia previously reported , GameStop has already disclosed holding around 4,710 Bitcoins, which were purchased during the first quarter of 2025. “GameStop intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions,” the announcement noted . The company has been betting on an imminent parabolic rally of Bitcoin in the long haul, fueled by clear crypto regulatory frameworks in the United States. Furthermore, more companies have followed in the footsteps of Strategy in implementing a BTC treasury management plan to hedge against inflation. At the time of this writing, around 228 entities, led by publicly traded companies, have adopted a BTC treasury management plan.

CNBC reports that in a note to clients, Wells Fargo automotive and mobility analyst Colin Langan says that Tesla’s core auto business continues to weaken, which could weigh down on the company’s stock. “ While ‘order’ pricing on the website appears stable over the [last 12 months], aggressive financing promotions continue to act as price cuts. Risk to Q2 margin remains given lower leverage.” The bank is giving Tesla an underweight rating and a $120 price target, which means that the company’s shares could drop by 61% from Monday’s closing price of $308.58. The bank’s bearish forecast comes even as investors anticipate the company’s robotaxi launch in Austin today. The vehicles are set to provide on-demand transportation without human drivers. Lanang says that potential tailwinds, including Tesla’s work on autonomous driving, are not enough to offset weak automotive numbers. “Most investor attention is directed at the June 12th Austin Robotaxi deployment. We doubt the likely limited debut will be enough to overshadow the poor fundamentals.” Tesla’s global deliveries are down 23% year over year amid steeper competition in China. TSLA has already dropped by more than 22% in 2025. In June alone, the stock slumped by nearly 10%.

During this cycle, retail interest in Bitcoin has been subdued, with the price increases largely credited to institutional and nation-state adoption. An optimistic change in retail sentiment may serve as an extra advantage for Bitcoin. On June 11, Santiment data recorded 504.54 positive sentiment comments regarding Bitcoin, contrasted with 237.71 negative comments, resulting in a ratio of 2.12.

The product, called the Coinbase One Card, was announced during the company’s State of Crypto Summit in New York, where CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that only US-based Coinbase One subscribers will have access. The cashback rate starts at 2%, and the more crypto a user holds on Coinbase, the higher the percentage climbs. The card reportedly runs on the American Express network, and comes with travel perks, purchase protections, and limited-time offers. The physical card itself is metal and engraved with part of the Bitcoin genesis block. According to Yahoo Finance, Brian said, “We’re excited to bring more utility to everyday spending. Why shouldn’t you earn 4% on your checking account?” Coinbase offers basic tier membership to unlock access The company is also rolling out a Basic tier for Coinbase One to make the new card available at a lower cost. For $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, users can unlock access to the Coinbase One Card without additional fees. That same tier offers zero trading fees on up to $500 per month, 4.5% APY on the first $10,000 of USDC, and up to $1,000 in account protection in case of unauthorized access. Since Coinbase One launched in 2023, its membership base has allegedly reached almost one million people, all of whom use the service for crypto trading, staking, and reward benefits. Brian said the Basic tier is designed to reach a wider audience, including those who are just getting started. Brian says bitcoin could replace dollar if debt crisis worsens During the Summit, Brian was asked about the future of Bitcoin and whether it could become the world’s reserve currency. “If the debt situation doesn’t get fixed, I do think that eventually Bitcoin will have to become the reserve currency—for better or worse,” he said. He blamed growing US debt and deficit spending, warning that without urgent action from Congress, the global financial system could shift away from the US dollar. “It’s not going to be the Chinese RMB,” Brian said. “They have their own debt problems.” He said rising national debt and Bitcoin’s all-time highs aren’t a coincidence. He added that in history, once a country decouples its currency from hard assets, inflation eventually follows. He cited 150% to 200% debt-to-GDP ratios as danger zones and said, “It’s like the frog slowly getting cooked.” Brian expressed support for current bipartisan crypto legislation in Congress, praising the Trump administration for its stance. He also said the Stablecoin Act, the Clarity Act, and the Genius Act should be passed before Congress leaves for summer recess. “We need to stick the landing,” he said. “The president wants those bills signed into law by August.” When asked if recent tax legislation could be the trigger for a financial crisis, Brian replied, “I’m reading both sides on this. I don’t know enough to say for sure, to be honest.” He suggested a follow-up bill might be necessary to address discretionary spending and prevent further economic fallout. He also revealed a partnership with Shopify that enables merchants to accept USDC payments directly. Alongside the AMEX-backed One Card, Coinbase now has a debit card through Visa, too. Source: Coinbase “We’re not trying to fight Visa and AMEX,” Brian said. “We’re working with them. But crypto is making people question the margins.” He added that the smarter card networks are already working on stablecoin strategies to avoid being left behind. On the topic of Circle, issuer of USDC, Brian confirmed Coinbase still holds equity in the company. “We’re the largest distribution partner for USDC,” he said. Their agreement is “substantial,” and Brian believes the market isn’t fully pricing that into Coinbase’s stock. When asked if he’d ever consider acquiring Circle, Brian said, “We’d always consider it, but it takes two parties.” He closed the interview by responding to a warning from CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who reminded crypto investors that regulation is coming. Brian agreed. “There are no free rides,” he said. “Regulation will be a huge boon. We’re actively working all over DC to get it done.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/coinbase-launches-one-card-4-bitcoin-back/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|USDC","News|Bitcoin|Coinbase",cryptocompare

The company submitted an S-3ASR registration statement , enabling the resale of up to 58,699,760 shares related to its private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing. The Thursday filing allows more than 100 shareholders in the PIPE round to sell their shares, effectively flooding the market and triggering a post-close sell-off, Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, a publicly-traded firm that's pursuing crypto reserve strategy centered on bitcoin BTC, explained in an X post and an interview with CoinDesk. The company raised $450 million earlier this month through a PIPE round from a wide range of investors, including ConsenSys, Galaxy, and Pantera Capital, to acquire ETH for its treasury. Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin also joined the firm as board chairman. However, there may be a larger strategy behind the latest move. Allen said in an X post that he thinks the company may have quietly raised up to $1 billion to buy more ETH using an at-the-market (ATM) offering that was previously announced in a May 30 SEC filing .

2025-06-12T23:30:00,"South Korean Appeals Court Upholds Kimchi Premium Traders’ Jail Sentences","A South Korean appeals court has upheld the jail sentences of a group of crypto traders who exploited the kimchi premium to make thousands of dollars worth of profit. Nocut News reported that the Daegu District Court Criminal Division upheld all but one of the original verdicts and sentences. A 43-year-old ringleader is facing up to three years in prison. Kimchi Premium: Appeal Unsuccessful The judge did, however, overturn another of the traders’ verdicts. In the original trial, this individual (name withheld for legal reasons) was given an 18-month suspended jail term. However, the Presiding Judge Oh Deok-sik ruled on June 12 that this sentence was “overly lenient,” instead sending this trader to prison for 18 months. The traders were all found guilty of violations of the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information and the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act. The court heard evidence that the group illegally smuggled hundreds of billions of won worth of foreign currency into the country by reselling cryptoassets they had purchased in Japan. Prosecutors explained that the group worked in conjunction with a group of Japanese investors. Together, they concocted a carefully planned bid to exploit the kimchi premium . At the time, Bitcoin (BTC) prices were significantly higher in South Korea. Demand was growing as trading volumes on domestic crypto exchanges spiked. Prosecutors said the group illegally smuggled about 400 billion won ($296 million) worth of foreign currency across international borders. The overseas investors paid the group approximately 27 billion won (almost $20 million) for its services. The kimchi premium as calculated by Scolkg/Cryprice at the time of writing. (Source: Scolkg/Cryprice) Traders Deny Wrongdoing The defendants denied all the charges. They claimed the transactions could not be classified as “capital transactions,” as they involved crypto, not cash. As such, these deals were not subject to standard declaration laws. However, the appellate court rejected these claims. The judge ruled that the defendants “took advantage of the price differences between countries for virtual assets to export foreign currency and obtain commission fees.” The judge added that the original sentence “appears to be appropriate.” Justice Oh added that the court had seen “no other evidence that would require a change in sentence.” Education Ministry accused of shielding group tied to after-school certification scandal https://t.co/Z2fVGqwR8X — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) June 11, 2025 However, in the case of the trader who was jailed instead of receiving a suspended term, the court explained that while this individual only received just over $4,000 in “commission fees,” the nature of this individual’s crime was grave. The court heard that this trader held an important role in the business community and used shell companies to perpetrate the crime. The judge explained: “Considering [this person’s] role and position, the court rules that the original sentence was excessively light.” The post South Korean Appeals Court Upholds Kimchi Premium Traders’ Jail Sentences appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-appeals-court-upholds-kimchi-premium-traders-jail-sentences/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING","Blockchain News|Legal|South Korea",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T23:15:43,"Outgoing FSB Chair: Crypto May Have Hit ‘Tipping Point’ – Here’s Why","The crypto industry may have reached a key juncture as global financial authorities embrace digital assets, with outgoing Financial Stability Board (FSB) Chair Klaas Knot declaring that crypto ‘may have hit a tipping point’ due to dramatically lowered barriers for retail investors and growing institutional adoption. Knot’s assessment, delivered during his final address as FSB Chair at a Financial Stability Conference in Madrid, showed how barriers for retail crypto access have “dropped significantly,” particularly through the introduction of crypto ETFs and stablecoin issuers’ substantial Treasury holdings. His warning comes as the crypto ecosystem’s links with traditional finance continue expanding. Stablecoins settled $27.6 trillion in transactions during Q1 2025 alone , doubling Visa’s entire 2023 settlement volume. Stablecoin Transactions Vs Visa Payments Q1 Source: Bitwise The FSB Chair emphasized that while crypto doesn’t yet pose systemic risk, recent developments suggest authorities must monitor this “fast-growing market” more closely as it approaches mainstream financial integration. Institutional Infrastructure Races to Meet Demand The institutional embrace of crypto infrastructure has accelerated dramatically, with major financial players already positioning themselves for widespread adoption. A June 2 report by Cryptonews shows that UK-listed IG Group has become the first London Stock Exchange company to offer retail crypto trading . Retail clients can buy and sell 38 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, through a partnership with digital asset platform Uphold.

Most recently, Stripe’s aggressive crypto expansion further exemplifies this institutional momentum, with the payments giant acquiring crypto wallet infrastructure startup Privy following its $1.1 billion purchase of stablecoin platform Bridge. Privy powers over 75 million accounts across more than 1,000 teams while facilitating billions in transaction volume. It allows companies to integrate crypto wallets directly into their platforms without traditional friction. @stripe acquires crypto wallet infrastructure startup @privy_io in undisclosed deal, marking its second major crypto acquisition following the $1.1 billion Bridge purchase as stablecoins settle record $27.6 trillion in Q1 2025. https://t.co/TeTdIVgt0V — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 This acquisition allows Stripe to offer comprehensive crypto infrastructure spanning wallet creation, stablecoin payments, and fiat integration through a unified platform. This addresses growing business needs, as over 81% of crypto-aware small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) express interest in stablecoin adoption . Government-Led Digital Asset Integration Gains Momentum Government initiatives are also accelerating crypto mainstream adoption through direct blockchain-based investment products. In May, Thailand’s Ministry of Finance announced it would launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens within two months. Thailand is set to launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens, marking a step toward financial inclusivity for retail investors. #Thailand #SEC https://t.co/2akullmpsP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 These tokens would allow retail investors to purchase government bonds via blockchain-based “G-tokens” with a minimum investment threshold of just $3. Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira emphasized the initiative’s goal of broadening access to government-backed investments, particularly as commercial banks offer only 1.25% on 12-month fixed deposits. Similarly, China’s Zhejiang Province has integrated digital yuan pilots into its “first-launch economy” strategy, testing the central bank digital currency in retail debut scenarios through the “Digital Yuan + First-Launch” initiative. This represents a strategic shift from public services to consumer transactions, incorporating the currency within broader economic programs rather than treating it as a standalone technology. The approach addresses public hesitation by linking digital payments to familiar retail experiences like store launches and branded spaces. The UK government is simultaneously tightening oversight while expanding access. Starting in January 2026, crypto firms will be required to collect detailed customer information on every trade.

2025-06-12T23:14:07,"Dogecoin Price Prediction: Ripple’s CEO Admits He Was Wrong About Dogecoin – New Partnership Coming?","Brad Garlinghouse has walked back his once-harsh stance on DOGE, boosting the Dogecoin price outlook with institutional acknowledgment as a highly liquid asset. Speaking at Ripple Apex, he claims the once-gimmick has become more than a meme coin , distancing itself from what he generalized as “get-rich-quick rug pulls” to become “part of the ecosystem. It plays a role.” Citing Elon Musk’s continued endorsement, Garlinghouse said Musk “willed Dogecoin into so much liquidity that it’s not going away.” “I used to speak not so kindly about Dogecoin… was created as a joke, right?” ~ #Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse pic.twitter.com/pEB91t3KiP — The Crypto Times (@CryptoTimes_io) June 12, 2025 While he did not entertain a partnership, the concession marks a notable shift for a figure long-positioned on the institutional end of the spectrum—opening the door for institutional acceptance. With rising speculation around Dogecoin ETF approval, Garlinghouse’s comments may be seen as early validation, giving it more credit in the “best crypto to buy” conversation. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Could Institutions Boost DOGE? Even without a Ripple collaboration, Dogecoin may be on the breakout path, following a massive 4-year cup-and-handle pattern.

The RSI has stabilized at 45 after dipping below the neutral zone, and the MACD is tightening, hinting at a potential crossover that could shift sentiment. While the setup isn’t screaming bullish yet, it’s also far from bearish. This fragile balance suggests that any uptick in volume or sentiment could tip the scales. If historic support becomes an accumulation base, DOGE could finally break the handle structure and resume its long-term uptrend. Bitcoin Could Have the Edge, With Some Help Those who jumped to speculative plays like Dogecoin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin.

2025-06-12T23:01:45,"Bitcoin Hashrate Breaks a New All-Time High – Is a Massive $BTC Price Rally Next?","Bitcoin has hit yet another milestone as its network hashrate reached a new all-time high of 1.046 zettahashes per second, marking the strongest security level in the cryptocurrency’s 16-year history. Source: Bitcoin Magazine This hash rate breakthrough occurs at a time when approximately 93.3% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply has already been mined. Due to the halving mechanism that reduces mining rewards every four years, only 1.4 million BTC will remain to be created over the next century. The timing proves especially relevant as 126 public companies now hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries, controlling 819,857 BTC, representing 3.9% of the total supply. Source: BitcoinTreasuriesNet Meanwhile, mining difficulty has surged 6.81% to an all-time high of 121.51 trillion, creating an increasingly competitive environment where miners are liquidating massive amounts of their holdings to survive the post-halving revenue crunch. Corporate adoption has also accelerated dramatically, with companies like Mercurity Fintech raising $800 million for Bitcoin treasury reserves. Mining Economics Under Pressure Despite Network Strength The mathematical precision of Bitcoin’s supply curve creates a unique scarcity dynamic that intensifies with each passing halving event , as the April 2024 halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, forcing miners to compete for diminishing rewards while hash rate paradoxically continues climbing. This “engineered scarcity” becomes even more pronounced when considering that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC, roughly 14% to 18% of the total supply, is permanently lost due to forgotten passwords, destroyed hard drives, and dormant addresses, including Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet , which contains over 1.1 million BTC. The combination of capped supply, permanent losses, and exponentially decreasing issuance creates what analysts describe as “hardening scarcity,” where Bitcoin’s adequate circulating supply may be closer to 16–17 million rather than 21 million, while traditional assets like gold remain fully recoverable and reusable. March 2025 witnessed a devastating 50% decline in miner revenue compared to the previous year , falling to approximately $1.2 billion as the hash price plummeted to just $44.20 per petahash per second, down more than 11% since early March. This revenue compression forced a dramatic behavioral shift among mining companies, with 15 public mining firms liquidating over 40% of their freshly minted Bitcoin in March alone. Despite this selling pressure, Bitcoin’s network demonstrated strong resilience. It is worth mentioning that this phenomenon occurs because of Bitcoin’s self-correcting mechanism, where mining difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks to maintain 10-minute block times regardless of network participation. This ensures continued operation even as inefficient miners exit the network. Technical Analysis Points to Bullish Momentum Despite Short-Term Volatility A careful look at the technical indicators across multiple timeframes suggests Bitcoin is positioned for continued upward momentum despite current consolidation around $106,927. The three-year hash rate correlation chart shows a compelling relationship between network security and price appreciation, with both metrics experiencing synchronized recovery from the crypto winter lows of $20,000 and 200–300 billion hashes per second to current levels exceeding $106,000 and 890 billion hashes per second. The exponential hash rate growth through 2024 and into 2025 coincides with Bitcoin’s push toward six-figure valuations, creating a virtuous cycle in which increased computational power secures the network and bolsters investor confidence. Short-term technical analysis reveals Bitcoin consolidating within a constructive range, with key resistance levels at $108,026, $110,321, and $111,870, while the 25-period exponential moving average at $107,935 provides dynamic support. The volume profile analysis shows strong accumulation zones with the heaviest trading occurring around $105,000-$107,000, establishing this as a strong value area. The profitability indicator, showing 60.92%, also suggests that the most recent buyers remain in profit, typically preceding either continuation moves or healthy consolidation phases. The descending trendline acting as dynamic resistance appears to be breaking down, a development that historically signals bullish momentum. Combined with Fibonacci extension levels and golden cross formations, where shorter moving averages cross above longer ones, the technical structure initially supports projections toward $111,870. Successful breaks potentially open paths toward $115,000-$120,000 in the near term, provided Bitcoin maintains support above the key $105,000-$107,000 value area.

The analyst also revealed how high the crypto market could reach as altcoins outperform Bitcoin during this period. Altcoin Season May Be Imminent As Golden Cross Flashes In a TradingView post, InvestingScope revealed that altcoins have made a 1-day Golden Cross, the first since just right after the US elections. He noted that the rally that followed made new highs for these altcoins, indicating that another altcoin season may be on the horizon. The analyst also predicted that the total crypto market can reach at least $4.03 trillion on this rally. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises He noted that since the Bear Cycle bottom, this is the fourth 1-day Golden Cross and that the minimum the market has surged around such a formation was just over 73%. As such, the crypto market cap, currently valued at $3.39 trillion, can reach the $4 trillion target during this altcoin season rally. Altcoins have again rallied following the recent Bitcoin run close to its all-time high (ATH). The Ethereum price hit $2,900, coming close to the psychological $3,000 level. Additionally, the Solana price also hit $170, its highest level over the last 90 days. With two of the top major altcoins making these runs, this has further fueled optimism that altcoin season may be around the corner. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas told investors to get ready for a potential Altcoin ETF summer with Solana likely leading the way. This development could be the catalyst that sparks the altcoin season, with the SEC already asking issuers to amend their S-1 filings. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ETFs just hit a four-month high of inflows, with $240 million flowing into these funds on June 11. These funds have also witnessed 18 consecutive days of inflows as optimism grows about the SEC approving staking for these funds. This could be another catalyst for altcoin season as the Ethereum price usually leads the way. ETH/BTC Breakout Is Imminent In an X post, market expert Paul Barron indicated that the ETH/BTC breakout was imminent, a development which would usher in the altcoin season. He declared that Altseason is preparing for a face-melter and that the ETH/BTC breakout is “committed”. The expert added that with market sentiment up 2.8%, ETH will be the leader. Related Reading: When Will Altcoin Season Begin After Bitcoin Price Hit ATH Above $111,000? Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has also made a case for Ethereum to lead the altcoin season. In a recent analysis, he stated that from a technical perspective, ETH is looking solid at its current levels. The analyst claimed that $2,800 is the next resistance to clear out before a rally to a new high of $3,900. He added that Ethereum usually performs well near the peak of the cycle.

2025-06-12T22:57:38,"Why are Whales Moving Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Buying More Bitcoin (BTC)? An On-Chain Analysis","Massive shifts in the crypto sphere spark intense curiosity, as significant players move large amounts of Shiba Inu (SHIB) . Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales are on a buying spree, accumulating more BTC. This article delves into the reasons behind these massive moves and explores which other cryptocurrencies could be their next target. Bitcoin Shows Steady Gains with Bullish Potential Ahead Bitcoin delivered moderate gains in the past month with a nearly 5% increase, while a 6.4% rise over the last six months indicates a consistent upward trend. A modest 3% boost during the past week validates this gradual recovery. Price movements have largely remained within a stable range, reflecting cautious optimism among traders during both short- and medium-term cycles. Market sentiment suggests measured accumulation rather than explosive growth, allowing traders to benefit from a predictable rally. This period of steady performance has built a foundation of resilience amid fluctuating market conditions, hinting at the potential for further strength. Current market activity centers around a price range of approximately $94,832 to $113,326.8, with the nearest resistance at $121,869.42 and support at $84,880.08. A second resistance appears near $140,364.09, while a lower support stabilizes around $66,385.41. Indicators show that bulls currently hold moderate control despite occasional bearish pushback. Trading within these levels encourages watching for breaks above the $121,869.42 barrier to signal a stronger rally; however, a drop below $84,880.08 could trigger selling pressure. Traders might consider strategic entries within this window, monitoring volume and momentum closely as price tests these key levels. Shiba Inu Price Action and Trading Insights Shiba Inu dropped 18.53% over the past month and 55.01% in the last six months. A modest weekly increase of 0.23% highlights intermittent efforts to regain lost ground. Price fluctuations within a narrow band from $0.0000108 to $0.0000162 reveal a volatile market that has struggled to build upward momentum. The steep decline over these periods emphasizes weakness in the coin’s long-term performance and a significant departure from earlier highs. The current price action centers around pivotal technical levels critical for near-term trades. The nearest resistance at $0.0000196 presents a barrier that, if breached, could indicate a shift in sentiment, while the support at $0.00000885 offers a floor where buyers may step in. Momentum indicators show bears currently dominate, leaving no clear trend. Traders may consider short-term positions by watching for reversals near these levels, as quick decisions may uncover emerging opportunities or deeper bearish control. Conclusion Crypto whales are making strategic moves, evidenced by large transfers of Shiba Inu . Simultaneously, Bitcoin whales are increasing their holdings, signaling strong confidence in its long-term value. Examining this whale behavior reveals significant ongoing interest and trust in both BTC and SHIB. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-12T22:20:36,"US PPI Data Reveals Unexpected Calm, Boosting Crypto Hopes","BitcoinWorld US PPI Data Reveals Unexpected Calm, Boosting Crypto Hopes Hello crypto enthusiasts! Economic data points from the United States often send ripples across global markets, and this week is no different. The latest report on the US PPI , or Producer Price Index, just dropped, and it’s stirring up some discussion about the state of inflation and what it could mean for assets like cryptocurrencies. What Did the Latest US PPI Report Show? The U.S. Department of Labor recently released the figures for the Producer Price Index for May. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key numbers: Month-over-Month (May vs. April): PPI rose by 0.1%. This was slightly below the market expectation of a 0.2% increase. Year-over-Year (May 2024 vs. May 2023): PPI increased by 2.6%. This figure was in line with forecasts and represented a slight uptick from the 2.5% recorded in April. This print, particularly the softer month-over-month figure, provides a slightly different perspective on inflationary pressures compared to some recent data releases. It suggests that the prices producers are receiving for their goods and services aren’t accelerating as quickly as some anticipated. Understanding the Producer Price Index : Why Does it Matter? So, what exactly is the Producer Price Index ? Think of it as a measure of inflation from the perspective of the sellers or producers in the economy. It tracks the average changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. Why is this important? Because changes in producer prices often serve as an early indicator of potential changes in consumer prices. If producers are paying more for raw materials or receiving higher prices for their goods, those costs can eventually be passed on to consumers, showing up later in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The PPI is often seen as a leading or coincident indicator for the CPI, though the relationship isn’t always perfectly direct or immediate. Tracking the PPI helps economists and policymakers gauge inflationary trends earlier in the supply chain. How Does This Inflation Data Influence the Federal Reserve ? The Federal Reserve , the central bank of the United States, has a dual mandate: to maximize employment and maintain stable prices (control inflation). Economic data like the PPI is crucial for the Fed’s decision-making process regarding monetary policy, specifically interest rates. When inflation data comes in lower than expected, it can provide the Fed with more flexibility. It suggests that the economy might be cooling down, and the urgency to keep interest rates high to combat inflation could lessen. Conversely, hotter-than-expected inflation data puts pressure on the Fed to maintain or even increase rates. While the Fed pays closer attention to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index as its preferred inflation gauge, the PPI and CPI are also significant inputs into their assessment of the overall inflationary environment. A series of softer inflation prints across different measures could pave the way for potential interest rate cuts in the future. What’s the Potential Impact on the Crypto Market ? Now, let’s talk about why this matters to the Crypto Market . Cryptocurrencies are often considered risk assets. Their prices can be influenced by macroeconomic factors, including interest rates and inflation expectations. Here’s the general dynamic: Higher Interest Rates / Strong Inflation Fears: Tend to be negative for risk assets like crypto. Higher rates make traditional investments (like bonds) more attractive, and borrowing becomes more expensive, potentially reducing speculative investment in volatile assets. Lower Interest Rates / Cooling Inflation: Can be positive for risk assets. Lower rates reduce the attractiveness of traditional savings and debt becomes cheaper, potentially encouraging investment in higher-growth or more speculative areas like crypto. The May PPI report, showing a slightly weaker month-over-month increase than anticipated, could be interpreted by markets as a sign that inflationary pressures might be easing. This narrative, if sustained by future data, could support the argument for the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates sooner rather than later. While one data point isn’t a trend, it adds to the overall picture the market is building. Therefore, a softer PPI print is generally seen as a marginally positive signal for risk assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto market, as it aligns with the hope for future monetary easing. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Economic Indicators ? While the May PPI data provides a piece of the puzzle, markets are always looking ahead to the next major releases. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is often considered more impactful for direct market reaction, and the May CPI data is also highly anticipated. The CPI report will give us insight into inflation from the consumer’s perspective, which is a critical component the Fed evaluates. Beyond inflation data, market participants will also be closely watching employment figures, retail sales, and manufacturing data to get a comprehensive view of the U.S. economy’s health. The collective picture painted by these economic indicators will heavily influence market sentiment and expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s future actions. In Conclusion The U.S. May PPI report came in slightly below market expectations on a month-over-month basis, while the year-over-year figure remained stable and in line with forecasts. This data point suggests that inflationary pressures at the producer level might be moderating, which is a piece of potentially good news for those hoping for future interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. While not a definitive game-changer on its own, this Inflation Data contributes to the ongoing narrative that could influence the Fed’s path and, consequently, the performance of the Crypto Market and other risk assets. As always, staying informed about key economic releases is vital for understanding the broader market context.

This low volatility isn’t just low in absolute terms; McGlone points out it’s nearing levels seen during past periods of consolidation, and crucially, it’s currently lower relative to traditional safe havens like gold and major stock indices such as the S&P 500. Typically, Bitcoin’s volatility dwarfs that of conventional assets. Its price can surge or plummet by double-digit percentages in a single day, a characteristic that has historically attracted speculative traders seeking outsized gains. However, the current environment paints a different picture. This sustained period of lower volatility suggests a potential equilibrium between buying and selling pressure, or perhaps a market waiting for a significant catalyst. Comparing Bitcoin Volatility: How Does it Stack Up? McGlone’s comparison to gold and the S&P 500 is key. Gold is traditionally seen as a store of value with relatively low volatility, while the S&P 500 represents a broad market index with moderate volatility influenced by economic cycles and corporate earnings. Bitcoin, positioned as a nascent digital store of value and a high-growth tech-like asset, usually sits at the high end of the volatility spectrum. When Bitcoin’s volatility compresses to levels approaching or even dipping below these traditional assets, it signals a potential shift. This could imply several things: Increased Maturation: As the market capitalization grows and institutional participation increases, Bitcoin could naturally become less volatile, similar to how other asset classes mature. Market Indecision: Investors might be holding back, unsure of the next major trend, leading to tighter trading ranges. Building Pressure: Periods of low volatility often precede periods of high volatility. The market might be coiling up before a significant price move. Here’s a simplified look at how volatility typically compares (note: specific percentages fluctuate constantly): Asset Typical Volatility (Relative) Current McGlone Observation Bitcoin High Historically Low, nearing/below Gold & S&P 500 Gold Low Higher relative to current Bitcoin volatility S&P 500 Moderate Higher relative to current Bitcoin volatility This unusual dynamic is what catches McGlone’s attention and prompts his warning. The Risky Turning Point: What Does McGlone Warn About? While low volatility can sometimes be interpreted as a sign of stability or maturity, McGlone suggests it could signal a potential Bitcoin risk . His core concern seems to be that while this maturation might reduce the probability of the kind of explosive, ‘100x’ gains seen in earlier cycles, the current low volatility environment, paradoxically, could heighten systemic risks. Why is low volatility potentially risky now, especially amid what McGlone describes as ‘bullish sentiment’? He posits that a combination of factors creates this heightened risk: Complacency: Prolonged low volatility can lead market participants to become complacent, potentially taking on excessive leverage or underestimating the possibility of a sharp move. Market Structure: The increasing financialization of Bitcoin, with derivatives markets and institutional products, means that a sudden shift could trigger cascading effects (e.g., liquidations). Politicization: McGlone highlights Bitcoin’s increasing politicization. Regulatory uncertainty, geopolitical events, and government stances on crypto can introduce sudden, unpredictable risks that low volatility might be masking. A negative political or regulatory shock could trigger a sharp sell-off in a market that has become accustomed to quiet trading. Underlying Bullish Sentiment: If bullish sentiment persists without a corresponding upward price movement, it can create pent-up energy. When a catalyst finally arrives (positive or negative), the ensuing move can be more violent than expected because positions have built up during the quiet phase. Therefore, according to McGlone, the current low volatility isn’t necessarily a sign that Bitcoin has become a boring, stable asset. Instead, it could be a precarious state where underlying pressures are building, and the market is particularly vulnerable to external shocks or a sudden shift in sentiment, potentially leading to a significant move with elevated systemic risk for the broader crypto market . Navigating Potential Bitcoin Price Action: Actionable Insights So, what does this mean for investors and traders? McGlone’s analysis suggests caution, even if the prevailing sentiment is bullish. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Risk Exposure: Given the potential for increased volatility and systemic risk, assess your current position size and leverage. Are you comfortable with the potential downside if the market moves sharply against you? Prepare for a Breakout: Low volatility periods often precede significant price movements. Have a plan for both potential upside and downside scenarios. What will you do if Bitcoin surges? What will you do if it plummets? Watch Macro and Regulatory News: Pay close attention to macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and most importantly, regulatory developments globally. As McGlone notes, Bitcoin’s politicization means external factors can have a swift and significant impact. Consider Hedging Strategies: If you hold significant Bitcoin, explore hedging options to protect against potential downside risk during this uncertain period. Focus on Long-Term Conviction: For long-term investors, periods of uncertainty and potential volatility can present opportunities to accumulate positions if your conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value remains strong. However, timing entries carefully during volatile swings is crucial. The key takeaway is not necessarily that a crash is imminent, but that the current market state is potentially more fragile than the quiet volatility might suggest. The combination of low volatility, bullish sentiment, and increasing external influences creates a complex environment. Conclusion: The Quiet Before the Storm? Mike McGlone’s warning serves as a crucial reminder that even in periods of relative calm, risks persist in the dynamic crypto market . Bitcoin’s unusually low volatility compared to traditional assets like gold and the S&P 500 could be a signal of maturation, but McGlone cautions that it might also be the market building pressure before a significant move. The increasing politicization of Bitcoin adds another layer of complexity, potentially amplifying systemic risks during a shift. While the potential for large gains remains a draw for many, understanding the potential downsides and preparing for increased volatility is paramount for navigating what could be a critical turning point for Bitcoin price action.

2025-06-12T22:00:48,"Liquidity Levels Show XRP Price Is Headed Up, But Must Cross $2.40 First","The XRP price appears to be approaching higher valuations as liquidity levels point to increasing buying pressure. According to a crypto market expert, this trend could set the stage for a potentially powerful rally. However, the altcoin must first break through the key resistance level at $2.40 to confirm a sustained move upwards. XRP Price Faces $2.4 Barrier Before Next Leg Up XRP is currently displaying early signs of strong bullish momentum that could propel it to fresh highs. However, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), known as ‘CryptoInsightsuk,’ warns that a confirmed breakout in the XRP price will require a decisive move above the critical $2.4 resistance. One of the analyst’s price charts highlights that XRP is now testing a long-term descending trendline , which has consistently rejected previous upward attempts. CryptoInsightsuk notes that the token, which was trading around $2.28 at the time of the analysis, is struggling to hold above the $2.4 resistance level. The goal is to flip this crucial price point into support, as failure to do so could stall bullish momentum. Moving forward, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) , located in the first price chart, is positioned near the neutral 51 mark, indicating a balanced momentum with possible room for further upside. While normal RSI remains evenhanded, its Stochastic RSI , situated at the bottom of the chart, has entered overbought territory. The Stochastic RSI is currently above 80, which often signals a short-term cooldown or consolidation before another leg up . Despite the recent bounce, where XRP jumped from around $2.05 in January to approximately $2.8, the altcoin’s volume has remained relatively modest. Notably, CryptoInsightsuk identifies $2.4 as the first real hurdle. A daily close above this threshold would signal the early stages of a potential trend reversal . However, the more substantial resistance remains at $2.6. Only a break above this level would fully confirm the bullish trend and potentially open the door to more aggressive upside targets . Until then, the pressure remains on bulls to sustain the altcoin’s momentum at this pivotal stage and push its price toward new breakout levels. Liquidity Levels Signal Caution As Price Tests Resistance CryptoInsightsuk’s second XRP price chart reinforces his bullish outlook, offering a detailed look at the cryptocurrency’s liquidity levels and volume concentration. The analyst emphasized the importance of liquidity levels currently forming around the altcoin . These levels represent areas of strong market interest and typically serve as both resistance and potential magnets for price action. Notably, CryptoInsightsuk points out that liquidity can sometimes be left behind as price moves. Still, when it’s as dense and pronounced as it is now, it becomes a key factor in market behavior and future price movements. Despite XRP’s bullish structure , the analyst remains cautious, as strong liquidity nearby suggests that the area could become a trap if the price fails to break above it.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-is-headed-up/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Altcoin|CryptoInsightsuk|Descending Trendline|Liquidity Levels|relative strength index|RSI|Stochastic RSI|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T21:50:36,"Bitcoin Price Plunge: What the BTC Drop Below $107,000 Means","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plunge: What the BTC Drop Below $107,000 Means The cryptocurrency market felt a familiar jolt recently as the Bitcoin Price experienced a notable decline, pushing the digital asset below the widely watched $107,000 level. This movement has naturally captured the attention of traders, investors, and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about the market’s direction and the factors influencing this shift. According to monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC has fallen below $107,000 . Specifically, the report highlighted BTC trading at $106,973.42 on the Binance USDT market at the time of observation. While this specific price point might seem minor in the grand scheme of Bitcoin’s volatile history, breaching a significant psychological or technical level like $107,000 often triggers increased market scrutiny and can influence short-term trading sentiment. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Experience a Drop? Understanding the reasons behind a Bitcoin Price movement is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Price drops are rarely attributable to a single factor. Instead, they often result from a confluence of technical indicators, market sentiment, and broader economic or regulatory news. Here are some potential contributing factors: Market Sentiment and Profit-Taking: After periods of upward movement or consolidation, traders may decide to take profits, leading to selling pressure. Negative sentiment, perhaps triggered by unfavorable news or rumors, can also cascade quickly in the interconnected crypto market. Technical Resistance: Price levels can act as technical resistance points. If Bitcoin struggles to break above a certain level, it can lead to a pullback as traders lose confidence in the immediate upward trajectory. The $107,000 level could have represented such a point after a prior move. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic news, such as inflation data, interest rate changes by central banks, or geopolitical events, can influence investor risk appetite. When traditional markets face uncertainty, investors might reduce exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors regarding cryptocurrency regulation in major economies can significantly impact prices. Stricter regulations are often perceived negatively by the market. Whale Activity: Large transactions by major holders (‘whales’) can move the market. Significant sell orders can quickly drive the price down, especially during periods of lower liquidity. Analyzing these factors requires staying informed and understanding how different pieces of information can interact to influence price action. What Does This BTC Price Drop Mean for Investors? A BTC Price Drop below a key level presents both challenges and potential opportunities, depending on an investor’s perspective, strategy, and time horizon. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Price drops often increase market volatility, making short-term trading riskier. Emotional Trading: Declines can trigger fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), leading investors to make impulsive decisions like selling at a loss. Uncertainty: It can be difficult to determine if the drop is a temporary correction or the start of a more significant downturn. Potential Opportunities: Buying Opportunity: For long-term investors bullish on Bitcoin’s future, a price dip can be seen as an opportunity to accumulate more BTC at a lower price point. This aligns with strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). Testing Support Levels: Traders can watch how the price reacts to potential support levels below $107,000. A strong bounce from a support level could indicate renewed buying interest. Re-evaluating Strategy: A price drop serves as a good reminder to review one’s investment thesis, risk tolerance, and portfolio allocation. Navigating a price drop requires discipline and a clear strategy, avoiding decisions driven purely by emotion. Navigating the Current Crypto Market News In times of market volatility, staying informed with reliable Crypto Market News is paramount. The digital asset space is dynamic, with constant updates ranging from technological developments and project milestones to regulatory shifts and macroeconomic indicators. However, it’s equally important to filter out the noise and potential misinformation. Here are some actionable insights for consuming crypto news effectively: Verify Sources: Always cross-reference information from multiple reputable news outlets. Be wary of sensational headlines or information shared only on social media without credible backing. Understand the Context: News often has a specific context. A regulatory proposal might sound negative initially but could have nuances or a long implementation timeline. Understand the potential impact in the broader market context. Distinguish News from Opinion: Be clear about whether you are reading a factual report or an analyst’s opinion or prediction. Both can be valuable, but they serve different purposes. Be Mindful of Sentiment: News can heavily influence market sentiment. While tracking sentiment is useful, don’t let it dictate your entire strategy. Base decisions on fundamental research and your own risk assessment. Being a well-informed participant in the crypto market involves more than just knowing the latest price; it requires understanding the underlying drivers and potential future trends. Performing Bitcoin Analysis in Volatile Times When the market is experiencing a BTC Price Drop or significant volatility, performing thorough Bitcoin Analysis becomes even more critical. Analysis can be broadly categorized into fundamental and technical approaches. Fundamental Analysis: This involves looking at the underlying value and factors that could influence Bitcoin’s long-term price. This includes examining network hash rate, transaction volume, adoption rates, regulatory landscape, and macroeconomic environment. While a short-term drop below $107,000 might be a blip, fundamental analysis helps assess if the long-term outlook remains strong. Technical Analysis: This involves studying price charts and using indicators to predict future price movements based on historical data and patterns. Traders might look at support and resistance levels (like the $107,000 level itself, and potential levels below it), moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and volume trends. A drop below a key level is a technical signal that prompts analysts to look for the next potential support zone. Combining both fundamental and technical analysis can provide a more holistic view. For example, strong fundamentals might suggest that a technical price dip is a temporary correction rather than a long-term reversal. Getting a BTC Update : Where to Find Reliable Information? Getting a timely and accurate BTC Update is essential for making informed decisions. With the sheer volume of information available, knowing where to look is key. Reliable sources typically include: Reputable Crypto News Websites: Platforms like Bitcoin World, CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, and others with established track records for reporting facts. Exchanges and Data Aggregators: Platforms like Binance (where the specific price was noted), CoinMarketCap, and CoinGecko provide real-time price data, volume, and market cap information. Official Project Channels: While Bitcoin doesn’t have a central ‘project’, following developers and key contributors on platforms like Twitter or participating in community forums can provide insights into network developments. Regulatory Body Websites: For news on potential regulation, checking the official websites of financial regulators in relevant countries is crucial. Be cautious of sources that promise guaranteed returns or push specific assets without clear, unbiased analysis. Diligent research and critical thinking are your best tools. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the recent BTC Price Drop and market volatility, what steps can investors take? Stay Calm and Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions are often detrimental in volatile markets. Stick to your pre-defined strategy. Review Your Strategy: Revisit your investment goals, risk tolerance, and portfolio allocation. Does the price drop change anything about your long-term conviction in Bitcoin? Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you are a long-term investor, a dip can be an opportunity to buy smaller amounts at regular intervals, lowering your average purchase price over time. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For traders, using stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the price continues to fall. Diversify: While this article focuses on Bitcoin, remember that diversification across different asset classes (not just different cryptocurrencies) can help manage risk. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on headlines or social media tips. Conduct your own analysis and understand what you are investing in. Ultimately, navigating market dips is a test of patience and adherence to a well-thought-out plan. Conclusion The recent fall of the Bitcoin Price below the $107,000 mark serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. While specific price levels are often psychological milestones, the underlying factors driving such movements are what truly matter. This BTC Price Drop highlights the importance of staying informed through reliable Crypto Market News , conducting thorough Bitcoin Analysis , and getting a timely BTC Update from trustworthy sources. For investors, it’s a period that demands careful consideration, adherence to strategy, and a focus on long-term goals rather than short-term price swings. Whether viewed as a challenge or an opportunity, understanding the market dynamics is key to navigating the exciting yet unpredictable world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-12T21:40:36,"Systemic Risk: FSB Chair Issues Dire Warning on Crypto’s Growing Threat","BitcoinWorld Systemic Risk: FSB Chair Issues Dire Warning on Crypto’s Growing Threat Are the lines between the world of crypto and traditional finance blurring faster than we think? According to a significant warning from a top global financial regulator, the answer is a resounding ‘yes,’ and it could spell trouble for the entire system. The increasing interconnectedness between the crypto market risk and the broader financial system is now approaching a critical threshold, according to the Chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). What Did the Financial Stability Board Chair Say? Klaas Knot, who heads the Financial Stability Board (an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system), recently delivered a stark message during a speech in Madrid on June 12. His core concern? The growing links between the seemingly separate worlds of digital assets and conventional banking and markets. He highlighted that these connections are becoming so significant that they could soon pose a systemic risk – a risk that could potentially destabilize the entire financial system, not just the crypto sector. Knot pointed to two key areas driving this increased interconnectedness: Retail Access via ETFs: Products like spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) make it easier for everyday investors to gain exposure to crypto assets through traditional brokerage accounts. While this seems like a benefit for accessibility, it deepens the link between mainstream finance and the volatile crypto market. Stablecoins and Traditional Assets: The reserves held by major stablecoins increasingly include significant amounts of traditional financial assets, particularly U.S. Treasury bills. This creates a direct link where stress in the stablecoin market could potentially transmit shocks into traditional short-term funding markets. This isn’t just theoretical hand-wringing. As Cointelegraph reported, Knot’s warning underscores a shift in the regulatory perspective, moving from viewing crypto as a niche concern to a potential source of broader financial instability. Understanding Systemic Risk in the Context of Crypto The term ‘ systemic risk ‘ might sound technical, but it’s crucial for understanding the FSB’s concern. Systemic risk refers to the risk of collapse of an entire financial system or market, as opposed to the risk of collapse of a single entity, group, or component within the system. Think of it like a domino effect: if one large, interconnected piece falls, it can knock down many others, leading to a widespread crisis. Historically, systemic risk has been associated with traditional finance – the collapse of large banks, the subprime mortgage crisis, etc. Now, regulators like the FSB are worried that crypto is becoming large and connected enough to potentially trigger or amplify such events. Why is this happening? The initial vision of crypto often involved being separate from traditional finance. However, to gain wider adoption, crypto has built bridges: Exchanges connect fiat currency to crypto. Institutions are investing in crypto or offering crypto services. Stablecoins aim to bridge the gap between crypto and fiat value. ETFs and similar products package crypto for traditional investors. Each of these bridges, while facilitating growth and adoption, also creates pathways for risk to travel between the two systems. A severe downturn in the crypto market risk could lead to forced selling of traditional assets held by crypto entities (like stablecoin reserves), potentially impacting traditional market liquidity and prices. Conversely, stress in traditional markets could force institutions to pull back from crypto, causing cascading effects. The Growing Stablecoin Risk Knot’s specific mention of stablecoins holding U.S. Treasuries highlights a particularly sensitive point. Stablecoin risk isn’t just about whether a stablecoin maintains its peg; it’s also about the composition and management of its reserves. Major stablecoins hold tens of billions of dollars in assets, a significant portion of which are often short-term government securities (like T-bills) and commercial paper. Here’s why this creates a link and potential risk: Large Holders: Stablecoin issuers have become significant players in certain short-term funding markets. Potential for Rapid Selling: If a stablecoin faced a large number of redemption requests (people cashing out their stablecoins for fiat), the issuer might be forced to sell off its reserve assets quickly. Market Impact: Large, rapid sales of assets like T-bills could potentially disrupt the functioning of those critical short-term markets, which are vital for the plumbing of the traditional financial system. Contagion: Disruptions in these markets could then affect banks, money market funds, and other traditional financial institutions. While many stablecoin issuers have improved the quality and transparency of their reserves following past incidents (like the Terra/LUNA collapse), the sheer scale of the assets held means this remains a key area of focus for regulators concerned about systemic risk . How Does Increased Retail Access Via ETFs Contribute? The approval and popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., represent a significant step in mainstreaming crypto. While this is often seen as a positive development for investors seeking easier access, from a regulator’s perspective focused on financial stability , it increases the number of participants directly exposed to crypto volatility through traditional channels. Consider this scenario: Millions of retail investors hold Bitcoin ETFs in their standard brokerage accounts. A sudden, sharp downturn occurs in the crypto market. Investors panic and sell their ETF shares. The ETF issuer must sell underlying Bitcoin to meet redemptions, potentially exacerbating the crypto price drop. Simultaneously, widespread losses on crypto holdings could impact retail investor confidence and spending, potentially having minor macroeconomic effects, or leading to margin calls and issues within brokerage firms themselves if not properly managed. While current ETF volumes might not pose an immediate, massive systemic risk , the concern is about the trend and future scale. As more crypto assets get packaged into traditional products and more people gain easy access, the potential for crypto market shocks to have broader societal and financial impacts increases. The Role of Crypto Regulation This is where crypto regulation comes into play. The FSB’s warning isn’t necessarily a call to ban crypto, but rather a clear signal that regulatory frameworks need to be developed and implemented to manage the risks associated with its integration into traditional finance. The goal of crypto regulation from this perspective is to build safeguards that prevent crypto market volatility from spilling over and causing wider economic damage. Key areas for potential regulation include: Stablecoins: Rules on reserve composition, custody, transparency, and redemption policies. Crypto Platforms & Exchanges: Requirements around consumer protection, market integrity, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) checks. Intermediaries: Regulations for banks, brokers, and other financial institutions that offer crypto-related services or hold crypto assets. Data Reporting: Requiring crypto firms to provide data on their activities and holdings to regulators to monitor interconnectedness and risk build-up. The challenge for regulators is immense. Crypto operates globally, often across different jurisdictions with varying rules. Developing coordinated and effective crypto regulation that fosters innovation while managing systemic risk and protecting consumers is a complex task. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? For participants in the crypto market , warnings like the one from the FSB Chair are a reminder that increased mainstream adoption comes with increased scrutiny and the potential for more stringent rules. While some in the crypto community view regulation negatively, others see it as a necessary step for long-term sustainability and broader institutional acceptance. Key takeaways for market participants: Expect More Regulation: The trend towards increased crypto regulation is likely to continue globally as regulators focus on financial stability . Stablecoin Scrutiny: Stablecoins will remain a key focus area, particularly regarding their reserves and operations. Interconnectedness Matters: Understand that the crypto market is no longer operating in a vacuum; it’s increasingly linked to the traditional financial system. Risk Awareness: Be aware of potential contagion risks and how events in traditional finance or specific crypto sub-sectors (like stablecoins) could impact the broader market. While the FSB’s warning highlights potential downsides, it also implicitly acknowledges the growing significance of the crypto sector. The fact that regulators are focusing on its potential to create systemic risk means it’s no longer considered a fringe phenomenon but a component that needs to be integrated safely into the global financial architecture. Conclusion: Navigating the Blurring Lines FSB Chair Klaas Knot’s warning serves as a crucial reminder that as crypto becomes more accessible and integrated into traditional finance through avenues like ETFs and stablecoin reserves, the potential for systemic risk increases. This growing interconnectedness means that problems in the crypto world could potentially impact traditional markets and vice-versa, posing a challenge to overall financial stability . Regulators like the Financial Stability Board are closely monitoring these developments, and the call for effective crypto regulation is becoming louder. While managing crypto market risk and particularly stablecoin risk is complex, developing robust frameworks is seen as essential to harness the potential benefits of digital assets while mitigating the dangers of a financial crisis triggered by or amplified by the crypto sector. The future of finance will likely involve navigating these increasingly blurred lines carefully, with a strong emphasis on risk management and regulatory clarity.

SEC approves NASDAQ Index that includes ADA Cardano pic.twitter.com/p7Rj5RVGQd — Cardano Feed ($ADA) (@CardanoFeed) June 11, 2025 ETF Holdings Await SEC Signoff Even though the index itself now includes all 9 assets, the US-listed Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF still holds only Bitcoin and Ethereum. That won’t change until the SEC signs off on updates to the ETF’s rulebook. Based on the current timeline, that approval is expected in early 2026. Until then, US investors can track the wider index on paper, but their ETF shares will stick with the original two coins.

It means added liquidity, better price support, and a clearer path into institutional portfolios. More cash in and out of ADA markets could narrow trading spreads and smooth out big swings. Trading platforms, custody services, and exchanges will feel the impact too. They’ll need to meet the index’s criteria—steady volume, regulated venues, and institutional-grade storage. Those checkpoints help keep major players comfortable when they decide to buy or sell ADA at scale. Overall, bringing ADA into this benchmark shows that big finance is watching Cardano more closely than before. Yet the final step—actual ETF inclusion in the US—still lies with regulators.

2025-06-12T21:13:45,"Crypto Cracks Late in Day, Bitcoin Slumps Below $106K","Cryptocurrencies were broadly lower on Thursday, with the selloff picking up steam in the early U.S. evening hours. Bitcoin BTC slipped more than 2.5% over the past 24 hours to $105,900, but the declines were far steeper in altcoins, with ether ETH, solana SOL, XRP XRP and dogecoin DOGE among those tokens sporting 5%-7% drops. Risk assets in general got off to a poor start Thursday as President Trump threatened renewed tariff measures as the early July deadline for trade deals begins to get near. In addition, with nuclear negotiations with Iran not going well, there were boosted fears of Israeli strikes against Iranian nuclear sites. “Look, there’s a chance of massive conflict,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday. “We have a lot of American people in this area, and I said, we’ve got to tell them to get out, because something could happen soon, and I don’t want to be the one that didn’t give any warning and missiles are flying.” “I don’t want to say imminent, but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen,” Trump said about Israel potentially striking Iran. He stated that he had advised against an attack while negotiations were ongoing. While U.S. stocks were able to shake off the headlines and close with modest gains, cryptos weren't so lucky. Green shoots? The rally in risk assets — crypto included — over the past several weeks has taken place amid a U.S. Federal Reserve seemingly determined not to ease monetary policy for the foreseeable future. And yet, there continue to be signs that weak economic data may soon force the Fed's hand — a far slowed pace of employment gains and weaker inflation numbers among them. Two more data points arrived Thursday in May's Producer Price Index, which came in softer than forecast on both the headline and core levels, and initial jobless claims, which unexpectedly matched last week's multi-month high of 248,000. Continuing jobless claims rose to 1.956 million, the third consecutive gain and the highest level since November 2021. President Trump continued his crusade to goad Fed Chair Jerome Powell into a more dovish posture, calling him a ""numbskull"" for not cutting rates . ""I may have to force something,"" threatened Trump. Powell's term as Fed boss doesn't end until 2026 and the president had previously said firing him prior to that was not an option.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/12/crypto-cracks-late-in-day-bitcoin-slumps-below-106k,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL","Markets|Bitcoin|Market Wrap|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T20:49:56,"Coinbase to Launch Bitcoin Rewards Card With Amex, While Eyeing U.S. Futures Expansion","Crypto exchange Coinbase is planning to launch a credit card that offers bitcoin BTC cashback, the company said on Thursday. The Coinbase One Card, issued in partnership with American Express, includes perks such as earning 4% in BTC after purchases, boosted rewards on USDC stablecoin holdings and higher staking rewards and transaction credits on Base, the Ethereum layer-2 network developed by the exchange, according to the card's website . The card's rollout is expected this fall. The move comes as more crypto platforms and exchanges are rolling out payment cards to enable users to spend their blockchain-based token stash on everyday purchases. For example, self-custodial wallet MetaMask introduced its debit card last year, while Mastercard unveiled plans in April to launch debit cards with crypto exchanges OKX and Kraken . It's also not the first crypto endeavour for Amex, either: the company issued a credit card offering crypto rewards with Abra in 2022. Coinbase's announcement coincided with the company's State of Crypto Summit event in New York, where the exchange also hinted at expanding perpetual futures trading to the U.S., according to media reports . Perps trading has been limited to non-U.S. users at Coinbase Advance. However, the exchange said earlier this year in a blog post that it was working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) towards making ""perpetual-style futures contracts"" accessible to U.S. users.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/12/coinbase-to-launch-bitcoin-rewards-card-with-amex-while-eyeing-us-futures-expansion,"BTC|COMMODITY|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING","Finance|Coinbase|American Express|credit cards|perpetual contracts|News",cryptocompare

On Thursday, Coinbase announced a series of new products geared towards enhancing mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. On the top list, Coinbase unveiled its Coinbase One Card in collaboration with American Express. The Coinbase One Card will offer up to 4 percent Bitcoin back on each purchase. The cryptocurrency exchange announced the launch of perpetual futures in the United States, with the feature expected to be expanded to global markets soon. The exchange also introduced its Coinbase Business and announced the waitlist is open to entrepreneurs seeking to venture into the crypto space. Coinbase also announced a strategic partnership with Shopify to enable USDC checkouts on Base through Shopify Payments and Shop Pay. Will Coinbase Overthrow Peers? As Coinpedia has reported in the past, Coinbase has suffered significant criticism for its poor customer service, especially during challenging times such as account takeovers and scams. As a result, Coinbase has continued to record significantly low quarterly trades volume compared to Binance and Bybit . The launch of the new products will play a crucial role in rebuilding its broken trust with the customers. Moreover, Coinbase is heavily regulated in the United States and has huge backing from institutional investors seeking to venture into the crypto market. However, Coinbase will have to use more unique tactics to attract more customers amid heightened competition from its competitors. Rising competition from other crypto exchanges, such as Upbit and Kraken , also presents more headwinds for Coinbase in the near future. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency industry will continue to boom in the near future, fueled by institutional investors and clear crypto regulations, thus ensuring a long term growth prospects for Coinbase.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/coinbase-unveils-new-products-are-they-the-awaited-triggers-to-attract-more-crypto-traders/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T20:35:50,"Dow, Nasdaq up 0.24%, S&P gains 0.38% on rate cut expectation","U.S. stocks gained on Thursday as investors weighed soft inflation data and growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, with strong tech earnings helping offset trade uncertainty and sector-specific losses. The S&P 500 rose 0.38% to close at 6,045.26, led by a rally in large-cap tech stocks. The benchmark index now sits less than 2% below its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.24%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 101.85 points, or 0.24%, to 42,967.62. Oracle was the day’s standout performer, surging 13% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results and projecting over 70% growth in cloud infrastructure revenue next year, fueled by rising AI demand. The strong report lifted the broader tech sector and helped drive market gains. The rally came despite a 4.8% drop in Boeing shares, which weighed on the Dow after one of its 787 Dreamliners crashed in India. Still, investor sentiment held up amid easing Treasury yields and softer economic data that pointed to potential Fed policy easing.

The May producer price index rose just 0.1%, below expectations, while jobless claims showed signs of labor market softening. The data, combined with strong demand at a Treasury auction, sent yields lower, with the 10-year note dipping below 4.4%. Trade tensions remained in focus as President Trump reiterated plans to send tariff warning letters to dozens of countries, though he signaled progress with China and other key partners.

2025-06-12T20:30:00,"Ethereum Consolidates At The Highs Of Its May Range - ETH Forecast (Technical Analysis)","Summary The current picture on the daily is mostly bullish, with prices breaking above their daily MA 200 and its May consolidation range. A break-retest scenario would hint at a continuation as towards the next resistance zone between 3,000 to 3,050 as long as prices don't re-enter the May Range. Price action looks a bit more mixed looking in the 1H timeframe - prices might be forming what resembles like a head and shoulders which would be confirmed with a bigger correction in other crypto assets. By Elior Manier The cryptocurrency picture is confusing to understand in the past week, with most altcoins rallying but the path is not a one way up. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is unchanged and most altcoins are down in today's session. ETH ( ETH-USD ), for example, broke above its 2,739 May highs, establishing local highs at 2,879 on Wednesday before retracting. Prices are down 2.80% on the session, but the descent looks more like a retracement than a full correction of the preceding up-moves. Ethereum's recently launched ETF's like ETHA ( ETHA ) or FETH ( FETH ) have had some steady inflows, not showing many signs of weakness there.Let's take a look at different timeframes, going from the Daily to the hourly to spot potential trends and hurdles. Table of Daily ETH ETF inflows, June 12 – Source: Glassnode Ethereum Technical Analysis ETH Daily Timeframe ETH Daily Chart, June 12, 2025 – Source: TradingView The current picture on the daily is mostly bullish, with prices breaking above their Daily MA 200 and its May consolidation range.The RSI is still overbought; therefore that may slow down the prices again, any continuation of the up move would be dependent on market sentiment. ETH 4H Timeframe ETH 4H Chart, June 12, 2025 – Source: TradingView Ethereum has consolidated above what was the preceding immediate resistance at 2,739 and is now considered the main pivot to future movements.The RSI went from overbought to slightly above neutral on the 4H timeframe accompanied by the 4H MA 20 - Candles are not showing any type of decision with a few three consecutive dojis. A break-retest scenario would hint at a continuation as towards the next resistance zone between 3,000 to 3,050 as long as prices don't re-enter the May Range.If they do, there is support at the 50 MA around 2,630 and after, the Main support zone 1 from 2,385 to 2,425. ETH 1H Timeframe ETH 1H Chart, June 12, 2025 – Source: TradingView Price action looks a bit more mixed looking in the 1H timeframe - prices might be forming what resembles like a head and shoulders which would be confirmed with a bigger correction in other crypto assets. The H&S materializing would be pointing towards the 4H MA 50 level at 2,638. In the meantime, prices are consolidating in the pivot zone mentioned higher and would need to break above the 1H MA 50 to keep pushing higher.The immediate resistance point is the last highs at 2,879. Watch for any change in the global market tone as stocks went close to their highs again, which may drag up sentiment and cryptocurrencies with it. Safe trades!
