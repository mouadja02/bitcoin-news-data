2025-06-13T12:53:59,"”Bitcoin Eyes $110K, but I Choose This Hot Meme Token for 10,000% Gains” - ChatGPT","With Bitcoin pushing toward $110,000, the market is heating up and confidence is rising. BTC remains the dominant force, backed by institutional inflows, ETF momentum, and strong technicals. But while Bitcoin offers steady growth, the real upside in this cycle may lie elsewhere. That’s when we turned to ChatGPT for insight. “Bitcoin is strong and could hit $110K soon, but if I were chasing 10,000% gains, I’d go with XYZVerse. It’s a high-upside meme token with early momentum, real utility, and presale entry points that Bitcoin can’t match.” Let's take a closer look at why ChatGPT is backing XYZVerse over BTC when it comes to raw return potential—and what that could mean for investors chasing the next big breakout. Bitcoin Long-Term Price Prediction for 2025–2030 2025 Estimated Range: $85,000 – $110,000 Bitcoin pushes higher post-halving but fails to trigger the explosive rally some expected. ETF flows help support price, but macro uncertainty and limited retail interest keep gains controlled. Price tests $110K but struggles to hold above it for long. 2026 Estimated Range: $80,000 – $100,000 Bitcoin experiences a cooling phase after the 2025 high. Market sentiment weakens, and capital rotates into altcoins and other sectors. BTC remains relatively stable but drifts slightly downward as enthusiasm fades. 2027 Estimated Range: $90,000 – $105,000 A mild recovery emerges, supported by stronger institutional infrastructure and steady global demand. Bitcoin slowly climbs back toward six figures but remains in consolidation mode with low volatility. 2028 Estimated Range: $100,000 – $120,000 The next halving renews interest, and supply shock begins to tighten availability again. Price gradually increases, but there is no parabolic move. Investors remain cautious, keeping Bitcoin's growth slow and steady. 2029 Estimated Range: $110,000 – $130,000 Bitcoin maintains a modest upward trend. Adoption by corporations and cross-border finance use cases improve sentiment. Regulatory clarity in major markets supports broader participation, but price action stays moderate. 2030 Estimated Range: $125,000 – $150,000 Bitcoin matures into a globally recognized digital asset, acting more like a reserve commodity than a growth play. Gains are slow but consistent. The market treats BTC as a long-term hedge rather than a speculative tool. XYZVerse vs. Bitcoin: Where the Real Upside Lies Bitcoin may be eyeing $110K, but at this stage in its cycle, BTC is increasingly seen as a stability play—not a growth asset. While its potential gains between 2025 and 2030 could be in the 1.5x–2x range, meme coins like XYZVerse offer far more dramatic upside, especially for early investors entering during the presale phase. Unlike Bitcoin, which already commands a trillion-dollar market cap, XYZVerse is starting from a low base with massive growth potential. At a presale price of just $0.003333, and with an internal target of $0.10, the project is aiming for a 30x return—and that’s just the conservative estimate. If post-launch demand mirrors what we’ve seen with tokens like PEPE, WIF, or BONK, XYZVerse could surge even higher. Realistically, early listings combined with sports-driven marketing could push XYZ to $0.15–$0.25 in the first few weeks, delivering 45x–75x returns for early buyers. Over a 6–12 month window, with major exchange listings and strong ecosystem expansion, a longer-term target of $0.40 isn’t out of the question—marking a potential 100x move from current levels. Bitcoin may be the safer bet, but XYZVerse is built for aggressive growth. With deflationary tokenomics, influencer-driven momentum, and gamified utility in the sports betting niche, it appeals directly to the meme coin crowd chasing the next viral breakout. For those looking at crypto through the lens of high-risk, high-reward investing, XYZVerse isn’t just an alternative to BTC—it’s an opportunity that Bitcoin can no longer offer. Bottom Line Bitcoin remains a cornerstone of the crypto market, offering long-term stability, institutional backing, and slow, steady growth. But for investors hunting exponential returns, it’s no longer the main event. XYZVerse , with its low market entry, sports-integrated utility, and viral meme appeal, represents the kind of high-upside opportunity that defined early Bitcoin cycles—only compressed into a much shorter time frame. If Bitcoin is where capital goes to stay safe, XYZVerse is where capital goes to multiply. For those willing to take on risk in exchange for the chance at 30x, 50x, or even 100x gains, XYZVerse may be the breakout story of this bull run—and the kind of move BTC simply can't match anymore. Frequently Asked Questions What is the current price of XYZVerse, and how high could it go? XYZVerse is currently priced at $0.003333 in presale. The project’s initial target is $0.10 (around 30x), but based on market trends and token hype, it could potentially reach $0.25–$0.40 in the first year—translating to 75x–100x gains. Is XYZVerse just another meme coin, or does it offer real utility? XYZVerse stands out by combining meme coin culture with real-world sports utility. It’s integrated with sportsbook platforms and includes gamified, play-to-earn features. The project also uses deflationary tokenomics and community incentives to support long-term value. How does Bitcoin’s projected growth compare? Bitcoin is expected to gradually rise from current levels to $125K–$150K by 2030, based on macro trends, adoption, and ETF flows. This reflects a conservative 1.5x to 2x return over several years—solid, but far more limited than the early-stage opportunity XYZVerse presents. Can XYZVerse really deliver 10,000% gains? While nothing is guaranteed, meme coins with strong branding, viral marketing, and smart tokenomics have reached similar or greater multiples before. If XYZVerse secures major listings and sustains demand, a 100x gain (10,000%) from presale levels is within the realm of possibility. How can I buy XYZVerse? XYZVerse is available through its official presale site. You can purchase using crypto (USDT, ETH, BNB, etc.) or via Visa/Mastercard. After the presale, it is expected to list on centralized and decentralized exchanges. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-13T12:50:44,"Japan Bitcoin: Strategic Move as Remixpoint Boosts Bitcoin Investment","BitcoinWorld Japan Bitcoin: Strategic Move as Remixpoint Boosts Bitcoin Investment In a significant move within the Asian cryptocurrency market, Japanese energy consulting firm Remixpoint has once again expanded its digital asset reserves. The company announced on June 12th its acquisition of an additional 55.68 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at 887.3 million yen, approximately $6.2 million at the time of purchase. This latest transaction underscores a growing trend among corporations to integrate digital assets into their balance sheets and highlights the increasing relevance of Remixpoint Bitcoin holdings within their overall corporate strategy. This recent purchase isn’t a first for Remixpoint. The company has been steadily accumulating Bitcoin, and this acquisition brings their total reported holdings to around 981.39 BTC. For a company primarily known for energy consulting, this substantial digital asset portfolio is noteworthy and positions them as a significant player in the Japan Bitcoin landscape. Why are Companies Making a Bold Bitcoin Investment ? The decision by a company like Remixpoint to make a substantial Bitcoin Investment might seem unconventional at first glance, especially for one rooted in traditional sectors like energy consulting. However, a deeper look reveals several strategic motivations driving corporate Bitcoin adoption: Inflation Hedge: With global economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, companies are seeking assets that can potentially preserve or grow value over time. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ is seen by some as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation due to its capped supply. Store of Value: Beyond inflation, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, immutable store of value that is not tied to any single government or financial institution. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury provides diversification away from traditional assets like cash and bonds, potentially reducing portfolio risk. Potential Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, attracting investors looking for capital appreciation. Alignment with Business (especially for Remixpoint): As we’ll explore, Remixpoint operates a cryptocurrency exchange, making a Bitcoin Investment strategically aligned with their core business interests in the digital asset space. These factors collectively contribute to the increasing trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, viewing it as a strategic asset for the future. Diving Deeper into the Remixpoint Bitcoin Strategy Remixpoint’s business operations are more diverse than just energy consulting. Crucially, the company is the parent entity of BITPoint Japan, a licensed cryptocurrency exchange. This subsidiary provides essential context for understanding the company’s approach to accumulating Remixpoint Bitcoin. Operating a crypto exchange means Remixpoint is inherently involved in the digital asset ecosystem. Holding a significant amount of Bitcoin can serve multiple purposes related to their exchange business: Liquidity: While not explicitly stated, holding reserves can potentially aid in managing liquidity for exchange operations, although this is typically handled differently. Balance Sheet Strength: A valuable asset like Bitcoin on the balance sheet can strengthen the company’s financial position. Investor Confidence: For investors interested in their crypto subsidiary, a strong Remixpoint Bitcoin holding signals confidence in the asset class they facilitate trading for. Treasury Management: It acts as a form of corporate treasury management, allocating capital to a non-traditional, potentially high-growth asset. The accumulation of nearly 1000 BTC demonstrates a long-term commitment to digital assets as part of Remixpoint’s corporate treasury strategy, closely tied to their operations in the cryptocurrency sector via BITPoint Japan. What Does This Signal for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption ? Remixpoint’s latest purchase is another data point in the ongoing narrative of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . While companies like MicroStrategy have become synonymous with large-scale corporate Bitcoin holdings, moves by other listed companies, especially outside the traditional finance sector (though Remixpoint has a foot in crypto via BITPoint), are significant indicators. This acquisition by a Japanese listed company suggests that the trend of integrating Bitcoin into corporate balance sheets is gaining traction globally, extending beyond the early adopters in North America. It signals to other institutions, both in Japan and internationally, that holding Bitcoin is becoming a more accepted and potentially strategic financial decision. The continuous flow of news regarding companies increasing their Bitcoin reserves reinforces the idea that digital assets are maturing and being considered seriously by corporate treasurers and investment committees as a legitimate asset class for long-term holding, contributing to the broader trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . The Broader Landscape of Japan Bitcoin Japan has a unique relationship with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It was one of the first countries to establish a clear regulatory framework for exchanges, recognizing Bitcoin as a legal property. This environment has fostered a relatively mature crypto market with several licensed exchanges, including Remixpoint’s BITPoint Japan. The news of Remixpoint’s purchase fits into the broader context of the Japan Bitcoin market, which is characterized by: Clear Regulation: Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) oversees cryptocurrency exchanges, providing a level of legitimacy and security for investors. Active Retail Market: Japan has a strong base of retail crypto traders. Growing Institutional Interest: While perhaps not as vocal as in the US, institutional players in Japan, including banks and investment firms, have been exploring crypto-related services and investments. Corporate Involvement: Remixpoint’s move highlights that corporate treasury allocation into Bitcoin is occurring within Japan, adding another dimension to the Japan Bitcoin story. Remixpoint’s significant holding positions them as one of the notable listed companies in Japan with substantial direct exposure to Bitcoin, potentially influencing how other Japanese corporations view the asset class. Key Takeaways from This Important Cryptocurrency News Japan This latest piece of Cryptocurrency News Japan offers several key insights for anyone following the digital asset space or corporate investment trends: Continued Corporate Confidence: Remixpoint’s repeated purchases demonstrate ongoing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, despite market volatility. Strategic Alignment: For companies with existing ties to the crypto industry (like Remixpoint with BITPoint), holding Bitcoin can be a logical strategic move that aligns their balance sheet with their operations. Japan’s Role: The purchase reinforces Japan’s position as a significant market for cryptocurrency activities, with domestic companies actively participating. Sign of Maturation: Each instance of a listed company adding Bitcoin to its treasury contributes to the overall narrative of Bitcoin maturing as an asset class suitable for corporate holdings. While the exact reasons and future plans for Remixpoint’s Bitcoin holdings are best understood by the company itself, their actions provide valuable signals about the evolving relationship between traditional businesses and digital assets in major economies like Japan. Investors and market observers should continue to monitor such corporate moves as they can influence market sentiment and potentially pave the way for further institutional involvement, shaping the future of Cryptocurrency News Japan and globally. Conclusion: Remixpoint’s recent acquisition of an additional 55.68 BTC is more than just a transaction; it’s a strategic statement. It highlights the increasing comfort level of listed companies, particularly those with existing ties to the digital asset ecosystem, in allocating significant capital to Bitcoin. As Institutional Bitcoin Adoption continues to unfold globally, driven by various economic and strategic factors, moves like Remixpoint’s in the Japan Bitcoin market serve as compelling examples of this trend in action. It underscores Bitcoin’s growing role not just as a speculative asset, but as a potential long-term treasury reserve for forward-thinking corporations.

Stablecoins can help retailers avoid high transaction fees, achieve real-time supply chain visibility, accelerate international e-commerce settlements, and provide faster, more affordable payment options for customers. What challenges might Walmart and Amazon face with crypto integration? Challenges include managing crypto price volatility for product pricing, ensuring blockchain scalability for vast operations, and addressing cybersecurity risks to protect digital transactions. How is President Trump’s stance influencing stablecoin adoption by corporations?

2025-06-13T12:47:23,"Is the crypto bull run still possible after Israel bombed Iran?","Crypto prices crashed Thursday evening as investors embraced a risk-off sentiment following Israel’s attack on Iran’s nuclear sites, which could trigger a wider conflict in the region. Bitcoin ( BTC ) plunged below $105,000, while the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap fell to $3.26 trillion. The 24-hour liquidations jumped by 252% to over $1.15 billion, with 247,950 traders being liquidated. Most altcoins performed worse than Bitcoin. SPX6900 (SPX) token plunged by 20%, while Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), Celestia ( TIA ), and Bonk ( BONK ) fell by over 15%. The stock market also declined, with futures tied to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 falling by over 1%. Is the crypto bull run still possible? Israel’s attack on Iran’s nuclear sites will have some impact on the crypto market. In addition to triggering fear among investors, a prolonged war could push crude oil prices higher over time. Brent and West Texas Intermediate benchmarks rose by over 10% on Friday. Higher crude oil prices could make inflation stickier and push the Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates higher for longer, affecting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. However, a look at past “black swan” events shows that Bitcoin and other altcoins tend to recover after the initial knee-jerk reaction. For example, Bitcoin plunged to a multi-month low of $74,488 in April after Donald Trump delivered his “ Liberation Day ” speech, in which he announced retaliatory tariffs. Bitcoin then surged to a record high of $111,928 two months later. Similarly, Bitcoin dropped from $10,480 to $3,948 in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic began. It then surged a few months later and peaked at $68,897 in November 2021. Bitcoin and other altcoins fell to $34,000 when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, then bounced back to nearly $48,000 a month later. Therefore, there is a likelihood that Bitcoin and other altcoins will bounce back as the current fear subsides.

Fundamentally, demand is rising as ETF inflows grow, with BlackRock’s IBIT now holding over $72 billion in assets. Companies like Trump Media, GameStop, Strategy, and MetaPlanet are accumulating the coin. This demand is soaring as supply on exchanges and over-the-counter venues has plunged. Santiment data shows that supply on centralized exchanges has dropped to 1.2 million, down from 1.5 million in January. Bitcoin supply on exchanges and funding rate | Source: Santiment As the chart above shows, Bitcoin’s funding rate has also surged — a sign that market participants expect it to bounce back. Further, as crypto.news wrote here , this pullback is part of Bitcoin’s handle in the cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern often results in a strong bullish breakout, with Bitcoin’s target projected above $140,000.

2025-06-13T12:45:34,"French legislators present bill to curb kidnaps targeting crypto millionaires","A new bill meant to improve the personal security of French crypto entrepreneurs, targeted in a string of recent kidnapping attacks, has been drafted and filed in Paris. The legislative initiative coincides with ongoing arrests of suspects in multiple cases that are still under investigation, while authorities are working hard to end the wave of violence that shook France and its crypto space this year. French officials scramble to deal with daring kidnappings The series of kidnapping attempts on crypto figures and their close ones over the past few months, including a Ledger co-founder and his partner, has spurred the French society to elaborate measures to ensure their lives and security are sufficiently protected in the face of the still-present threat. Reacting to the criminal phenomenon, officials are now taking concrete steps to strengthen the confidentiality of the personal details of these executives and their families, while trying to maintain balance between security and transparency, the French crypto news outlet Journal du Coin noted. One of the proposals pitched in the public space in response to calls from corporate circles has been gaining support among politicians in Paris. The idea is to remove the addresses of owners and managers of crypto firms from official trade registers. According to the French financial daily Les Echos, the kidnappers may have used the files to identify the places of residence of their victims. On June 11, French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin announced a new decree to swiftly implement the demanded change. Translated post of French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin urging the removal of the addresses of owners and managers of crypto firms from official trade registers. Source: Gérald Darmanin (X/Twitter) New law to preserve the privacy of crypto businessmen Also on Thursday, French lawmaker Paul Midy from the center-right Renaissance party submitted a bill designed to protect the privacy of business leaders by deleting their personal addresses from the publicly available company records. Unlike previous proposals in the same direction, which envisaged removal of the sensitive information upon request and on a voluntary basis, this piece of legislation suggests automating the process, La Tribune explained in an article . Following consultations with industry members, Midy wants to restrict access to the data that is currently freely accessible on online platforms aggregating information from official registers, the business weekly detailed. The provisions concern all business officials in general, but especially those whose personal residence also serves as their corporate address, as is often the case with startups and their owners, particularly those active in the crypto market. The law will oblige the operators of official databases, like Inpi, Infogreffe, and Insee, to share with private platforms, such as Société.com, Pappers, and SociétéInfo, only documents in which personal addresses have been redacted. French authorities are yet to explain the sudden spike in crypto kidnappings, including that of David Balland, co-founder of the crypto wallet firm Ledger, and the attempted abduction of the daughter and grandson of crypto exchange Paymium’s CEO. Eric Larchevêque, business partner of Balland, who had a finger cut off while in captivity, took to X to urge the government to “stop the Mexicanisation of France,” criticizing what he described as the “laxity” of French law enforcement. Halte à la mexicanisation de la France. Depuis plusieurs mois, les affaires sordides d’enlèvements et de tentatives d’enlèvement se multiplient. En plein jour. En plein Paris. Sous les yeux de tous.

This week, France 24 reported that the French police have detained more people over last month’s kidnapping for ransom of a crypto entrepreneur’s father. Prompted by the spate of brazen attacks, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau summoned crypto bosses in mid-May to discuss their security, emphasizing on the need for taking joint measures to protect them and their families. He also vowed to “find the perpetrators wherever they may be.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

You might also like: Analysts say XYZVerse beats Shiba Inu for new investors Bitcoin continues to climb Source: TradingView Bitcoin ( BTC ) has shown steady growth over the past six months. Its price has increased by 5.89% in that period. In the last month, Bitcoin rose by 4.48%, and over the past week, it gained 2.47%. Currently, Bitcoin trades between $101,837 and $108,318. Technical indicators suggest Bitcoin might rise further. The Relative Strength Index is at 28.41, which means the coin is oversold. The Stochastic oscillator is at 8.47, also indicating oversold conditions. When assets are oversold, they often rebound. The MACD level is negative at -459.49, but may reverse if momentum improves. Bitcoin’s nearest resistance level is at $110,851. If it breaks this level, it could reach the second resistance at $117,332. That would be gains of about 6% and 13% from current prices. On the downside, support levels are at $97,889 and $91,408. These levels could limit losses to around 4% and 10%. The price is close to the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, suggesting potential for upward movement.

2025-06-13T12:30:53,"Institutional Appetite Grows as Bitcoin ETFs Rebound with $1.07B in 4 Days","Bitcoin’s institutional narrative looks to be back on track, with spot BTC ETFs attracting more than $1 billion in fresh capital against a backdrop of significant market upheavals triggered by Middle East tensions. On-chain data shows a four-day inflow streak into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, decisively reversing a brief period of outflows and signaling strong institutional appetite. Over $1B in Four Days According to the market intelligence platform Santiment, between June 9 and June 11, the BTC-backed financial instruments raked in north of $970 million . Data from the crypto investment research website SoSoValue corroborated this, revealing that spot Bitcoin ETFs flipped from notable outflows late last week to four straight days of positive inflows. The reversal started on Monday this week, when the ETFs absorbed $386.27 million, followed by a much heftier $431.12 million on Tuesday. This coincided with the news that BlackRock’s IBIT had shattered records by becoming the fastest exchange-traded fund to reach $70 billion in assets under management (AUM), having done it in just 341 days. Flows stayed positive on Wednesday, with an additional $164.57 million entering the regulated BTC investment products. Thursday’s more modest $86.31 million brought the four-day total inflow to $1.07 billion. The surge effectively erased the $278.44 million and $47.82 million in outflows recorded on June 5 and June 6, respectively, pushing cumulative net inflows for all spot Bitcoin ETFs to $45.31 billion and total net assets to $130.26 billion as of June 12. Bitcoin Stumbles Amid Middle East Flare-Up Interestingly, the bullish flows arrived during a sharp market shakeup. On June 13, details emerged, confirming Israel’s missile strike on Iranian nuclear sites, triggering fears of wider conflict in the Middle East. The immediate fallout wiped out more than $190 billion in total crypto market capitalization. Bitcoin alone tumbled from an intraday high of $108,369 to a low of $103,081 within hours. It has since clawed back slightly to about $103,971, but was still down 3.6% over 24 hours at the time of this writing. Despite the turmoil, BTC remains 1% higher than a week ago, edging out a global crypto market that dipped 0.6% over the same period. Still, there are signs the king cryptocurrency’s crown may soon face a challenge. Spot Ethereum ETFs have now posted 19 straight days of net inflows, even overtaking Bitcoin for the first time with a record $240 million in daily net additions on June 11. According to some market watchers, this flip may hint at a subtle shift in investor preference as traders diversify into Ethereum following growing regulatory optimism regarding decentralized finance (DeFi) and clarity around ETH’s classification.

2025-06-13T12:30:34,"First Solana Layer-2 Close to $50M as Company Plans $5B $SOL Investment","In a move that’s shaking the market, publicly traded DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV) announced a staggering $5B equity line of credit with RK Capital. The firm has made its intentions clear. The entire $5B line will be used to acquire Solana ($SOL) , dramatically increasing its already substantial holdings. According to CEO Joseph Onorati, the strategy offers flexibility, allowing the company to raise capital gradually and only when it aligns with their core goal of increasing the $SOL per share . This isn’t DFDV’s first major play either; the company has already gathered over 609K $SOL and has deeply integrated itself into the ecosystem by acquiring a validator business. On the surface, it’s a maximalist bet on the future of the Solana network. And one crypto presale that’s ready to leverage Solana’s bullish run is Solaxy ($SOLX, the first-ever Solana Layer-2 that aims to improve the blockchain’s known congestion issues. Genius Move or a House of Cards? Beneath the bullish Solana headlines, DFDV’s move invokes a bit of skepticism. Some could see this act of issuing company stock to fund the purchase of a volatile crypto asset as another block in an unstable house of cards built by pro-crypto firms. The strategy creates a loop: DFDV’s stock price becomes increasingly tied to $SOL’s performance. Simultaneously, the company tries to boost $SOL’s price through massive purchases funded by its own equity. This comes as the broader market flashes red, with $SOL itself down over 9% in the past 24 hours . The contrast between DFDV’s aggressive accumulation and the current market fear highlights a growing disconnect. As institutional players build intricate, high-risk structures around major assets like $SOL, many retail investors are seeking clearer, more direct paths to potential growth. The institutional focus on the base $SOL asset has savvy investors looking deeper into the ecosystem for the next innovation. This could spotlight presale projects like Solaxy ($SOLX) , a new Solana Layer 2 already close to $50M. The token has been gaining massive traction thanks to its intention to upscale Solana to modern demands. As is often the case, market interest can lead to hype, so will $SOLX (one of 2025’s best crypto presales ) benefit from the substantial $SOL investment from institutional asset managers? Let’s discuss that. The Fix for Solana’s Biggest Flaws So, what’s the path to potential growth for retail investors? The answer— Solaxy ($SOLX) , the first-ever Solana Layer-2 blockchain, whose presale is already moving at incredible speed. More than just another token , Solaxy is a foundational upgrade designed to neutralize Solana’s biggest pain points: network congestion, failed transactions, and slow speed. The real utility to a very serious industry problem potentially makes Solaxy one of the best altcoins to buy right now. By bridging the gap between Ethereum’s massive liquidity and Solana’s efficiency, $SOLX creates a multi-chain powerhouse perfect for the high-speed demands of DeFi and meme coin trading. The Race to $50M: Your Ground-Floor Entry Solaxy ($SOLX) has received an overwhelming response (one whale bought $$73K $SOL in December 2024), raising over $48M from early backers who see much potential in the project. The momentum signals strong market confidence in the project’s vision and its first-mover advantage as Solana’s premier Layer-2 solution. If $SOLX sounds like your cup of tea, the opportunity is still available, but time is running out. The current presale price for $SOLX is $0.001756, but the presale ends in just over 3 days, so let us help you through the buying stage . Looking ahead, we’ve predicted a positive outlook for $SOLX. With top Ethereum Layer-2s commanding impressive market caps, $SOLX could see a similar trajectory. We forecast an end-of-year high of $0.032 for 2025, representing a 1,722.32% increase on the current price. With staking rewards of 84%, you could be set to benefit further. Remember, this isn’t financial advice, and just because Solana is set to receive a large investment, it doesn’t mean other coins will actually benefit.

According to our Litecoin price prediction, the LTC price might hit the $500 mark in 2028. However, this rally depends on the future buying interest in the altcoin market. Does LTC have a good long-term future? Despite the recent adjustments and potential peak formation, Litecoin exhibits a robust long-term price trajectory and outlook, indicating a high potential for future growth. If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might reach $1000 in no time.

It’s now asking the public to share thoughts on whether the ETF can help stop fraud and manipulation. Litecoin price prediction June 2025 Litecoin’s price shows signs of bullish moves as it has been surging toward $100. However, as BTC’s price aims for a hold above the $110K mark in June, Litecoin’s price intends to end this month on a bullish note.

2025-06-13T12:27:28,"Friday the 13th Meme Coin Massacre: SPX and FARTCOIN Plunge by Double Digits","TL;DR Meme coins suffered a significant decline today (June 13), with their total market capitalization dropping by 8% in hours. DOGE and SHIB are among the affected ones, heading south by 6-7% each, but SPX and FARTCOIN lead the adverse trend. Memes Bleed Out The cryptocurrency sector and the meme coin niche recorded a substantial resurgence earlier this week. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the market cap of all the memes reached almost $65 billion on June 11 , but currently , it is hovering around $55 billion. The downtrend was most likely triggered by the latest geopolitical tension caused by the military conflict between Israel and Iran. Some of the worst-affected meme coins include SPX6900 (SPX) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). The former is down 22% on a daily scale, while the latter retraced by 17% within that timeframe. SPX Price, Source: CoinGecko Interestingly, those assets were among the best performers during the recent rally. As CryptoPotato reported , SPX became the fifth-biggest meme coin, with its market cap surging well above $1 billion. Other tokens of that type that have posted double-digit losses on a 24-hour basis are Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF), Floki (FLOKI), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and many more. On the other hand, lesser-known meme coins such as REKT, AURA, and TST have charted some gains. How Are the Big Shots Doing? Dogecoin (DOGE) – the undisputed leader in the meme coin sector – has also nosedived, albeit posting less substantial losses than the aforementioned tokens . It currently trades at around $0.17, representing a 7% decline for the past 24 hours. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – DOGE’s biggest contender – briefly dipped to as low as $0.0000114, the lowest point since April. As of this writing, the self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer is worth roughly $0.00001170, or a 6% decrease on a daily scale. Meme coins are notorious for their heightened volatility and typically decline more significantly and rapidly than well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) during periods of uncertainty and market turmoil. Having that said, investors should tread carefully with them, conduct proper research before committing funds, and invest only as much as they are ready to lose.

2025-06-13T12:15:52,"Bitcoin Price Today Crashes, When Will Crypto Prices Recover?","The post Bitcoin Price Today Crashes, When Will Crypto Prices Recover? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the past 72 hours, the Bitcoin price bullish momentum witnessed a short-term halt, due to an increase in bearish pressure involving worsening geopolitical conditions. As a result, Bitcoin price suffered a loss of 7%, as it fell short of bullish strength to surpass the benchmark $112,000 ATH. Moreover, the leveraged long positions were unwound, which further amplified downside momentum for top crypto and altcoins. Similarly, recent on-chain metrics highlight that derivative exchanges saw significant withdrawals of stablecoins. Where these withdrawals are coupled with a notable divergence between BTC price and Binance’s Open Interest. These converging signals strongly indicate a cautious outlook for Bitcoin in the immediate short term. BTC Jumped From Cliff – Down 7%: What Exactly Happened? The global uncertainty has increased recently, which has affected the financial sector, including cryptocurrencies. This happened as Donald Trump plans to put unilateral tariffs in the next two weeks. Alongside the pessimism surrounding Trump’s tariffs, the Israel-Iran Conflict also escalated further, which has triggered aggressive selling. The sudden spike in sell volume closely aligns with Israel’s unexpected military strike on Iran early Friday (June 13), which sent shockwaves through global markets. Crypto is regarded as a high-risk asset and faces immediate liquidation pressure. Where traders dumped BTC in anticipation of broader market turmoil. What DOes This Divergence Between Bitcoin Price and Binance Open Interest Means For Investors? Recent insights from CryptoQuant reveal a notable divergence between Bitcoin’s price and Binance’s Open Interest (OI). As the Bitcoin price neared its all-time high of $110,000- which was last seen in late May, the OI failed to match the peak levels. This is clearly indicating a weakening interest in futures trading despite strong long-term BTC price momentum.

This significant movement mirrors a similar withdrawal on May 29, 2025, also around $750 million. Such synchronized outflows often indicate capital rotation or changes in trader behavior. When these occur near market highs, they may signal hedging or de-risking actions.

BTC/USD 1.D. COINBASE | Source: TradingView Therefore, amid the geopolitical chaos, the absence of confirmation from Binance OI, along with repeated large stablecoin outflows, increases the likelihood of a short-term pullback. If the $101,000 support area is breached, BTC price could drop to the support zone around $96,000. The short-term situation urges market participants to “DYOR” and should avoid “FOMO” based future decisions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin’s price is down today primarily due to escalating geopolitical tensions from Israel’s military operation against Iran, alongside global uncertainty stemming from potential new tariffs proposed by Donald Trump. How might upcoming U.S. interest rate decisions influence crypto prices?

Conversely, rate cuts can boost crypto appeal. How low can Bitcoin go this month? Bitcoin is currently trading around $104,000.

2025-06-13T12:15:36,"PI coin dips by 35% in minutes: What’s going on with the network?","PI coin’s price nosedived on Friday, falling by over 35% within minutes. The decline coincided with news of Israel’s military strike on Iranian targets, sending the altcoin markets into a bloodbath. Data from CoinMarketCap showed that PI dropped from $0.62 to as low as $0.40 during the early hours of trading. Although the token briefly recovered to $0.55 later in the session, it still remains far below its 30-day high of $1.27, a 53% loss from the level. The token’s 24-hour volume jumped 276%, which could mean holders offloaded their positions in fear of further declines. At press time, PI was down approximately 12% from the previous day and 21% over the past week. Pi Coin price volatility after token unlock announcement The price volatility came just weeks after the crypto community started speculating about Pi Network Core Team’s announcement scheduled for early May. The teaser started a bullish spell for the token, causing a price spike from $0.60 to nearly $1.70 within a few days. However, even before the announcement was made public, prices began to tumble. Once the team revealed its plan to invest in Pi Network-native projects , the price corrected to just over $0.60. According to data from PiScan, over 340 million PI tokens are scheduled for release over the next month, with the largest unlocks expected on June 18, June 26, July 5, and July 7. The releases will increase supply, and will more than likely push the price down further. Investors, who have been waiting years for token liquidity, may choose to cash out once their assets become available. The result could be a significant increase in sell-side activity, further straining prices that the altcoin market slump has already weakened. Moreover, market analyst Moon Jeff noted that altcoins had begun to rally in early June. In a post dated June 10, he remarked : “ALTs have started pumping again. Every time an altseason starts, something always happens. I wonder what will happen this time round.” His comments foreshadowed the end to that short-lived rally, which was interrupted by Friday’s tragic news in Iran. Bitcoin led the crypto sell-off, plunging by $5,000 during the Asian trading session. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also fell over 9% in a matter of hours, dropping from $2,760 to as low as $2,470. It has since climbed back above $2,500, a level that analysts identify as its psychological support zone. Alongside Pi, the correction hit other altcoins like Solana, which was down 12%, retreating to $140. Dogecoin posted a 10% decline, sliding to $0.17, while Cardano tumbled 9.5%, falling to $0.62. Currently, PI coin is showing no clear bullish or bearish trend. The market appears to be in a holding pattern, with minimal momentum on either side. Analysts warn that until buyers step in with conviction, or a new announcement shifts sentiment, the price may remain trapped in its current range. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-13T12:15:17,"This Nasdaq-Listed Firm Is Building $500 Million Crypto Treasury With Ripple’s XRP","As companies and governments consider adding Bitcoin to their treasuries, Singapore-based Trident Digital is taking a different route — committing a whopping $500 million to establish what it asserts will be one of the world’s first corporate treasuries centered around Ripple-promoted XRP token. Trident Eyes $500 Million Raise To Buy XRP Nasdaq-traded Trident has announced that it is raising up to $500 million for its XRP treasury strategy. The tokens purchased by Trident will serve as the company’s long-term strategic reserves. “This initiative reflects our belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology for capital allocation and cross-border value transfer,” Soon Huat Lim, founder and CEO of Trident, said in a statement. “Through this initiative, Trident aims to demonstrate how public companies can thoughtfully and responsibly participate in the ongoing development of decentralized finance.” Trident intends to use its XRP reserves to generate yield via staking and have a “deep engagement” with Ripple’s ecosystem instead of a mere buy-and-hold strategy. The company will launch the treasury in the second half of 2025, dependent on regulation clarity and market sentiment. U.S.-based Chaince Securities will act as a strategic advisor on the XRP treasury play. Trident plans to raise capital for the initiative through equity sales, private placements, and other structured financing instruments. CEO Soon described the effort as a novel bet on the role of cryptocurrencies in corporate capital management. “We see digital assets as key enablers in the evolution of the global financial landscape,” he opined, asserting that the initiative reflects Trident’s “commitment to transparency, strong governance, and strategic foresight.” The Bitcoin corporate treasury reserve has become quite popular in the cryptoverse. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) pioneered the trend back in 2020, and publicly listed companies like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific have since emulated the firm’s BTC-buying master plan.

2025-06-13T12:10:50,"Altcoin Season Index Confirms Crucial Bitcoin Season Shift","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Confirms Crucial Bitcoin Season Shift The latest reading from a key industry metric indicates a significant shift in the crypto market landscape. The Altcoin Season Index, a widely watched indicator, recently registered a value that confirms we are currently experiencing a period known as Bitcoin Season . This news carries important implications for investors and participants across the entire crypto market , particularly concerning the performance of altcoins . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index To grasp the significance of the current market phase, it is essential to understand the Altcoin Season Index itself. This metric, tracked by major cryptocurrency data platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), serves as a barometer for the relative performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin. The index is designed to provide a clear picture of whether the broader altcoin market is outperforming or underperforming the leading cryptocurrency. It achieves this by analyzing the performance of a specific group of cryptocurrencies over a defined period. What it tracks: The index specifically looks at the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. What it excludes: Importantly, it excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC), focusing purely on native altcoins and Bitcoin. The comparison: It compares the performance of each of these top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin’s performance. The timeframe: The comparison is typically made over the past 90 days. The resulting index score, which ranges from 1 to 100, provides a single number that summarizes the overall state of the market’s preference for altcoins versus Bitcoin. Decoding the Seasons: Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season The value of the Altcoin Season Index directly corresponds to one of two primary market phases: Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season . These phases are defined by specific thresholds based on the index score. Altcoin Season: Definition: According to the index methodology, Altcoin Season is declared when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Index Score: This typically corresponds to a high index score, often above 75. Characteristics: During Altcoin Season, we typically see significant rallies across a wide range of altcoins. Capital flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to a decrease in Bitcoin’s dominance percentage relative to the total crypto market capitalization. Enthusiasm is high, and many smaller cap tokens can experience exponential growth. Bitcoin Season: Definition: Conversely, Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Index Score: This corresponds to a low index score, typically 25 or below. Characteristics: In Bitcoin Season , Bitcoin tends to dominate the market. It may be consolidating, experiencing a strong upward trend, or showing relative strength during downturns while altcoins struggle. Bitcoin dominance usually rises, and capital is often seen flowing into BTC as a perceived safer asset within the crypto space, or simply leading the overall market movement. Many altcoins may lose value against Bitcoin, even if they are stable or slightly increasing in fiat terms. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Altcoin Season Index ≤ 25 ≥ 75 Top 100 Altcoins Outperforming BTC (90 days) ≤ 25% ≥ 75% Bitcoin Dominance Generally Rising Generally Falling Altcoin Performance vs. BTC Underperforming Outperforming (Broadly) Market Sentiment Often Cautious on Altcoins High Enthusiasm for Altcoins The Current State: Altcoin Season Index at 25 Confirms Bitcoin Season As reported, the Altcoin Season Index stood at 25 at 00:31 UTC on June 13. This figure represents a drop from previous readings and, crucially, falls precisely on the threshold that defines Bitcoin Season according to the index methodology. A score of 25 means that over the past 90 days, only about a quarter (or fewer) of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin. This data point reinforces the observation many market participants have made: while Bitcoin might be consolidating or making moves, a large portion of the altcoin market is currently lagging behind in terms of relative performance against BTC. This doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins are losing value in fiat terms, but it signifies that an investment in Bitcoin over the last three months would, on average, have yielded better results than an investment spread across a basket of top altcoins. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: Implications for Altcoins Being in Bitcoin Season has distinct implications for holders of altcoins and those looking to enter the crypto market . Challenges for Altcoin Holders: Relative Underperformance: The primary challenge is that altcoins, on average, are not keeping pace with Bitcoin. This can lead to frustration for investors holding altcoins while watching Bitcoin potentially make gains or hold its value better during volatility. Increased Risk: During Bitcoin Season, capital often flows into Bitcoin. This can leave altcoins more susceptible to price drops, especially if overall market sentiment turns negative. Smaller cap altcoins can experience significant losses. Lack of Broad Rallies: Unlike Altcoin Season where many different altcoins pump simultaneously, Bitcoin Season is characterized by more isolated altcoin pumps based on specific news, developments, or narratives, rather than a broad market wave. Potential Opportunities in Bitcoin Season: Selective Accumulation: While the broad market underperforms, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate high-conviction altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Identifying fundamentally strong projects that are temporarily suppressed by market dynamics can be a strategy. Focus on Bitcoin: Some investors choose to rotate capital into Bitcoin during this phase, leveraging its relative strength and dominance. Learning and Research: Bitcoin Season provides a quieter period, away from the frenzy of altcoin pumps, allowing investors to conduct thorough research on projects, understand underlying technology, and plan strategies for the next market cycle. Broader Crypto Market Dynamics in Bitcoin Season The shift into Bitcoin Season reflects and influences broader dynamics within the crypto market . Bitcoin’s dominance is a key factor here. When Bitcoin’s price is strong or consolidating while altcoins lag, its percentage of the total crypto market capitalization tends to increase. This rising dominance reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is the primary focus for capital flows. Market sentiment can also shift. During periods of uncertainty or consolidation, investors often seek the relative safety or liquidity of Bitcoin. This gravitational pull towards BTC can further dampen enthusiasm for higher-risk altcoins. Furthermore, major macroeconomic factors and regulatory news often impact Bitcoin first and most significantly, with altcoins reacting with greater volatility afterwards. In Bitcoin Season, the market narrative is often centered around Bitcoin’s price movements, institutional adoption of BTC, or Bitcoin-specific developments like halving events or ETF flows. Strategies for Navigating Bitcoin Season Given the current state indicated by the Altcoin Season Index , what steps can investors take? Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Risk Management: This is crucial in any market phase, but particularly when altcoins are broadly underperforming. Consider reducing exposure to highly speculative altcoins or setting tighter stop-losses. Increase Bitcoin Exposure: If you believe Bitcoin’s dominance will continue or that BTC is poised for a significant move, increasing your allocation to Bitcoin can be a prudent strategy during this period. Selective Altcoin Accumulation: Instead of broadly buying altcoins, focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, active development, and potentially upcoming catalysts. Look for altcoins that might show relative strength or are trading at attractive valuations against BTC. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue or start a DCA strategy into Bitcoin and/or a select few high-conviction altcoins. This removes the emotion of trying to time the bottom and allows you to accumulate assets over time. Stay Informed: Pay close attention to Bitcoin’s price action, dominance charts, and overall crypto market sentiment. Also, monitor the Altcoin Season Index for potential shifts. Looking Ahead: When Might Altcoin Season Return? Bitcoin Season is not permanent. Market cycles are a natural part of the cryptocurrency landscape. A return to Altcoin Season would be signaled by the Altcoin Season Index climbing significantly, ideally above 75. What factors could trigger such a shift? Bitcoin Consolidation/Stagnation: Often, Altcoin Season kicks off after Bitcoin has had a major rally and then enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows capital that profited from the BTC run to flow into altcoins seeking higher returns. Increased Risk Appetite: A general increase in confidence and risk appetite across the broader financial markets can spill over into crypto, encouraging investment in higher-beta assets like altcoins. Major Altcoin Narratives: The emergence of strong, compelling narratives around specific sectors (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, AI) or major upgrades/events within prominent altcoin ecosystems can drive significant interest and investment into those areas, potentially sparking a broader altcoin rally. Falling Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained decrease in Bitcoin’s share of the total market cap is a visual indicator that altcoins are collectively gaining ground. Monitoring these potential catalysts, alongside the movement of the Altcoin Season Index , can help investors anticipate and prepare for the next phase of the market cycle. Limitations and Other Considerations While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it is not the only metric to consider. It provides a broad overview of the top 100 altcoins’ performance relative to Bitcoin, but it doesn’t capture the nuances of the entire market. Beyond the Top 100: Many promising projects exist outside the top 100 by market cap. Their performance isn’t directly factored into this specific index. Individual Project Fundamentals: Even during Bitcoin Season, individual altcoins with strong fundamentals, significant news, or successful product launches can perform well independently of the broader market trend. Macro Environment: The overall economic climate, interest rates, inflation, and global events significantly impact the entire crypto market , including both Bitcoin and altcoins. Regulatory Landscape: Changes in regulations can disproportionately affect certain types of altcoins or the market as a whole. Therefore, while the index signals the prevailing season, a comprehensive investment approach requires looking at a variety of indicators, understanding specific project details, and considering the broader market context. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index currently sitting at 25 serves as a clear indicator that the crypto market is navigating a period defined as Bitcoin Season . This means that, on average, altcoins have been underperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days. While this presents challenges for altcoin investors hoping for broad, rapid gains, it also offers opportunities for strategic accumulation and a focus on risk management. Understanding the characteristics of Bitcoin Season and keeping an eye on the factors that could signal a shift back towards Altcoin Season are crucial for navigating the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape effectively.

2025-06-13T12:09:07,"Bitcoin To Replace Gold As Store Of Value And Hit $1 Million, Predicts Mike Novogratz","Former Goldman Sachs partner and Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz remains one of the most prominent Bitcoin bulls in finance. Novogratz has now joined the $1 million per Bitcoin (BTC) bandwagon, suggesting that the OG cryptocurrency could 10X and break that milestone if it continues to grow in popularity and surpass gold. Novogratz Says Bitcoin Tops $1 Million If Adoption Trend Continues Appearing on CNBC’s Power Lunch on Thursday, Mike Novogratz said he foresees a seven-figure moonshot for the premier cryptocurrency. Novogratz’s main rationale for anticipating Bitcoin’s potential 1,000% growth is based on the crypto’s increasing institutional adoption as a macro asset. “Now we’ve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin, there’s easier ways to get it,” he quipped. “So the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in, I think that’s now a ball rolling down hill.” BlackRock is perhaps the most notable example of institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset. The $11 trillion asset manager’s spot BTC exchange-traded fund has amassed approximately 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply for its clients since going live in January 2024. The iShares Bitcoin Trust currently holds more than $70 billion in assets under management. Novogratz further suggested that the increasing adoption will ensure Bitcoin catches up with gold. According to the pundit, younger investors would buy Bitcoin over gold, with the supply-capped digital asset replacing the yellow metal over time: “If you look at gold’s market cap and Bitcoin’s market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go, 10x, and so that’s [$1 million] Bitcoin just to be where gold is.” Other Seven-Figure Bitcoin Calls Novogratz is not the first Bitcoin bull to predict that Bitcoin will appreciate significantly in value over the long term. In April, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest raised its bull-case Bitcoin price projection to $2.4 million by 2030, up from a previous projection of $1.5 million. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said last month that BTC could break $1 million by 2028, thanks to strong tailwinds including a likely outflow of foreign investment and devaluation of the huge stock of the US Treasury. Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has also, on multiple occasions, shared his thoughts on how high he thinks the price of Bitcoin could rocket to.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-to-replace-gold-as-store-of-value-and-hit-1-million-predicts-mike-novogratz/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|ZRX","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Gold|Mike Novogratz",cryptocompare

Polkadot Community Proposes Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Using Treasury Funds The plan currently being discussed on the Polkadot governance forum proposes allocating 501,000 DOT (Polkadot’s native token) to gradually purchase tBTC, a decentralized, Bitcoin-backed token. Under the proposal, the tBTC purchase will be carried out over a period of one year using Hydration’s Rolling Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) mechanism, providing a stable and risk-free entry into the Bitcoin position. Once purchased, tBTC will be deposited into the Hydration Omnipool as liquidity, leveraging the Threshold Network’s custody-free Bitcoin bridge to maintain full decentralization and asset security. Proponents of the proposal argue that the move would diversify the Treasury’s holdings, provide a hedge against market volatility, and promote cross-chain liquidity in the Polkadot ecosystem.

Table of Contents Softer CPI data fuels BTC recovery attempt Middle East risks redirect capital toward gold Predictive models suggest $160K–$170K range still in play Softer CPI data fuels BTC recovery attempt Bitcoin ( BTC ) climbed to $110,400 on Jun. 11 after fresh U.S. inflation data showed prices rising at a slower pace than expected . The report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may have more room to lower interest rates in the coming months, a potential tailwind for risk assets including BTC. As of Jun. 12, Bitcoin is trading near $107,000. That’s about 4.5% below its all-time high of $111,970 reached on May 22. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Investor sentiment has also shifted. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently sits at 71, placing the market in the “greed” category. Meanwhile, social media data from Santiment shows 2.12 positive Bitcoin mentions for every negative one, marking the highest ratio since November 2024. At the time, Bitcoin had crossed $70,000 shortly after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. 😍 With Bitcoin teasing its $112K all-time high the past couple days, retail has gotten bullish. There are more than double the amount of positive $BTC comments vs. negative across social media, the highest ratio since Trump was elected over 7 months ago. pic.twitter.com/kdb4ZtDwIq — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 11, 2025 Institutional flows have grown as well. Total assets in Bitcoin ETFs rose from $91 billion in April to $132 billion in June, a 45% increase in two months, pointing to sustained demand from large investors. With Bitcoin price activity, sentiment, and institutional positioning all showing upward movement, new models such as the Golden Curves and Sine Wave forecasts are gaining attention. Let’s understand the math behind the optimism, revisit historical cycle behaviors, and assess if buying Bitcoin now offers a favorable risk-reward setup. Middle East risks redirect capital toward gold Bitcoin’s recent pullback points to a combination of macroeconomic developments and geopolitical stressors that are introducing short-term uncertainty. U.S. inflation remains contained, with core consumer prices holding steady at 2.8%. That has led to increased expectations of interest rate cuts later this year. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, most traders are now pricing in two potential cuts starting in September. A lower interest rate environment typically reduces the appeal of the U.S. dollar and fixed-income assets, giving risk-on markets like crypto more space to perform. However, those expectations are being tested by current global events. In the Middle East, escalating tensions are starting to impact capital flows. The U.S. is relocating personnel from parts of the region amid security concerns, while Israel’s reported plans regarding Iran have attracted renewed international attention. Earlier today, the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that Iran has violated its nuclear obligations for the first time in two decades. As a result, investors have shifted some capital into traditional safe havens, with gold prices rising over 1.5% in the last 24 hours to $3,375 per ounce. Bitcoin has been affected by this repositioning. It is down 1.7% over the same 24-hour period, mirroring risk asset behavior in response to global uncertainty and short-term flight to safety. Meanwhile, the broader crypto derivatives market remains active. On Deribit, open interest in Bitcoin options has risen to $36.7 billion, the highest level so far this month. The June 27 expiry leads in volume, accounting for $13.8 billion in notional terms. A significant number of call options remain concentrated at the $140,000 strike price, although the overall put-to-call ratio has adjusted to 0.60, signaling a slightly softer bullish bias than previous sessions. In futures markets, total open interest across Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, and Hyperliquid has reached $55.4 billion, with Binance alone contributing $23.3 billion, pointing to sustained participation despite near-term volatility. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release May’s Producer Price Index data today. Expectations point to a month-over-month increase of 0.3% in core PPI, following a decline of 0.4% in April. Headline PPI is also forecast to rise 0.2% after last month’s drop of 0.5%. Year-on-year, both core and headline readings are projected to remain steady or move slightly higher. If confirmed, the rebound in monthly PPI figures could indicate fresh inflationary pressure at the wholesale level, challenging the broader market narrative of cooling inflation. That, in turn, may affect expectations around how soon and how much the Federal Reserve can ease rates. Predictive models suggest $160K–$170K range still in play Bitcoin’s short-term direction appears to be hinged on a complex interaction between macro triggers, technical structure, and behavioral signals from larger market participants. Technical analysts are paying close attention to the $106,000 to $107,000 range. According to trader KillaXBT, this is a key demand zone. He notes that BTC has “rejected local supply” and is attempting to stabilize within this range. $BTC | Analysis As of now, structure is still bullish. Bitcoin rejected local supply & is now pushing into demand around 106-107K. This is quite a important level in terms of market structure, if we are unable to hold, we likely fill the CME gap below. 114-116K is a HTF… pic.twitter.com/rtkdL07tYZ — Killa (@KillaXBT) June 12, 2025 His high time frame (HTF) target remains between $114,000 and $116,000 for the month, but he cautions that “if we lose 106K,” the Bitcoin price may fall to fill a CME futures gap, which would involve testing lower levels before any continuation of trend. The broader sense from his analysis points to a structured market that is still intact, provided Bitcoin does not breach $100,000 support. On the behavioral side, on-chain data from CryptoQuant highlights the role of large holders. During prior cycle tops, Binance whales — wallets with over 1,000 BTC — typically increased exchange inflows as prices approached new highs, signaling intent to take profits. A strong bullish signal from Binance whales! “Today, however, inflows are just around $3 billion and are continuing to decline, suggesting that these whales prefer to keep holding.” – By @Darkfost_Coc Full analysis ⤵️ https://t.co/T1FlLnM4nK pic.twitter.com/O3XrqhAyEc — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2025 In early 2024, inflows peaked around $5.3 billion and climbed to $8.45 billion and $7.24 billion during earlier rallies. Currently, inflows are down to around $3 billion and trending lower, indicating a preference to hold rather than distribute. The pattern signals that many large holders are not yet ready to exit and may be positioning for higher levels ahead. Sentiment models also point to possible future upside, though with varying levels of confidence. The Golden Diminishing Curves model, shared by CryptoCon, places the next cycle top between $160,000 and $170,000. By almost all measures, 160 – 170k is the next step up for Bitcoin. The cycle top on the golden diminishing curves is at +2, which has gone completely untouched. A ticking time bomb for an explosion to the upside pic.twitter.com/DHXnsMaD8H — CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) June 11, 2025 The model’s upper cycle band labeled as “+2” has not been reached yet, suggesting that the current cycle still has room to develop. CryptoCon described the setup as a “ticking time bomb,” but the data itself simply illustrates that past cycle tops followed a clear curve pattern that has not yet been completed in this run. PlanB, known for his stock-to-flow and RSI-based cycle studies, weighed in with a separate observation. If Bitcoin’s monthly Relative Strength Index retests 75, it would historically align with price levels around $130,000. Would be nice if BTC retests RSI 75 again this month. RSI 75 = ~$130k (June closing price). pic.twitter.com/AIjjQRxyDK — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) June 9, 2025 He adds that “RSI 75 = ~$130k (June closing price),” suggesting that if momentum continues, such a target is plausible based on prior RSI peaks during bull runs. Across these perspectives, one common thread is that the structure remains intact, and many indicators are pointing to the possibility of further upside. The $114K–$116K region appears to be a major short-term target. However, risk still remains. A break below $100K would weaken the bullish structure, and a failure to hold $106K could trigger lower retracements. The current phase, therefore, is less about euphoric breakout calls and more about managing expectations within clearly defined levels. As always, consult a financial planner before making any investment decisions, trade wisely, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

2025-06-13T12:07:05,"Cardano Founder Hoskinson Plans to Use Bitcoin and Stablecoins to Help Cardano Grow","The post Cardano Founder Hoskinson Plans to Use Bitcoin and Stablecoins to Help Cardano Grow appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Charles Hoskinson, the mind behind Cardano , is once again turning heads—this time with a bold new idea aimed at strengthening the ecosystem’s financial future. He shared a detailed update about a decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) for the Cardano ecosystem during a recent podcast. From Bitcoin investments to ADA buybacks, this plan could bring long-term value and stability to the community. But not everyone is on board just yet. Hoskinson Cardano SWF Work In his podcast on X, Hoskinson explained how the Cardano SWF would work. He said it’s inspired by how countries like Norway use their wealth to invest in various assets for future growth. The idea is to take around $100 million worth of ADA from the treasury and convert some of it into stablecoins and Bitcoin . Cardano Decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund https://t.co/8RIELNl872 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 13, 2025 This isn’t about abandoning ADA; in fact, it’s the opposite. The plan is to invest a portion of treasury funds into less volatile assets to earn yield, then use those earnings to repurchase ADA over time. This strategy, according to Hoskinson, would help grow ADA’s value and strengthen the entire Cardano ecosystem in a sustainable way. Bitcoin Investment – ADA Buybacks Strategy Hoskinson suggested that profits from the Bitcoin investment could be used to buy back ADA, which could increase demand and support its price. He believes that by reinvesting these profits every year over five to ten years, the community could create a self-sustaining financial model that strengthens Cardano’s future. This move isn’t just about making money; it’s about making Cardano stronger in the long run without risking too much of its core treasury. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. Senate to Decide Stablecoin Future with GENIUS Act on June 17 , Community Support and Skepticism While some members of the Cardano community welcomed the idea, others had different thoughts. One member, Chad Luce, suggested that a Private Equity Fund or Green Energy Fund might bring in more investors and better returns than the proposed SWF. Despite mixed reactions, Hoskinson made it clear that diversification is key and that long-term planning is essential for ADA to grow and thrive. ADA Treasury Plan for Stability Charles Hoskinson’s proposal shows that Cardano is focused on long-term growth, not short-term hype. By using part of the treasury wisely, building profits, and supporting ADA, the Sovereign Wealth Fund could become a smart way to protect and grow the Cardano network for years to come. As of now, Cardano ADA price is trading around $0.64, reflecting a drop of 5.4% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $10.9 billion. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-13T12:07:01,"Bitcoin Crashes Amid Middle East Tensions","Bitcoin dropped sharply to $103,162 as tensions in the Middle East escalated, with Israel launching attacks on Iranian nuclear and missile facilities, including targets in Tehran. Although the price has slightly recovered, it remains 2% lower compared to 24 hours ago . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the strikes, stating they aim to eliminate the Iranian threat to Israel. He also warned that such military actions will continue if necessary. This military response followed a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), revealing Iran’s failure to comply with uranium enrichment restrictions—a first in 20 years. The news sparked speculation about a potential strike, which U.S. President Donald Trump acknowledged could trigger a “massive conflict,” though he still hopes for a diplomatic resolution. On the prediction market Polymarket, bettors previously saw less than a 30% chance of an Israeli attack by July. Initial reports came from Axios, and Al-Jazeera later confirmed explosions in Tehran. Traditional financial markets also responded. European stock indices declined —the Euro Stoxx 50 fell 1.4%, and the FTSE 100 dropped 0.7%. U.S. futures lost about 1.4% across the board. In contrast, safe-haven assets gained. Gold rose 1% to $3,436 per ounce , U.S. Treasury yields dropped slightly, and oil prices spiked up to 9% before settling 5.6% higher.

2025-06-13T12:06:14,"New Crypto Coins Analysis: Bitcoin Solaris Stands Alone as True Bitcoin Successor with Revolutionary Mobile Mining","There’s a flood of new crypto coins launching every month—but only a rare few make you stop and think, “This could be the one.” In 2009, it was Bitcoin. Today, that spotlight is shifting toward Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). It’s not just another chain with promises and hype. This project brings something crypto hasn’t seen in years: a realistic shot for everyday people to build wealth from their phones, with zero barriers. At the heart of this movement is a powerful combination of cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure and something delightfully simple: mobile mining. The Sea of New Coins—and Why BTC-S Is Different From meme coins to AI-layer plays, the current wave of new coins is loud, crowded, and often fleeting. Many offer bold visions but lack the structure to deliver. Bitcoin Solaris, on the other hand, arrives not just with promises but with real, working architecture and a delivery-first mentality. It isn’t trying to ride hype waves. It’s creating its own. Its biggest innovation? The upcoming Solaris Nova app which turns any smartphone into a mining device. No expensive GPUs. No complicated setup. Just pure, daily rewards through one of the cleanest interfaces crypto has seen. This simplicity is what gives BTC-S a massive edge—and a growing army of early adopters. Core Strength: Bitcoin Solaris’s Powerful Technical Design Under the hood, BTC-S operates on a hybrid dual-consensus architecture—combining the reliability of Proof-of-Work with the high-speed performance of Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This system allows it to process over 10,000 transactions per second while maintaining Bitcoin-level security and decentralization. The Helios Consensus, a unique innovation, rotates validators efficiently to keep the network balanced, stable, and tamper-resistant. Even more impressive, BTC-S achieves this while using 99.95% less energy than traditional PoW chains. Smart contract capabilities have also been baked in, enabling powerful decentralized apps and integrations that support gaming, DeFi, and beyond. Liquid Staking That Works for Real Users One standout feature that’s catching the attention of both developers and retail users is Bitcoin Solaris’s liquid staking model . Instead of locking up tokens, BTC-S allows stakers to convert their holdings into sBTC-S at a 1:1 ratio, earning passive rewards while keeping full liquidity. Benefits include: Rewards + Liquidity: Passive income without asset lockups. DeFi-Ready: Use sBTC-S across lending platforms and governance. Stronger Network: Boosts decentralization and security. User-Friendly: Fully integrated with the upcoming Solaris Nova App. This staking model not only enhances the ecosystem, it empowers the user. BTC-S Makes Crypto Simple and Profitable Verified, Trusted, and Backed by Experts Bitcoin Solaris hasn’t just built hype—it’s passed the test of scrutiny. Independent audits from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins confirm the integrity of its smart contracts and ecosystem infrastructure. In a space where rug pulls and vaporware dominate headlines, this level of transparency matters—and it’s helping drive rapid adoption. So is the growing buzz from influencers, including a full breakdown by 2Bit Crypto , who highlighted BTC-S as one of the few “new coins” with actual substance. Mining for the Masses: A Direct Comparison Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Mining Setup ASIC rigs Smartphone Energy Use High 99.95% lower Mining Access Wealthy users Anyone with a phone TPS ~7 Over 10,000 Mobile Mining Not possible Core feature via Nova App And yes, the Solaris mining calculator lets you see real-time estimates of your potential earnings, based on nothing more than your phone’s power and network contribution. Presale Buzz: This Is Not a Drill With phase 7 underway, Bitcoin Solaris is sitting at $7 per token. The next jump—$8—is fast approaching, and the final launch price is already set at $20. With over 11,000 unique users already on board and more than $4.1 million raised, this is being hailed as the shortest and most explosive presale in recent memory. There are only around 7 weeks left before the presale closes. With the rate of adoption and attention, Bitcoin Solaris could be one of the rare few that deliver both early entry and long-term value. Bitcoin Solaris might be the final chance at a ground-floor opportunity that can actually live up to the Bitcoin legacy. Conclusion Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just another “new coin” thrown into the crypto firehose—it’s a calculated response to everything this space promised, yet never delivered. With unmatched scalability, real mobile mining, flexible staking, and a proven technical backbone, BTC-S offers a legitimate path for everyday users to build lasting financial momentum. And with the presale closing in fast, it might just be the last of its kind.

2025-06-13T12:00:37,"Stablecoins To Hit $2 Trillion? US Treasury Hints At Explosive Growth","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers that dollar-pegged stablecoins could swell to more than $2 trillion in the next few years. He spoke at a Senate hearing this week. His outlook came as Congress moved to set new rules on how these tokens must be backed. Related Reading: TRX Price Up As Tron Rolls Out The Red Carpet For Trump-Backed Stablecoin Growth Forecast Details According to Bloomberg, Bessent said a leading industry group expects the stablecoin market cap to top $2 trillion. He called that view “very reasonable.” It would mean backing up to $2 trillion in tokens with US Treasury Bills. Based on reports, Citigroup analysts think issuers might buy an extra $1 trillion in those bills by 2030. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that dollar-linked stablecoins could hit $2 trillion or even more as he reiterated the potential for these digital assets to strengthen the greenback’s position https://t.co/HwVRu0aPkT — Bloomberg (@business) June 11, 2025 Backing Rules Move Forward Lawmakers voted to advance a key amendment to the GENIUS Act, which would force stablecoin issuers to hold reserves in top-tier assets. The amendment won cloture yesterday. That clears the way for a final vote, likely early next week. Supporters say the change will boost confidence by ensuring every dollar-linked token has real backing. Market Size Today Right now, the total stablecoin market sits at about $255 billion. Dollar-pegged coins make up roughly $233 billion of that. That equals 90% of the whole market. The top nine dollar-pegged coins include USDT, USDC, USDe, DAI, USD1, FDUSD, PYUSD, TUSD, and USDD. They account for nearly all stablecoin activity. Challenges Ahead Regulators have work to do. If the GENIUS Act stalls or changes, issuers might head to friendlier markets. There’s also a risk that a handful of big players could dominate. That could create new “too big to fail” worries if a major issuer faces trouble. Plus, tech glitches and smart-contract bugs could still trigger runs on tokens. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC If stablecoin use really takes off in cross-border payments and decentralized finance, the US dollar could win new fans overseas. Every $1 trillion in token issuance backed by Treasury Bills might add to demand for US debt. But the path isn’t guaranteed. Lawmakers must iron out rules that balance safety with innovation. Issuers need strong risk plans. And users must see clear benefits beyond speculation. For now, the market is small compared with the broader financial system. But the shift toward programmable money keeps pace.

2025-06-13T12:00:33,"Tether Buys 31.9% Stake in Gold Royalties Company Elemental Altus (ELE)","Tether has acquired a 31.9% stake in Elemental Altus Royalties Corp (ELE), a Canadian publicly listed gold royalties company. Tether is well known for creating the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT . In recent months, Tether has been bolstering its gold and Bitcoin reserves, as part of a broader strategy to back up its stablecoin with hard assets. Tether obtained 78,421,780 common shares of Elemental Altus. The deal was reportedly made offshore to secure such a large transaction. Tether made an options trade, with AlphaStream mediating the agreement, to obtain 34,444,580 additional shares from Elemental Altus. The trade marks a pivotal moment for the stablecoin issuer, with a significant investment in the gold royalties market. Tether invested in the gold royalties company Elemental Altus for around $89.2 million, branching out into precious metals and tangible asset markets. The stablecoin USDT, operated by Tether, has a market capitalization of $155 billion. Elemental Altus is a publicly listed company that is traded on the Toronto-based exchange. The share price of ELE jumped around 23% on the news that Tether had purchased a third of the shares. Tether purchased the common shares from La Mancha, a Luxembourg-based mining and investment firm. When the announcement was made to the general public, the price of ELE jumped to around $1.30. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, commented that the investment reflects Tether’s confidence in the gold market and its fundamentals at this moment in time. Elemental Altus is a gold royalty company, which means it finances mining operations and receives a royalty in return for the gold revenues. For this reason, gold royalty companies are considered low-risk because they merely finance operations and have very little overhead to concern themselves with. Gold royalty companies spend considerable time investigating whether a client would make a profit for the company. From an investor’s perspective, gold royalty companies are attractive because they can potentially continue to make profits even after a gold price boom. Tether commented that such an investment reflected their interest in low-risk exposure to real-world assets. Tether plans to enhance its financial products’ stability and transparency by diversifying into the gold royalties market. Ardoino commented that Tether was increasing in Gold and Bitcoin as part of a forward-looking strategy to build a more transparent financial system. Ardoino argued that Bitcoin was a proven hedge against inflation, and Gold was a time-tested long-term value store. Ardoino reiterated that gold investment was about profits and creating a resilient financial infrastructure for the next century. Tether’s complex asset strategy includes over 100,000 BTC, 80 tons of physical gold, and stablecoin Tether Gold XAUT. Tether has been slowly building a new financial infrastructure to replace the existing systems. However, Tether is creating an economic system built from blockchain technology, making it a more transparent and fair system for investors. A portfolio combining Gold and Bitcoin allows investors to couple the two assets into one portfolio. Bitcoin already symbolises Gold through its language, such as proof-of-work and mining. It makes sense to further associate the two assets with one another. Tether has consistently built its gold stablecoin XAUT, which is further validated by having gold investments. Tether may also wish to invest in commodity-backed digital assets, requiring expertise in various business models such as gold royalties. Tether may create a gold-based backbone for the Tether USDT ecosystem by associating Gold with Bitcoin. Tether could also collaborate with the Elemental Altus management board to develop financial products further. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, stated that the core strategy for Tether was to create a financial system backed by tangible assets. In Q1 2025, Tether bought around $735 million worth of Bitcoin. This formed part of the company’s strategy to back up their financial instruments with real-world assets. Tether bought 8,888 BTC when the price was valued at around $82k. This massive buy-in ranked Tether as the sixth-largest holder of Bitcoin worldwide. At the time, the buy-in added to Tether’s accumulation treasury of 92,647 BTC. However, the stablecoin issuer now owns over 100,000 BTC. Tether, moreover, owns around 80 tons of gold, showing its commitment to amassing real-world assets to its portfolio. It would be convenient for Tether to amass Bitcoin reserves because the digital asset is stored online. Still, Tether has also aimed to accumulate gold reserves to back up its gold stablecoin. The TRON network recently minted around 1 billion USDT, coinciding with an upward movement in Bitcoin’s price.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/tether-buys-31-9-stake-in-gold-royalties-company-elemental-altus-ele/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|USDT","Cryptocurrency|News|Tether|USDT",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T12:00:24,"Another Hyperliquid whale switches to short BTC position","Another closely watched Hyperliquid whale suffered losses from its long position. The whale, recognized as one of the most experienced traders in the crypto space, switched to a short position with 20X leverage. Another Hyperliquid whale was pushed out of its long position following the downturn of BTC prices. The whale, recognized as @aguilatrades, is one of the oldest known participants in the BTC market. Unlike Wynn, this trader hardly publicizes its decisions and trades, and is not seeking popularity. The new wallet was identified just days ago and tagged by on-chain investigators. AguilaTrades( @AguilaTrades ) has closed his $BTC long position with over $12.4M in losses — and flipped short. Will he keep racking up losses, or is this short his shot at redemption? https://t.co/dSItG8OY3n pic.twitter.com/L04a0FyNtE — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 13, 2025 Hyperliquid whales have suffered recent liquidations On-chain data showed the trader closed a 40X leveraged long on BTC, absorbing $12.4M in losses. Soon after that, the whale opened a 20X leveraged short position valued at over $878K. At one point, AguilaTrades took a position opposite the risky trader James Wynn . The inflow of whale traders also attracted none other than Andrew Tate , who was quickly liquidated in the high-risk market. Recently, Wynn also got liquidated on multiple positions, also involving meme tokens like PEPE. Counter-trading Wynn was still a winning strategy, as in the case of one whale making $8M from shorting BTC just in time for its downturn. The Hyperliquid whale was closely watched for a shift in sentiment, as long positions were attacked again. | Source: Hyperliquid The series of liquidations affected multiple whales that voted confidence in BTC or went long on ETH. BTC traded at $104,763, while ETH slid to the $2,500 range, breaking its attempt to regain $2,800. The market momentum turned, as greed trading shifted to a more neutral attitude. The liquidations for long whales coincided with the market-wide downturn and liquidation of long positions. Around $1B was liquidated from the crypto markets in the past 24 hours, with over $451M in liquidations for BTC pairs. Hyperliquid activity remains near peak levels Despite this, Hyperliquid’s activity remained near peak levels, aiming to retain its activity from April and May. Hyperliquid usually became more active during times of clear direction for top coins, with whales taking high-profile positions. Following the recent peak activity, HYPE slid down to $40 after peaking at $43.76. The token sees additional buying pressure from whales, which may bring the price back toward $45. Whales are also using Hyperliquid to build positions on the native token, as well as currently hot meme tokens. Hyperliquid remains a high-risk venue, which has still produced whales with significant earnings, based on the DEX leaderboard . The high-profile trades partially disguised the performance of whales that still managed to win in the current market. Hyperliquid still reflects the general exuberance of the market. However, there are skeptics that see the exchange as a venue for money-laundering, using liquidations to sway the asset price, while holding the reverse position on another exchange. Additionally, Hyperliquid users are still expecting a potential second airdrop, keeping up activity in the hopes of receiving a higher payout. Hyperliquid remains the ninth-largest ecosystem by value locked, mostly due to the weight of the native HYPE token, but also for a small collection of memes . The ecosystem locks in $1.6B in value, with near-record inflows of USDC in the past days. The DEX still contains over $3.1B in USDC, breaking to a new high in the past week.

2025-06-13T12:00:00,"Assessing Strategy's New Perpetual Stride Preferred Shares","Summary (Micro)Strategy's Bitcoin purchases have dramatically slowed down so far in June. Through a $1 billion capital raise, Strategy has given the market a third preferred share option, Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, for income investors with higher risk tolerance. STRD pays an effective yield of 11.3%, though dividend payouts are not mandatory. I still like STRF far better due to seniority and cumulative, mandatory payouts, but I think STRD is also worth a look. After purchasing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) at a blistering clip for much of April and May, Strategy ( MSTR ) has slowed down the company's purchases of BTC during the month of June. Through June 11th, Strategy has reported buying just 1,750 BTC at a total cost of $185 million: Reported Periods (Strategy, Author's Chart) For just about any other company in the public equity markets, $185 million in just a couple of weeks would be significant. But for Strategy, this is perhaps underwhelming, given the company has averaged about $4 billion per month going back to September. What is also interesting, in my view, is that both of the announced purchases have come with funding through Strategy's preferred stock offerings via the MicroStrategy Incorporated 10.00% SER A PERPETUAL STRIFE PFD STK ( STRF ) and MicroStrategy Incorporated 8.00% SERIES A PERPETUAL STRIKE PFD ( STRK ) rather than through the company's common stock. Simultaneous to these preferred share-driven BTC acquisitions, Strategy announced the offering and pricing of a third perpetual preferred share, this latest one is the Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock ( STRD ). In this article, I'll detail how STRD is different from Strategy's previous two preferred share offerings and assess whether income investors should consider adding STRD to their portfolios. STRD Offering Details On June 6th, Strategy announced the offering of 2,500,000 shares of STRD perpetual preferred shares with a yield of 10%. Subsequent to the offering, Strategy sold 11,764,700 shares at an offering price of $85 per share. The STRD offering raised $1 billion for the company, with expected net proceeds of $979.7 million after underwriting commissions. Like the two other perpetual preferred shares, STRD has a liquidation preference of $100. Which means the effective yield on STRD would actually be closer to 11.3% at the closing price of $88.35 on June 11th assuming Strategy declares the dividend and pays shareholders. That last point is the critical difference between STRD and both STRK/STRF. Comparison of Strategy Preferred Stocks Unlike STRK and STRF, STRD is not a mandatory dividend. This makes STRD the riskiest of the three offerings, but it's a terrific way to raise capital from Strategy's vantage, since it isn't dilutive to common stockholders. The latter of which saw shares outstanding grow by over 50% year over year as of the quarter ended March, with even more dilution through the ATM to fund BTC purchases subsequent to Q1. Still, assuming Strategy wants to ever be able to raise capital again in this market, I would expect the company to declare the STRD dividend each quarter. The breakdown of the key differences between the shares as I see it is below: Share Comparison STRD STRF STRK Coupon 10% 10% 8% Cumulative? No Yes Yes Mandatory Dividend? No Yes Yes MSTR Convertible? No No 10:1 Preferred Seniority Rank 3 1 2 Liquidation Preference $100 $100 $100 Share Price Close as of 6/11/25 $88.35 $104.70 $106.72 Effective Yield 11.32% 9.55% 7.50% Source: Strategy From where I sit, Strategy has actually done a pretty incredible job of creating preferred share structures that appeal to different investor types. All of these preferred shares are ultimately backed by the company's Bitcoin on the balance sheet. But one need not believe in the future price appreciation of BTC to find these shares appealing. Given the seniority rank of STRF compared to the other preferred stocks, I view STRF as the lowest-risk and most suitable for income investors. The shares have a mandatory dividend that are cumulative. Meaning, if Strategy misses a payment, STRF shareholders are still owed the payout. Since STRF is not convertible to MSTR shares, the upside in STRF is more limited than that of STRK in the event Bitcoin rallies significantly and drags MSTR with it. But even at a 9.55% effective yield, STRF is quite attractive given Strategy's collateralization ratio. STRK is perhaps more suitable for investors who care less about the effective yield and more about the total return of the shares. At a $1,000 MSTR share price, STRK becomes interesting on the capital appreciation potential given the 10:1 convertibility to the common stock. However, purely as an income product, I think STRK is less appealing than STRF due to the seniority rank and lower effective yield. STRD is perhaps the most interesting preferred stock of the three offerings because it's the highest risk and currently has the highest yield. For income investors who like sure things, I'd probably avoid this one. But for income-investors who have a higher risk-tolerance, I think STRD is worth a look. The biggest reason for that - aside from Strategy's collateralization ratio - is that the market has already taken the more senior preferred shares above liquidation preference. So the effective yields when buying those funds on secondary are actually lower than the 10% and 8% coupons from the offering. Thus, if you still want a Strategy preferred that yields 10%, STRD is your only option currently. Can Strategy Actually Pay These Shareholders? Ultimately, the investment case for any of these preferred stock shares lies in the ability Strategy has to actually pay shareholders back. At current Bitcoin price levels, my view is that there is low risk in holding these shares today. However, that view is predicated on the notion that Strategy exhibits a willingness to lock in some of the company's unrealized Bitcoin gains and pay its preferred share dividends with the proceeds of those sales. Even if Strategy stops raising capital through the preferred instruments going forward, the company has an annualized coupon obligation of over $300 million based on my calculation of the combined outstanding shares: Preferred Payouts STRK STRF STRD Shares 11,306,243 9,412,070 11,764,700 Annual Coupon Obligation $90,449,944 $94,120,700 $117,647,000 Source: Strategy filings, Analyst's calculations Of course, Strategy could simply not pay the $118 million STRD dividends over the next 12 months. But again, I think doing so would irreparably damage the company's ability to raise capital. My view is it's essentially a mathematical certainty that Strategy will have to start selling Bitcoin to pay these preferred obligations. Keep in mind, the company's software business loses money and cannot support these preferred share payouts. Data by YCharts After a gross profit of $326 million on a trailing twelve-month basis, Strategy's bottom-line goes negative when factoring in the combined $392 million on SG&A and R&D expenses. So again, Strategy cannot pay these dividends from the operations of the software business. The company either has to keep raising from new investors to pay the old ones (there is a word for this) or it has to realize gains in BTC appreciation. My vote is the latter. Major Risk Of course, the risk here is that Strategy is one of the biggest BTC holders in the market at this juncture. If the company starts selling, investment demand through the spot ETF products could sour and Strategy could take the market down essentially by itself. But given the current market value of Bitcoin, I think longing STRD is worth the risk given Strategy has $11.5 billion in convertible debt and preferred share obligations against $63 billion in Bitcoin holdings. Closing Summary In my opinion, STRF is hands-down the best choice for income-focused investors who want a high-yield offering with some margin of safety. With STRF, the dividends are mandatory, cumulative, and are senior to the other two offerings. Meaning, if Bitcoin goes into a deep bear market and Strategy is forced to sell BTC to make preferred payments, STRF shareholders are paid back before STRK and STRD shareholders. While STRD is clearly the riskiest of the three offerings because there is no guarantee of any dividends at all, I do expect Strategy to pay them and believe the market will bring STRD shares more in line with the liquidation preference of $100 as it did with both STRK and STRF; each of which now trade at premiums to liquidation preference. Thus, at a share price currently trading under $89, I think STRD is somewhat easy to justify on the potential price appreciation alone. As I noted in my last coverage of MSTR, I'm personally long STRF. I am now also long STRD to a smaller degree. My approach to STRD is quite simple; I'm long the shares at $88 and plan to sell closer to $95-96. At that point, I'd entertain rolling proceeds into STRF for the mandatory payment. I remain of the view that Strategy's Bitcoin flywheel could have devastating consequences in a Bitcoin bear market, and I view STRF shares as insurance against my BTC position. The price of that insurance is the spread between Bitcoin capital gains that I may miss out on and the 11% effective yield at my STRF cost basis.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794555-assessing-strategys-new-perpetual-stride-preferred-shares?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK","STRF|STRK|STRD|MSTR",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T12:00:00,"Mercurity and Galaxy CEOs Double Down on Bitcoin Adoption","The institutional case for Bitcoin is gaining strength as public companies and investment leaders increasingly position the digital asset as a long-term strategic reserve. Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz reiterated his projection that Bitcoin could rise tenfold to reach $1 million, while Mercurity Fintech Holding unveiled plans to raise $800 million to build a corporate Bitcoin treasury. Mike Novogratz Projects $1 Million Bitcoin: A Macro Asset on the Rise Galaxy Digital CEO and outspoken crypto advocate Mike Novogratz is once again making waves with his bullish stance on Bitcoin, predicting the digital currency could one day reach $1 million per coin. Speaking in an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Novogratz outlined a scenario in which Bitcoin continues its steady ascent by gradually displacing gold as a store of value, driven by younger generations and expanding institutional adoption. “The bull case becomes that over time young people care about it more than old people, so gold slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin,” Novogratz said. “If you look at gold's market cap and Bitcoin's market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go — 10x — and so that’s [$1 million] Bitcoin just to be where gold is.” Novogratz’s outlook isn’t based on short-term speculation but rather a broader shift in the global financial paradigm. With Bitcoin currently trading around $106,210 and a total market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, reaching a $1 million valuation would imply a staggering $20 trillion market cap — putting Bitcoin on par with the total estimated value of all the world’s gold. The Galaxy Digital chief emphasized that macro-level adoption of Bitcoin is already underway. ”Now we’ve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin,” he said. “The adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in — I think that’s now a ball rolling downhill.” That momentum is most clearly seen in the rise of institutional Bitcoin investment vehicles, most notably BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. Since its launch, the ETF has accumulated over $70 billion in assets under management, accounting for roughly 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. The product provides traditional investors with exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of self-custody, making it easier than ever to add the asset to a portfolio. This institutional interest is helping to legitimize Bitcoin as a modern-day alternative to traditional safe havens like gold. According to Novogratz, it’s this systemic shift — rather than speculative hype — that is laying the foundation for Bitcoin’s long-term growth. A Broader Chorus of Bulls Novogratz is far from alone in predicting Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest made headlines in April when it raised its long-term price projection for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by 2030, citing continued institutional inflows and technological innovation. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor, another vocal Bitcoin bull, has also consistently reiterated his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, going so far as to funnel billions of dollars from his company’s balance sheet into the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s fundamentals have continued to strengthen as well. With an annual price appreciation of over 50%, the asset is now trading within reach of its all-time high of $111,000. Despite short-term volatility, the longer-term trend remains bullish, particularly as macroeconomic conditions favor hard assets amid concerns of inflation and fiat currency debasement. While Novogratz’s comments are bullish, they are not without vested interest. Galaxy Digital has positioned itself deeply within the crypto ecosystem. The firm’s asset management division last year raised $113 million for Galaxy Ventures, a fund dedicated to early-stage crypto investments. Additionally, the company holds approximately 12,830 BTC on its balance sheet — worth more than $1 billion at current prices — and operates a large-scale Bitcoin mining operation in Texas. The performance of Bitcoin has a direct impact on Galaxy Digital’s financial health, as well as the broader valuation of the crypto sector. A tenfold increase in Bitcoin’s price would not only validate Novogratz’s thesis but significantly boost the firm’s own assets and revenue. Roadblocks Ahead? Despite the optimistic outlook, a number of factors could slow Bitcoin’s ascent to $1 million. Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant concern, especially in jurisdictions with tightening scrutiny on crypto markets. Moreover, the pace of institutional adoption, while growing, still faces hurdles in terms of infrastructure, security, and risk management. Critics also point to Bitcoin’s scalability and energy consumption as challenges to mass adoption, although proponents argue that these issues are being mitigated by innovations in layer-2 scaling solutions and growing use of renewable energy in mining operations. Novogratz’s vision for Bitcoin is not predicated on short-term price action, but on a multi-decade transformation of global finance. As the asset becomes more embedded in the portfolios of corporations, sovereign wealth funds, and everyday investors, its utility as a digital store of value could rival or even exceed that of gold. Whether Bitcoin will eventually reach the $1 million milestone remains to be seen. But if the current trajectory of adoption, innovation, and institutional integration continues, Novogratz’s projection might be less far-fetched than it seems. Mercurity Fintech to Raise $800M for Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Amid Rising Corporate Crypto Adoption Meanwhile, Mercurity Fintech Holding, a Nasdaq-listed digital finance firm focused on blockchain-based payment infrastructure, announced plans on Wednesday to raise $800 million in capital to create a long-term Bitcoin treasury reserve. The move places the company among a growing list of corporations integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheet strategies as institutional adoption of crypto assets accelerates worldwide. In its official statement, Mercurity detailed that the Bitcoin reserve would be established using a blockchain-native approach, incorporating custody solutions, staking mechanisms, and tokenized treasury management services. The initiative is aimed at creating a resilient and yield-generating asset reserve that aligns with the firm’s strategic focus on digital financial infrastructure. Mercurity’s proposed $800 million capital raise—if executed at current market prices near $104,000 per BTC—would enable the company to purchase approximately 7,433 Bitcoin. This would catapult Mercurity into the 11th spot among corporate Bitcoin holders globally, surpassing GameStop, which holds 4,710 BTC, according to data from Bitbo. Largest corporate Bitcoin holders (Source: Bitbo ) The initiative reflects a growing corporate trend of transitioning idle treasury funds into digital assets with long-term upside and inflation-hedging potential. Mercurity said it plans to structure the reserve in a way that generates yield while maintaining strategic exposure to Bitcoin as a long-duration asset. The reserve will integrate with blockchain-based treasury management services, reinforcing the company's commitment to decentralized financial systems. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Reaches Record Highs Mercurity’s announcement comes amid a surge in corporate interest in Bitcoin. Recent figures from BitcoinTreasuries.NET reveal that over 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin in their treasuries, up from just 124 earlier this month. These firms collectively control over 819,000 BTC, equivalent to nearly 3.9% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Firms like Strategy, Galaxy Digital, and Tesla have already paved the way for Bitcoin to become a legitimate corporate reserve asset. Strategy alone holds more than 214,000 BTC, and the trend appears to be accelerating with new entrants like Mercurity Fintech stepping into the arena. While Bitcoin remains the primary asset of choice for corporate treasuries, alternative cryptocurrencies are also gaining traction. For example, Interactive Strength, a Nasdaq-listed fitness equipment manufacturer, recently disclosed plans to raise up to $500 million to establish a Fetch.ai (FET) token treasury. The move underscores a broader institutional appetite not just for Bitcoin, but for blockchain-based assets more generally.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9560/mercurity-and-galaxy-ce-os-double-down-on-bitcoin-adoption,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-13T11:58:03,"BlackRock XRP ETF Is Coming. Here’s the Latest","Speculation surrounding a potential XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) surged this week after influential ETF analyst Nate Geraci suggested that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is likely to expand its crypto ETF portfolio to include XRP . In a post on X, Geraci asserted that he “fully expects BlackRock to file for spot Solana and XRP ETFs,” explaining that, as a market leader in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, it would make “zero sense to cede other top crypto asset ETF categories to competitors.” Shortly after Geraci’s post, Amonyx echoed the sentiment in a bold update: “BREAKING: BlackRock XRP ETF is coming .” Though no formal filing has been made public, the momentum building behind this possibility reflects broader industry expectations that XRP could soon join the ranks of institutionally traded digital assets. BREAKING: BlackRock #XRP ETF is coming. pic.twitter.com/ZL56tykoI0 — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 13, 2025 BlackRock’s Expansion Strategy and the XRP Advantage BlackRock’s interest in digital assets has moved far beyond exploratory. Since the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become a dominant force in crypto markets, drawing billions in institutional capital. In May 2024, the SEC also approved 19b-4 filings for spot Ethereum ETFs.. With these milestones achieved, the next logical step for BlackRock is expansion into other high-liquidity digital assets. XRP stands out as a prime candidate. It is one of the oldest and most actively traded cryptocurrencies, with a deep pool of liquidity, robust exchange listings, and a well-established infrastructure through Ripple and the XRP Ledger. Geraci also noted that he expects BlackRock to file for an index-based crypto ETF — a fund likely to include XRP among other top tokens. Such a move would not only expand investor access to diversified crypto exposure but also elevate XRP’s role in institutional portfolios. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Clarity Supporting ETF Possibility A crucial factor supporting an XRP ETF is the partial legal clarity secured in Ripple’s ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security in programmatic (exchange-based) sales, effectively giving the green light for its trading on secondary markets. While the case remains active, a final resolution is expected soon. Compared to many altcoins still clouded by regulatory ambiguity, XRP enjoys a legal advantage that makes it a feasible candidate for ETF structuring. With Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already approved and launched, XRP’s combination of legal clarity, market maturity, and infrastructure strength makes it a natural next step. Market Watching for BlackRock’s Next Move Amonyx’s declaration that a “BlackRock XRP ETF is coming” may not reflect an official filing, but it aligns with a growing consensus in the financial world. BlackRock has made no secret of its ambition to dominate the crypto ETF space. Failing to secure a position in the XRP market would leave room for rivals such as Fidelity or VanEck — a move that seems unlikely given BlackRock’s aggressive strategy to lead. As the regulatory environment evolves and demand for diverse crypto investment vehicles grows, the launch of a BlackRock XRP ETF appears increasingly inevitable.

2025-06-13T11:53:13,"Altcoins To Buy Now For 10x Gains","The post Altcoins To Buy Now For 10x Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As regulatory clarity improves and institutional interest grows , analysts believe the market is entering a multi-year supercycle, where a select group of tokens could see 10x or more gains. In a latest analysis, expert EllioTrades has listed some altcoins that he believes have major upside once regulations are clear. Aave (AAVE) Aave is currently trading at $284.82, down 3% in the past day. It is up 24% in the past month. AAVE has rallied 180% since April, recently hitting $312, its highest since February. AAVE also formed a golden cross on the charts, and it could keep climbing toward $398, a 28% gain from current levels, unless it falls below the $282 support. Maker (MKR) Maker is currently trading at $1885, down 5% in the last 24 hours. It is up around 17% in the last 2 weeks, and experts predict Maker to rise by 34% and reach $2,512 by July 13, with a price range between $1,879 and $2,570. While the short-term sentiment is mixed, analysts expect up to 35% upside in July if the trend holds, with an average target around $2,475 . Maple Finance (SYRUP) Maple Finance is currently trading at $0.4825, down over 3%. It is up around 60% in the past month. Key levels to watch are support at $0.46 and resistance at $0.52. If volume picks up, the price could rise toward $0.55. Ethena (ENA) Ethena is currently trading at $0.2931, down over 10% in the last 24 hours. However, analysts believe that Ethena is testing the upper resistance of a descending channel on the daily chart. A breakout could send the price toward key targets at $0.45, $0.63, and $0.95 . Euler (EUL) Euler is currently trading at $7.51, down 7.3%. Euler is down 15.78% over the past month and currently trades below both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, signaling a bearish trend. A short-term recovery could push EUL to $16.10 by end of June, with a longer-term target of $27.32 by end of 2027. Pendle (PENDLE) Pendle is currently trading at $3.83, down 1.5% in the past day. Pendle is expected to stay around $3.69 in July, with a small chance to rise slightly. Traders could see a short gain if the price stays in the $3.68–$3.70 range. Tokens like Uniswap, and Superverse, (which is quietly preparing to launch Black Hole), were also mentioned. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a press briefing on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Iran’s nuclear ambitions as a “clear and present danger,” saying the “preemptive strikes” would “continue for as many days as it takes to eliminate this threat.

2025-06-13T11:50:42,"Iran Israel Strike: Urgent Update on Escalating Middle East Tensions","BitcoinWorld Iran Israel Strike: Urgent Update on Escalating Middle East Tensions Breaking news from the Middle East indicates a significant development: the Israeli Air Force has reportedly conducted a strike within Iran. This action, reported by Axios and shared widely via platforms like X by figures such as Walter Bloomberg, marks a critical moment in the ongoing regional tensions. For those following global events and their potential ripple effects on financial markets, including the often-sensitive cryptocurrency space, understanding the nuances of this situation is paramount. This event injects a new level of Geopolitical Risk into an already volatile global landscape. Understanding the Latest Iran Israel Strike The report of an Iran Israel Strike follows a period of heightened direct confrontation between the two nations. For years, the conflict has primarily unfolded through proxies and covert operations. However, recent events saw Iran launch an unprecedented direct missile and drone attack on Israel, which Iran stated was in retaliation for a strike on its consulate in Damascus. Israel had vowed to respond to Iran’s direct attack. The reported strike in Iran appears to be that response, bringing the long-simmering conflict into a more overt phase. While details are still emerging, initial reports suggest the strike targeted specific locations within Iran. The nature and extent of the damage, as well as Iran’s official response, are key factors that will determine the immediate trajectory of the situation. The world watches closely, assessing the potential for further escalation. Why Geopolitical Risk Matters for Global Markets Major geopolitical events inherently introduce uncertainty, which financial markets dislike. An increase in Geopolitical Risk can trigger significant reactions across various asset classes. Historically, conflicts in the Middle East, a region central to global energy supplies, have had pronounced effects on oil prices. Rising oil prices can contribute to inflation, impacting monetary policy decisions by central banks worldwide. This, in turn, influences everything from bond yields to stock valuations. Beyond energy, heightened tensions can disrupt supply chains, affect international trade, and dampen investor confidence. In times of uncertainty, investors often move towards assets traditionally considered ‘safe havens,’ such as gold or certain government bonds. However, the definition of a safe haven can shift, and the interconnectedness of modern markets means that even traditional safe havens can experience volatility during extreme stress events. Here are some potential ways geopolitical risk can ripple through markets: Energy Prices: Direct impact if conflict threatens production or transit routes. Investor Sentiment: Increased fear can lead to sell-offs in riskier assets. Supply Chains: Disruptions can affect global manufacturing and trade. Inflation: Higher energy or commodity prices can fuel inflationary pressures. Central Bank Policy: Geopolitical factors can influence decisions on interest rates. Navigating Escalating Middle East Tensions The current Middle East Tensions between Iran and Israel are particularly concerning due to the potential for a wider regional conflict involving other state and non-state actors. The involvement of proxies, the strategic importance of the region, and the complex web of alliances make de-escalation challenging. Any miscalculation could have severe consequences, extending beyond the immediate combatants. Understanding the historical context is crucial. The animosity between Iran and Israel dates back decades, rooted in political, religious, and strategic disagreements. Iran’s support for groups hostile to Israel and its nuclear program are central points of contention. Israel views Iran as an existential threat. This latest direct exchange marks a dangerous evolution in their rivalry. International reactions play a key role in shaping the narrative and potential outcomes. Calls for restraint from global powers are common, but the effectiveness of such calls depends on the willingness of the parties involved to step back. The position of major global players like the United States, European Union nations, Russia, and China will be critical in diplomatic efforts, or lack thereof. The Potential Global Market Impact The immediate Global Market Impact of the reported strike is likely to manifest as increased volatility. Futures markets often react quickly to such news, and the start of trading sessions will reveal how this development is being priced in by investors worldwide. Sectors most directly affected might include energy, defense, and potentially technology, given the reliance on global supply chains. However, the longer-term impact depends heavily on whether this event leads to further escalation or if diplomatic efforts manage to contain the situation. A prolonged or expanded conflict would likely have a more sustained negative impact on global economic growth prospects and market stability. Conversely, a swift de-escalation could see markets recover relatively quickly, having priced in the initial shock. Market participants will be closely monitoring official statements from Iran and Israel, as well as reactions from major international bodies and governments. The language used and the actions taken in the coming hours and days will be critical indicators of the potential trajectory of the conflict and, consequently, the markets. Considering Crypto Volatility in Times of Geopolitical Stress The relationship between geopolitical events and the cryptocurrency market is complex and not always straightforward. While Bitcoin was envisioned by some as a non-sovereign store of value, potentially acting as a safe haven during traditional financial system stress, its price often behaves like a risk asset, correlating with technology stocks. Crypto Volatility is already a defining characteristic of the market. Geopolitical events can exacerbate this volatility, though the direction isn’t always predictable. In some instances, initial news of conflict might lead to a sell-off in risk assets, including crypto. However, if the event is perceived as weakening traditional financial systems or increasing inflation fears (due to rising commodity prices, for example), some investors might theoretically turn to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value, potentially driving prices up. The crypto market is also influenced by global liquidity and macroeconomic factors, which are indirectly affected by geopolitical stability. Increased global uncertainty can lead to tighter financial conditions, which typically pressure risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, if central banks were to react to a geopolitical crisis with more accommodative monetary policy (though this is not the current trend), it could potentially provide tailwinds for crypto. Here’s a look at potential, though not guaranteed, impacts on crypto: Initial Sell-off: As part of a broader risk-off move across markets. Increased Correlation: May see crypto move in tandem with traditional indices like the S&P 500. Narrative Play: Renewed discussion around Bitcoin as a potential safe haven, though market action doesn’t always support this consistently. Heightened Volatility: Prices likely to swing more dramatically based on news flow. For cryptocurrency holders and traders, this period calls for increased vigilance. Monitoring global news alongside market data is essential. Understanding that external, non-crypto specific events can significantly impact digital asset prices is a crucial part of navigating this market. What Happens Next? Potential Scenarios Predicting the future in geopolitical situations is impossible, but analysts are considering several potential scenarios following the reported Iran Israel Strike : De-escalation: Both sides, having demonstrated capability and resolve, might choose to step back, possibly under international pressure. This is the most hopeful scenario for regional stability and markets. Limited, Tit-for-Tat Exchanges: The situation could devolve into a series of limited strikes and counter-strikes, potentially targeting military assets or infrastructure, but avoiding all-out war. This maintains high tension and market uncertainty. Wider Regional Conflict: The conflict could expand, drawing in proxies or even direct involvement from other regional powers or global players. This is the most dangerous scenario with severe humanitarian and economic consequences. The actions and rhetoric of leaders in Tehran, Tel Aviv, Washington D.C., and other capitals will provide clues about which path is most likely being taken. Diplomatic efforts, back-channel communications, and public statements will all be scrutinized. Actionable Insights for the Informed Reader Given the unfolding situation and its potential Global Market Impact , what should readers, especially those with exposure to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, consider? Stay Informed: Rely on reputable news sources for updates on the geopolitical situation. Understand the facts as they are reported and differentiate them from speculation. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical events are a reminder that external shocks can occur. Ensure your investment portfolio aligns with your comfort level regarding risk and volatility. Understand Market Correlations: Be aware that crypto prices can be influenced by broader market sentiment and macroeconomic factors tied to global stability. Avoid Panic Decisions: Volatility can trigger emotional responses. Make investment decisions based on your long-term strategy, not short-term news spikes. Diversification: Consider whether your portfolio is adequately diversified across different asset classes, which can help mitigate risks associated with specific market segments or events. While it’s impossible to perfectly predict how Middle East Tensions will specifically affect Crypto Volatility in the short term, being prepared for potential market reactions is prudent. This involves understanding the underlying factors at play and maintaining a rational approach to investing during uncertain times. Summary: A Critical Juncture The reported Iran Israel Strike marks a significant escalation in long-standing Middle East Tensions . This event immediately heightens Geopolitical Risk , with potentially far-reaching consequences for regional stability and the global economy. The Global Market Impact is likely to be characterized by increased uncertainty and Crypto Volatility , at least in the short term. While the exact trajectory of events remains uncertain, the coming days will be critical in determining whether this leads to further conflict or a path towards de-escalation. For investors and global citizens alike, staying informed and understanding the potential implications of this developing situation is essential.

2025-06-13T11:49:15,"Altcoin Season 2025: Is the Capital Rotation Already Underway?","The post Altcoin Season 2025: Is the Capital Rotation Already Underway? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today’s downturn has left crypto marketers wondering about the near future of the industry and the possibility of an altseason. Amidst all the hustle and bustle, analyst Cryptex Guy in an X post talks about whether we will see the altseason again. In this write-up, we take you through the proponent’s thesis, on the altcoin season, BTC dominance, stablecoins, Ethereum’s stance, and more. BTC Dominance + Stablecoin Mix: The BTC.D + USDT.D + USDC.D combo chart shared by the analyst highlights how much money sits outside altcoins. Historically, this metric approaching the 74–75% red zone has been a trigger point for sharp altcoin rallies due to rejection from that overhead resistance. Currently sitting at 70.87%, a final push into that zone, followed by rejection, as seen in the past, could mean a capital rotation into altcoins. Notably, a break below the ascending cyan trendline would confirm the end of Bitcoin’s capital dominance run, making way for a full-fledged Altseason, similar to the mini alt-run we’ve seen in Q4 2024. BTC Dominance on Lower Time Frame: On the 4H chart, BTC Dominance has broken out of a rising wedge, a classically bearish pattern for BTC.D. Since altcoins are inversely correlated to BTC.D, this breakout could lead to a short-term relief rally in altcoins. Now, BTC.D appears to be retesting the wedge’s upper boundary. Should this retest be rejected, we can expect a quick 5–10% upside candles on strong altcoins. This aligns with Ethereum’s recent $1000+ surge, which injected $138B into the altcoin ecosystem. Ethereum’s Retest & the Bigger Altseason Picture On higher time frames, Ethereum has reclaimed a significant multi-year trendline, known as the Bull-Bear boundary. A successful reclaim would boost investor confidence and could catalyze sustained inflows into altcoins. The altcoin market is also forming a bullish structure. If this pattern holds, it would set the stage for Altseason 2025, with many altcoins potentially seeing 2–3x gains from current levels. This scenario mirrors the patterns from 2023 and 2024, when capital rotation into alts delivered broad market upside. Also read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 FAQs When can we expect the next Altseason to begin? If BTC.D gets rejected from the 74–75% zone and breaks the trendline, Altseason could commence in late 2025, as historical patterns and technical structures align. What role does Ethereum play in triggering Altseason? Ethereum acts as a capital gateway. Its successful reclaim of major support boosts market-wide confidence, triggering rotations into other Layer 1s and alt sectors. Is it too early to enter altcoins now? Currently, altcoin prices are still suppressed, offering early entry opportunities. As BTC.D approaches resistance, the risk-to-reward ratio for alts becomes increasingly favorable.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/altcoin-season-2025-is-the-capital-rotation-already-underway/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T11:45:10,"Polkadot community members pitch Bitcoin as treasury stability strategy","Polkadot community members have proposed introducing a Bitcoin reserve for the Polkadot Treasury in response to the Wish-For-Change referendum. The proposal aims to convert 500,000 DOT into tBTC over the next year using Hydration’s rolling DCA feature. The community members want the capital to be provided as liquidity into the Hydration Omnipool to put the funds into use. They also added that an additional 1000 DOT is reserved for transaction fees. All-time average trade fees as of proposal submission are around 0.3%. Proposal aims to provide liquidity to Polkadot’s Treasury Polkadot Treasury Bitcoin Strategic Reserve polkassembly referenda 1394 & forum polkadot network bitcoin-reserve-for-the-polkadot-treasury/13221 Recently a Discussion has sparked among the Polkadot Community to add BTC into the Treasury of the Polkadot to diversify it and… pic.twitter.com/uY8K4YcENg — Quantum (@ItsMeQuantum) June 13, 2025 According to the proposers, BTC was mentioned in the original diversification proposal #457 and could help reduce volatility and preserve the value of the Polkadot Treasury, ensuring funds are available to support a given budget in the future. They chose Threshold BTC (tBTC), a non-custodial solution utilizing threshold-ECDSA wallets, for its decentralization, liquidity, and transparency. The proposal suggests selling a fixed amount of DOT per trade rather than acquiring a fixed amount of tBTC. The community members also stated that, for better capital efficiency, the full amount of DOT will be initially converted into a DOT (yield-bearing collateral token) and supplied into the Hydration Borrow feature. According to the proposers, the Polkadot Treasury will accumulate yield on the dormant DOT while substantially increasing the DOT supply available for borrowing, enabling more DeFi use cases. The proposal indicated that chunks of 0.005 tBTC will be provided as liquidity after a short accumulation period into the Hydration Omnipool. The community believes it will allow diversification of the Polkadot Treasury portfolio while also supporting ecosystem DeFi incentives. Polkadot community members argued that Bitcoin continues to perform among the strongest assets of the past decade. They also believe that it’s an opportunity for Polkadot to hedge against uncertainty while signaling to the broader industry that they do believe in and support a multi-chain future. One community member hopes to bring the proposal on-chain early next week following some discussion. One Polkadot community member reiterated that the goal of the proposal is to create a resilient treasury and ensure funding for ecosystem development through turbulent cycles, starting with a Bitcoin reserve. The individual also confirmed that the proposal is about risk management and operational continuity, not market timing or speculation. In the proposal, the community members noted that DOT has increased ~60% vs. Bitcoin since the WFC was first proposed in January. They argued that if the Bitcoin reserve proposal had been enacted, the net gain for the treasury would have been ~$1.5M, all else being equal. According to the individuals, it could give the treasury $124M in assets instead of $122.5M, a 2.46% annualized return. The community members believe a 2.46% annualized return during a 60% DOT decline vs BTC is a great risk-adjusted performance. They also argued that while the upside seems small now, if the decline continues, the difference compounds and the community continues to function. Proposal focuses on risk management and diversification The Polkadot members acknowledged that risk management is fundamental to every major institution. Nobody concentrates 100% of their operating capital on a single asset; even the Ethereum Foundation has diversified into other assets. They believe that by showing the ability to introduce risk management into their system, they’re signaling that Polkadot is maturing into a modern and resilient enterprise. One community member said if Polkadot wanted a resilient treasury, it would diversify into different asset classes and not sell one highly volatile asset for another. Another member also suggested that the Polkadot Community Foundation should open an investment account on behalf of the treasury. The member argued that PCF should roll funds over time from the treasury into investments with yield and use the yield to purchase DOT and top up the treasury regularly. Another Polkadot community member suggested using PCF as a holdings company that can issue tokens or NFTs representing the underlying asset and hold that underlying asset on behalf of the network. The individual argued that it could help the ecosystem because the treasury earns a fee for holding the assets and a premium for being the issuer.

But while that rocket may have taken off, 2025 has opened a new launchpad—and its name is Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). For anyone who missed Bitcoin’s first wave, this might just be the reset button they’ve been hoping for. What Makes Bitcoin Solaris Different? Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just another layer-1 chain trying to mimic the greats. It’s an entirely reimagined blockchain ecosystem, built for speed, fairness, and wealth creation. At its core lies a powerful dual-consensus mechanism, blending the rock-solid security of Proof-of-Work (PoW) with the blazing speed and efficiency of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). That combination enables BTC-S to hit over 10,000 transactions per second with a 2-second finality, while using 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin. More than just tech, Bitcoin Solaris has built its ecosystem to be inclusive. Through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine from smartphones, laptops, and everyday devices—no expensive rigs or technical knowledge required. Bitcoin Was the First Chance. BTC-S Could Be the Second. Ask anyone who bought Bitcoin under $1000 and held on—life was never the same. But what if you had missed that? For many, the answer has been regret. BTC-S aims to rewrite that script. The entry price is still low, and the potential is massive. It’s not a clone. It’s a next-gen system engineered from the ground up. From smart contract flexibility to cross-chain bridges and near-instant scalability, Bitcoin Solaris is positioning itself as a true backbone for Web3 finance and applications. Why Investors Are Flocking In A detailed review by Ben Crypto outlines why BTC-S is on the radar of top crypto voices. Influencers and DeFi enthusiasts are calling it “one of the most promising crypto ecosystems of the year.” Audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins confirm a secure and well-structured codebase that inspires trust. As of now, the presale is in Phase 7, with BTC-S priced at $7. With the launch price locked at $20, investors are looking at a 233% return if they hold until launch. And with only around 7 weeks left, time is tight. Over 11,000 users have already joined, making this one of the shortest and most explosive presales in recent memory. Bitcoin Solaris is now sitting at over $4.1 million raised, and momentum is still climbing. You can learn more and join the presale through Bitcoin Solaris. Technical Brilliance That Translates to Wealth BTC-S isn’t just fast—it’s precise. Behind the scenes, it operates using a hybrid chain architecture: The Base Layer runs PoW for uncompromising security. The Solaris Layer handles high-volume operations using DPoS for scalability. Validators rotate intelligently across both layers, ensuring decentralized consensus and resilience. Smart contracts on Bitcoin Solaris are Rust-based, enabling advanced DeFi features like atomic swaps, liquidity protocols, and cross-chain integration. All while maintaining ultra-low latency and stable execution. A Smarter, Faster, Fairer Bitcoin Is Here—Step Into BTC-S BTC-S also supports liquid staking , offering users the ability to stake without lockups. Tokens are converted 1:1 into sBTC-S, which can still be used across DeFi apps or traded freely. It’s part of the chain’s broader vision of accessible wealth-building. Mining for Everyone: The Heart of BTC-S Perhaps the most radical aspect of BTC-S is how it democratizes mining. Instead of making it exclusive to tech-savvy users with costly setups, the upcoming Solaris Nova App lets you start mining from your mobile or desktop with just a few taps. More than a convenience, it’s a revolution in participation. And thanks to the blockchain’s adaptive consensus design, it remains highly efficient regardless of device. You can even calculate your potential mining earnings here: Bitcoin Solaris Mining Calculator Tokenomics That Inspire Confidence Bitcoin Solaris embraces scarcity and strategic distribution through its structured tokenomics model: Total Supply: 21 million BTC-S 66.66% for mining (spanning 90 years) 20% allocated for presale Remaining split among liquidity, ecosystem, marketing, and rewards Conclusion: Why Bitcoin Solaris Is The Second Chance at Life-Changing Wealth Bitcoin Solaris isn’t chasing hype—it’s building quietly, with purpose. Its advanced tech, mobile mining, and efficient design give everyday users a real opportunity to grow with the network from day one. While headlines focus elsewhere, BTC-S is laying the foundation for something far bigger. For those paying attention, this could be the most important move they make in 2025.

2025-06-13T11:40:39,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index Dips to 61: A Cautionary Tale in the Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index Dips to 61: A Cautionary Tale in the Greed Zone Hey crypto enthusiasts! Let’s talk about market vibes. The latest reading from the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , a popular gauge for tracking Crypto Market Sentiment , shows a slight cooling. As of June 13th, the index registered 61, a noticeable dip of 10 points from the previous day’s reading. Despite this decline, the index remains firmly within the ‘Greed’ territory. But what exactly does this number tell us, and how should you interpret it in the context of the broader market? Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Think of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index as a thermometer for market psychology. Developed by Alternative.me, it aims to quantify the emotional state of cryptocurrency investors and traders. Emotions like fear and greed can heavily influence market movements, often leading to irrational decisions. Extreme fear can signal a potential buying opportunity for those brave enough, while extreme greed might suggest the market is due for a correction. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed A score closer to 0 indicates that investors are highly fearful, likely selling off assets. A score closer to 100 suggests investors are getting overly greedy, potentially buying aggressively and pushing prices unsustainably high. What Factors Influence Crypto Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from analyzing six key factors. Each factor is weighted differently to reflect its perceived impact on overall Crypto Market Sentiment . Understanding these components helps provide a clearer picture of why the index moves the way it does. Here’s a breakdown of the factors: Factor Weighting How it’s Measured Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies compared to their average values. High volatility often indicates increased fear or uncertainty. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and momentum of the market. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greed, while low volume on a dip might indicate fear or lack of interest. Social Media 15% Scans social media platforms (like Twitter) for relevant posts about cryptocurrencies, counting mentions and analyzing sentiment (positive vs. negative). Surveys 15% Gauges public opinion through weekly crypto polls (currently paused). This provides a direct look at investor sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Examines Bitcoin’s share of the total market capitalization. Increasing Bitcoin Dominance can sometimes indicate fear (investors fleeing altcoins for the relative safety of BTC), while decreasing dominance might suggest greed (investors rotating into riskier altcoins). Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google search data for cryptocurrency-related terms. Spikes in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto bubble” can indicate fear, while terms like “buy crypto” or specific altcoin names might signal greed. As noted, the surveys component is currently paused, meaning the index is calculated based on the remaining five factors. The Current State: Why 61 is Still ‘Greed’ The recent drop of 10 points to 61 is significant, indicating a measurable shift in sentiment over a short period. However, 61 still falls comfortably within the 50-74 range, classifying it as ‘Greed’. This suggests that while some of the recent bullish fervor might have subsided, the prevailing mood among investors is still one of optimism and willingness to buy. A reading of 61 could mean several things: Some profit-taking might be occurring after a period of price increases. Recent negative news or a slight market dip might have tempered extreme optimism. The market is still viewed positively, with many expecting further gains, but perhaps with less intensity than when the index was higher (e.g., in the 70s or 80s). It’s a point where the market isn’t overly euphoric (Extreme Greed) but is definitely not fearful. Investors are generally confident, which can keep buying pressure relatively strong. What Does ‘Greed’ Imply for Your Trading Strategy? Being in the ‘Greed’ zone has important implications, especially when developing or adjusting your Trading Strategy . Historically, periods of high greed have sometimes preceded market corrections. This is based on the idea that when everyone is overly optimistic and buying aggressively, the market can become overextended and vulnerable to a sharp downturn. Here’s how you might interpret the current ‘Greed’ reading for your Trading Strategy : Caution is Advised: A high greed score suggests the market might be getting warm. It’s generally not the ideal time for aggressive new long positions, especially for short-term trades. Consider Risk Management: If you have open positions, this might be a good time to tighten stop-losses, take some profits, or reduce position sizes. Look for Confirmation: Don’t rely solely on the index. Use it as one tool among many. Confirm the sentiment with technical analysis (like chart patterns, indicators) and fundamental analysis. Prepare for Volatility: High sentiment periods can often be accompanied by increased Crypto Volatility . Be prepared for potentially larger price swings. Some traders use the index as a contrarian indicator: buying when there is extreme fear and selling (or avoiding buying) when there is extreme greed. A reading of 61 isn’t ‘extreme’ greed, but it’s definitely on the side where caution becomes more important than chasing gains. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance and Crypto Volatility Two significant components of the index are Bitcoin Dominance and Crypto Volatility . Let’s briefly touch upon their influence. An increase in Bitcoin Dominance often happens when altcoins are bleeding value faster than Bitcoin, or when investors are consolidating their positions into the largest, most liquid cryptocurrency during uncertain times. While sometimes interpreted as fear, it can also reflect a strong run-up in Bitcoin itself, which then pulls the overall market sentiment up. Crypto Volatility is a constant factor in the market. High volatility can contribute to either fear (if prices are dropping fast) or greed (if prices are skyrocketing). The index measures this volatility relative to historical averages. If recent price swings have been larger than usual, this factor will likely contribute to a higher score if the movement is upwards (momentum is also strong) or push it towards fear if the movement is downwards. The index’s calculation of 61 incorporates the current state of both Bitcoin Dominance and Crypto Volatility , alongside market momentum, social sentiment, and Google Trends data, to arrive at the overall sentiment score. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights So, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index sitting at 61 in the ‘Greed’ zone, what are some actionable steps you can consider? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the index’s movement daily. A rapid change in either direction can be a strong signal. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current holdings. Are you comfortable with your exposure given the ‘Greed’ sentiment? Set Price Alerts: If you’re waiting for a dip, set alerts for key price levels you’d be interested in buying at. Avoid FOMO: The ‘Greed’ zone is where Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is highest. Stick to your pre-defined Trading Strategy and avoid making impulsive decisions based on hype. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re a long-term investor, DCA can help mitigate the risk of buying at a potential peak during a greed phase. Remember, the index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. It doesn’t predict future price movements with certainty but provides valuable insight into the market’s psychological state, which is a crucial driver of short-to-medium term trends. Conclusion The dip in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index from 71 to 61 signals a slight cooling in market enthusiasm, yet the persistent ‘Greed’ reading suggests investors remain largely optimistic. This current state highlights the ongoing positive sentiment but also serves as a cautionary signal that the market is not in ‘Fear’ territory, where historical opportunities for aggressive buying are often found. By understanding the factors like Bitcoin Dominance and Crypto Volatility that contribute to the index, and integrating this sentiment gauge into your overall Trading Strategy , you can make more informed decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

Through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), the asset management giant has quietly built one of the largest BTC positions in the world. According to fresh data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham Intel, BlackRock now controls 665,938 BTC, currently valued at approximately $69.83 billion as of Friday, June 13, 2025. BlackRock Bitcoin holdings. Source: Arkham That position makes up an estimated 94.8% of BlackRock’s $73.66 billion crypto portfolio, showing a clear focus on Bitcoin over other digital assets, despite the firm’s daily purchases of Ethereum in the last two weeks . BlackRock is now the second-largest holder of Bitcoin globally With this level of accumulation, BlackRock has moved ahead of major players such as Binance and MicroStrategy. Its IBIT fund is now the second-largest holder of Bitcoin globally. Only the legendary wallet linked to Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, holds more. BlackRock’s aggressive move into Bitcoin is part of a broader strategy. The company aims to become the world’s leading crypto asset manager by 2030. In a corporate presentation published Thursday, BlackRock stated its target of managing at least $50 billion in digital assets within the next five years. Bitcoin remains the foundation of this goal. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself continues to attract institutional interest. The cryptocurrency is trading above $104,000 at press time. As regulatory clarity improves and more capital flows into the market, BlackRock’s growing share of Bitcoin ownership may reshape the landscape at the highest levels of global finance.

2025-06-13T11:35:13,"Walmart and Amazon eye dollar-pegged stablecoins to cut payment costs: report","U.S. retail powerhouses Walmart and Amazon are reportedly weighing the launch of their own dollar-pegged stablecoins. Per a June 13 WSJ report , the companies are said to be exploring how stablecoin launch and integration could help streamline payment systems, significantly cut processing fees, and reduce reliance on the traditional banking infrastructure. By issuing their own tokens, both firms could shift massive volumes of daily transactions onto the blockchain, offering more efficient payment flows. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report also noted that other major players, including Expedia Group Inc. and airlines in the United States, are considering similar stablecoin initiatives. You might also like: DTCC joins stablecoin race, awaits clarity from U.S. lawmakers Amazon recently joined tech peers like Microsoft and Meta in opting against the proposal to hold crypto giant Bitcoin in its treasury. The latest report, while brief, suggests that the e-commerce giant likely prefers stablecoins as a more practical and stable path for integrating crypto-like assets into their financial ecosystems. Leading stablecoins USDT ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) have already demonstrated strong utility in global payments. Tether’s USDT recently surpassed $155 billion in circulation and the surge in adoption highlights that the assets can serve as efficient, low-cost alternatives to traditional options. Meanwhile, ride-hailing company Uber also recently signaled interest in the use of stablecoins to streamline global payments. Earlier this month, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi revealed the company is in the “study phase” of evaluating stablecoins as a potential tool for international transactions. E-commerce infrastructure provider Shopify will also reportedly begin allowing merchants to accept payments in USDC starting later this month, as it advances efforts to integrate the stablecoin in collaboration with Coinbase and Stripe. The present total supply of stablecoins exceeds $239 billion, all held across 150 million wallet addresses.
