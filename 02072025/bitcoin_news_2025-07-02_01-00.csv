2025-07-01T22:56:17,"Eurozone Inflation Unveils Urgent Economic Outlook: A 2.0% CPI Deep Dive","BitcoinWorld Eurozone Inflation Unveils Urgent Economic Outlook: A 2.0% CPI Deep Dive The world of finance is a tapestry woven with interconnected threads, where macroeconomic shifts in one region can send ripples across global markets, including the often-volatile cryptocurrency landscape. Recently, a key development emerged from the heart of Europe that warrants close attention: Eurozone inflation experienced a slight climb in June, with the annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) reaching 2.0%. While seemingly a modest figure, this rise carries significant implications for traditional investors, policymakers, and indeed, those navigating the digital asset space. Understanding these shifts is crucial for anticipating market movements and making informed decisions in an increasingly globalized financial ecosystem. Understanding the Latest Eurozone Inflation Figures: What Does 2.0% Mean? The latest data from Eurostat indicates that Eurozone inflation , as measured by the harmonized Consumer Price Index (HICP), reached an annual rate of 2.0% in June. This figure marks a slight increase from previous months and brings the inflation rate precisely in line with the European Central Bank’s (ECB) target. But what exactly does this 2.0% figure represent, and why is it a significant benchmark for the Eurozone economy? Defining CPI: The Consumer Price Index (CPI), or HICP in the Eurozone’s case, is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living. The ECB’s Target: The European Central Bank aims for an inflation rate of 2.0% over the medium term. This target is considered optimal for maintaining price stability while allowing sufficient room for economic growth. An inflation rate too low can signal deflationary pressures, potentially leading to reduced spending and investment, while a rate too high erodes purchasing power. Components of the Rise: The slight climb in June was likely influenced by various factors. Often, energy prices play a significant role due to their volatility, but other components like services and non-energy industrial goods also contribute. Understanding which sectors are driving the increase provides insight into the underlying health and pressures within the economy. For instance, if services inflation is high, it suggests strong domestic demand, whereas energy price rises are often external shocks. How Does a 2.0% Annual CPI Impact Everyday Life and Markets? While 2.0% might seem like a small number, its implications for consumers, businesses, and financial markets are far-reaching. The annual CPI acts as a barometer for the cost of living and directly influences economic behavior. For instance, when prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases, meaning your euro buys slightly less than it did a year ago. Impact on Consumers: Purchasing Power: A 2.0% inflation rate means that on average, goods and services cost 2% more than they did last year. For households, this translates to a subtle erosion of savings if income growth doesn’t keep pace. Cost of Living: Everyday expenses, from groceries to utility bills, gradually increase. While a 2.0% rise might not feel drastic immediately, it compounds over time, affecting household budgets and financial planning. Impact on Businesses: Input Costs: Businesses face higher costs for raw materials, energy, and labor. This can squeeze profit margins if they cannot pass these costs on to consumers. Pricing Strategies: Companies must carefully consider their pricing strategies. Raising prices too much can deter customers, while not raising them enough can impact profitability. Impact on Financial Markets: For investors, a 2.0% CPI reading signals stability but also prompts questions about future central bank actions. Bond yields, equity valuations, and currency exchange rates are all sensitive to inflation data. Higher inflation expectations can lead to higher bond yields as investors demand more compensation for the erosion of their money’s value. This, in turn, can affect borrowing costs across the economy. The ECB’s Dilemma: Navigating Monetary Policy Amidst Rising Prices The European Central Bank (ECB) finds itself in a delicate balancing act. Achieving its 2.0% inflation target is a success, but maintaining it requires careful calibration of monetary policy . The ECB’s primary mandate is price stability, but it also supports the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union, which include sustainable economic growth and high employment. Historically, central banks use several tools to manage inflation: Interest Rates: Raising key interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, which can cool down economic activity and reduce inflationary pressures. Conversely, lowering rates stimulates borrowing and spending. Quantitative Easing (QE) / Tightening (QT): QE involves buying government bonds or other financial assets to inject liquidity into the financial system, while QT involves reducing the size of the central bank’s balance sheet, effectively withdrawing liquidity. Forward Guidance: Communicating future policy intentions to guide market expectations. The challenge for the ECB is to assess whether the current inflation climb is transitory (due to temporary supply chain disruptions or energy price spikes) or more persistent (due to strong demand or wage growth). A misstep in monetary policy – tightening too aggressively could stifle economic recovery, while being too dovish could allow inflation to become entrenched – carries significant risks for the entire Eurozone. How the Eurozone Economic Outlook Influences Global Markets and Crypto The health of the Eurozone economy, as reflected in its economic outlook , has significant ripple effects far beyond its borders. As one of the world’s largest economic blocs, developments here can sway global investor sentiment, currency markets, and even the appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Interconnectedness with Global Economy: Trade Flows: The Eurozone is a major trading partner for many countries. Its economic performance directly impacts global trade volumes and supply chains. Currency Markets: The Euro (EUR) is the second most traded currency globally. Its strength or weakness, often influenced by the economic outlook and interest rate differentials, affects international trade and investment. A stronger Euro makes Eurozone exports more expensive, while a weaker Euro makes them cheaper. Investor Confidence: A stable and growing Eurozone contributes to overall global investor confidence, encouraging investment in various asset classes worldwide. Conversely, economic instability can lead to risk aversion. Implications for Cryptocurrency: While often seen as a separate asset class, cryptocurrencies are not entirely immune to traditional macroeconomic forces. When major economies like the Eurozone show signs of inflation or economic uncertainty, it can influence: Risk Appetite: In times of economic stress or high inflation, investors may shift away from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, towards perceived safe havens. Conversely, a stable economic environment can foster greater risk-taking. Liquidity: Central bank policies, driven by the economic outlook , affect global liquidity. Tighter monetary conditions (e.g., higher interest rates) can reduce the amount of capital available for speculative investments, potentially impacting crypto valuations. Narratives: Persistent inflation in traditional fiat currencies can strengthen the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, potentially attracting new investors to the crypto space, though this is a complex and debated topic. The Potential Impact on ECB Interest Rates and Beyond The 2.0% CPI figure is a critical data point for the European Central Bank’s Governing Council as they deliberate on the future trajectory of ECB interest rates . Reaching the target might suggest less urgency for aggressive rate hikes, but sustained inflation pressures could change that. What to Watch For: Forward Guidance: The ECB’s communication regarding its future policy intentions will be paramount. Any hints about potential rate hikes or adjustments to asset purchase programs will be closely scrutinized by markets. Economic Data Consistency: The ECB will look for consistency in inflation data, wage growth, and overall economic activity before making significant policy shifts. A one-off spike is less concerning than a trend. Global Context: Actions by other major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, can also influence the ECB’s decisions, as coordinated or divergent policies can impact currency valuations and capital flows. Consequences of Rate Changes: Any adjustment to ECB interest rates would have widespread consequences: Borrowing Costs: Higher rates mean more expensive loans for businesses and consumers, affecting everything from mortgages to corporate investments. This can cool demand and inflation. Bond Yields: Government bond yields would likely rise, making it more expensive for Eurozone governments to borrow. Currency Valuation: Higher interest rates typically make a currency more attractive to foreign investors, potentially strengthening the Euro. For the crypto market, higher traditional interest rates can make risk-free assets (like government bonds) more appealing, potentially drawing capital away from more speculative investments. Conversely, if inflation remains high and real returns on traditional assets are negative, it might push some investors towards crypto as an alternative. Conclusion: Navigating the Nuances of Eurozone Inflation The slight climb in Eurozone inflation to an annual CPI of 2.0% in June marks a significant moment, bringing the region’s price growth precisely in line with the European Central Bank’s long-term target. This development underscores the ongoing complexities faced by policymakers as they strive to maintain price stability while fostering sustainable economic growth. The ECB’s careful navigation of its monetary policy will be crucial in determining the future path of ECB interest rates and shaping the broader economic outlook for the Eurozone. For investors, including those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macroeconomic currents is not just an academic exercise; it’s a vital part of risk assessment and opportunity identification. While traditional finance and digital assets operate on different rails, they are undeniably connected by the overarching forces of global liquidity, investor sentiment, and central bank actions. The Eurozone’s inflation story is a compelling chapter in the global economic narrative, demanding continued attention and careful analysis.

The large-cap altcoin, which is heavily incentivized by the mainstream adoption of memecoins and real-world assets tokenization (RWA), dropped over 5 percent in the last 24 hours to trade at about $146.55 on Tuesday, July 1, 2025, during the mid-North American trading session. Institutional Demand Spells Hope for Solana The demand for Solana has grown exponentially in the past year fueled by institutional investors. As Coinpedia noted , the U.S. SEC’s approval of the first Solana ETF product, after the agency gave Grayscale the green light to convert its Grayscale Digital Large Cap (GDLC) Fund into a spot ETF, signaled an imminent approval of the rest of the spot SOL ETF application soon. Due to the growing organic demand for Solana, DeFi Development Corp. (NASDAQ: DFDV) has announced plans to double down on its SOL acquisitions. On Tuesday, DeFi Development Corp. announced it intends to raise $100 million through convertible senior notes due 2030. “The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.00001 per share through the prepaid forward described below. The Company expects to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of SOL,” DeFi Development, noted . What’s Next for SOL Price? As with the rest of the altcoins, the SOL price has ultimately mirrored BTC price action in the recent past. In the daily timeframe, Solana price was rejected from the 50 Moving Average Simple (SMA), thus signaling the bulls have lost initial recovery momentum.

2025-07-01T22:30:05,"Bitcoin Allocation: Anemoi’s Astounding 40% Reserve Boost Signals Institutional Confidence","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Allocation: Anemoi’s Astounding 40% Reserve Boost Signals Institutional Confidence The world of traditional finance is increasingly intersecting with the dynamic realm of cryptocurrencies, and recent moves by major players are painting a clear picture: institutional Bitcoin adoption is no longer a fringe idea, but a growing reality. For those watching the convergence of old money and new assets, Anemoi International’s latest announcement serves as a compelling testament to this evolving landscape. What’s Driving Anemoi International’s Bold Bitcoin Allocation? In a significant development, Anemoi International, a holding company listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), has announced a remarkable increase in its Bitcoin allocation . According to a July 1 press release, the company has elevated the share of its cash reserves dedicated to Bitcoin from an already substantial 30% to approximately 40%. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a decisive strategic shift that underscores a deeper conviction in the digital asset’s long-term value. This move was executed through a specific investment vehicle: the STKd 100% Bitcoin & 100% Gold ETF (BTGD). Why would a traditional holding company make such a pronounced move into a volatile asset like Bitcoin? Several factors likely play a role: Inflation Hedging: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by institutions as a potential hedge against currency debasement, much like gold. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a traditional portfolio offers diversification benefits, as its price movements often correlate differently with traditional assets. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated immense growth potential over the past decade, attracting investors seeking high returns. Long-Term Vision: Anemoi’s increased exposure suggests a belief in Bitcoin’s future as a global reserve asset or a significant component of the digital economy. The Role of the BTGD ETF in Anemoi’s Crypto Investment Strategy Anemoi’s choice to utilize the BTGD ETF for this substantial investment is particularly noteworthy. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) offer a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional institutions to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. The BTGD ETF, specifically, provides a unique proposition by combining exposure to both Bitcoin and Gold. This dual-asset approach within a single ETF might appeal to institutions for several reasons: Feature Benefit for Investors Bitcoin Exposure Access to potential high growth and digital store-of-value characteristics. Gold Exposure Traditional safe-haven asset, offering stability and inflation protection. Regulated Structure Operates within established financial frameworks, offering transparency and oversight. Liquidity Easy to buy and sell on an exchange, unlike direct crypto purchases for large institutions. Simplicity Single investment vehicle for diversified exposure to two key alternative assets. By investing through the BTGD ETF, Anemoi International gains the benefits of both Bitcoin’s innovative digital scarcity and gold’s historical role as a tangible asset, all within a familiar and regulated investment wrapper. This strategy could be seen as a cautious yet progressive approach to digital asset integration. Why is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Gaining Momentum? Anemoi’s decision is not an isolated incident but part of a broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed a growing number of corporations, hedge funds, and even sovereign wealth funds exploring or directly investing in Bitcoin. This shift is driven by several factors: Maturing Market Infrastructure: The development of regulated exchanges, custody solutions, and investment products (like ETFs) has made it safer and easier for institutions to engage with crypto. Increasing Clarity: While regulatory frameworks are still evolving, there’s more clarity and acceptance from governments and financial bodies globally regarding digital assets. Performance Track Record: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin’s long-term performance has consistently outperformed many traditional asset classes, making it attractive for long-term strategic allocations. Changing Perceptions: Bitcoin is increasingly seen not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate technology and a potential future global currency or store of value. This growing institutional interest lends significant credibility to the cryptocurrency space, potentially paving the way for even wider mainstream acceptance and further price appreciation. What Does Anemoi’s Enhanced Bitcoin Allocation Mean for the Market? Anemoi International’s move sends a powerful signal to the market. When a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange significantly increases its Bitcoin allocation , it acts as a strong endorsement. This could encourage other traditional companies and institutional investors to reconsider their own portfolios and potentially allocate a portion to digital assets. The implications are multi-faceted: Increased Demand: More institutional capital flowing into Bitcoin naturally increases demand, which can have a positive impact on its price. Reduced Volatility (Long-Term): As more institutional holders with long-term investment horizons enter the market, it could potentially lead to a more stable price floor, reducing some of Bitcoin’s notorious volatility over time. Validation of Crypto as an Asset Class: Each such announcement further validates Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and investable asset class, moving them away from niche speculation. Innovation in Financial Products: The success of ETFs like BTGD may spur the development of even more sophisticated and diverse crypto-related financial products tailored for institutional needs. However, it’s also crucial to acknowledge that institutional involvement comes with its own set of challenges, including potential for larger market swings due to significant capital movements and increased scrutiny from regulators. Challenges and Considerations for a Robust Crypto Investment Strategy While the benefits of institutional Bitcoin adoption are clear, it’s important to approach a crypto investment strategy with eyes wide open to the inherent challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. While its long-term trend has been upward, sharp corrections are common. Institutions must be prepared for significant price swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the legality or profitability of crypto investments. Security Risks: While ETFs mitigate some direct custody risks, the broader crypto ecosystem still faces security challenges, including hacks and scams. Market Manipulation: The crypto market, while maturing, can still be susceptible to manipulation due to its relatively smaller size compared to traditional markets. Due Diligence: Institutions must conduct thorough due diligence on any crypto-related investment product, understanding its underlying assets, management, and associated risks. Anemoi International’s decision, while bold, likely comes after extensive risk assessment and strategic planning, reflecting a calculated move rather than a speculative gamble. Their reliance on an ETF like BTGD also indicates a preference for managed exposure. Concluding Thoughts: A New Era for Corporate Reserves? Anemoi International’s decision to boost its Bitcoin allocation to 40% of its cash reserves via the BTGD ETF is a powerful indicator of the growing confidence among traditional financial entities in digital assets. This move highlights a shift in corporate treasury management, where Bitcoin is increasingly being considered not just as a speculative play, but as a legitimate component of a diversified reserve strategy. As institutional Bitcoin adoption continues to accelerate, we can expect more companies to follow suit, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position in the global financial landscape. This trend signals a fascinating new era for both corporate finance and the cryptocurrency market, pushing the boundaries of what constitutes a ‘traditional’ investment.

2025-07-01T22:21:57,"Eskom Eyes Bitcoin Mining & AI to Tackle $22.7B Debt – Can the Lights Stay On?","South Africa’s struggling power utility Eskom is considering Bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence (AI), and data centres as part of its long-term strategy to stay afloat, according to group CEO Dan Marokane. Speaking earlier this year at the BizNews Conference, Marokane said the utility is exploring new ways to repurpose its excess electricity capacity as the energy market shifts. He pointed to growing demand in the U.S. from Bitcoin miners and data centres as an indication of where the future might be heading. Inside Eskom’s Strategy to Survive a $22.7 Billion Debt Load Eskom is undergoing a major strategic rethink as it confronts declining electricity sales and a mounting R403 billion ($22.7 billion) debt load. Eskom CEO Dan Marokane recently acknowledged the severity of the crisis, describing it as a “structural decline” driven by the growing adoption of self-generation and independent power producers (IPPs). In 2023 alone, Eskom’s electricity sales dropped by 4%, and the utility anticipates that this downward trend will persist for another three to five years. “The business has to reinvent itself and use part of this baseload in a way that can help it manage the remainder of its debt pile,” Marokane said, hinting at the need to reimagine Eskom’s commercial model. Eskom employees are involved and generating and selling fraudulent prepaid electricity tokens worth billions, causing higher tariffs and likely contributing to past load-shedding. https://t.co/fhGlQQMoNu — MyBroadband (@mybroadband) June 30, 2025 Beyond operational challenges, Eskom faces a deepening financial crisis. The utility’s municipal customers owe an additional R90 billion, and South Africa’s Electricity Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa has warned that Eskom’s total debt could balloon to R3.1 trillion by 2050 if left unchecked. Eskom is exploring alternative uses for its surplus generation capacity. Among the unconventional options being considered are energy-intensive industries such as artificial intelligence data centers and even Bitcoin mining. “We have to be looking at alternatives, and there are exciting opportunities around AI and data centres, but also within the space of Bitcoin,” Marokane noted. Bitcoin mining, though controversial, offers a potential outlet for surplus electricity. In countries like the U.S., crypto miners and AI firms have become major energy consumers. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in 2024 that large-scale computing facilities, including Bitcoin mining operations, are now among the fastest-growing sources of electricity demand, especially in Texas. These facilities often strike deals to reduce usage during high-demand periods, similar to Eskom’s load curtailment program. In one case, Texas-based mining firm Riot Platforms was paid $32 million in 2023 for voluntarily cutting consumption during a heatwave. Eskom said it is looking to replicate this model. But while it plans for an integrated energy-intensive future, South Africa’s grid is reportedly under pressure. Between June 13 and 19 this year, Eskom reported average unplanned outages of 15,076 megawatts, above the 15,000 MW threshold that triggers Stage 2 load-shedding. The utility has so far avoided rotational blackouts but has relied heavily on costly diesel-powered open-cycle gas turbines (OCGTs). Eskom’s OCGT load factor has more than doubled year-over-year, from 5.78% to 11.73%. To date, Eskom has spent R4.51 billion on diesel this financial year, generating 768.64 GWh of electricity. That’s more than double the 378.75 GWh generated during the same period last year. Eskom says diesel usage will likely drop as more power units come back online following long-term maintenance. But for now, it continues to burn fuel to keep the lights on while weighing long-term solutions, including Bitcoin mining and AI, to secure its financial survival. Global Bitcoin Mining Faces Growing Scrutiny Over Energy and Emissions As Eskom prepares a $22.7 billion debt relief plan to stabilize South Africa’s power utility, the global spotlight on energy use, particularly from Bitcoin mining, is intensifying. A 2024 peer-reviewed study in Nature Communications revealed that U.S. Bitcoin mining facilities emit harmful fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across state lines, affecting nearly 2 million people. The 34 largest mining sites consumed 32.3 TWh of electricity, 33% more than Los Angeles, mostly powered by fossil fuels. Pollution hotspots now stretch from New York to Texas, exposing regulatory gaps and health risks. This has reignited global scrutiny on crypto mining’s power demands. While a Cambridge report showed a positive trend —52.4% of Bitcoin mining now uses sustainable energy—natural gas has overtaken coal as the dominant source, showing uneven progress. Meanwhile, the U.S. sector faces new hurdles. Tariffs of up to 36% on imported mining machines , proposed under Trump’s trade policies, have sent shockwaves through the industry.

2025-07-01T22:20:05,"Bitcoin Yield ETP: Unlocking Strategic Returns on the Vienna Stock Exchange","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Yield ETP: Unlocking Strategic Returns on the Vienna Stock Exchange The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and a significant new development is poised to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the innovative realm of cryptocurrency. Asset manager Fineqia has just made headlines by launching a groundbreaking Bitcoin Yield ETP on the prestigious Vienna Stock Exchange. This move isn’t just another product; it’s a strategic play designed to offer investors a targeted 6% annual return, leveraging sophisticated decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies on their Bitcoin holdings. For anyone interested in the future of crypto investments , this is a development worth paying close attention to. What is the Bitcoin Yield ETP and How Does it Work? An Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) is a type of security that tracks an underlying asset, index, or basket of assets. In this case, Fineqia’s new offering is designed to track Bitcoin (BTC) while simultaneously generating yield. But how does it achieve that targeted 6% annual return? The core innovation lies in its approach: Underlying Asset: The ETP is backed by Bitcoin holdings, providing investors with exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Yield Generation: Instead of simply holding BTC, the ETP actively employs decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies. This means the underlying Bitcoin is put to work within the DeFi ecosystem to earn yield, primarily through lending protocols. Targeted Return: The product aims for an impressive 6% annual return. This is a significant figure, especially when compared to traditional fixed-income investments in the current low-interest-rate environment. Accessibility: By being listed on a traditional stock exchange, the ETP makes investing in Bitcoin and earning yield more accessible to a broader range of investors, including institutional players, who might be hesitant to directly engage with complex DeFi protocols or self-custody digital assets. This structure provides a regulated and familiar wrapper for what is essentially a crypto-native yield-generating strategy, making the complex world of DeFi more approachable for mainstream investors seeking passive income from their digital assets. Why is Fineqia Leading This Charge? Fineqia is an asset manager that has been at the forefront of digital asset innovation. Their strategic vision involves creating regulated investment products that bridge the gap between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning digital asset space. This Bitcoin Yield ETP is a testament to their commitment to offering innovative solutions that cater to the evolving needs of investors. By launching such a product, Fineqia positions itself as a pioneer in providing structured, regulated access to the high-growth potential of digital assets, combined with the yield opportunities present in DeFi. Their move signifies a growing confidence from established financial entities in the maturity and potential of the cryptocurrency market. It also highlights a crucial trend: as the crypto space matures, more regulated and compliant products will emerge, offering traditional investors safer avenues to participate. The Significance of the Vienna Stock Exchange Listing The choice of the Vienna Stock Exchange for this launch is not arbitrary; it holds considerable significance. European exchanges, particularly those in countries with progressive regulatory frameworks, are increasingly becoming hubs for digital asset ETPs. Listing on a regulated exchange like Vienna offers several key advantages: Regulatory Clarity: It provides a regulated environment, offering investors a level of protection and transparency that might be perceived as lacking in direct crypto market participation. Accessibility for Traditional Investors: Many institutional investors and even retail investors prefer to access digital assets through familiar brokerage accounts and regulated exchanges rather than directly interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges or DeFi platforms. Market Visibility and Liquidity: A listing on a major stock exchange increases the product’s visibility and can contribute to better liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. Validation of Digital Assets: Each such listing further validates digital assets as a legitimate asset class within the traditional financial system, paving the way for broader adoption. This move on the Vienna Stock Exchange underscores Europe’s proactive stance in embracing digital asset innovation, often providing a clearer regulatory path than other major jurisdictions. It sets a precedent and potentially encourages other exchanges and asset managers to follow suit. Demystifying the DeFi Strategies Behind the Yield The term ‘DeFi strategies’ might sound complex, but at its core, it refers to a set of financial applications built on blockchain technology that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks. For this Bitcoin Yield ETP , the primary strategy involves lending. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Lending Protocols: The ETP’s underlying Bitcoin holdings are deposited into decentralized lending protocols (e.g., Aave, Compound, MakerDAO). Borrower Demand: Other users on these platforms borrow the deposited Bitcoin, typically by providing other cryptocurrencies as collateral. Interest Earned: The borrowers pay interest on their loans, and a portion of this interest is passed back to the lenders (in this case, the ETP). Automated and Transparent: These processes are governed by smart contracts – self-executing agreements coded directly onto the blockchain – ensuring transparency and automation. While DeFi offers attractive yields, it’s important to understand that it comes with its own set of risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities, impermanent loss in liquidity pools (though less relevant for pure lending), and oracle risks. Fineqia’s role would involve careful selection and management of these DeFi protocols to mitigate risks and achieve the targeted return, while also managing the complexities for the end investor. Impact on Broader Crypto Investments Landscape Fineqia’s launch of this Bitcoin Yield ETP marks a significant milestone for the broader crypto investments landscape. It represents a maturation of the market, offering sophisticated yet accessible products that cater to diverse investor needs. Here’s how it impacts the space: Benefits for Investors: Regulated Access: Provides a familiar and regulated pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin and its yield-generating potential. Passive Income Stream: Offers a compelling opportunity for investors to earn a targeted 6% annual return on their Bitcoin holdings, making their digital assets work for them. Diversification: For those already holding traditional assets, it offers a way to diversify into digital assets while benefiting from the innovation in the DeFi space without direct interaction. Reduced Operational Burden: Investors don’t need to manage private keys, navigate DeFi protocols, or worry about the technical complexities of yield farming themselves. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: While the ETP aims for a yield, the underlying asset (Bitcoin) remains highly volatile. The value of the ETP will still be significantly influenced by BTC price movements. DeFi Risks: Despite Fineqia’s management, inherent risks of DeFi, such as smart contract bugs, protocol hacks, and liquidity risks, are still present at the underlying level. Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory landscape for crypto ETPs and DeFi is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the product. Fees: ETPs typically come with management fees, which will reduce the net yield for investors. Actionable Insights for Potential Investors: Before considering any investment, especially in emerging asset classes, due diligence is paramount. If Fineqia’s Bitcoin Yield ETP piques your interest, consider the following: Understand the Product: Read the prospectus carefully to understand the exact mechanisms, risks, and fees associated with the ETP.

2025-07-01T22:01:09,"Here’s the $255,000,000,000 Threat That Visa and Mastercard Are Facing Right Now, According to Insiders: Report","Payment giants Visa and Mastercard are reportedly gearing up to fend off a quarter-trillion-dollar threat against their business models. Bloomberg reports that executives at the two companies – which are a combined $1.1 trillion in market capitalization – are preparing for the continued rise of stablecoins, which drastically lower the cost of everyday transactions for both giants’ customers. Jack Forestell, chief product and strategy officer at Visa, says that in prior disruptions, such as mobile wallets and buy-now-pay-later apps, corporate adaptation ultimately prevailed. “We’ve been tokenizing access to value for a very long time now… Now the value that underlies that token, by and large, is either bank accounts or credit lines, debit and credit cards, but there’s absolutely no reason that can’t be a stablecoin or another cryptocurrency… When you’re crypto natives, you can send money back and forth, but if you want to use that in a broad scale manner for your everyday purposes, you need that hyperscale connectivity, and we provide the best onramp to that.” And Jorn Lambert, chief product officer at Mastercard, says that the rise of stablecoins more so represents new “opportunities” rather than a threat of replacement. “We shouldn’t assume that overnight, stablecoins will replace existing card payments or fiat… We think this is much more about new use cases and new opportunities than about replacing the existing system, especially in remittances, disbursements and business-to-business payments.” According to data from CoinGecko, the current market cap of all stablecoins in circulation is over $255 billion. According to last month’s report from The Wall Street Journal, anonymous people familiar with the matter said that some of the world’s largest retailers are considering issuing their very own dollar-pegged crypto assets in the US in an effort to save billions of dollars in transaction fees. Walmart, Amazon, Expedia and unnamed airline companies were among those listed in the WSJ report.

2025-07-01T22:00:59,"MARA Holdings Sees Low BTC Mining Production In June: Report","MARA Holdings, a leading Bitcoin mining company, has shared its operational update for June 2025. The company reported a noticeable drop in Bitcoin production for the month, reflecting some of the ongoing challenges in the mining space. Despite the dip, MARA remains focused on its long-term strategy. It plans to keep expanding its mining capacity and energy infrastructure as part of its broader goal to lead in the fast-growing Bitcoin mining industry. Bitcoin Mining Drops 25% in June In June, MARA mined 713 Bitcoin, down 25% from May. The company stated that this was due to short-term operational issues. The crypto miner reported that adverse weather conditions affected operations, resulting in reduced uptime. Additionally, the company had to temporarily use older machines at its Garden City site while storm damage was being repaired. This further affected its monthly output expectation. Beyond these external factors, the company also experienced natural fluctuations in block rewards. Meanwhile, block reward reduction is a common phenomenon in Bitcoin mining, and it is known to impact mining production. MARA Eyes Growth as Hash Rate and Reward Slip In June, MARA’s energized hash rate dropped slightly to 57.4 EH/s, down from 58.3 EH/s in May. The company’s share of total mining rewards also fell from 6.5% to 5.4%. These shifts highlight how challenging it can be to remain efficient as the Bitcoin network becomes increasingly competitive . Still, MARA is aiming high, with plans to reach a hash rate of 75 EH/s by the end of 2025. That would be over 40% more than last year, made possible by new mining machines the company has already ordered. MARA’s mining efforts are powered by 1.1 gigawatts (GW) of active energy, drawn from a total capacity of 1.7 GW. This robust energy supply is crucial to supporting the company’s ambitious expansion plans. MARA Continues HODLing Strategy Despite Lower Output Even with a drop in production, MARA remains confident in its long-term Bitcoin plans and continues to add to its BTC holdings . By the end of June, the company held 49,940 BTC. Importantly, MARA did not sell any of its digital assets during the month. The Bitcoin miner remains committed to its “hodl” approach as seen in past strategies. However, it is important to note that the total Bitcoin stash is not fully available to the company. Approximately 15,534 BTC, or about 31% of the total holdings, is currently loaned out, used as collateral, or held in managed accounts. This setup is part of MARA’s broader plan to manage risk while striking a balance between liquidity and long-term growth.

2025-07-01T22:00:38,"Crypto Shake-Up: TON Holds $7, ADA Eyes $0.78, But Unstaked Dominates with $3 Projection & $10.6M Presale!","Toncoin has settled near the $7 level, while Cardano stays afloat above its $0.63 support zone. Toncoin’s tight range between $6.90 and $7.10 shows buyers stepping in. ADA, meanwhile, is holding up and could push toward $0.78 if current momentum builds. While both coins are getting attention, another name is gaining traction under the radar. Unstaked ($UNSD) is still below $0.02, but the project is offering more than hype. It’s creating a system where AI agents built by users run tasks and earn on-chain rewards. These agents rely on $UNSD to function, which drives daily demand. With each new AI tool launched, token usage increases, reducing supply. Forecasts suggest this project could climb past $3, meaning current prices offer a massive upside. For those searching for real use cases and early access, this could be the moment before it takes off. Early Access to Utility? Unstaked Ready for a $3 Climb! Unstaked is in the early growth stage that many top performers start from, with quiet traction, low entry, and a working model. Its platform lets users build AI agents that operate inside Telegram, Discord, and X (formerly Twitter). These tools aren’t just bots; they generate earnings. To operate them, users need $UNSD, which links every action to the token demand. As more users come in, the supply naturally gets tighter. It’s still under $0.02, but projections now show that $3 could be within reach. What makes this project different is the direct connection between use and token flow. There’s no pump cycle here, just a system designed to grow through utility. Once the AI agents officially launch after the presale ends, daily token use will start. That’s when price movement could accelerate fast, the kind of moment where charts begin their upward curve. Currently, Unstaked is in stage 22 of its presale. It has already raised over $10.6 million, selling more than 1.2 billion tokens. The price is now $0.01209, with the exchange listing fixed at $0.1819. That means there’s a built-in path to over 15x for early entries. No VC rounds. No private deals. Just a public rollout with smart contracts and open access. In a space filled with copycat tokens and recycled ideas, Unstaked is building something fresh: AI tools that actually do something, and a token that powers the system. It may not be trending yet, but the mechanics behind it are worth paying attention to. Toncoin Holds $7 as Buyers Defend the Key Zone Toncoin is staying close to the $7 level. It’s trading in a tight zone from $6.95 to $7.10, with some mild upward bias. The $7 mark is acting like a support line, and if price holds while volume picks up, there’s potential to move toward $7.50 or even $8. Analysts are watching for signs from Bitcoin and Ethereum, as any strong push from the majors could carry TON with them. That said, there’s hesitation in the air. A rejection near $7.20 might push Toncoin back down to the $6.70–$6.80 area. So far, any drop below $7 has brought buyers back in, keeping the token in play. Although there’s no explosive rally yet, the setup is clean. Traders looking for short-term breakout setups are keeping a close eye on this range. A bump in volume could be all it takes to trigger a quick move. Will ADA Reclaim $0.78? All Eyes on Whale Buys Cardano is trading just above key support, hovering around $0.63. After failing to clear the $0.70 barrier, ADA fell back but managed to stay above $0.62. As long as this support level holds, bulls could aim for a move back up to $0.74 and $0.78. A close above $0.74 might even open a short run to $0.80. Whale accumulation has added fuel to this zone. Over 310 million ADA were scooped up in June, suggesting strong hands are building positions here. Still, there’s downside risk. If $0.62 breaks, ADA might revisit $0.50, a key Fibonacci retracement level. Mid-term price models place Cardano between $0.68 and $1.01 by late summer, depending on sentiment. Longer projections show targets of $1.88 or even $2.36 by 2025, but that journey depends on renewed momentum. For now, it’s holding steady, but the spark hasn’t hit just yet. Looking Ahead Toncoin is trying to stay above $7, while ADA clings to its $0.63 base. Both are holding steady, not crashing, not flying, just moving sideways. That opens space for something new to step in. Unstaked is doing just that. It’s more than another presale. Unstaked has real utility and a clear design. The $UNSD token runs the network’s AI agents, and those agents go live after launch. The listing price is locked at $0.1819, giving plenty of room to move, and long-term forecasts now stretch as far as $3. While Toncoin and Cardano get the headlines, Unstaked might be the sleeper pick. The price is still low, the noise is still minimal, and the opportunity is still open. For those scanning the market for something early, something useful, and something poised, Unstaked may be that window.

2025-07-01T21:10:00,"Not all Bitcoin holding firms will avoid death spiral, new report says","Nearly 200 companies now hold billions in Bitcoin, but a new report cautions that only a few can avoid the dangers of a potential death spiral. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) corporate adoption is accelerating fast, with nearly 200 entities now holding over 3 million BTC on their balance sheets. But as new players seem to rush in, only those who can skillfully grow their Bitcoin holdings per share are more likely to survive the risks ahead. As of May 2025, about 199 entities reportedly hold 3.01 million BTC, roughly $315 billion at current prices. Among these, 147 companies — both private and public — hold around 1.1 million BTC, valued at $115 billion. And this isn’t static. Since early 2024, Bitcoin held by such entities has more than doubled. Corporate Bitcoin adoption among different entities | Source: Breed.VC The story here isn’t just about accumulation, but about how companies whose main purpose is to hold Bitcoin are being valued differently, say analysts at Breed.VC. Think of these as Bitcoin holding companies — Strategy is the poster child. A new report highlights that for these firms, survival and success depend on commanding what’s called the Multiple on Net Asset Value, or shortly MNAV. Essentially, this is a premium investors pay above the Bitcoin value on the books. Wait and see But this premium, the report explains, “hinges on trust in and execution by the core team.” It’s not just about owning Bitcoin; investors want to see these firms execute a playbook that grows Bitcoin holdings per share faster than anyone could by simply holding Bitcoin on their own. Bitcoin holdings and MNAV | Source: Breed.VC Strategy currently dominates with about 580,000 BTC, over half of all corporate-held Bitcoin, valued around $60 billion. Yet its market capitalization sits at $104 billion, giving it an MNAV of about 1.7 times. Historically, Strategy’s 2x MNAV has been the gold standard. The report outlines three main levers Strategy has used since 2020: Issuing convertible debt with low coupons, which converts to equity only if the share price jumps substantially, protecting shareholders from dilution unless performance warrants it. Running at-the-market stock issuance programs, allowing them to sell new shares when the price exceeds MNAV and then dollar-cost average into more Bitcoin. Reinvesting all free cash flow from legacy businesses into buying spot Bitcoin. Others are watching and learning. New entrants are adopting and tweaking this approach, some even enabling Bitcoin holders to swap coins for shares without triggering capital gains, or acquiring undervalued businesses and turning that value into Bitcoin. Others pursue distressed Bitcoin litigation claims or raise capital via PIPE deals, apparently navigating regulatory grey areas to their advantage. You might also like: Strategy joins Russell Top 200 Value Index with $64b BTC on the books The roster of Bitcoin treasury players is growing fast. Over 40 companies have announced Bitcoin treasury strategies in the first half of 2025 alone, raising tens of billions to back these moves. These firms come from all over: Metaplanet from Japan is capitalizing on low interest rates there, Semler Scientific and GameStop in the U.S. have pivoted their treasuries, and pure-play firms like Twenty One Capital — backed by Tether and Cantor — are also in the mix. Contagion risk Yet, despite all the optimism, the report cautions that “nothing in finance is bulletproof,” especially in this space. Strategy itself faced a brutal stress test during the 2022–23 bear market. Bitcoin’s price plummeted 80%, the MNAV premium collapsed, and capital dried up. Though the company survived, the threat is clear. Crypto treasury company death spiral | Source: Breed.VC An extended bear market combined with looming debt maturities could force firms to sell Bitcoin to meet obligations, potentially triggering a vicious cycle of price drops and forced sales. This risk is said to be particularly acute for newer companies lacking Strategy’s scale and reputation. They often raise capital on tougher terms with higher leverage, which in downturns could accelerate margin calls and distressed selling, amplifying market pressure. The report predicts that “when failures inevitably hit, the strongest players are likely to acquire distressed companies and consolidate the industry.” “Fortunately, contagion risk is muted because most financing is equity-based; however, companies that rely heavily on debt pose a greater systemic threat.” Breed.VC Looking ahead, the Bitcoin treasury company model appears to be just getting started, and not only for Bitcoin. The playbook is already spreading to other crypto assets. For example, Solana has DeFi Development Corp, which holds over 420,000 SOL and is valued around $100 million, and Ethereum has SharpLink Gaming, which raised $425 million in a round led by Consensys. The report expects this trend to grow globally, with more companies chasing higher leverage to amplify success. However, it also foresees that “most will fail.” In that shakeout, only a handful will maintain a lasting MNAV premium through “strong leadership, disciplined execution, savvy marketing, and distinctive strategies.” In short, the game is evolving. Bitcoin treasury firms aren’t just holders anymore as they are becoming their own breed of companies, entities that must demonstrate skill and discipline to outperform the market they invest in.

2025-07-01T21:08:43,"Wall Street Just Gave XRP a Seat at the Table With Latest Grayscale Announcement","The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved the conversion of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund into an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This significant regulatory decision allows the fund to be publicly traded on traditional financial markets while offering exposure to a basket of digital assets. According to the announcement posted by crypto enthusiast Amelie, the ETF will include several prominent cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). XRP’s Inclusion Marks a Significant Development The inclusion of XRP in this ETF has attracted considerable attention within the cryptocurrency community. The decision is particularly significant given XRP’s lengthy history of regulatory scrutiny in the United States. Many market observers interpret this as a major milestone for XRP, considering the asset has faced multiple legal and regulatory challenges over recent years. Amelie’s post highlighted the importance of this development, particularly for XRP holders and the broader crypto ecosystem. Community Reactions Reflect Market Sentiment Several cryptocurrency commentators responded to the announcement. An X user named X Finance Bull remarked that while the list of assets in the ETF is strong, the presence of XRP holds special significance, especially in light of the hurdles it has faced. This sentiment underscores how the regulatory clarity around XRP evolves in the U.S. financial landscape. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another X user, FairyFrens, described the development as a pivotal moment for XRP. Their comment emphasized that fund conversions of this nature often reshape the structure and dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. They also questioned how other financial funds might respond following this approval, suggesting that it could influence broader trends in digital asset investment vehicles. Isabel, another participant in the discussion, emphasized the macroeconomic implications of the SEC’s approval. She noted that the U.S. economy is currently experiencing a downturn. In her view, this decision could serve as a catalyst to attract global capital inflows into the U.S. financial system. Isabel argued that the ETF, including XRP, has the potential to inject vitality into related industries, contribute to economic growth, and create employment opportunities within the digital economy. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market The SEC’s decision to approve the conversion of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund into an ETF represents an important step in the continued integration of digital assets into traditional financial markets. This approval not only reinforces the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum but also elevates XRP’s standing in regulated investment products. The move could potentially pave the way for further adoption of cryptocurrency ETFs that incorporate a diversified range of assets. The regulatory validation also signals a shift in how U.S. authorities are approaching the crypto sector. By allowing XRP to be part of a publicly traded ETF, the SEC indirectly acknowledges its role as a legitimate asset in diversified investment portfolios.

2025-07-01T21:00:08,"Solana Hits New Milestone: Wallets Holding 0.1+ SOL Reach Record High","Solana has returned to the spotlight as speculation around a potential Solana ETF approval gains momentum. While still unconfirmed, growing signals from market insiders suggest that regulatory green lights may not be far off. If approved, a Solana ETF would mark a major milestone for the ecosystem, opening the door to traditional capital flows and broader institutional exposure, similar to what Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced following their own ETF breakthroughs. For long-term investors, this development could set the foundation for a new phase of sustainable growth. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh data from Glassnode, which shows that the number of wallets holding over 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high. This milestone marks an increase in retail participation and growing confidence in Solana’s long-term potential. As the network continues to mature, the rise in small holders also signals expanding grassroots adoption—an encouraging sign during a period of market uncertainty. While short-term price action may still be driven by broader macro trends, sentiment around Solana is clearly improving. If ETF approval becomes a reality, the combination of increased accessibility and rising on-chain adoption could significantly boost Solana’s market position in the coming months. Solana Growing On-Chain Adoption Solana is currently trading below the $150 mark after experiencing a sharp retracement from its May high. The asset has lost more than 20% in value since peaking earlier this cycle, driven largely by broader market consolidation and declining risk appetite across altcoins. Despite the recent pullback, SOL continues to hold a strong support zone near the $135–$140 range, which has proven resilient during previous sell-offs. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, noting that a sustained push above key supply zones—particularly the $155–$165 range—could reignite bullish momentum. However, the market remains in a phase of indecision. Price action across major assets, including Solana, reflects uncertainty as traders wait for a clear breakout or breakdown to confirm the next move. Without a strong catalyst, SOL may continue to consolidate alongside the broader altcoin market. Amid the sideways price action, one encouraging signal is the growing on-chain adoption. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared data from Glassnode showing that the number of wallets holding over 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high, now exceeding 11.44 million. This steady rise in non-zero wallets points to expanding retail participation and long-term holder confidence, even as short-term volatility persists. = 0.1 | Source: Ali Martinez on X"" width=""860"" height=""484"" srcset=""https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/btc.jpeg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/btc.jpeg?w=750 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/btc.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/btc.jpeg?w=860 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/btc.jpeg?w=1140 1140w"" sizes=""(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"" loading=""lazy""/> The divergence between price action and user adoption suggests that Solana’s fundamental growth remains intact. If momentum returns and macro conditions improve, Solana may be well-positioned for a breakout, especially with ETF rumors fueling speculative interest. For now, the $150 level remains a psychological pivot as the market watches for signs of direction. SOL Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $149.30, just below the key resistance confluence of the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, all clustered between $150 and $151. This area has acted as a strong technical barrier, and SOL’s repeated failure to reclaim it reflects the market’s hesitancy amid broader uncertainty. After rallying to $159.99 earlier in the session, bears stepped in and pushed the price back down, closing the candle with a bearish wick, signaling ongoing selling pressure. The chart reveals a prolonged consolidation pattern that has developed since the mid-May rejection near $180. Despite several bounce attempts, SOL has not been able to regain bullish momentum. The volume profile also suggests fading interest during upswings, a common trait during accumulation or exhaustion phases. Notably, price remains above the March low, preserving a key higher low structure, which is crucial for the broader bullish outlook. If SOL breaks above the $151–$155 range with sustained volume, it could trigger a move toward $180. However, failure to clear this resistance might lead to another test of support around $135. Traders should watch for a decisive close above the moving average cluster to confirm trend continuation, especially with ETF speculation fueling long-term optimism.

The launchpad is ready, but without an upward move in volume, the breakout could face rejection at the resistance zone. Pinnacle_Crypto revealed that XRP is showing a bullish setup on the daily chart, currently trading within a descending wedge pattern, a formation associated with trend reversals and breakouts. The price has bounced strongly from the key support zone near $2.10, which also aligns with the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a technical level that acts as a dynamic support in trending markets. Currently, XRP is aiming for a 25% move to the upside, with the next resistance target at around $2.85. A break above the descending wedge resistance could confirm the move and trigger further upside. It is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, a setup that precedes high-volatility breakouts. Price action is tightening, and with each dip bought up, FOMOwiz outlined that buying pressure is increasing, pointing to ongoing accumulation. Momentum is building as altcoin compresses near the triangle. The structure suggests that a breakout is looming, and if bulls seize control, the price could surge toward the resistance at $3.35. Triangle Pressure Building — XRP Prepping For A Breakout XRP is in a critical accumulation phase on the 2-day chart, coiling within a massive triangle. This pattern is tightening price action where buyers and sellers reach a temporary balance, and heavy accumulation suggests that smart money is preparing for a move. CRYPTOMOJO_TA mentioned that Q3 is underway, and momentum could pick up dramatically, propelling price toward the $4.60 resistance level. Another analyst, James, pointed out a striking similarity between the 2-week chart and the patterns observed during the 2017 bull run. The structure mirrors the giant accumulation triangle that formed back then, followed by a breakout pump that surges price into new highs , the same symmetrical triangle re-accumulation is now taking shape . Based on the chart pattern, James anticipates a final pump in price targeting a range between $4.5 and $5.4.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-gearing-up-for-another-surge-the-4-hour-chart/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|CRYPTOMOJO_TA|FOMOwiz|James|Pinnacle_Crypto|SquirtleCharts|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-01T20:50:31,"Connecticut Governor signs bill banning public officers from using BTC and other crypto assets","The Governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont, has banned public officers from using Bitcoin and other crypto assets. In a bill signed June 30th, the governor also prevented the state’s storage, exchange, and transactions. The law, now known as House Bill 7082 or Public Act 25‑66, passed the state House and Senate without opposition as the House voted 148–0, and the Senate voted 36–0 to go through easily. However, some believe the acceleration to the bill’s passing is not unconnected to the Democrats’ overwhelming majority in Connecticut, especially amid the consistent criticism of President Trump’s involvement with memecoins and digital finance since he came on board as President. This criticism likely influenced the state’s decision to regulate cryptocurrencies more strictly. The bill, which was referred to the House Committee on Banking in February 2025, was passed on June 30th and will come into full effect from October 1st, 2025. Democrats dominate the Connecticut legislature (Source: Bitcoin King on X) The law stated new rules for crypto businesses to follow, which include that any entity trading virtual currencies, including crypto transactions, digital wallets, and Bitcoin Exchanges, must get a license from the State Banking Commissioner. Such entities must also explain clear risk warnings to consumers, issue receipts after each transaction, and strictly follow anti‑money‑laundering rules. If they allow minors to trade, they must have gotten their parents’ consent beforehand. Connecticut’s conservative stance on crypto and Bitcoin investments and trading is coming after several of its neighbouring states in the US continue to support creating a Bitcoin reserve to hold a portion of their wealth. Supporters say the law will protect citizens from exploitation and risks According to supporters of the law, House Bill 7082 is meant to help protect users from being exploited due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, especially for underage people. Also, the law is created to help protect Connecticut’s money and resources from unnecessary risks. However, industry enthusiasts do not agree, noting that while the law might protect citizens due to the unregulated side of crypto, if not done carefully, it could stifle innovation in a growing creative industry. Others are more critical of the move, describing it as an action that will hurt taxpayers. Meanwhile, some believe the law is simply a statement and the state will eventually reverse its decision in the next few years once it sees its costs. Crypto attorney Aaron Brogan is among those who think the law does nothing of substance in the long run. Connecticut says No, when other US states are saying Yes With Connecticut deciding to ban its government from using or investing in Cryptocurrency, it is going away from what other neighbouring and high-profile states are doing. Most of these states already use Bitcoin as a store of value and investment for their assets. In June, Texas made a bold move in crypto. Its governor, Greg Abbot, ratified a bill known as Senate Bill 21 that allows Texas to create a strategic reserve for Bitcoin . This immediately made Texas the latest US state to create a Bitcoin Reserve while officially allocating $10 million to Bitcoin. According to its lawmakers, this prepares the state for the inevitable future of digital finance, where it will become a part and parcel of its economy and the global economy. They also believe this step will help protect their funds from inflation and instability, which will help grow Texas financially in the long run. Arizona and New Hampshire have passed similar bills to set up a strategic Bitcoin and digital assets reserve fund, which their lawmakers believe will help them stay ahead of new technologies and not get left behind. Interestingly, New Hampshire also has laws that support using digital assets as innovation tools to bring financial freedom.

The European fintech announced on July 1, 2025, noting that it was integrating Chainlink ( LINK ), with the strategic aim of bolstering interoperability . Chainlink’s cross chain standard, CCIP, will enable more than $380 million of its institutional-grade onchain money market funds to be accessible to users much more easily and compliantly. “Until now, Spiko MMFs were deployed natively across multiple networks — but investors couldn’t move their shares from one chain to another. The only workaround was to redeem on Network A and re-subscribe on Network B — a clunky, time-consuming, and costly process. That’s officially a thing of the past,” Spiko posted on X. In this case, CCIP will power Spiko’s regulated money market funds, with these MMFs approved by France’s markets regulator. Chainlink will offer the cross-chain interoperability solution that will benefit users looking to tap into traditional financial instruments on-chain.

The two assets, backed by euro and U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills, are the first EU-approved USD- and EUR-denominated money market funds whose shares are issued as fungible tokens on a public blockchain. It’s part of the massive tokenization trend currently being witnessed across the world. “By integrating CCIP, we’re extending our tokenized money market funds across chains while maintaining the compliance and operational standards required by institutional investors,” said Paul-Adrien Hyppolite, co-founder and chief executive officer of Spiko. Spiko aims to use Chainlink to scale access to its funds, with regulatory and operational standards around identity verification checks, such as know your customer and anti-money laundering. CCIP integration sees Spiko tap into another key blockchain-powered solution after the platform adopted Chainlink SmartData to offer real-time NAV reporting. Chainlink continues to attract massive adoption initiatives as its solutions power growth and traction for projects across decentralized finance, banking, and real-world assets, among others.

2025-07-01T20:30:18,"MiCA regulations caused 82% of crypto media sites in Europe to lose traffic in Q1 2025","Crypto news sites across Europe lost visibility fast in the first three months of 2025 after MiCA rules kicked in. According to a detailed report from Outset, over 80% of crypto-native media in the region saw traffic fall. While MiCA mainly targets crypto service providers, not publishers, the rules swept up media outlets anyway, especially those running sponsored posts, affiliate links, or anything remotely promotional without the right disclaimers. In January, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) warned that even editorial content must be stripped of investment talk unless licenses are in place. Google responded quickly. Pages without proper disclaimers or jurisdiction tags got buried. Sites outside the EU weren’t safe either if their content targeted Europe in German, French, Dutch, or Spanish. The traffic drops weren’t just algorithmic. Geopolitical tensions and the broader crypto market downturn made the hits worse. Germany issued threats, and traffic collapsed anyway Germany had 34 crypto-native media outlets. By February, 21 of them were down. BaFin, the country’s regulator, issued public warnings about unlicensed “investment-like” promotion. Coin-Update lost over 51%. Krypto Magazin fell 45%. Cointelegraph Germany plunged 63%. March didn’t fix much—half the German outlets were still dropping. A few sites fought back with disclaimers and legal fine print. BitcoinBlog.de bounced up 47.4% in March. Krypto News and Kryptozeitung also posted small rebounds. Others stayed down for the count. The few winners—CryptoMonday, Blockzeit, CoinJournal DE, and Crypto Valley Journal—used stronger legal tagging and multilingual coverage. In total, just 9 German-language sites recorded any growth that quarter. CoinJournal DE benefited from its ownership by Investoo Group, a UK firm that owns a bunch of multilingual crypto sites optimized for SEO and local compliance. In 2020, Investoo added CoinJournal to its portfolio and later merged bitcoinmag.de into it. The combined traffic and shared legal infrastructure helped them hold steady during the crackdown. Other former Investoo brands like Kryptoszene.de, now independent, still saw growth. It probably pivoted to niche German-first content after the split. Blockchain Stories DE and Block-Builders.de also grew across the quarter. French outlets fell hard while only a few climbed back up France had 25 crypto-dedicated media outlets at the start of Q1. Most dropped. The Blog lost nearly 72%. Coinhouse, CryptoNews France, and Conseils Crypto each lost around 40%. Cointelegraph France underperformed even though it’s tied to Frekaz Group, which also owns Cointribune. Cointribune held up better, mostly due to its structure as a hybrid VC-media startup under Frekaz. But it wasn’t immune to search penalties. Franchise models, like Cointelegraph’s French edition, struggled more—limited backend access and lower investment in SEO made a difference. By March, things improved a bit. Stelareum climbed back up 9%. Blockchain France grew 72.64%. InvestX jumped 60.71%. Cryptoast and Bitcoin.fr also showed mild gains. In total, only four French outlets finished the quarter with stable growth: ActuCrypto.info, Blockchain France, The Market Periodical, and InvestX. All of them leaned on compliance tools, clear risk language, and wider language support. The Netherlands and Belgium didn’t pass new crypto media laws, but that didn’t protect anyone from Google. Dutch-speaking outlets took heavy hits in February. Out of 21 sites, over 76% lost traffic. Bitcoinexchangenederland.nl got wrecked—down 92.96%. Bitcoin Koers dropped more than 50%. Crypto Insiders fell even without regulatory pressure. The same pattern held in Spain and Italy. Spanish outlets were hit by the late 2024 ad rules from CNMV. By February, 70% had traffic losses. CriptoPasion dropped nearly 47%. Cointelegraph ES and BeInCrypto’s Spanish edition both lost around 20%. Bit2Me News was the outlier, up 149.40% after a spike in March. The rest stayed down. Italy also saw 70% of crypto media lose ground. The Cryptonomist dropped 42%. Cointelegraph Italy fell 46%. Only Borsainside grew. CONSOB’s early 2025 advisories didn’t help, especially for influencer-linked platforms. The UK wasn’t even part of MiCA , but got slammed anyway. The FCA started enforcing its own crypto ad rules in January. Five UK-facing crypto outlets were tracked. The Market Periodical and MyCryptoSpaceUK posted gains, but they were small—MyCryptoSpaceUK stayed under 10K monthly visits. Bitcourier and Cryptouk.io failed to recover. The Crypto Adviser surged in March, up 162.18%, but still couldn’t hit 4K visits. Q1 ended with 81.61% of crypto-native publishers in Europe down. January started with 26.57M visits across all outlets. By March, it was 22.22M. That’s a 16.37% drop in just two months. Only 16 outlets gained any traction, and just half of those had steady growth month to month. Traffic across Europe was mostly concentrated in a handful of sites. BTC Echo, Crypto Insiders, Cointribune, Bitcoin Magazine, Cointelegraph ES, and Newsbit’s Dutch and German versions had over 1M monthly visits. They made up 60% of all crypto media traffic. Lower-tier sites—those under 100K visits—added up to just 6.24% of the region’s traffic. Mid-level outlets filled in the rest. Germany and France led the region in audience. Italy and the UK underperformed. Belgium split between Dutch and English sites. Portugal had zero crypto-native publications. Meanwhile, mainstream financial sites outperformed crypto media. Of 46 broader media outlets, 25 gained traffic. Sites like Investing.com and Finanzen.net got over 100M visits combined. In Germany, 24% of top-performing generalist outlets were based locally. Italy’s big players—like FinanzaOnline—brought in millions. Spain’s finance media also held up. Only 32% of those mainstream finance outlets were consistently in Google Discover. Sites like boursier.com, finanzen.at, and es.investing.com were regulars. Nine of those broke 1M visits. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-01T20:10:02,"€748 billion UniCredit reveals capital protected Bitcoin ETF","Italy’s second-largest bank, UniCredit SpA has launched a capital investment certificate spanning a five-year time period. The product is tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). It appears that European banks are ready to move beyond their skepticism of cryptocurrencies and start participating meaningfully in the digital asset market as UniCredit SpA, one of Europe’s largest banking institutions with €748B ($881B) in assets, launches a new structured product tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The product is exclusively targeted at professional clients and offers full capital protection at maturity. The five-year, dollar-denominated investment certificate will mirror the performance of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF. UniCredit reveals capital protected Bitcoin ETF According to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News and confirmed by UniCredit, the certificate guarantees 100% capital protection at maturity while capping the maximum return at 85% of the ETF’s performance. The product is set to be available for subscription from July 1 to July 28, with a minimum investment requirement of $25,000. While capped returns may not appeal to high-risk traders, they offer a palatable entry point for investors still wary of the notorious volatility of cryptocurrencies. This kind of investment structure is often called a “capital-protected note,” and it is typically used in volatile or emerging asset classes where investor confidence may be low. “We are seeing increasing interest from professional investors in instruments tied to emerging asset classes such as cryptocurrencies,” Chicco di Stasi, UniCredit’s head of Group Investment Product Solutions and Equity & Credit Sales and Trading, said. “With this product, we offer our professional clients a distinctive solution — the first of its kind in Italy.” Bitcoin has outperformed much of the broader crypto market in 2025, and has gained approximately 14% year-to-date, while many smaller tokens have experienced steep losses. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) , launched by BlackRock, has played a pivotal role in mainstreaming Bitcoin investment. Since its approval by U.S. regulators in January 2024, the ETF has grown to over $75B in assets under management, making it one of the most successful exchange-traded funds of all time. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also launched a separate Bitcoin ETP in Europe. Italian and European banks consider crypto expansion European banks are cautiously stepping into the digital asset industry. Earlier this year, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Italy’s largest banking group, confirmed its first spot Bitcoin purchase and launched a digital asset trading desk for institutional clients. Spain’s Banco Santander SA is also reportedly exploring options to expand its digital asset offerings. The bank is in early-stage planning to launch a stablecoin and provide access to cryptocurrencies for retail clients through its digital banking arm. Across the European Union, regulatory clarity around digital assets has improved with the gradual rollout of MiCA , the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, which is aimed at bringing more transparency and consumer protection to the industry. European investor interest in crypto is rebounding following a turbulent 2022 and 2023, which was marked by high-profile crypto firm bankruptcies and market volatility. The success of UniCredit’s product could prompt the company to expand its digital asset offerings further and encourage even more European banks to follow suit.

The crypto market cap declined by around 4 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $3.366 trillion on Tuesday, July 1, during the mid-North American trading session. Amid the midterm crypto bearish outlook, on-chain data analysis shows institutional investors have continued to accumulate relentlessly. For instance, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, recorded a net cash inflow of about $102 million on Monday, thus registering 15 consecutive days of cash inflows. Will U.S. SEC’s Approval of Spot Altcoin ETF Trigger Market Reversal? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has remained on the side of pro-crypto regulations since the 2nd inauguration of President Donald Trump. On Tuesday, the SEC granted approval to the conversion of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap (GDLC) Fund into an ETF. The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which has about $774 million in Assets Under Management (AUM), holds several digital assets led by Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The approval of the GDLC‘s conversion to ETF is a major milestone for the entire altcoin market, which has been expecting more spot ETF approval in the coming months. As a result, the approval will play a crucial role in net crypto traded volume during the next few months. The expected demand growth in the spot market will likely trigger a bullish reversal in the near term. Midterm Expectations Following the approval of GDLC conversion to an ETF product, the odds of an altseason in the near term have significantly surged. Furthermore, the U.S. SEC will imminently approve more crypto spot ETFs in the near future. Yes, this is what everyone wants, what makes sense and what we think will happen and why we so bullish (95% on most of the coins) approval. Q is what will the standards be.

2025-07-01T20:00:25,"Genius Mathematician Urges XRP Holders to Buckle Up. Here’s why","A bold mathematical prediction has ignited excitement among XRP holders, thanks to a viral video shared by Levi of Crypto Crusaders. In the clip, a mathematician named Giovanni uses advanced modeling techniques to forecast Bitcoin’s future, and by extension, offers a compelling glimpse into XRP’s explosive potential. As the market enters a critical phase, his insights are urging XRP investors to prepare for what could be a dramatic uptrend. The Math Behind Bitcoin’s Explosive Future Giovanni’s analysis relies on a combination of regression lines and a power law formula, in which Bitcoin’s price is proportional to time raised to the power of six. Here, time refers to the age of the Bitcoin network, and the “power” amplifies the value growth exponentially. According to Giovanni, this model forecasts that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin in eight years, and $10 million in two decades. These projections may sound ambitious, but they are grounded in historical trends and logarithmic growth patterns, not mere speculation. GENIUS Mathematician Urges XRP Holders To BUCKLE UP! #XRP pic.twitter.com/B0vCVoKSA7 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) June 30, 2025 This model suggests that Bitcoin’s price has historically followed a mathematically consistent upward curve that reflects not just market hype but the intrinsic maturation of its decentralized network. As the system ages, the price naturally escalates along the curve, making this forecast particularly powerful for long-term investors. Why XRP Could Outperform Bitcoin Levi of Crypto Crusaders takes Giovanni’s projection a step further by connecting it to XRP’s historical behavior. He notes that while Bitcoin drives the market, XRP often mirrors its performance, but with significantly greater gains. During the last major bull move, when Bitcoin rose from $50,000 to around $110,000 (a 2x increase), XRP surged from $0.50 to about $3, a 6x rally. Levi applies this same ratio to current market levels. With Bitcoin now trading at approximately $106,232 and XRP at $2.19, he argues that if Bitcoin reaches the projected $150,000 to $200,000 range during this cycle, XRP could logically climb to between $15 and $25. His conservative estimate places XRP at $20 at the cycle’s peak, an outcome that fits with previous market dynamics and historical correlations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Conditions and XRP’s Current Position At present, XRP trades around $2.19, showing significant strength amid broader market optimism. Bitcoin’s steady climb has created favorable tailwinds, and XRP appears to be gaining momentum as investor confidence returns. With the SEC litigation largely behind Ripple, regulatory uncertainties that once held XRP back are quickly fading. Moreover, Ripple’s increasing global footprint in payments infrastructure, along with rising institutional interest in XRP-related services, adds fundamental support to these bullish technical projections. XRP’s unique utility in cross-border finance continues to distinguish it from many other altcoins, enhancing its credibility as a high-upside asset in the evolving financial ecosystem. Buckle Up: A Mathematical and Market-Driven Call Giovanni’s prediction, backed by decades of trend analysis, aligns perfectly with what seasoned XRP analysts like Levi have observed over multiple market cycles. If Bitcoin does peak in the $200,000 range as the model suggests, XRP’s amplified response could create generational wealth for long-term holders. For those positioned early, the message is clear: buckle up. The next wave may not only validate this bold mathematical model, but it could also solidify XRP’s place among the most explosive assets in the crypto market.

2025-07-01T19:55:35,"Man Allegedly Converts $1,700,000 Worth of Fake Checks and Fraudulent Wire Transfers Into Bitcoin After Multiple Scams","A central New York man is currently in custody for turning $1.7 million worth of fraudulent checks into Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to official District of Rhode Island court documents , Tushal Rathod has been charged with wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Court documents show an affidavit by FBI special agent Samuel Morgan detailing Rathod’s allegations. From 2022 to 2024, Morgan alleges Rathod collected nearly $2 million in fraudulent checks and business email compromise (BEC) fraud. According to the affidavit, “During a BEC, scammers obtain the login credentials of an email user of a business email account. Typically, the credentials are obtained during a ‘spearphishing’ cyber campaign.” In a BEC, thieves use the stolen credentials to monitor e-mail transactions, stepping in with fraudulent communications over sensitive matters like upcoming financial transactions. BECs sometimes even involve malware. Rathod allegedly then spread the fraudulent funds out across seven accounts in six different banks. Furthermore, most of those funds were then converted into BTC. Rathod allegedly worked with several co-conspirators and took on different names to different people. Says Morgan, “In my training and experience, I know that fraudsters and individuals who conduct BEC schemes often work with a vast network of money launderers to help them ‘clean’ funds and then re-integrate the ‘cleaned’ funds into the economy so that the funds can be used free from the taint of criminal activity. This allows the scammers to profit from their fraudulent conduct and to avoid getting caught.” Rathod was arrested and arraigned last Wednesday. He is currently awaiting his detention hearing in custody.

2025-07-01T19:40:46,"Buffett Indicator hit 205%, signaling extreme market overvaluation","The Warren Buffett Indicator has climbed to 205%, the highest point ever tracked. That figure officially tops levels seen during both the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis. It means the total market cap of US stocks now sits at more than double the country’s GDP, marking the most expensive valuation on record. The market hit this milestone just as trading began for the second half of 2025, and Wall Street’s reaction? Flat. Stocks barely moved. The metric may be screaming red, but traders seem to be holding their breath. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 426 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 hovered near the flatline and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6%. The Dow’s movement came after a change in trading behavior. Investors dumped tech names like Microsoft and Nvidia, two of the biggest winners in Q2, and rotated into health-care firms. Amgen, Merck, and UnitedHealth each jumped close to 3%, while Johnson & Johnson added almost 2%. The tech-heavy Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which gained nearly 23% last quarter, started Q3 down 1%. Trump tax bill passes Senate as Musk slams it, Powell hints at pause President Donald Trump’s new tax and spending bill passed the Senate on Tuesday with a narrow 51-50 vote. The legislation, which includes sweeping budget changes, now moves to the House. But it’s already facing public criticism from major corporate names. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, called the bill “utterly insane and destructive” on Truth Social. In response, Trump posted on the same platform calling for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to investigate the government subsidies that Musk’s companies have collected. This is the second time this year the two have clashed over federal funding and regulatory priorities. Elon’s reaction came on the same day Tesla stock dropped more than 5%. It was one of the worst-performing names among large caps. His public comments raised concerns about political backlash against clean energy subsidies, a key part of Tesla’s business model. Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a policy update during a European Central Bank panel in Portugal. Powell said that without Trump’s tariffs, the Fed would have likely cut interest rates again by now. “In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence,” Powell said . He didn’t clarify whether July would be too soon for another move, instead saying any decision would be based on data. Corporate bitcoin buying overtakes ETFs for third quarter On the crypto side, corporate buying of bitcoin continued to outpace ETFs for the third straight quarter. Public companies added around 131,000 BTC in Q2, increasing their holdings by 18%. In comparison, ETFs added 111,000 BTC, a growth of 8%. Leading the pack is Strategy, still holding the largest stash among public companies. But others are catching on. Ben Werkman, Chief Investment Officer at Swan Bitcoin, said the landscape is shifting. “It’s going to be very hard to catch Strategy’s scale,” Werkman said. “They’re going to be the preferred landing spot for institutional capital because of the deep liquidity around their equity, while these smaller equities are going to be really good risk returns for retail investors and smaller institutions that want more of that upside.” Back on Wall Street, Berkshire Hathaway’s stocks responded to the Buffett hype. Class A shares closed at $733,214.44, up $4,414.44 or 0.61%, while Class B shares ended the day at $488.70, rising 0.60%. These gains came as the Buffett Indicator dominated headlines, though the company’s performance had no direct link to the broader market overvaluation that the metric tracks. Markets had already recovered significantly after their April slide, triggered by Trump’s aggressive tariff policies. Back then, the S&P 500 flirted with bear market territory. Since then, things have turned. The S&P 500 closed out Q2 with a 10.6% gain, and the Nasdaq jumped nearly 18%.

2025-07-01T19:40:22,"Michael Saylor’s Strategy Shocks Wall Street As $14 Billion Bitcoin Gains Match Amazon & JPMorgan","Michael Saylor’s Strategy has stunned Wall Street critics as the once-struggling software and business intelligence firm recorded approximately $14 billion in unrealized gains during the second quarter, elevating it to the exclusive tier of corporate giants, including Amazon.com Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. This prestigious position is typically reserved for a handful of U.S. companies whose operating profits exceed $10 billion quarterly by generating billions in revenue. According to a July 1 Bloomberg report , Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) has now secured membership in this Wall Street elite circle. Michael Saylor’s Strategy to Join Wall Street Elite With $14 Billion Windfall https://t.co/TUXH3nEpy9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 1, 2025 The dramatic turnaround from near-obscurity stems from Bitcoin’s price recovery in April and May and a recent accounting methodology change at Strategy regarding the valuation of its substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Per Bloomberg projections, Strategy is expected to generate approximately $112.8 million in second-quarter revenue from its traditional software operations. Critics Double Down on Saylor’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Despite Record Performance The anticipated record profit for the quarter ending June 30 comes amid intensified criticism from prominent skeptics, including renowned short-seller Jim Chanos. During a recent Odd Lots podcast episode titled “On the Absurdity of Bitcoin Treasury Companies,” Chanos criticized Strategy’s treasury strategy and advised investors to short MSTR stock while purchasing Bitcoin directly, betting that the large premium the stock commands over its token holdings will eventually contract. Noted short-seller Jim Chanos is now shorting shares of Strategy (formerly @MicroStrategy ) while simultaneously buying Bitcoin directly. #JimChanos #Bitcoin https://t.co/EKkOhUWttz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 15, 2025 Chanos shared Strategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition data, commenting: “It looks like Saylor will be happy to sell you some more MSTR stock, as he tapped the common equity ATM for over half a billion dollars again last week.” In that case, it looks like Saylor will be happy to sell you some more $MSTR stock, as he tapped the common equity ATM for over half a billion dollars again last week. pic.twitter.com/N8Sp0t26yO — James Chanos (@RealJimChanos) June 30, 2025 The Wall Street investor also revealed insider information suggesting that Strategy was being considered for S&P 500 inclusion, though this decision has reportedly been delayed until September. However, Saylor maintains that most critics fundamentally misunderstand Strategy’s business model. He has faced criticism for over four years, yet his company has dramatically outperformed both single stocks and the broader S&P 500 index. Strategy’s shares (MSTR) have skyrocketed more than 3,130% since Saylor initiated Bitcoin purchases in mid-2020 as an inflation hedge. Source: Google Finance During the same timeframe, Bitcoin has gained approximately 1,000%, while the S&P 500 has risen around 115%.

Recall that Strategy concluded its strongest month since November 2024 with a 32% surge in April, closing at $380.11, up from $288 at the period’s start. Strategy Accounting Changes Drive Q2 Profitability as Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Spreads Strategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings are beginning to translate into profitability primarily due to anticipated modifications in cryptocurrency asset accounting regulations. Despite widespread awareness of the accounting methodology change , the first-quarter loss has attracted several class-action lawsuits alleging that Strategy executives made false and misleading statements that harmed shareholders. Strategy stated its intention to “vigorously defend against these claims” in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing . Saylor’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy has inspired numerous imitators seeking to replicate his success. Other companies are also adapting the approach for different cryptocurrency tokens. For example, SharpLink Gaming Inc. is accumulating Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, while Upexi Inc. recently raised $100 million to purchase Solana tokens. SharpLink Gaming has emerged as the world’s largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum (ETH), after acquiring 176,271 ETH for $463 million. #ETH #Sharplink https://t.co/ynahjYt7Hd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 A group of hedge fund executives recently attempted to raise $100 million to acquire BNB, Binance’s native token , through a publicly traded vehicle.

2025-07-01T19:30:00,"Senate passes Trump’s massive budget bill, with no mentions of crypto or Bitcoin","Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” passed the Senate, but without any provisions related to the crypto industry. Trump’s budget bill passed the Senate, but the crypto industry has little to celebrate. On Tuesday, June 1, the U.S. Senate passed the sweeping budget bill, with a razor-thin margin. Yet, despite Donald Trump’s past vocal support for the crypto industry, the bill had no crypto-related provisions. Specifically, there was no mention of “digital assets,” “Bitcoin,” “Ethereum,” “crypto,” “web3,” or “blockchain” anywhere in the over 1000-page bill. This is despite specific efforts by pro-crypto Senators to include tax breaks for the industry in the bill. Notably, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal advocate for digital assets, argued for changing the tax code for crypto mining and staking. She argued that miners and stakers were taxed twice, once when they received block rewards and then again when they had to sell them. For years, miners and stakers have been taxed TWICE. Once when they receive block rewards, and again when they sell it. It’s time to stop this unfair tax treatment and ensure America is the world’s Bitcoin and Crypto Superpower. 🇺🇸 — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 30, 2025 You might also like: Senator Lummis pushes for crypto-friendly amendments in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Miners and stakers seek relief from taxation Currently, the IRS classifies profits from crypto mining and staking as income, which is taxed at fair market value at the time of receiving them. Once the miners sell their crypto, they have to report capital gains and pay a flat rate on these profits. While these taxes don’t strictly entail double taxation, miners and stakers complain that the system is overly burdensome. Namely, they have to pay taxes before realizing any profits, or before converting any crypto to fiat. You might also like: Guide to paying taxes on cryptocurrency income Lummis also advocated for tax exemptions for small crypto transactions, or a “de minimis” rule. These are often transactions that involve small payments for gas fees, small transfers, etc. While transactions don’t generate much tax income, they are a significant burden when it comes to tax reporting. The crypto industry was one of the biggest donors in the November 2024 elections. They supported candidates from both parties, raising over $190 million for their campaigns.

2025-07-01T19:29:48,"Socialist Zohran Mamdani may become a New York mayor. Why does crypto X push against him?","33-year-old socialist Zohran Mamdani became a surprise favorite among the NYC mayoral candidates from the Democratic Party and is considered a likely winner in the election. Mamdani’s socialist platform is criticized for being naive and unrealistic. However, his popularity is a signal to capitalists that the masses of New Yorkers are unheard of. Why does crypto X blast Mamdani? Is he an enemy of cryptocurrencies? Table of Contents Zohran Mamdani’s background and platform Can Mamdani save New York? Why does Crypto Twitter not like Mamdani? Conclusion Zohran Mamdani’s background and platform Zohran Mamdani’s parents are Ugandan academic and political commentator Mahmood Mamdani and award-winning Indian American filmmaker Mira Nair. Mamdani’s family moved to the USA from Uganda when Zohran was seven. Mamdani is Muslim and an outspoken socialist. He criticizes Israel’s actions in Palestine while opposing anti-semitism at the same time. Mamdani has a degree in African studies. Prior to starting a political career, he worked as a housing counselor. He has been a member of the New York State Assembly from the 36th district since 2021. Mamdani announced he is running for mayor of New York in October 2024. His platform is based on the idea that New York got too expensive to live in for working-class New Yorkers, which is true, given that even one-bedroom apartments in working-class districts can cost over $3,000 or even $4,000 per month. Mamdani’s supporters use slogans such as “Freeze the Rent” and “A City We Can Afford” while Mamdani is addressing the cost-of-living crisis in his speeches. His initiatives include abolishing payment for the use of buses, creating affordable city-owned grocery stores across the city, providing public child care, freezing housing prices, and building more affordable houses. These ideas resonated with young lodgers of New York and Asian and Latinx voters. In June, Mamdani became the leading candidate from the Democratic Party, beating former New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary. Mamdani’s success scared and angered Republicans, big business, and some of the moderate Democrats. Can Mamdani save New York? Just like Donald Trump before the presidency, Mamdani is criticized for lacking real experience in politics. His success owes much to social media and efficient promotion. The assembly years of Mamdani weren’t marked with any achievements. Now that his campaign has proved to be victorious, critics worry about a possible disastrous mayoral term of Mamdani. Mamdani’s ideas are criticized for being naive and even harmful : rent grows slower than the maintenance costs for apartment owners, while the promise to build affordable housing projects totally ignores the fact that New York has already been championing this strategy for many years. More than that, the rent prices for 40% of apartments are already controlled (landlords cannot raise the cost more than 5% a year). This policy shows poor results as the uncontrolled housing gets costlier, while controlled housing loses in quality as landlords cut expenses. Freezing the rent altogether will only make it worse. Mamdani’s plan to tax the rich to pay off his public projects may also find opposition from the governor and state legislature. As for the buses, critics say that free buses will attract new passengers who now use the subway. This pressure may worsen the traffic jam situation. Why does Crypto Twitter not like Mamdani? It seems that many of Mamdani’s plans are too hard to materialize, or they are just bad at their core. However, Crypto X (Twitter) has one more reason to hate a new Democratic leader: he is not a cryptocurrency champion, while his opponents in the election are pro-crypto. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa promised to widen the Bitcoin ATM infrastructure back in 2021. Also, he was urging local businesses to start accepting crypto payments. The incumbent NYC mayor, who is going to get re-elected as an independent candidate, Eric Adams, is a crypto advocate who famously said that he received his first three mayoral paychecks in Bitcoin. Adams was calling New Yorkers to oppose Bitlicense, a framework that stalls cryptocurrency business in New York, and participated in various other cryptocurrency initiatives.

He used a cryptocurrency topic as the reason to criticize former governor Andrew Cuomo, calling him out for advising an OKX exchange that broke local rules and had to pay $505 million in fines. Andrew Cuomo could’ve spent the years since his resignation making amends and helping New Yorkers. Instead he hounded the women who spoke out about his serial harassment, fought to keep his book deal millions…and advised a foreign crypto exchange that broke US law. pic.twitter.com/kBxkNGdrgA — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) April 2, 2025 In 2023, Mamdani called to tighten regulations on cryptocurrency in New York, despite the fact that New York is already a tough jurisdiction for cryptocurrency businesses. Basically, that’s all Mamdani had to say about crypto during his lifetime. When crypto companies collapse, it isn’t the rich who suffer, it’s small investors who disproportionately come from low-income and communities of color. @NewYorkStateAG has a bill to address this and protect New York investors. Let’s do it! https://t.co/z0lCuPzkK9 — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) May 11, 2023 It is not Mamdani’s lack of support for crypto, nor the weakness of his platform, that is the target for Crypto Twitter. It seems that many in the community simply hate Mamdani for being a socialist, Israeli military aggression critic, and “tax the rich” proponent. Some even point at his Ugandan roots as a problem or bring up the fact that Mamdani is not poor himself, as if it means he is not honest with the voters. Your mom lets you stay in her $2 million condo in Chelsea. Why are you pandering? You are rich. You are a nepo baby. https://t.co/uq8bbSjHP9 — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) June 30, 2025 As many big figures in the crypto community don’t have reservations about being or becoming ultrawealthy, they seem to be angered and scared by the sudden success of Mamdani, who claimed, “I don’t think we should have billionaires because it is so much money in a moment of such inequality.” Zohran Mamdani: “I don't think that we should have billionaires.” Do you agree? Is there a point in being a billionaire besides for power? pic.twitter.com/zEyE0yHHp1 — Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein) June 29, 2025 Billionaire and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is one of the most concerned about Mamdani’s person on X. He cites the poorly based post suggesting that the results in the Democratic primary are not impressive as a thoughtful piece, and reposts various tweets that bring up Mamdani’s remoteness from the working class or his distaste for Benjamin Netanyahu as problematic. Socialism is a mental disease spread by those looking to prey on the economically illiterate. — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) June 30, 2025 One of the retweeted posts is by Anthony Pompliano, a cryptocurrency podcaster and the new CEO of the ProCap BTC Bitcoin treasury company. On his podcast, he shared a clip in which ​​market analyst Jordi Visser explains why the youth lean toward socialism. Frustration and the feeling that the system is failing them are to blame. Visser, however, sees that Bitcoin may be the way out–something that is missing from Mamdani’s platform. In the same video, Pompliano shares the text from a venture capitalist, Peter Thiel, who cites student debt, unaffordable housing, long-term negative capital, no stake in the capitalist system, and the lack of eagerness of the boomer generation to pass the power to younger generations. Interestingly, Pompliano suggests that the solution for the youth would be copying the behavior of successful people of the past: accumulating capital, embracing new technologies, and taking risks–diving into the Bitcoin space matches all three suggestions. However, it only emphasizes that the old-school pipeline of the American Dream is systematically broken, and Bitcoin is one of the newer bypasses in the post-2008-and-2020-crises world order. Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss made a viral post condemning the youth supporting Mamdani. He concluded that socialism can be a hard lesson for Zoomers and millennials to learn why socialism is a bad idea. A lot of people have asked me if I will get involved in the NYC mayor race by supporting a candidate that can defeat Zohran Mamdani. TBH, I’m torn and undecided. Like every other city run by democrats, NYC is a broken kleptocracy. Taxes are astronomical and services are pathetic… — Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) June 26, 2025 However, many in the comment section pointed out that instead of speaking about how good it is for New Yorkers to “learn it the hard way,” Winklevoss could come up with a more positive program, for instance, educating the youth about dangers of socialism the same way Mamdani earned his popularity–via social media, or just through “throwing good money at [capitalism] to work outside your trust fund.” Blaming socialism for millennial disillusionment is wild when it was capitalism—2008, student debt, unaffordable housing—that radicalized millennials. Also rich (ha): a billionaire crypto mogul lecturing NYC on kleptocracy while VC money launders luxury towers and rig… — efficientenzyme (@efficientenzyme) June 26, 2025 Conclusion New York is home to Gemini, MoonPay, Circle, Paxos, and other cryptocurrency projects. The mayor of the city will have an impact on the crypto industry of the U.S., per se. The probable victory of Mamdani casts a shadow on the prospects of the cryptocurrency business in New York, as the crypto sector is nonexistent in his campaign. It’s four months until the November election, and things can change.

2025-07-01T19:20:45,"Japanese Game Developer CyberStep Pioneers Ambitious $6.96M Crypto Reserve for Web3 Future","BitcoinWorld Japanese Game Developer CyberStep Pioneers Ambitious $6.96M Crypto Reserve for Web3 Future In a significant move signaling the growing convergence of traditional entertainment and decentralized finance, CyberStep, a prominent Japanese game developer renowned for its popular online claw machine game Toreba, has launched an ambitious new initiative. This strategic pivot into the digital asset space marks a bold step, setting a precedent for how established gaming companies are embracing the future of finance and technology. Why is this Japanese Game Developer Making Waves? CyberStep’s decision to dive deep into the cryptocurrency world isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a calculated move. On July 1, the company officially unveiled CRYPTECH Capital, a dedicated division poised to manage its foray into digital assets. This isn’t merely about dabbling; it’s about establishing a robust foundation within the burgeoning Web3 ecosystem. For a leading Japanese game developer , this move underscores a belief in the long-term viability and transformative potential of blockchain technology, especially as it relates to interactive entertainment. Building a Strategic Crypto Reserve: The Vision At the heart of CyberStep’s new venture is the commitment to building a substantial crypto reserve . The company’s strategy involves converting tokens generated from its various Web3 services into established major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). These assets will then be held on the company’s balance sheet, providing a stable foundation and potentially new avenues for growth. This approach demonstrates a clear understanding of market dynamics, opting for blue-chip cryptocurrencies known for their liquidity and relative stability within the volatile crypto landscape. CyberStep’s Bold Digital Asset Strategy Unpacked The financial commitment behind this initiative is noteworthy. CyberStep has initially allocated 200 million yen (approximately $1.39 million) for immediate crypto purchases within the fiscal year ending May 2026. This initial investment is just the beginning. The long-term vision for this digital asset strategy is to expand the reserve significantly, aiming for a target of 1 billion yen (around $6.96 million), contingent on favorable market conditions. This phased approach allows the company flexibility to adapt to market fluctuations while steadily building its digital asset portfolio. It’s a pragmatic and forward-thinking strategy for managing risk and maximizing potential returns. The Future of Web3 Gaming and Beyond CyberStep’s move highlights a broader trend: the increasing integration of blockchain technology into the gaming industry. The creation of Web3 services, which leverage decentralized technologies, is a key component of this shift. By converting tokens from these services into major cryptocurrencies, CyberStep is not only diversifying its assets but also strengthening its commitment to the decentralized future. This could pave the way for more innovative in-game economies, true digital ownership for players, and new forms of interaction within the Web3 gaming sphere. It positions CyberStep at the forefront of this evolving digital frontier, potentially inspiring other traditional game developers to explore similar paths. What Does This Mean for CyberStep Crypto Holdings? The establishment of CRYPTECH Capital and the accumulation of a substantial CyberStep crypto reserve could have several implications: Enhanced Financial Stability: Holding major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH can act as a hedge against inflation and offer diversification from traditional fiat currencies. Future Investment Opportunities: A strong digital asset base provides capital for future Web3 projects, acquisitions, or partnerships. Industry Leadership: By proactively embracing crypto, CyberStep solidifies its position as an innovator in the gaming and tech sectors. Player Engagement: The integration of Web3 elements could lead to more engaging and rewarding experiences for players, potentially increasing user retention and growth for games like Toreba.

2025-07-01T19:13:00,"“Not off the table”: Fed comment could trigger Bitcoin, altcoin rally","Bitcoin and altcoin prices could stage a strong rally in July after a surprise statement from Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair. In a statement, Powell changed his tune on when the Fed will start cutting interest rates. For the first time this year, he did not rule out slashing rates as soon as in the July meeting. He said : “I really can’t say. It’s going to depend on the data. And we are going meeting by meeting. I wouldn’t take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table. It’s going to depend on how the data fall.” In his testimony to Congress last week, Powell insisted that the bank would maintain a wait-and-see approach before hiking interest rates. He and other officials are assessing the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs on interest rates. You might also like: Senator Lummis pushes for crypto-friendly amendments in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Some Federal Reserve officials have supported a July interest rate cut. In recent statements, Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman have insisted that Trump’s tariffs were having a limited impact on inflation and that a July cut would be necessary. Still, traders and the futures market are unconvinced that the Fed will cut in July. Polymarket data pegs a July cut at 17% and no change at 82%. The CME FedWatch tool puts the odds of a cut at just 19.1%. A July rate cut would be highly bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins because it would reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. It would also increase risk appetite among investors, as happened during the COVID-19 pandemic when the bank brought rates to zero. The rate cut would also coincide with the passing of Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which introduces some tax cuts and reduces regulations. Some of the money saved in taxes will be invested in cryptocurrencies. While a July rate cut is not guaranteed, most analysts anticipate one in September, with odds standing at over 75%. In a statement this week, Goldman Sachs predicted three cuts this year, while Morgan Stanley sees seven in 2026. Bitcoin and altcoins have other catalysts Bitcoin and altcoins have other catalysts that will push them higher this year. For example, Bitcoin demand continues rising, with spot ETF inflows nearing the $50 billion mark. More companies like Coinbase, Block, GameStop, and MetaPlanet continue to accumulate Bitcoin. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve several altcoin ETFs later this year. Odds of an XRP ETF being approved this year have jumped to 85%, while Solana ( SOL ) has soared to 99%. ETF approvals will likely lead to more inflows among investors. Further, regulatory clarity in the crypto industry is happening, which will attract more investors. For example, the US Senate has passed the GENIUS Act , which focuses on the stablecoin industry.
