2025-07-02T11:45:50,"Scammers Drain $20,000 From Billion-Dollar Bank Customer Who Took Out Loan for Business Purposes: Report","A customer of a billion-dollar US bank reportedly says scammers stole the funds from her small business loan that she had just received. Lele Ewah, a small business owner in Houston, Texas, says the scam all started with a call from a woman impersonating an official at Prosperity Bank, where she has her account, reports the NBC-affiliated KPRC2. She says the caller ID matched the bank’s number and the woman, who identified herself as “Erica,” referenced her travel habits. “She asked, ‘Are you and your husband out of town? You always set travel notifications.’ It sounded so real.” Ewah says the woman asked her to verify certain information to “secure” her account and reset her online banking access. However, in doing so, Ewah unwittingly gave the scammer access to her account. She says later in the day, she noticed two large transfers totaling $20,000 were made to internal accounts at the same bank. That was the total amount of funds Ewah received from a small business loan to make repairs and do marketing for her health and wellness shop called Power of Sea Moss. “I was absolutely devastated. From a small business perspective, every dollar is needed. I felt like I couldn’t breathe.” While the bank told her it could recover the funds since they were sent to another internal account, she says the bank has only restored $12,000 so far. “We borrowed a certain amount of money for a specific reason, and now we don’t have it. That doesn’t fix the situation.” Prosperity Bank is a $38.765 billion regional financial holding company based in Houston, Texas, with 284 branches across the state and in Oklahoma.

2025-07-02T11:45:14,"Institutional rush for Bitcoin CME futures cools as premium drops","The premium on Bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has declined to its lowest level in eight months. According to data from 10x Research, the rolling three-month basis on CME Bitcoin futures has fallen to just 4.3%, a level not seen since October 2023. The figure recorded is a downturn from levels above 10% seen earlier in 2025, and could mean institutional interest in the largest crypto by market cap is dwindling, heading into the third quarter of 2025. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is changing hands at around $107,700, an uptick of about 1% over the last 24 hours. Over the past two weeks, the coin has been consolidating in a tight range between $105,000 and $107,700. The decline in futures premiums spells a loss of forward-looking enthusiasm among professional investors. The drop in what is known as the “basis,” the difference between futures and spot prices, translates to a reduction in arbitrage opportunities and an undefined near-term price direction. Institutional retreat from arbitrage market positions According to CME data from Q2, public companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 131,000 BTC, a surge of 18%, while ETF inflows rose by approximately 8%, an additional 111,000 BTC. These figures indicate that institutional interest in Bitcoin was initially present, at least in aggregate. However, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen said the drop in yield spreads shows how institutions are less confident about a Bitcoin price move on the upper side. “When yield spreads fall below a 10% hurdle rate, Bitcoin ETF inflows are typically driven by directional investors rather than arbitrage-focused hedge funds,” he explained. CME basis rates now lie around 4.3% and perpetual funding rates around 1.0%, which means the environment is becoming less favorable for cash-and-carry strategists. In most cash-and-carry trades, hedge funds exploit price discrepancies between spot and futures markets by simultaneously buying Bitcoin via ETFs and selling futures to lock in a yield. That opportunity is drying up. Not many funds are now willing to deploy capital for the slim return, owing to the sentiment of a “risky environment.” Funding rates negative, retail momentum stalls The softening in CME premiums comes against the backdrop of negative funding rates in perpetual futures in offshore exchanges. These rates recently flipped below zero, implying that traders are paying for short positions, another indication of bearish bias in derivatives markets. Weekly distributions of annualized CEX Funding Rates and CME Basis for BTC and ETH. Source: Padalan Capital Padalan Capital, in a weekly market update , coined the funding slide “a symptom of broader speculative fatigue.” “A more acute signal of risk-off positioning comes from regulated venues, where the CME-to-spot basis for both Bitcoin and Ethereum has inverted into deeply negative territory,” the firm remarked. Institutions are more than likely seeking safety ahead of the second half of the year, as most CME gaps were filled before Bitcoin’s breakout to new all-time highs late May. Bitcoin whales’ sentiment is mixed Per Blockchain intelligence firm CryptoQuant contributor Kripto Mevsimi, on-chain behavior during the final week of June showed Bitcoin whales realized over $641 million in profits and more than $1.24 billion in losses within the same week. Some investors who entered late in the rally appeared to capitulate, while earlier Q2 buyers likely used the moment to lock in gains. Long-term whales also took profits of approximately $91 million and recorded relatively few losses. These simultaneous signals of profit-taking and capitulation could represent a local exhaustion point. However, activity levels have since dropped heading into July, the start of a balance period, or a purported change in market behavior in support of bears.

2025-07-02T11:42:02,"Grayscale Secures SEC Approval to Convert Large-Cap Fund Into ETF","Asset manager Grayscale has received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking another significant step in the institutionalization of crypto investing. The fund, which mirrors the CoinDesk Five Index, consists of the five largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Bitcoin (BTC) dominates the fund with an 80.2% weighting, followed by Ether (ETH) at 11.3%, XRP (XRP) at 4.8%, Solana (SOL) at 2.7%, and Cardano (ADA) at 0.81%. The ETF structure will allow investors to gain exposure to these leading digital assets without the technical challenges of direct custody while benefiting from the liquidity and transparency that ETFs offer. End of an Era for Grayscale Trust Arbitrage For years, Grayscale’s crypto trusts provided investors with a unique arbitrage opportunity, allowing them to profit from premiums or discounts relative to the net asset value (NAV) due to the trust’s lock-up periods and lack of in-kind redemptions. However, these opportunities have narrowed as Grayscale transitions its private trusts into ETFs, aligning the share value more closely with the underlying assets. In a letter accompanying the SEC’s approval, Grayscale stated , “The investment objective of the Fund is for the value of the shares to reflect the value of the digital assets held by the Fund, ‘Fund Components’ as determined by reference to their respective Index Prices and weightings within the Fund, less the Fund’s expenses and other liabilities.” The move underscores the maturation of the crypto investment landscape, as products once viewed as niche and risky are now transitioning to structures that align with traditional financial markets, increasing accessibility for a broader range of investors. Legal Battle Paved the Way Grayscale’s approval comes after a hard-fought legal battle with the SEC. In June 2022, the company filed a petition to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF following a denial from the regulator. The dispute lasted over a year until a U.S. judge ruled in August 2023 that the SEC’s denial was “arbitrary and capricious,” granting Grayscale the right to proceed with the conversion. Today, Grayscale’s Bitcoin trust trades as an ETF with a 1.5% expense ratio, making it the most expensive Bitcoin ETF on the market while also standing as the highest-grossing Bitcoin investment product.

2025-07-02T11:40:43,"Bit Digital: Unlocking a Massive $162.9M for Ethereum Purchases","BitcoinWorld Bit Digital: Unlocking a Massive $162.9M for Ethereum Purchases In a significant development that has sent ripples across the digital asset space, U.S. Bitcoin miner Bit Digital (Nasdaq: BTBT) has announced a substantial capital injection, raising an impressive $162.9 million through a recent underwritten public offering. This monumental funding is earmarked specifically for Ethereum purchases , signaling a strategic pivot for the company and prompting a closer look at its implications for the evolving crypto landscape. Bit Digital’s Bold Shift: Why Ethereum Purchases? For a company primarily known for its Bitcoin mining operations, the decision to allocate such a significant sum towards Ethereum is noteworthy. Bit Digital’s move suggests a calculated strategy to diversify its digital asset holdings and potentially capitalize on the growth trajectory of the Ethereum ecosystem. While Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum’s utility as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols presents a compelling case for investment. This strategic shift could be interpreted as Bit Digital preparing for the future of blockchain. With Ethereum’s highly anticipated transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, traditional GPU-based mining for ETH will cease. By acquiring Ethereum directly, Bit Digital positions itself to potentially engage in ETH staking, which offers a different revenue model compared to mining. This proactive approach could secure future income streams and reduce reliance on energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) operations, aligning with broader industry trends towards sustainability. Understanding the Public Offering: A Strategic Move The $162.9 million was raised through an underwritten public offering , a common method for publicly traded companies to raise capital. In this type of offering, an investment bank (the underwriter) agrees to purchase and resell a company’s shares to the public. This mechanism provides a guaranteed amount of capital to the company, albeit often at a discount to the market price, and helps ensure the success of the offering. For Bit Digital, this offering provides a significant cash reserve without incurring debt. This fresh capital infusion empowers the company to execute its strategic vision for Ethereum without immediate financial constraints. While public offerings can lead to a dilution of existing shares, the substantial capital raised for a clear strategic purpose often outweighs this concern for investors who believe in the company’s long-term growth prospects. It underscores Bit Digital’s commitment to transparency and compliance as a Nasdaq-listed entity, adhering to stringent regulatory requirements. The Evolving Landscape of Crypto Mining The crypto mining industry is in a constant state of flux, driven by technological advancements, market dynamics, and regulatory scrutiny. High energy costs, increasing network difficulty, and environmental concerns have pushed many miners to innovate and diversify. Bit Digital’s move to invest heavily in Ethereum rather than solely expanding its Bitcoin mining fleet reflects a broader trend of adaptation within the sector. This decision highlights a potential shift in focus for some miners from purely computational power (PoW) to asset management and staking (PoS). It suggests that successful crypto companies in the future might need a more versatile business model that can adapt to different blockchain technologies and revenue generation opportunities beyond just mining new coins. Bit Digital’s proactive stance could serve as a case study for other mining operations considering their long-term viability in an increasingly competitive and evolving environment. What Does This Mean for BTBT Stock and Investors? The announcement of such a significant capital raise, coupled with a clear strategic direction towards Ethereum purchases , can have a multifaceted impact on BTBT stock . On one hand, the substantial cash injection provides financial stability and the means to pursue growth initiatives, which can be viewed positively by investors. The strategic diversification into Ethereum, a major asset with a robust ecosystem, could also reduce the company’s singular reliance on Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. However, investors should also consider potential risks. The success of this strategy hinges on the performance of Ethereum and Bit Digital’s ability to effectively manage and potentially stake its ETH holdings. Market volatility remains a key factor in the cryptocurrency space. For investors considering BTBT stock, it will be crucial to monitor the execution of this strategy, Ethereum’s price performance, and any future announcements regarding Bit Digital’s staking operations or further diversification efforts. This move positions Bit Digital for potential future growth but also introduces new layers of market exposure. A Forward-Looking Strategy Bit Digital’s decision to raise $162.9 million for Ethereum purchases through a public offering is a powerful statement about its vision for the future. It signifies a strategic evolution from a pure-play Bitcoin miner to a more diversified digital asset company, positioning itself to capitalize on opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency landscape, particularly in the thriving Ethereum ecosystem. This move could pave the way for increased profitability and resilience, showcasing how established players are adapting to the dynamic and ever-evolving world of blockchain technology.

Also, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 2.3% to $3.4 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $85.7 billion, decreasing over the past few days. TLDR: The crypto market slides today amid the consolidating market; BTC and ETH barely moved since yesterday, currently trading at $106,881 and $2,445, respectively; Market participants await the release of key macroeconomic data in the US; Crypto market has entered ‘a summer lull’, with bearish sentiment creeping in; US spot Bitcoin ETFs broke a 15-day positive flow streak; Analysts note the market’s “increasing capacity to absorb and rebound from large-scale disruptions”; “The narrative of robust institutional demand which has so defined this current market cycle remains in place. Crypto Winners & Losers Only one of the top 10 coins per market cap has seen its price rise today, while two others are unchanged. Bitcoin (BTC) stands as one of the coins whose price has not changed over the past day. It currently sits at $106,881. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) has decreased by 0.5%, currently changing hands at $2,445. Tron (TRX) is the only coin that appreciated today, rising 0.9% to the price of $0.2812. The highest decrease is 1.3% by XRP (XRP) , now standing at $2.19. Additionally, 18 of the top 100 coins saw their prices increase over the past day. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) appreciated the most, with the only double-digit rise in the category. It’s up 11.7% to $0.01624. Algorand (ALGO) and Tokenize Xchange (TKX) dropped the most today: 6.2% and 5% to $0.1753 and $23.57, respectively. Speaking of Pudgy Penguins, the team said on Tuesday that they are about to drop the Pudgy Party mobile game . It’s developed by Mythical Games . For those not aware, @pudgypenguins is about to drop a mobile game called Pudgy Party. Gameplay looks fun AF, think Mario Party meets Fall Guys.

As for stablecoins, that safe harbour is “enticing for some retail investors as they remain on the sidelines, awaiting a clear market move,” the CEO concludes. Moreover, blockchain data platform Glassnode noted that profit-taking has increased on Bitcoin, rising to $2.46 billion on Monday, but that we’re still seeing below-average numbers overall. Profit-taking is ramping up on the #Bitcoin network again. Yesterday, $BTC realized profits hit $2.46B, while the 7D SMA climbed to $1.52B. That’s above the YTD average of $1.14B, but still well below the ~$4-5B peaks (7D SMA) seen in Nov–Dec 2024. pic.twitter.com/hGnQHyEI2c — glassnode (@glassnode) July 1, 2025 Meanwhile, Glassnode and crypto exchange Bybit published a report on Tuesday, in light of the massive Bybit hack back in February, stating that it “highlights a significant shift in crypto market structure: an increasing capacity to absorb and rebound from large-scale disruptions.” Per the two companies, “if such resilience becomes the norm, it may pave the way for greater investor confidence and long-term maturity across the broader crypto ecosystem.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $106,881. At one point, it fell from the intraday high of $107,139 to the daily low of $105,402, before rising back up. The coin may attempt to retest the $107,832 level, followed by $108,979. Current support levels stand at $105,431 and $104,338. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,460. The coin hit an intraday high of $2,465 before dropping to $2,395 and rising to the current price. Additionally, the crypto market sentiment still stands in neutral territory, but it fell to its lowest point in the past week. The Fear and Greed Index fell from 50 yesterday to 46 today . Investors continue to be cautious, but the fear is slowly moving. Further drops may present a buying opportunity. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, on 1 July, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke their 15-day streak of positive flows with $342.25 million in outflows. Fidelity and Grayscale lead the list with outflows of $172.73 million and $119.51 million, respectively. However, US ETH ETFs recorded inflows of $40.68 million . BlackRock and Grayscale took in $54.84 million and $9.96 million, while Fidelity lost $24.11 million in the same period. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance published a notice on Tuesday to offer clearer guidance for ETF issuers . It covers how net asset value is calculated, how service providers are selected, detailed descriptions of custody practices, potential conflicts of interest, and more. Yes, this is what everyone wants, what makes sense and what we think will happen and why we so bullish (95% on most of the coins) approval. Q is what will the standards be. We think they'll likely be loose enough where the vast majority of Top 50 coins would be ok to be ETF-ized. https://t.co/1AUZOmpe1O — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 1, 2025 Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation transferred $32 million worth of ETH to multisig wallets over several days. While the Foundation has faced community backlash throughout 2025 for selling ETH, Vitalik Buterin defended this approach, noting regulatory concerns about staking large amounts of ETH. The #EthereumFoundation has been transferring 1,000 $ETH ($2.46M) daily to multisig wallet 0xc061 recently, totaling 13,000 $ETH ($32M) so far. https://t.co/IN91jVuDbk pic.twitter.com/LeXJRpVXbt — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 1, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market has decreased over the past 24 hours, while the US stock market saw a mixed situation on Tuesday. For example, the S&P 500 fell by 0.11% and the Nasdaq-100 went down by 0.89%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.91%. Stocks are cooling off after three days of gains amid optimism surrounding potential trade and tariff deals, as well as the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in the coming months.

2025-07-02T11:32:09,"Standard Chartered Bank Shares 2025 End Price Forecast for Bitcoin! Expects Record in 2028! Here Are the Details","Standard Chartered Bank has increased its optimism for Bitcoin price in the second half of 2025. Standard Chartered: Bitcoin Could Surpass $135K in Q3 2025 In the report published by the bank today, it was estimated that BTC will exceed $ 135,000 by the end of the third quarter and exceed $ 200,000 by the end of the year, due to the effect of increasing Bitcoin purchases by corporate treasuries and strong ETF inflows. The report, which included the assessments of the bank's head of digital asset research, Geoff Kendrick, stated that Bitcoin is now free of the price pressure brought by the past halving cycle. “Thanks to increased investor inflows, Bitcoin has now moved past the 18-month downward cycle typically seen post-halving,” Kendrick said. The Halving Cycle Has Diminished Its Impact Halvings, when Bitcoin's mining reward is cut in half every four years, have historically been associated with large price spikes followed by sharp corrections. However, according to Kendrick, the effects of the last halving, which took place in April 2024, are different this time because new dynamics such as ETFs and institutional purchases have come into play. Standard Chartered therefore expects prices to continue their broadly upward trend, although it acknowledges that a correction is likely in September-October 2025. 2028 Target: $500,000 The bank also set a rather ambitious long-term price target for Bitcoin, predicting that if current dynamics continue, BTC could reach $500,000 by 2028. ETF Outflows Could Be Temporary Kendrick’s analysis comes as spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their first outflow of $342.3 million after 15 consecutive days of net inflows, representing just 7% of the $4.8 billion in inflows over the past 15 days. Despite this, Kendrick stated that ETF and institutional purchases reached a total of 245,000 BTC in the second quarter of 2025, and that this level will be exceeded in both the third and fourth quarters. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-02T11:30:17,"Michael Saylor’s Strategy Set To Yield $14 Billion Profit In Q2, Bloomberg","Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is on track to report an impressive $14 billion in unrealized gains from its extensive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Co-founded by Michael Saylor, the company has successfully transformed itself from a struggling enterprise software provider into a leading leveraged Bitcoin proxy, drawing comparisons to major corporate powerhouses such as Amazon and JPMorgan Chase. Strategy Set To Post Record Profits According to a recent Bloomberg report, Strategy’s anticipated profits stem largely from the rebound in Bitcoin prices and recent changes in accounting practices that allow the firm to value its substantial cryptocurrency holdings at market rates. Analysts project that while Strategy’s software business may only generate approximately $112.8 million in revenue for the second quarter, the surge in Bitcoin prices has significantly bolstered its financial outlook. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury This potential record profit comes after a turbulent period for the company, which faced criticism from notable investors like Jim Chanos. Chanos has publicly derided Saylor’s valuation model, describing it as “financial gibberish,” while Saylor has countered that Chanos fails to grasp the intricacies of his approach. Despite the skepticism, Mark Palmer, an analyst at Benchmark Capital, noted Saylor’s resilience, stating that he has consistently outperformed not only his critics but also the broader market. Since Saylor initiated his Bitcoin buying spree, Strategy’s stock has skyrocketed over 3,300%. In the same time frame, Bitcoin has appreciated approximately 1,000%, while the S&P 500 has advanced around 115%. The company’s shares saw a 40% increase in the second quarter, significantly outpacing the S&P’s 11% rise. $64 Billion Bitcoin Value The recent accounting change at Strategy, which took effect in the first quarter, allows the firm to recognize the market value of its Bitcoin holdings—currently valued at about $64 billion—resulting in substantial swings in reported earnings. Previously, the company treated its Bitcoin similar to intangible assets, which limited their ability to recognize gains unless the assets were sold. This change has positioned Strategy to capture the full benefit of Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shopping Spree: Strategy Continues Accumulation With $530M Purchase At the start of the second quarter, Strategy held 528,185 BTC, valued at over $43.5 billion based on market prices. An increase in the value of Bitcoin of 30% during the quarter alone contributed more than $13 billion to the company’s unrealized gains. Cumulatively, weekly purchases have brought the company closer to holding 600,000 BTC. Despite the positive outlook, the company has faced legal challenges, including several class-action lawsuits claiming that executives misled shareholders regarding the first-quarter losses. In response, Strategy has pledged to vigorously defend against these accusations. As of press time, BTC trades at $106,100, down 5% from its current record high of $111,800 during May’s rally.

Failure to retake a previous high might result in a big crash, which could lead to a serious bearish move in the long term. The late June bounce has brought a slight relief in the recent bearishness, although Bonk almost resumed yesterday, but the price is recovering on the day following a substantial volume inflow since the start of today. A daily close above the $0.0000153 level could bring bullish sentiments back in the market as it slowly breaks through the previous weekly high. Such a setup should confirm more upside moves following the recent higher high and higher low formation on the hourly timeframe. That could fuel a massive bullish rally with a double-bottom pattern if the price scales through the May peak. While that could lead to a major shift in the crypto trading landscape, the daily buying volume appears insufficient at the time of writing. Fundamentally, the current increase came as a result of Bitcoin’s price recovery. Therefore, it is important to note that the overall market structure is still in favour of the bears from a short-term perspective. If they manage to step back into the market, Bonk will likely post a huge loss in the near term. BONK’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Scaling through the previous weekly $0.0000153 high in the latest surge, the next buying target would be $0.0000183 and $0.0000244 resistance, with a potential break to $0.0000314. Bonk is currently supported by the $0.0000114 level. A drop below it could drive the price back to the bottom level of $0.0000089. Breaking lower could crash the price to $0.000005.

The dip comes amid growing political tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, raising concerns across traditional and digital markets alike. Bitcoin Price Movement: July Starts in the Red After a strong rebound in the last week of June, Bitcoin stumbled on the final day of the month, falling 1.13%. The decline deepened on July 1, with BTC dropping another 1.35%, touching a low of $105,252.18. This places Bitcoin at least 2.28% below June’s peak, despite a bullish month overall (+2.40%). Here’s a breakdown of Bitcoin’s recent volatility: June 1–2 : Slight rise of 1.19% June 3–5 : Sharp drop of 4.11% June 6–10 : Strong rebound of 8.66% June 11–22 : Consistent decline of 8.42% June 23–29 : Impressive recovery of 7.29% June 30 : 1.13% drop July 1 : Down 1.35% Trump vs Powell: A Battle Over Interest Rates At the center of this week’s market anxiety is a growing power struggle between President Trump and Fed Chair Powell. Trump is pressuring Powell to cut interest rates immediately — even sending him a handwritten note blaming him for high borrowing costs and reportedly demanding his resignation. But Powell, speaking at a European Central Bank forum, made it clear: “The Fed will not bow to political pressure.” He reaffirmed that any rate cuts will be data-driven, not dictated by politics. [post_titles_links postid=”477630″] Crypto Market Reacts to Macro Tensions As traditional markets react to interest rate expectations, Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a macro asset. Analysts believe the latest crypto market drop is linked to Trump-Powell tensions. “We’re seeing Bitcoin move in tandem with macroeconomic shifts,” said Unity Wallet COO James Toledano . “But the long-term outlook for BTC remains strong.” Bitcoin Outlook: Is Q3 Still Bullish? While Q1 2025 was disappointing for Bitcoin with a -11.7% return, Q2 flipped the script with a massive 29.9% surge. As of now, Q3 has started with a modest 0.49% gain, with Bitcoin currently trading near $107,670.Despite political drama, macro pressure, and short-term volatility, Bitcoin bulls are still confident.

[article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs Why is Bitcoin’s price so volatile right now, and how much is due to the Trump-Powell conflict? Bitcoin’s current volatility is attributed to its increasing behavior as a “macro asset,” reacting to broader economic shifts. The Trump-Powell conflict, stemming from the President’s pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates, is a significant contributor to this market anxiety, pushing Bitcoin’s price downward as traditional markets react. How do interest rate decisions affect Bitcoin’s price? Interest rate decisions heavily influence Bitcoin’s price because lower rates generally increase market liquidity, making riskier assets like crypto more attractive. Conversely, higher rates can divert capital into safer, fixed-income products, reducing demand for Bitcoin and potentially suppressing its price. What factors could lead to Bitcoin stabilizing or rallying in Q3 2025? Bitcoin could stabilize or rally in Q3 2025 if clarity emerges regarding interest rates, easing macroeconomic pressures. Continued institutional demand (including from ETFs), corporate buying, and the asset’s fixed supply could also contribute to upward momentum, potentially pushing it toward $115,000-$135,000. How do Trump’s tariff policies relate to Bitcoin’s price movements? Historically, Trump’s tariff policies have created market anxiety, as they can be perceived as inflationary and potentially deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates. This, in turn, can put downward pressure on non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin, causing price fluctuations.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-today-reacts-to-trumps-pressure-on-fed-chair-powell-whats-next/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T11:21:17,"Will Bitcoin Become the Ultimate Currency for Cross-Border iGaming?","BitcoinWorld Will Bitcoin Become the Ultimate Currency for Cross-Border iGaming? While all the talk in the Bitcoin space may be about institutional adoption and national reserves, there’s still a need for it to become mainstream among everyday people. While the Bitcoin market has been booming for the last year, Google search results show that there has been little interest from retail this time around. It may require a massive online industry like iGaming to help Bitcoin spread to the masses and win more people over. It does present an excellent solution for online casinos, as it allows for cross-border gaming without the need to accommodate for different fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s Unique Role in Global iGaming The online gambling industry is a global sector, with operators desperate to compete in as many markets as possible – legislation permitting. For this reason, it would make more sense for these sites to operate with a single currency that’s recognized around the world. Bitcoin is arguably the greatest chance we have of a global currency, one that isn’t confined by borders or banking restrictions. It enables anyone to transfer funds from anywhere at any time, bypassing traditional obstacles such as high conversion fees and currency volatility. The use of Bitcoin could be particularly appealing to up-and-coming markets in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, as many of the countries in these regions have weak currencies or inaccessible banking systems. Therefore, iGaming operators who accept Bitcoin could flourish in these markets. Bitcoin as a Bridge to Underserved Markets There are a lot of emerging markets in the iGaming industry that operators would love to get into as they could be lucrative in the years ahead. For example, Latin America is relatively underserved, but operators are starting to move into these countries as regulations loosen. There has been a major surge in adoption of cryptocurrencies in countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela, as residents have turned to Bitcoin and others as a hedge against inflation and weak local currencies. Crypto casinos could easily market themselves in the region and would most likely attract a lot of users. This represents a great opportunity for new operators who use prebuilt platforms such as turnkey software for gambling . The technology comes with the ability to accept crypto payments already built in, meaning that it’s easy to set up a crypto casino in no time and start trying to attract Latin American players. With options like these out there, we should thus see a rise in the number of independent entrepreneurs looking to get ahead in this new technological heyday. Stablecoins Could be the Best Solution While there has always been talk of Bitcoin becoming a global currency, there may already be a better solution for everyday payments at places such as iGaming sites. Crypto enthusiasts may still hold Bitcoin as a store of wealth in their crypto wallets, but when it comes to day-to-day transactions, stablecoins may soon become the norm. Options such as Tether mean that crypto users can still keep their funds on-chain, but they can always swap to something that doesn’t face as much price volatility as Bitcoin. This would enable operators to ensure that all buy-ins and payouts are fair. After cashing out, users could then change their USDT back into Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a chance at becoming the number one currency for iGaming, as it offers various benefits such as cross-border payments. However, for everyday transactions, it may be preferable for users to swap their BTC into a stablecoin such as USDT.

2025-07-02T11:20:17,"Unlocking Value: Bitcoin’s Digital Gold Narrative Soars as US National Debt Reaches New Heights","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Value: Bitcoin’s Digital Gold Narrative Soars as US National Debt Reaches New Heights The halls of the U.S. Senate recently witnessed a monumental financial decision that could profoundly reshape the investment landscape, particularly for cryptocurrencies. The approval of the $3.3 trillion budget proposal, colloquially dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” has sent ripples across global markets. For the astute investor, this isn’t just another piece of legislation; it’s a potential catalyst strengthening Bitcoin’s (BTC) long-held narrative as a modern-day Bitcoin digital gold . As national debt figures escalate, the spotlight on decentralized assets intensifies, making it crucial to understand the implications for your portfolio. Understanding the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ and its US National Debt Implications The U.S. Senate’s green light on this substantial budget proposal marks a significant moment for the American economy. According to reports from BeInCrypto, this bill is set to add over $3 trillion to the existing national debt. To put this into perspective, consider the sheer scale: Budgetary Expansion: A $3.3 trillion budget signifies a massive injection of funds into various sectors, from infrastructure to social programs. While the intent is often economic stimulus, the method of funding is critical. Debt Accumulation: A substantial portion of this spending is typically financed through borrowing, directly contributing to the national debt. This isn’t merely an accounting entry; it represents future obligations and potential strain on the nation’s fiscal health. Economic Ramifications: Historically, significant increases in national debt have raised concerns about currency debasement and inflation. When a government prints more money or borrows heavily to fund its expenditures, the purchasing power of its currency can diminish over time. This weakening dollar scenario is precisely what many analysts are pointing to as a bullish signal for assets designed to resist such pressures. The growing skepticism toward U.S. fiscal management, fueled by continuous debt accumulation, creates a compelling backdrop for alternative asset classes. Investors are increasingly seeking shelters from potential economic storms, and this is where Bitcoin steps into the limelight. Why is Bitcoin Digital Gold Now More Relevant Than Ever? The concept of Bitcoin digital gold isn’t new, but its resonance deepens with every trillion added to the national debt. For centuries, physical gold has been the go-to asset for preserving wealth during times of economic uncertainty, primarily due to its scarcity and universal acceptance. Bitcoin, with its finite supply cap of 21 million coins and decentralized nature, mirrors many of gold’s appealing characteristics in the digital realm. The escalating US national debt and the specter of inflation make Bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge particularly attractive. When traditional fiat currencies lose value, assets that are independent of government control and have verifiable scarcity tend to perform well. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Physical Gold Bitcoin (BTC) Scarcity Limited geological supply, difficult to extract. Capped at 21 million coins, mathematically enforced. Divisibility Can be melted and re-cast, but cumbersome. Highly divisible (to 8 decimal places), easy for transactions. Portability Heavy, requires secure storage and transport. Digital, transferable globally in minutes. Centralization Risk Subject to government confiscation, centralized storage. Decentralized, resistant to censorship and confiscation. Inflation Hedge Proven track record over centuries. Emerging track record, strong narrative against fiat debasement. As the dollar weakens and concerns about fiat currency debasement mount, Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value grows stronger. It offers an alternative that is not subject to the same fiscal policies or printing presses that can devalue traditional currencies. Broader Crypto Market Impact: Beyond Bitcoin While Bitcoin often captures the headlines, the implications of such significant macroeconomic shifts extend across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The “Big Beautiful Bill” and its subsequent inflationary pressures are likely to generate a broader crypto market impact . Ethereum (ETH) , as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the backbone of a vast decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, is poised to benefit significantly. Its utility as a platform for smart contracts, NFTs, and decentralized applications makes it a prime candidate for capital reallocation. As investors seek alternatives to traditional bonds and low-yield savings accounts, the innovative potential of Ethereum and other Ethereum altcoins becomes increasingly attractive. The capital shift from bonds to alternative assets could drive broader gains across the crypto market. However, it’s crucial to understand that the impact will not be uniform. Here’s a breakdown: Infrastructure and Utility Tokens: Projects focused on building scalable blockchain infrastructure, providing real-world utility, or enabling decentralized financial services (DeFi) are likely to attract increased institutional and retail investment. Their inherent value proposition is strengthened when traditional finance faces headwinds. Layer 2 Solutions and DeFi Protocols: As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, Layer 2 scaling solutions and robust DeFi protocols will likely see enhanced interest due to their ability to offer efficient and cost-effective transactions within a decentralized framework. Memecoins and Highly Speculative Assets: Conversely, highly speculative assets like memecoins, which often derive their value from community sentiment and viral trends rather than fundamental utility, could face heightened volatility. While they might experience short-term pumps, their lack of intrinsic value makes them more susceptible to market downturns when broader economic uncertainty prevails. Investors may become more risk-averse, favoring assets with clearer use cases and stronger underlying technology. This macro-economic shift could usher in a new wave of capital into the crypto space, not just from crypto-native investors, but from traditional finance participants looking for new ways to preserve and grow wealth. Navigating the Shifting Tides: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Investor? For individuals and institutions alike, understanding these macroeconomic currents is paramount to making informed investment decisions. The strengthening of Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative and the broader positive crypto market impact present both opportunities and challenges. Benefits: Portfolio Diversification: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, offer a unique uncorrelated asset class that can act as a hedge against traditional market downturns and fiat currency debasement. Potential for Appreciation: As more capital flows into the space, driven by inflation concerns and a weakening dollar, the demand for scarce digital assets could lead to significant price appreciation. Innovation and Growth: The shift could accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology and decentralized finance, fostering further innovation and creating new investment avenues within the crypto ecosystem. Challenges: Volatility: While the long-term outlook may be positive, cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile. Investors must be prepared for significant price swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate digital assets. New regulations could introduce unforeseen challenges or opportunities. Market Manipulation: The relatively nascent nature of the crypto market makes it susceptible to manipulation, though increasing institutional participation is helping to mature the market. Actionable Insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing, thoroughly research any cryptocurrency or project. Understand its fundamentals, use case, and team. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market fluctuations. This strategy can mitigate the impact of volatility. Diversify Your Crypto Portfolio: While Bitcoin and Ethereum are strong contenders, explore other promising altcoins with solid use cases and technological foundations. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of macroeconomic developments, regulatory news, and technological advancements within the crypto space. The current economic climate, marked by increasing US national debt and inflationary pressures, underscores the growing importance of assets that can act as a reliable inflation hedge . Bitcoin’s unique properties position it as a front-runner in this new financial paradigm. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto’s Role in Global Finance The passage of the “Big Beautiful Bill” by the U.S. Senate is more than just a legislative event; it’s a profound economic signal. The inevitable rise in national debt and the mounting concerns over inflation are strengthening the narrative of Bitcoin digital gold , positioning it as an increasingly vital asset in a world grappling with fiscal uncertainty. The broader crypto market impact is undeniable, with Ethereum and other utility-focused altcoins poised to attract significant capital as investors seek refuge and growth outside traditional financial instruments. While volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto space, the underlying macroeconomic forces are building a compelling case for its long-term relevance. We are witnessing a pivotal moment where digital assets are no longer just speculative curiosities but are solidifying their role as legitimate contenders for wealth preservation and growth in the global financial landscape. The future of finance is rapidly evolving, and cryptocurrencies are at its very heart.

2025-07-02T11:20:03,"Are Meme Coins Set to Crash Again as Bitcoin Loses This Key Holding Level?","In the latest price drop, meme coins lost traction and now paint a serious red. Still, Dex gems experience massive profit growth. As fearful as it may sound, Bitcoin just lost a key holding level of $107k after days of consolidation, triggered by a sharp rejection from a three-week high lately. Due to that, the price is down today with large-cap altcoins showing signs of bearishness. While low caps are painting serious bearish scenarios, meme coins are expected to suffer significant losses as the primary crypto signals a sell-off. In reaction to that, Doge just dipped below $0.16, with others posting substantial losses since yesterday. Memecoins Market Cap Drops as Crypto Cycle Nears Top With numerous on-chain metrics hinting market cycle is nearing the top, some major meme coins like Doge , Shiba and Pepe are already trading far from their recent all-time highs (ATH) after experiencing a huge crash in the first quarter. Although they recovered briefly in the second quarter of the year, and later rolled over due to growing supply. That period marked a new milestone for Bitcoin as it set a new ATH, but a sudden halt in demand has raised a question of whether it will reclaim that peak or not. From the look of things, it will likely suspend bullish following a new sell order targeted at the crucial $100k level. Potential Meme Coins Crash? As Bitcoin usually dictates the mood and direction of the market from inception, sector like the meme coin is expected to feel the heat most as many assets here may collapse to new lows and bottoms as the general market structure enters an overbought condition. Only a few tokens with a strongly driven community base will survive the coming recession. Ranging from Aura, Vader, Mori and Bone, which are wildly reacting to the latest drop in the past hours, a few meme tokens like Broccoli, Pengu and Osak are defying the market odds with notable gains on both daily and weekly scales. While some trending tokens on Alpha have cooled off, Bobby The Cat, Gold Digger and Wind are exploding massively in terms of profits on the Dex. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-07-02T11:15:04,"Tom Lee Explains Why Bitcoin Price Is Not Moving Despite Institutional Demand","Fundstrat’s CIO, Tom Lee, has given his expert opinion on the recent Bitcoin price stagnation despite growing institutional demand. Lee, who was recently appointed the chairman of BitMine, shared his thoughts on CNBC’s ETF Edge on Tuesday after a slow start to the month for Bitcoin. The pioneering cryptocurrency dropped to $105,159 on Tuesday, sparking a broader market shake-off, but has reclaimed $107,000 at the time of writing.Why Bitcoin Price Has StagnatedThe Fundstrat CIO highlighted that the US Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been one of the most successful ETF launches in history. The investment vehicles have collectively attracted $48.6 billion since their launch, as demand for Bitcoin exposure reaches unprecedented levels.Meanwhile, aside from the $342 million net outflow on July 1, the Bitcoin spot ETFs had been on a 15-day inflow streak, with their last outflow before yesterday occurring on June 6. These inflows have resulted in the products accumulating a net asset of $131 billion, which is approximately 6% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization.Yet, Bitcoin has not mooned from the inflows as many expect. Lee noted that one of the reasons behind this price stagnation could be how these ETFs receive their inflows.Specifically, he noted that some of them may have been receiving an in-kind exchange from customers who already own Bitcoin . This type of transaction involves moving Bitcoin from cold wallets to the asset manager’s wallet and does not require active purchasing.Lee called such transactions a “wash,” insisting it would not move Bitcoin’s price. Notably, Bitcoin’s price follows a simple demand-supply mechanism, and such transfers do not bring new demand pressure. As a result, the price continues to range.Selling Retailers Neutralizing Institutional DemandFurthermore, the long-standing Bitcoin proponent blamed the price stagnation on Bitcoin OGs who are sitting on massive profits. He highlighted that early retailers who acquired the crypto leader at significantly lower prices than its current level could be taking profit. “They don’t care if Bitcoin goes to a million; they are probably sellers at around a hundred thousand,” Lee said.As a result, this selling pressure has countered the demands from institutions, slowing down Bitcoin’s price. Interestingly, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared a similar sentiment earlier, highlighting Bitcoin’s trend around $100,000 as a possible reason for this bearish sentiment.Horsley noted that these profit-taking individuals would reconsider their selling disposition when Bitcoin rallies higher, probably to between $130,000 and $150,000. At that price, he suggested that no one would sell their Bitcoin.Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to hover around its current all-time high, specifically trading at $107,420. Earlier analysis suggests that this emerging mainstream demand for BTC could drive prices to $200,000 before the end of 2025 and $1 million by the end of this cycle.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/02/tom-lee-explains-why-bitcoin-price-is-not-moving-despite-institutional-demand/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=tom-lee-explains-why-bitcoin-price-is-not-moving-despite-institutional-demand,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T11:14:36,"ECB Plans Crypto Ledger Technology as CBDCs Advance: Choose Best Wallet Custody Instead","The European Central Bank (ECB) is planning distributed ledger technology (DLT) for financial settlement, which shows a good intention to modernize the Eurozone’s financial infrastructure. How will they do it? Through a ‘dual-track strategy’ that explores immediate and long-term applications of DLT. While the developments will bring novel technology into traditional finance, the conversation around Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) also intensifies. It begs several questions, mostly regarding financial autonomy and privacy, especially when contrasted with solutions like Best Wallet . ECB’s Dual-Track DLT Strategy and the Rise of CBDCs The ECB’s dual-track strategy involves two distinct initiatives, ‘Pontes’ and ‘Appia’. 1. The Short-term Track (Pontes) It links DLT platforms and existing TARGET Services for the settlement of wholesale transactions in central bank money. This approach seeks to leverage DLT to improve efficiency and security within the current financial framework. 2. The long-term vision (Appia) It shapes a future-ready, innovative, and integrated financial ecosystem within Europe and eventually globally. This long-term track suggests a more fundamental rethink of the market infrastructure. Which potentially invites tokenized assets and more sophisticated DLT applications. The duality in approach shows a forward-looking perspective on digital assets. Simultaneously, central banks (including the ECB) are actively investigating and developing CBDCs. The digital euro, for instance, wants to have a foundation by October 2025. You might argue that CBDCs are more secure and efficient, and might replace cash in an increasingly cashless society. Their goal – to enable faster interbank settlements, improve cross-border payments, and strengthen monetary sovereignty, of course. But. And there’s a big but here. The push for CBDCs comes with some significant privacy concerns. For one, centralized control from banks—they’ll theoretically see all your transactions and potentially impose limitations on your account. These contrast sharply with the inherent privacy and control offered by self-custody solutions like Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets). Best Wallet: Your Shield Against Centralized Control CBDCs inherently allow for surveillance and potential control over your financial transactions. This doesn’t happen with cash or decentralized crypto transactions. And it’s also where Best Wallet’s self-custody solution shines, offering true financial freedom. Best Wallet is a non-custodial platform that puts the control back into your hands. No more third parties that can freeze or control your transactions, it’s all you. You also eliminate third-party risk, no longer worrying about hacks or insolvency affecting CEXs. Best Wallet made our list of top anonymous crypto wallets for its security, including its Fireblocks MPC, which splits your private key into several shards shared between several parties. Unlocking Exclusive Advantages with the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Think of Best Wallet as your vehicle to complete financial control. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the key that unlocks a world of exclusive benefits. Holding $BEST offers significantly reduced transaction fees. You’ll also get enhanced staking rewards, which maximizes your earnings on your staked assets, and early access to high-potential crypto presales in the ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section. With this, you can be among the first to invest in promising new projects, potentially front-running the market. Furthermore, you’ll receive priority access to new features like the Best Card, which will allow you to seamlessly spend your cryptocurrency anywhere Mastercard is accepted. In the future, you’ll also gain governance rights, influencing the future direction of the Best Wallet platform as the ecosystem evolves. You can buy $BEST for $0.025265, but a price increase is imminent. We predict it will reach $0.072 by the end of 2025, which will see an ROI of 184. The Future of Finance: Centralization vs. Self-Custody The ECB’s DLT and CBDC advancements aim to modernize finance but raise privacy concerns. Best Wallet offers a self-custody alternative, providing financial freedom and control over your digital assets. Holding $BEST unlocks even more benefits, providing further incentive. As finance evolves, understanding the implications of centralized versus self-custody solutions is crucial.

2025-07-02T11:10:15,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Face Crucial Outflow, Ending Remarkable Inflow Streak","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Face Crucial Outflow, Ending Remarkable Inflow Streak The world of cryptocurrency investment often moves at a breakneck pace, and recent developments in the realm of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs have certainly kept investors on their toes. After a remarkable run of 15 consecutive trading days witnessing net inflows, the market experienced a significant shift on July 1st, recording a net outflow of $342.25 million. This abrupt halt to a bullish trend has naturally sparked conversations about the immediate future of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset landscape. What does this sudden reversal signify, and how might it influence investor sentiment? What Triggered the Recent Bitcoin ETF Outflows? The latest data, compiled by Trader T, paints a clear picture of a day where capital moved away from these popular investment vehicles. Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge in withdrawals, seeing a substantial $172.73 million exit the fund. Grayscale’s GBTC, a long-standing player in the space, also experienced significant withdrawals totaling $119.51 million. Not to be left out, ARK Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB recorded outflows of $27.03 million and $22.98 million, respectively. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day. This sudden reversal in Bitcoin ETF Outflows raises immediate questions. While a single day’s activity doesn’t define a long-term trend, it’s crucial to understand the potential factors at play. One common explanation for such movements is profit-taking. After a sustained period of inflows, some investors may have decided to realize gains, especially if Bitcoin’s price had seen a recent appreciation. Another factor could be a general shift in market sentiment, perhaps influenced by broader macroeconomic concerns or anticipation of upcoming economic data that could impact risk assets. ETF Ticker Fund Name Outflow (Millions USD) FBTC Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund $172.73 GBTC Grayscale Bitcoin Trust $119.51 ARKB ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF $27.03 BITB Bitwise Bitcoin ETF $22.98 Others Various $0.00 Total Net Outflow $342.25 Understanding the Significance: End of a Remarkable Inflow Streak The 15-day inflow streak that preceded this outflow was a significant indicator of growing institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin through regulated investment products. The launch of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was hailed as a landmark event, opening up Bitcoin exposure to a wider range of investors who prefer traditional brokerage accounts. This sustained period of inflows underscored confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class and signaled increasing mainstream adoption. The cessation of this streak, while a minor blip in the grand scheme of Bitcoin’s history, serves as a reminder of market volatility and the dynamic nature of investment flows. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a fundamental shift in the long-term outlook for Bitcoin, but rather a natural ebb and flow of capital. Markets rarely move in a straight line, and periods of consolidation or slight correction are healthy for sustainable growth. How Might This Impact BTC Price and Broader Crypto Market Trends? Naturally, one of the first questions on investors’ minds is the potential impact on BTC Price . In the immediate aftermath of such news, it’s common to see a slight dip as short-term traders react to the data. However, Bitcoin’s resilience has been tested many times, and its price action is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond just ETF flows, including global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and technological developments within the crypto ecosystem. Looking at broader Crypto Market Trends , Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether. A significant movement in Bitcoin’s price or sentiment can ripple through the altcoin market. While this single day of outflows is noteworthy, it’s crucial to observe subsequent days to determine if it’s an isolated event or the beginning of a more sustained trend. Long-term investors typically focus on Bitcoin’s fundamentals – its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing utility – rather than daily fluctuations. Navigating Digital Asset Investments: What’s Next? For those engaged in Digital Asset Investments , this event underscores the importance of a balanced perspective. While the accessibility offered by spot Bitcoin ETFs is a significant step forward for the industry, it also means these products are subject to the same market forces as traditional assets. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor ETF flow data, but also keep an eye on broader economic indicators and global events that could influence the crypto market. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies can help mitigate risk. Long-Term View: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment. Daily fluctuations, while attention-grabbing, are often less significant than the asset’s long-term growth trajectory. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market, while offering significant opportunities, also comes with inherent volatility. The market for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is still maturing, and we can expect to see more such fluctuations as investors navigate this new landscape. These products provide a vital bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, and their performance will continue to be a key indicator of institutional appetite for digital assets. The recent $342 million outflow from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a temporary pause in what has been a period of significant growth and enthusiasm. While it ended a commendable 15-day inflow streak, it serves as a healthy reminder of market dynamics and the importance of a well-informed investment strategy. Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space continue to evolve, offering both opportunities and challenges. By staying vigilant and adopting a long-term perspective, investors can better navigate these exciting yet volatile waters.

2025-07-02T11:09:29,"Pundit Suggests Likely XRP Price When the SEC Approves First U.S. Spot XRP ETF","XRP’s price trajectory continues to spark intense debate, particularly amid growing expectations that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could soon approve a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Market observer Xaif recently stirred the pot with a provocative post on X, asking: “ What will be the XRP price when the SEC approves the first U.S. Spot $XRP ETF? $10? $50? $100?” While no definitive answer exists, the conversation has reignited discussions among analysts, traders, and crypto investors about the realistic upside potential of XRP. XRP’s Current Position and Momentum As of now, XRP is trading around $2.18, a substantial rebound from its multi-year lows experienced during the height of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC. The token’s bullish momentum reflects increasing confidence that Ripple’s ongoing regulatory challenges may soon be fully resolved. What will be the XRP price when the SEC approves the first U.S. Spot $XRP ETF? $10? $50? $100? Let the speculation begin… — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 2, 2025 With the court having already declared in 2023 that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors, and with the SEC likely to drop its remaining appeal after Ripple dropped its own, the road appears clearer than ever for institutional adoption. This optimistic backdrop has allowed XRP to sustain a price floor above the $2 mark, with technical analysts closely watching for a breakout above $2.30. Such a move could trigger a rapid rally, especially in anticipation of a landmark regulatory approval like an ETF. Why an XRP ETF Would Be a Game Changer The idea of a spot XRP ETF is no longer far-fetched. Following the SEC’s approval of multiple spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the odds for an XRP version have surged. According to Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, the probability of approval has climbed to as high as 95%. Financial institutions including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise have expressed growing interest in XRP, some already holding the asset within multi-token funds like the Grayscale GDLC, which itself received SEC clearance. An ETF would open the floodgates for institutional capital to pour into XRP, offering traditional investors seamless exposure through regulated platforms. It would also increase liquidity, reduce volatility over time, and potentially elevate XRP’s status as a mainstream financial asset. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously emphasized that ETFs are key to bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, and the approval of one for XRP would be seen as a strong endorsement of its utility and long-term potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculative Targets: How High Can XRP Really Go? In light of a possible ETF approval, speculation about price targets has reached new heights. Analysts have projected XRP could surge to as high as $8–$10 shortly after an ETF launch, with some models suggesting even more aggressive targets in the $20–$27 range based on historical ETF-driven rallies. The approval of spot ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum triggered immediate price appreciation and massive inflows. Many believe XRP could follow a similar pattern, particularly given its utility in cross-border transactions and the support of Ripple’s expanding ecosystem. Still, projections beyond $50 or even $100 per XRP remain highly speculative. Such valuations would likely require transformative adoption of XRP as a global liquidity asset, integration into central bank digital currency frameworks, or widespread use across financial institutions for real-world settlements. While not impossible, these scenarios hinge on macroeconomic factors, regulatory clarity, and technological infrastructure not yet fully realized. Anticipation Builds as Reality Approaches Xaif’s post reflects the collective curiosity and bullish energy pulsing through the XRP community. At $2.18, XRP remains within striking distance of new yearly highs. The looming possibility of a U.S. spot XRP ETF, once thought improbable is now viewed by many as a near certainty. As institutional sentiment shifts and the legal landscape improves, the case for XRP’s revaluation gains strength. Whether it hits $10, $50, or even $100, the approval of the first XRP ETF would undoubtedly represent a watershed moment, one that could redefine XRP’s place in the digital asset hierarchy.

Here Are the Details","In the latest analysis published by crypto financial services company Matrixport, it was stated that Bitcoin is in the process of transforming from a high-risk investment vehicle to a structurally safe asset class more suitable for institutional investors. Matrixport: Bitcoin Is Evolving into a New Asset Class for Institutional Investors According to Matrixport, Bitcoin’s ideal role for Wall Street is to use it as a “standalone” investment vehicle with low correlation to traditional assets, in order to diversify portfolios, thus providing protection against market volatility and allowing it to be included in institutional portfolios with peace of mind. However, the report emphasized that the correlation between Bitcoin and US stocks is still at a high level of 72%, indicating that Bitcoin is still not completely independent of classical markets. Although this correlation has weakened somewhat recently, this is attributed to Bitcoin lagging behind the S&P 500 while US stock markets have reached record levels. In contrast, the decline in Bitcoin's volatility is attracting the attention of institutional investors, especially those who are sensitive to risk management. Matrixport drew attention to Bitcoin's risk profile by saying, “Another criterion that is as important as return for institutional investors is the predictability and stability of the investment.” As a result, the Matrixport analysis included the following assessment: “The decrease in volatility and the decrease in correlation with the US stock markets make Bitcoin an asset that can be included in institutional investment portfolios. This transformation shows that Bitcoin has evolved from a high-risk speculative instrument to a new generation asset class that is more suitable for institutional balance criteria.” *This is not investment advice.

Additionally, OFAC also listed four key individuals connected to Aeza: Arsenii Aleksandrovich Penzev- CEO and 33% shareholder of Aeza Group Yurii Meruzhanovich Bozoyan- General director and 33% owner of Aeza Group Vladimir Vyacheslavovich Gast- Technical director of Aeza Group Igor Anatolyevich Knyazev- 33% owner of Aeza Group. OFAC’s Action Against the Crimes The TRM Labs reported that OFAC designated a TRON crypto address (TU4tDFRvcKhAZ1jdihojmBWZqvJhQCnJ4F) tied to Aeza Group payments and their illicit activities, which has received over $350,000 in funds. The Treasury reported that it continued to work on combating cybercrimes and targeting malicious actors in undermining the United States’ security systems. [post_titles_links postid=”477585″] Additional Crime Connections of Aeza OFAC also accused Aeza of providing infrastructure services to BlackSprut, a centralized darknet market with more than $900 million in incoming funds. These dark markets have been linked to fentanyl trafficking through the sale of fentanyl precursor chemicals. Aeza Group also hosted infrastructure for ransomware groups such as BianLian (which received more than $2 million in ransoms) and infostealer operations, including Meduza and Luma. With emerging cybercrimes, crypto hacks, and asset thefts, it is crucial for crypto investors to thoroughly follow the universal guidelines and not get thrilled by “too good to be true” offers. As the federal agencies are actively working to secure the crypto platforms, it is also necessary for the users to double-check the guidelines.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is a financial intelligence and enforcement agency within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Its primary role is to administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions that support U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives by targeting foreign countries, regimes, terrorists, narcotics traffickers, and other threats. What exactly is a bulletproof hosting (BPH) provider, and how does it enable cybercrime? A bulletproof hosting (BPH) provider offers internet hosting services with minimal regulatory oversight, designed to resist complaints and takedown requests. This enables cybercriminals to host illicit content (like malware, ransomware, and darknet markets) without interruption, making it difficult for law enforcement to disrupt their malicious operations. How does OFAC identify and track crypto-related cybercrime activities? OFAC identifies and tracks crypto-related cybercrime by including cryptocurrency addresses as identifiers in sanctions designations. They work with blockchain intelligence firms to trace transactions, analyze on-chain activity, and surface hidden connections between illicit actors and their digital assets. This allows for public attribution and aids compliance efforts by crypto sector participants.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/us-treasury-ofac-sanctions-russian-firms-associated-with-cybercrimes/,"REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN","News|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T10:51:14,"Here Is the Timeline to Buy Bitcoin Below $120,000: Analyst","An analyst on X has identified the timeline to buy Bitcoin below a key level amid growth potential. Bitcoin’s price has been fluctuating between $105,000 and $109,000 over the past week. Currently trading for $106,952, Bitcoin is showing signs of a bullish trend despite experiencing significant price swings. As the crypto market remains volatile, Leo Heart, author of Bitcoin Rainbow Wave, has presented new insights into Bitcoin's potential price trajectory.Logarithmic Regression and Bitcoin's GrowthHeart’s analysis relies on a rainbow logarithmic regression model, which is designed to highlight Bitcoin's exponential price movements over time. This model tracks Bitcoin’s price fluctuations following each halving event, which occurs approximately every four years. Historically, Bitcoin’s price has seen significant increases post halving. For instance, after the 2012 halving, Bitcoin’s price jumped from around $14 to more than $1,000. Similarly, after the 2016 halving, it surged from $600 to nearly $20,000 by the end of 2017. The halving in 2020 saw Bitcoin reaching over $67,000 by late 2021.Projected Bitcoin Price RangesMeanwhile, the current period following the 2024 halving (H4) shows that Bitcoin is moving toward higher price levels.The chart also includes colored regression bands, which represent different price zones. These bands reflect Bitcoin’s price movement within certain ranges, with the lower bands typically representing undervalued periods and the upper bands representing overvalued periods.Bitcoin has historically moved between these bands, often reverting to the mean, making these bands useful in predicting future price behavior. According to the projection, by 2029, Bitcoin’s price will likely range between $122,372 and $509,090, marking a significant increase from its current levels. Notably, Bitcoin would need to surge by approximately 14.4% from the current price of $106,952 to reach $122,372.The analyst also notes that it will only be possible to buy Bitcoin below $120,000 until the end of 2028 and never after. This means before then, Bitcoin's price is still likely to be within the lower part of the regression band, and could later surge to historical post-halving ranges. When asked about Bitcoin’s price until the end of 2027, Leo Heart stated that the current price levels could persist until the fall of 2028. Regarding the end of 2025, he predicts Bitcoin’s price to range between $137,000 and $165,000.Analyst Expectations for Bitcoin's Price in 2025Alongside Heart’s long-term projections, crypto asset manager Bitwise remains optimistic about Bitcoin's near-term prospects. On June 30, Bitwise executives Ryan Rasmussen and Matt Hougan and reaffirmed their projection that Bitcoin will reach $200,000 in the next six months. They attribute this optimism to rising institutional demand for Bitcoin, recent progress in U.S. crypto legislation, and growing interest in stablecoins. These factors are expected to drive significant price action, according to Bitwise's analysts.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/02/here-is-the-timeline-to-buy-bitcoin-below-120000-analyst/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-the-timeline-to-buy-bitcoin-below-120000-analyst,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T10:50:10,"Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs’ Bold Vetoes Challenge Bitcoin State Reserves","BitcoinWorld Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs’ Bold Vetoes Challenge Bitcoin State Reserves The world of cryptocurrency is dynamic, and legislative efforts to integrate digital assets into state finances are becoming increasingly common. However, not all proposals sail smoothly through the political waters. In a significant move that has caught the attention of the crypto community, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has once again demonstrated her cautious approach towards incorporating Bitcoin into the state’s financial strategy. Her recent veto of HB 2324 marks the third such rejection of a “Bitcoin Reserve” bill during the current legislative session, signaling a clear stance on the perceived risks of state-held digital assets. Why is Arizona a Battleground for Bitcoin Legislation? Arizona has emerged as a fascinating case study in the ongoing debate surrounding state adoption of cryptocurrencies. For several legislative sessions, proponents have pushed for bills that would allow the state to hold digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, as part of its treasury reserves. The rationale often centers on the potential for hedging against inflation, diversifying state investments, and positioning Arizona as a forward-thinking hub for financial innovation. However, these ambitious proposals have consistently met resistance from the Governor’s office, highlighting a fundamental disagreement on the prudence of such moves. Proponents’ View: Advocates argue that holding Bitcoin could offer a hedge against fiat currency devaluation, provide a high-growth investment opportunity, and attract tech-savvy businesses and individuals to the state. Opponents’ View: Critics, including Governor Hobbs, typically cite concerns about Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, the lack of a clear regulatory framework, and the potential for significant taxpayer risk should the market experience a downturn. Understanding the Vetoed Bills and Crypto Legislation Governor Hobbs’ recent veto of HB 2324 is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a pattern observed throughout the current legislative period. This particular bill aimed to establish a reserve of digital assets specifically sourced from criminal asset forfeitures. While seemingly a logical way to utilize seized funds, the Governor’s office appears to view any direct state ownership of volatile cryptocurrencies as too risky. This veto follows two earlier rejections: SB 1373: This bill sought to create a broader state reserve of digital assets intended for general state investment purposes. SB 1025: Similar to SB 1373, this proposal also aimed to establish a digital asset reserve for state investment. The consistent rejection of these bills underscores a cautious approach to state-level crypto integration. The core concern revolves around the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential for public funds to be exposed to significant market fluctuations. This legislative dance in Arizona reflects a broader national conversation about how states should engage with the rapidly evolving digital economy. The Significance of Digital Assets in State Policy The debate in Arizona isn’t just about Bitcoin; it’s about the broader role of digital assets in public finance. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance, states are increasingly exploring ways to interact with them, whether through taxation, regulatory frameworks, or direct ownership. The idea of a “Bitcoin reserve” or “digital asset reserve” is not unique to Arizona, with other states also considering similar measures. Proponents often highlight: Potential Benefit Description Inflation Hedge Bitcoin’s fixed supply is often cited as a protection against inflationary pressures on traditional fiat currencies. Investment Diversification Adding a non-correlated asset class to a state’s portfolio could theoretically reduce overall risk and enhance returns. Technological Leadership Embracing digital assets could position a state as innovative and attractive to blockchain businesses. However, the challenges are equally significant. Volatility remains a primary concern, as do regulatory uncertainties, security risks associated with digital asset custody, and the need for specialized expertise within state treasuries. The ongoing legislative battles in Arizona serve as a crucial barometer for how these benefits and risks are weighed by policymakers. What’s Next for Arizona and State Reserves ? Despite the series of vetoes, it’s not a complete shutdown for crypto-related legislation in Arizona. Governor Hobbs did sign one related measure into law: HB 2749. This bill establishes a crypto reserve, but notably, it is tied to unclaimed property rather than general state investments or criminal forfeitures. This distinction is crucial: HB 2749 (Signed): Focuses on unclaimed property, which typically involves assets that are already digital or have a clear digital equivalent. This might be seen as less speculative than directly investing state funds from taxes or general revenue into highly volatile assets like Bitcoin. Vetoed Bills (HB2324, SB1373, SB1025): Aimed for broader investment or utilization of forfeited assets, implying direct exposure to market volatility for state funds. This nuanced approach suggests that while the Governor is wary of speculative investments with taxpayer money, she is open to measures that integrate digital assets in a more controlled or administratively necessary manner. The future of Bitcoin and other digital assets in Arizona’s state reserves will likely depend on continued legislative efforts, evolving market stability, and perhaps a clearer federal regulatory framework. As the digital economy continues to grow, states like Arizona will remain at the forefront of these complex and often contentious debates. The legislative journey for Bitcoin and digital asset reserves in Arizona is far from over. Governor Hobbs’ consistent vetoes highlight the deep-seated caution many policymakers hold regarding the integration of volatile cryptocurrencies into state finances. While the dream of a robust state-held Bitcoin reserve remains on hold, the signing of HB 2749 indicates a pragmatic willingness to engage with digital assets in specific, less speculative contexts. This ongoing dialogue in Arizona offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities states face as they navigate the burgeoning world of decentralized finance, underscoring the delicate balance between innovation and fiscal responsibility.

2025-07-02T10:41:56,"Connecticut Bans Crypto Payments and Reserves in State Government","Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont has signed a bill into law that will restrict the use of digital assets within state government operations, signaling a cautious stance toward cryptocurrencies. On Monday, Lamont approved Connecticut House Bill 7082, which had earlier passed through the state’s House of Representatives and Senate with considerable debate. The legislation prohibits the state government from accepting payments in the form of virtual currency or establishing a crypto reserve for any operational or investment purposes. These provisions will officially take effect on October 1, underscoring a clear policy direction away from direct state-level crypto engagement while other U.S. states explore building crypto reserves to diversify their treasuries. Connecticut Chooses a Different Path The bill, introduced by state Representative Jason Doucette in February, also outlines additional requirements for crypto money transmission licensees operating in Connecticut, adding layers of consumer protection while restricting government crypto transactions. This move sharply contrasts with initiatives in states like New Hampshire, which have recently moved to establish state-run cryptocurrency reserves as part of their financial infrastructure strategies. Brogan Law founder Aaron Brogan described Connecticut’s move as largely symbolic amid growing national debates on cryptocurrency use, particularly under former President Donald Trump’s administration, which has expressed support for expanding federal crypto holdings. Brogan noted, “This is signaling that Connecticut is symbolically opposed to cryptocurrency, and to all the states that have established Bitcoin reserves,” while emphasizing that the bill would “do nothing of substance” to affect broader market dynamics. Crypto Reserves Across States While Connecticut moves to restrict state crypto involvement, other states remain open to the potential of digital assets. Texas Governor Greg Abbott approved legislation in June to establish a crypto reserve, while New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte signed a similar bill in May. At the federal level, Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to create a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile,” signaling a contrasting approach to crypto in government reserves. Meanwhile, efforts to pass Bitcoin reserve bills failed in states such as South Dakota, Montana, and Pennsylvania, showing how divided the policy landscape remains across the country. As Connecticut enacts its restrictions, it highlights the ongoing debate within the United States over how digital assets should interact with public finances and state governance.

2025-07-02T10:40:04,"Celsius $4B Bitcoin lawsuit against Tether given green light by judge","A US bankruptcy judge has ruled that Celsius Network can proceed with its $4 billion lawsuit against Tether, a decision that could reshape how collateral is handled in crypto lending agreements. This landmark case, which centres on the liquidation of nearly 40,000 Bitcoin during the height of Celsius’s 2022 collapse , raises serious questions about contractual obligations, jurisdiction, and good faith practices in the crypto industry. The judge’s decision to allow key claims to move forward now paves the way for a high-stakes legal showdown that could have ripple effects across the digital asset ecosystem. Celsius is disputing ‘wrongful’ Bitcoin liquidation by Tether At the heart of the case is Celsius’s accusation that Tether wrongfully sold over 39,500 Bitcoin that had been pledged as collateral. The crypto lender claims the liquidation occurred in June 2022 at an average price of $20,656, far below prevailing market rates at the time. According to court filings , Celsius argues that Tether bypassed a contractually required 10-hour waiting period, conducting what it described as a “fire sale” of its digital assets. The proceeds, Celsius alleges, were then moved to Bitfinex accounts controlled by Tether, further deepening the breach of trust between the two entities. Although Tether sought to dismiss the case in full, the court allowed several of Celsius’s central claims to proceed. The judge upheld Celsius’s allegations of breach of contract and fraudulent transfer, stating that the company had presented a “sufficiently plausible” case to warrant further examination. Tether had argued that the lawsuit represented an improper attempt to apply US bankruptcy law to a foreign entity incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong. However, the judge rejected this defence, ruling that the actions in question had enough domestic ties, including US-based personnel, communications, and financial accounts, to fall under American jurisdiction. This finding significantly strengthens Celsius’s position and sets the stage for the case to advance toward trial. $4 billion at stake in the Celsius lawsuit Celsius, once one of the largest players in crypto lending, contends that Tether’s actions led to more than $4 billion in losses at today’s Bitcoin prices. The dramatic plunge in the price of Bitcoin in mid-2022 severely impacted Celsius’s solvency, prompting the company’s bankruptcy and triggering a lengthy legal and financial restructuring. Following 18 months of court proceedings, Celsius emerged from bankruptcy in January 2024 and has since begun repaying creditors. The court’s recent ruling opens the door for a potential trial that will delve into whether Tether acted unlawfully when it moved to liquidate the BTC without honouring contract terms. The judge emphasised that factual disputes, particularly surrounding the timing and method of the asset sale, must be resolved in court. What does this mean for Tether? For Tether, the lawsuit adds to a growing list of legal and regulatory challenges it faces as the most prominent issuer of stablecoins. Despite its denials of wrongdoing, the company must now prepare to defend its practices in court, particularly those involving collateral management and fund transfers. Tether has maintained that its actions were necessary to preserve stablecoin reserves and prevent broader market disruption. Meanwhile, the timing of this legal escalation comes as Tether expands its footprint in Bitcoin markets, recently acquiring a majority stake in Twenty One Capital and transferring nearly $4 billion worth of BTC to related addresses.

2025-07-02T10:30:45,"Altcoin Season Index Plummets: Is Bitcoin Season Dominating the Crypto Market?","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Plummets: Is Bitcoin Season Dominating the Crypto Market? The pulse of the cryptocurrency world is constantly shifting, and understanding its rhythm is crucial for any investor. Currently, a significant signal from the Altcoin Season Index is grabbing attention: it sits at a mere 20. This low number isn’t just a statistic; it’s a powerful indicator that the market has decisively entered a ‘Bitcoin Season’. What does this mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate these evolving crypto market trends ? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 20 Really Mean? For those closely watching the ebb and flow of digital assets, the Altcoin Season Index is a critical metric. Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index provides a snapshot of the broader market’s sentiment and direction. On July 2, at 00:56 UTC, the index registered 20, a slight dip from the previous day’s figure. This seemingly small number carries substantial weight, confirming a period of Bitcoin Season . So, how is this index calculated, and what do its scores signify? Let’s break it down: Exclusions: The index specifically excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to focus purely on the performance of volatile, independent assets. Scope: It compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. This broad scope gives a comprehensive view of the market’s health beyond just the major players. Altcoin Season Threshold: For the market to be declared in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority – at least 75% – of these top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. This indicates a broad-based rally in alternative cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Season Threshold: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when 25% or fewer of these top 100 coins manage to outperform Bitcoin. An index score of 20, as we see now, clearly falls into this category, indicating Bitcoin’s strong dominance. Index Range: The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a stronger Altcoin Season and lower scores pointing towards Bitcoin dominance. A score of 20 unequivocally tells us that Bitcoin is currently leading the charge, with most altcoins struggling to keep pace or even losing ground against the flagship cryptocurrency. Why Are We in Bitcoin Season? Analyzing Current Crypto Market Trends The shift into a dominant Bitcoin Season isn’t arbitrary; it’s a reflection of underlying market dynamics and investor behavior. Several factors often contribute to Bitcoin’s outperformance: Flight to Safety: In times of uncertainty or market volatility, investors often de-risk by moving capital from more speculative altcoins into Bitcoin, which is perceived as a safer, more established store of value within the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin’s larger market cap and longer track record make it a less volatile option compared to many altcoins. Pre-Halving Rallies: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, historically precede significant price appreciation. As a halving approaches, anticipation builds, drawing capital into Bitcoin in expectation of future gains. Institutional Interest: When institutional investors enter the crypto space, they often start with Bitcoin due to its liquidity, regulatory clarity (in some regions), and established infrastructure (like Bitcoin ETFs). This influx of large capital can significantly boost Bitcoin’s price. Dominance Cycle: The crypto market often moves in cycles. Periods of Bitcoin dominance are frequently followed by altcoin surges once Bitcoin consolidates its gains, and vice versa. We are currently in a phase where Bitcoin is reclaiming its market share. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation, and global geopolitical events can also influence capital flows. When traditional markets are uncertain, some investors might turn to Bitcoin as a hedge, further solidifying its position. The current score of 20 on the Altcoin Season Index strongly suggests that one or more of these factors are at play, pushing Bitcoin to the forefront of investor interest and capital allocation. Navigating Altcoin Performance: What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? When the Altcoin Season Index signals a strong Bitcoin Season, it has direct implications for altcoin performance . For many investors, this period can be challenging, especially if their portfolios are heavily weighted towards altcoins. Challenges for Altcoin Holders: Underperformance: Most altcoins will likely underperform Bitcoin, meaning their value in Bitcoin terms (e.g., ETH/BTC, ADA/BTC) will decline. Increased Volatility: While Bitcoin can be volatile, many altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, experience even greater price swings during Bitcoin Season. Reduced Liquidity: Capital often flows out of altcoins, leading to lower trading volumes and potentially wider bid-ask spreads, making it harder to enter or exit positions. Potential Opportunities: Accumulation: For long-term investors, a Bitcoin Season can present an opportunity to accumulate quality altcoins at lower prices against Bitcoin. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: This period often shakes out weaker projects, allowing fundamentally strong altcoins to distinguish themselves. Bitcoin Gains: If you hold Bitcoin, this is a period where your primary asset is likely appreciating, potentially setting the stage for future altcoin rotations. It’s crucial not to panic sell during such times. Instead, a thoughtful analysis of your holdings and the market landscape is warranted. Smart Cryptocurrency Investment: Strategies for Bitcoin Season Given the current state of the Altcoin Season Index , adapting your cryptocurrency investment strategies is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio Allocation: Consider increasing your Bitcoin allocation, especially if you believe Bitcoin’s dominance will continue. A higher Bitcoin weighting can help preserve capital and potentially generate gains that can be rotated into altcoins later. Focus on Bitcoin Accumulation: If you’re looking to grow your crypto holdings, consider directing new capital towards Bitcoin. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin during this period can be an effective strategy. Identify Strong Altcoin Candidates: Not all altcoins will perform poorly. Look for projects with strong fundamentals, active development, clear use cases, and solid communities. These might be the first to rebound when the market shifts. Consider Staking and Yield Farming: While price action might be slow for altcoins, you can still earn passive income through staking or yield farming on stable, reputable platforms. This allows you to accumulate more assets without actively trading. Risk Management is Key: Set stop-losses, avoid over-leveraging, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The market can always go lower, and protecting your capital is always the top priority. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index, Bitcoin dominance charts, and broader market news. Changes in macroeconomics, regulatory environments, or significant project developments can signal shifts in market sentiment. Remember, market cycles are natural. A Bitcoin Season often precedes an Altcoin Season, creating a dynamic interplay that seasoned investors learn to leverage. When Will Altcoin Season Return? The Future of Altcoin Performance While the current Altcoin Season Index reading points firmly to Bitcoin’s dominance, the crypto market is famously cyclical. The question on many investors’ minds is: what will trigger the next Altcoin Season? Historically, Altcoin Seasons tend to follow periods of strong Bitcoin performance. Once Bitcoin has made significant gains and perhaps consolidated, capital often begins to flow down the risk curve into altcoins. This ‘trickle-down’ effect can be fueled by: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: After a strong rally, if Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or enters a period of sideways trading, investors might seek higher returns in altcoins. Major Altcoin Innovations: Breakthroughs in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 scaling solutions, or new blockchain paradigms can attract significant capital and spark individual altcoin rallies that eventually spread across the market. Narrative Shifts: New compelling narratives (e.g., AI integration, GameFi, Real World Assets) can drive interest and investment into specific altcoin categories. Reduced Bitcoin Dominance: As Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance percentage begins to decline, it often signals that altcoins are starting to gain ground. Monitoring these factors, alongside the Altcoin Season Index itself, will be key to identifying the early signs of a shift back towards widespread altcoin outperformance. Patience and strategic positioning during Bitcoin Season can pay dividends when the market eventually rotates. Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of Crypto Investment The Altcoin Season Index currently at 20 is a clear indicator that we are firmly entrenched in a Bitcoin Season. This means Bitcoin is leading the charge, and most altcoins are struggling to keep pace. For investors, this period calls for a strategic approach focused on understanding the current crypto market trends and adapting their cryptocurrency investment strategies. While altcoin performance might be subdued now, this cycle is a natural part of the crypto market’s evolution. By focusing on Bitcoin accumulation, identifying strong altcoin fundamentals, and practicing robust risk management, investors can not only navigate this period but also position themselves for future opportunities when the tides inevitably turn back towards altcoins. Staying informed and patient will be your most valuable assets in these dynamic times.

2025-07-02T10:30:32,"BTC may be due a new liquidity boost as US M2 money supply hits new record","The wider M2 money supply in the USA moved up to a new record at $21.94 trillion. The money supply has climbed rapidly in 2025, a metric that is closely watched for its effect on the crypto market. The M2 money supply for the USA expanded to a new record, with $21.94 trillion in circulation. The M2 metric closely correlates with the performance of assets, including BTC, potentially signaling ongoing gains for crypto. The US money supply hit a new record, also boosting the global M2 money. | Source: Federal Reserve The metric started climbing from a low of $20.7 trillion in 2023, coinciding with the reawakening of crypto after the years-long bear market. The expansion of the M2 coincides with another debt ceiling crisis looming. The Fed may have to continue with the monetary easing, further growing the available M2 and boosting market confidence. BTC still follows the M2 trend closely Over time, BTC has shown a correlation to both the global and US-based M2 supply. BTC lagged the indicator by a few months, being especially reactive to an M2 supply squeeze. A similar lag is seen in BTC expansion, which lags M2 growth by 3-6 months. On a shorter time scale, the M2 global money supply predicted the April BTC rally, when the price broke out and revisited levels above $100,000. On some occasions, the BTC price rally lags by only 1-2 weeks after shifts in the money supply. BTC has sometimes surged ahead during periods of low M2 growth, but those rallies are now seen as signs of a bubble. If the BTC price moves more closely to the M2 supply, the effects may be a more sustainable trend, when the market has not yet peaked with a short-term bubble. Global M2 money supply expands more gradually The global M2 money supply has been expanding more gradually in the past five years, based on data from the four leading central banks. As of July 2025, the M2 supply is at $93.69 trillion, growing by 7.45% in the past year. The recent BTC growth far outpaces the money supply, based on additional directed liquidity from stablecoins. However, the general sense of growing inflation and stock market exuberance is also translating into crypto expansion. While crypto activity is highly concentrated in the USA, China may also be a source of growing liquidity. The M2 money supply of China has been expanding for the past decade, with no slowdowns even during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, China’s M2 supply is over $44 trillion, more than double the liquidity of the USA. Global liquidity is even more closely watched in relation to BTC and its potential performance in the second half of 2025. BTC is now seen as lagging , while the M2 trends may boost the price to new price peaks up to $150,000 per BTC. The recent performance of BTC is raising questions about the effect of demand. The M2 chart is seen as a potential trigger, where corporate and ETF buying are too small to drive up valuations. The global M2 growth, however, coincides with a period of uncertainty, though still potentially affecting the nominal prices of all assets.

2025-07-02T10:30:29,"Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard","A growing number of Bitcoin and crypto market participants have fallen victim to a dangerous assumption: that summer in the crypto markets is synonymous with stagnation. However, crypto analyst Cristian Chifoi warns that this summer may follow a drastically different script. In a video analysis released on July 1, Chifoi lays out a compelling case that 2025 fits a historical pattern that has previously delivered some of Bitcoin’s strongest summer performances. Summer 2025 Could Flip Bitcoin’s Script Chifoi’s thesis is based on a concept he has long explored: Bitcoin seasonality—a recurring, cyclical behavior in Bitcoin’s price action across the calendar year, especially in relation to the four-year halving cycles. According to Chifoi, there is an identifiable seasonal window from mid-January to mid-March where Bitcoin historically shows explosive movement in one direction, only to reverse course in the subsequent months. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm—Bitcoin Could Explode Soon This pattern has held across multiple years and cycles. In 2021, for example, Bitcoin rallied from $28,000 to $60,000 between January and March before collapsing back to $28,000 by summer. The opposite occurred in 2023, when Bitcoin dumped in Q1 and reversed upwards during summer. “From January 22nd to March 11th [2024], we had a 2x on Bitcoin,” Chifoi noted. “And if the price moves in one direction in this window, it tends to do the exact opposite after that. That’s the seasonality reversal.” Chifoi highlighted this tendency across previous cycles as well, identifying the same trend flip in 2022, 2023, and most notably in 2021. Critically, Chifoi warns that while most traders are anchored to the recent past—recalling three consecutive “boring” summers—this year is historically aligned with a different kind of setup. “Nobody is prepared for this summer,” he said. “Because people only look at the past three years. But those were not the years to look at.” Instead, Chifoi compares 2025 to three historical analogues: 2013, 2017, and 2021—all years that followed a halving and saw significant summer rallies. In each of those years, after early-year volatility or corrections, Bitcoin posted dramatic gains from mid-July into early September. In 2017, Bitcoin rallied 160% in that timeframe. In 2021, the move was 77%. “The common factor in those years? They were one year after a halving, with a post-March reversal in trend,” Chifoi explained. “Now we are in the same window again. And people are not looking at it.” First Crash, Then Surge? The analyst also emphasized that current price action fits his broader fractal thesis. After Bitcoin’s local top at $109K earlier this year and the rejection that followed, the market appears to be chopping sideways—something he predicted back in late 2024. He expects this phase to continue into July 20, potentially ending with a sudden flush to the downside. But this, he argues, would be the setup for the next leg higher. “Don’t be surprised if the drop comes with a lot of bad news,” he said. “Every time there’s a dump before a rally, the media has a narrative ready. That doesn’t mean it’s real. It just means the market is doing what it always does—shake out the majority.” Related Reading: Analyst Calls For Bitcoin Crash As Price Pulls Above $108,000 — Details Chifoi also addressed broader market confluences, notably pointing out similar behavior in the S&P 500, where a corrective move in early July appears to align with his crypto timing model. He expects a pullback in both markets to precede the next upward thrust, targeting a Fibonacci resistance zone that historically acts as a pause point during price discovery. Despite his bullishness, Chifoi made it clear he’s not buying Bitcoin right now. “I already bought below $20K,” he said. “At this point, I’m watching altcoin charts, looking for pullbacks to accumulate.” He expressed frustration at the prevailing narratives circulating among large X accounts, particularly those pushing for rotating altcoins into Bitcoin under the assumption that dominance will rise indefinitely. “This is very stupid,” he said bluntly. “The market is behaving exactly as it should—for the fewest number of people to make money.” In closing, Chifoi cautioned that those who insist on saying this time is different will likely find themselves on the wrong side of the trade. “Only if this time is different will this not play out. But if you base your strategy on those words, I can guarantee you 99% of the time, you won’t make money.” As the July 20 pivot approaches, Chifoi’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s next move may catch a complacent market off guard. Whether or not history rhymes once more, the veteran analyst has made his stance clear: this is not a summer to sleep through. At press time, BTC traded at $106,880.

2025-07-02T10:29:34,"Sui Crypto Technology Rival Bitcoin Solaris Introduces Dual-Layer Blockchain for Instant Wealth Generation","The post Sui Crypto Technology Rival Bitcoin Solaris Introduces Dual-Layer Blockchain for Instant Wealth Generation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the crypto world, where speed and scalability are the holy grails, a new contender has stepped into the ring and turned heads with confidence. Bitcoin Solaris, or BTC-S, isn’t trying to follow the rules. It’s rewriting them entirely. And now, it’s on the radar of everyone from tech insiders to retail investors chasing serious returns. As the spotlight once reserved for coins like Sui shifts toward this rising force, one thing is clear: second-generation blockchains are about to mint a new wave of millionaires. Sui Has the Tech, But BTC-S Has the Timing Let’s give credit where it’s due. Sui made a name for itself with object-oriented smart contracts and fast finality. It’s sleek, experimental, and undeniably forward-thinking. But Bitcoin Solaris is taking that energy and pushing it further. Instead of optimizing one layer, BTC-S is deploying a full dual-layer architecture. That means one layer runs a Proof-of-Work system that ensures security and Bitcoin compatibility, while the second layer operates with Delegated Proof-of-Stake for speed and efficiency. Where Sui tried to be fast, Solaris aims to be unstoppable. Why Everyone Is Now Watching Bitcoin Solaris At its core, Bitcoin Solaris is about wealth creation. And it doesn’t shy away from that mission. Whether you’re a seasoned miner or someone who has never owned a rig, the platform opens the doors to financial upside without the headaches of legacy blockchain bottlenecks. Here’s what sets it apart: A blazing fast 10,000+ TPS capacity through its hybrid architecture Dual-layer design: Base Layer powered by PoW for decentralization, Solaris Layer with DPoS for scalability Validator rotation every 24 hours for fairness and security Fork resistance and cross-layer transaction integrity Ultra-efficient consensus with energy savings nearing 99 percent over traditional mining Notably, the Solaris Layer rotates validators daily and caps them at 21 to ensure efficiency and reduce collusion. Block finality? Two seconds. That’s faster than most centralized services. You can dive deeper into Bitcoin Solaris at bitcoinsolaris.com. Mining on the Go? This Changes Everything If mining sounded like something you needed a warehouse and an electricity bill to do, think again. Bitcoin Solaris introduces mobile mining through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, putting passive income literally in your pocket. The best part? It’s accessible and simple: No need for expensive hardware Rewards scale based on your device, contribution score, and duration Daily earnings calculated with this simple calculator This mobile-first approach, paired with 100,000 TPS capacity on the Solaris Layer, means mining isn’t just for tech geeks anymore. It’s for everyone with a phone. Not Just Crypto Evolution: This Is Financial Liberation The Presale Is Heating Up We’re now in Phase 10 of the presale, and things are moving fast. With the token currently priced at $10 and set to launch at $20, early investors are eyeing a potential 150 percent return. The clock is ticking, there’s less than five weeks left before the doors close. Here’s what you need to know: Already over $6 million raised More than 13,650 unique users joined One of the shortest and most explosive presales in crypto Investors are jumping in to secure what’s being called a once-in-a-cycle opportunity And when it comes time for launch, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery. Everyone’s Talking About It The momentum behind Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just hype; it’s validation. Influencers across the board are digging into what makes this project different. A detailed breakdown by Crypto Show points out why the dual-layer model is setting a new standard. Meanwhile, Crypto Vlog highlighted the energy efficiency and rapid validator rotation, and Token Galaxy called the mobile mining strategy “the biggest on-ramp since mobile banking.” Add to that two separate audits, one by Cyberscope and another from Freshcoins , and it’s easy to see why trust is building fast. Community excitement is visible across platforms, with growing traction on Telegram and X . Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just collecting followers. It’s building an army. Built for Real-World Use The vision isn’t short-term. The architecture supports: DeFi protocols with high-throughput demands Tokenized real estate and enterprise applications Gaming and NFTs with low fees and fast interaction Healthcare, education, and governance solutions IoT integrations and decentralized data markets And if you’re thinking long-term, the full development plan is already in motion. The roadmap includes the upcoming [Solaris Nova app], full mainnet launch, and cross-chain expansion. You can view the complete roadmap here . Final Thoughts In a space flooded with lookalike projects and recycled narratives, Bitcoin Solaris dares to be different. By merging raw Bitcoin power with next-generation scalability, it unlocks the kind of innovation that doesn’t just ride the wave, it makes it. Sui may have sparked a conversation about new blockchain frameworks. Bitcoin Solaris is turning that conversation into action. The result? A fast-moving presale, a powerful mining system, and a platform designed to generate real wealth.

2025-07-02T10:27:11,"Who is Selling Their BTC at These Prices? Glassnode Reveals Bitcoin Profit Takers","About a month ago, market analysts noted that profit-taking on the Bitcoin network was modest. However, that has changed. The on-chain insights provider Glassnode has revealed that profit-taking on the leading digital network is ramping up again. This comes as Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a consolidation phase following weeks of upward movement. BTC Holders Take Profits According to Glassnode’s tweet, bitcoin’s realized profits hit $2.46 billion on June 30, while the network’s seven-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) spiked to $1.52 billion. The SMA, which identifies trends by averaging prices over a specific period, is currently above its year-to-date (YTD) average of $1.14 billion. However, the metric is still below its November-December 2024 peak of approximately $4.5 billion. The spike in Bitcoin’s seven-day SMA indicates that coin distribution on the network is on the rise. Mid-to-long-term BTC holders have been leading this profit-taking spree; Glassnode said investors aged three to five years have realized at least $849 million in profits. This cohort of market participants is followed by those aged seven to ten years, with $485 million in profits, and investors aged one to two years with $445 million. Short-term BTC holders, those holding for under one year, have been cashing out the least gains, at less than $6 million. Interestingly, older BTC holders have been leading the profit-taking for this cycle. CryptoPotato reported a rise in spending by this cohort in late May, which drove the aggregate volume for the one- to five-year cohorts to $4 billion, its highest level since February. While older investors take the lead, the bulk of the volume is coming from this particular group of Bitcoin holders. Whales Are Redistributing Too Glassnode’s latest report is further substantiated by an analysis from the institutional decentralized finance (DeFi) analytics platform, Sentora (previously known as IntoTheBlock). The firm disclosed that wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC have been steadily reducing their balances. This indicates that although institutional money is flowing into Bitcoin, whales are still offloading their holdings. It is worth mentioning that Sentora sees the redistribution by whales as a sign of a maturing market rather than weakness. Older whale coins being dispersed could become a dynamic that would strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Meanwhile, BTC was still consolidating at the time of writing, hovering under $110,000 – a level, which it has remained confined to in the last few weeks.

2025-07-02T10:25:40,"Arizona Won’t Build Bitcoin Fund with Seized Assets, Says Governor Katie Hobbs","The post Arizona Won’t Build Bitcoin Fund with Seized Assets, Says Governor Katie Hobbs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has vetoed House Bill 2324 , which aimed to create a “ Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” from seized crypto assets. The bill proposed directing the first $300,000 of confiscated digital assets to the Attorney General’s office, with the remainder split: 50% to the AG, 25% to the state’s general fund, and 25% to the reserve fund. Governor Hobbs rejected the proposal, arguing it would “disincentivize local enforcement” from participating in digital asset forfeiture, as it removed seized assets from local jurisdictions. Although HB 2324 passed the House with a 34-22 vote, a veto override now appears unlikely. Hobbs’ Ongoing Crypto Caution This is not the first time Governor Hobbs has blocked crypto-related legislation. In May, she vetoed Senate Bill 1025, which would have allowed the state to invest up to 10% of its funds in Bitcoin, calling crypto “untested investments.” She also rejected Senate Bill 1373, which proposed a similar reserve of seized digital assets. However, not all crypto measures were blocked. In May, Hobbs signed House Bill 2749, which amends Arizona’s financial and unclaimed property laws, enabling the state treasurer to manage crypto assets under specific regulatory frameworks — but without using seized funds. Arizona vs Other Pro-Crypto States Arizona’s conservative stance contrasts with pro-crypto efforts in other states. Texas recently passed a bill to create its own Bitcoin reserve , while New Hampshire approved legislation permitting investment in crypto and precious metals. Six more U.S. states are advancing similar initiatives. [post_titles_links postid=”477619″] Mixed Reaction From the Crypto Community The veto drew mixed reactions. While some supported the cautious regulatory stance, others criticized it as a missed opportunity. Crypto commentator Frank Corva voiced skepticism over the governor’s reasoning, questioning whether police departments should benefit from asset seizures. Another user pointed out that law enforcement motivation may drop if local agencies don’t receive a share of seized crypto — a logic Corva found troubling. What’s Next for Crypto in Arizona? With SB 1062 and other proposals still active, Arizona remains a battleground for how digital assets are integrated into government frameworks. Governor Hobbs’ decision has further ignited the national debate over crypto’s role in public finance and criminal asset management. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs What does Arizona’s House Bill 2749 do, and how is it different from the vetoed bills? House Bill 2749, signed by Governor Hobbs, amends Arizona’s financial and unclaimed property laws. It allows the state treasurer to manage unclaimed crypto assets and deposit staking rewards or airdrops into a reserve fund. This differs from vetoed bills like HB 2324, which focused on seized crypto assets, and SB 1025/SB 1373, which proposed direct state investment of public funds into crypto. How do other states’ crypto reserve initiatives compare to Arizona’s rejected proposals? Arizona’s approach, particularly with Governor Hobbs’ vetoes, is more cautious than other states. While Arizona rejected direct investment of public funds or full redirection of seized assets, states like Texas and New Hampshire have approved initiatives for state Bitcoin reserves, sometimes allowing direct investment or retaining seized assets rather than immediately liquidating them, showcasing varied approaches to integrating crypto into public finance. How does the allocation of seized crypto assets currently work in Arizona, given the veto? With the veto of HB 2324, the article implies that seized crypto assets in Arizona are not currently being directed to a new state-managed “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” in the manner proposed. While the specific current allocation isn’t detailed, Governor Hobbs’ concern was that the bill would remove assets from local jurisdictions, suggesting local law enforcement previously retained a share.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/arizona-wont-build-bitcoin-fund-with-seized-assets-says-governor-katie-hobbs/,"BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|ALTCOIN|MARKET","News|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare
