2025-07-02T08:49:22,"Bitcoin breaks through $107,000, is the stagnant period over?","Bitcoin recently broke through the $107,000 mark, surging for the first time after days of mostly stagnant price movements. The surge can be attributed to the aggressive institutional accumulation of BTC or to the victory lap often associated with July. According to data from crypto.news, BTC ( BTC ) is standing just above the $107,000 threshold. On July 2 at 7:30 UTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading hands at $107,111. In the past 24 hours, the token has gone up slightly by 0.2% So far, it has stayed well above the $107,000 threshold, with only brief corrections bringing it down to $106,982 before bouncing back above $107k. When traced back, the token has begun to show signs of a gradual rally. So far, BTC has gone up by 0.44% in the past week and by 2% in the past two weeks. The surge in Bitcoin price has also served to boost its trading volume. Compared to the previous trading day, BTC’s daily trading volume has gone up by 22.8%, raising the number to $26.8 billion in the past 24 hours. This increase in trading volume marks a rise in recent market activity. Bitcoin has broken through the $107,000 threshold recently, July 2, 2025 | Source: crypto.news You might also like: Here’s why the crypto market is at a standstill as tech stocks take flight The last time Bitcoin was able to reach above $107,000 and even surge beyond $110,000 was back in early June, specifically on June 10. But that was before the crypto market got dragged down by geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel as well as the cautious stance towards interest rate cuts from the Fed. Bitcoin’s upward momentum is mostly driven by accumulation by institutional holders, like Michael Saylor’s Strategy as well as other “copy-cat” firms which have warmed up to BTC treasury operations. The strengthening of Bitcoin and other alternative assets like gold could be attributed to the weakening U.S. dollar, which has reportedly been losing its grip as it falls by record levels in 2025 alone. According to a report by Al Jazeera, the dollar index has fallen by 10.8% within the first half of this year. Could July boost Bitcoin even higher? Matrixport analysts predicted that BTC could hit a new all-time high this month, even going as high as $116,000. Based on analysis of historical Bitcoin patterns, analysts have found a consistent period of strong gains whenever July rolls around. For instance, BTC once hit its highest July peak in 2020, rising by as much as 23.9%. The next two years that followed also generated strong gains. Analysts have concluded that the month of July turns up an average return of more than 9.1%. “This creates a clear risk or reward skew to the upside as we head into July,” said Matrixport analysts. Just a day prior, crypto.news reported that BTC was stuck in a resistance zone and showing signs of a bearish divergence. However, it has rebounded back to the $107,000 level and is increasing steadily today. As traders enter the month of July, it remains to be seen whether the prediction will come to pass and whether BTC will finally be able to break free from its stagnation period.

2025-07-02T08:48:53,"Bitcoin Investors Hold Tight as BTC Finds Strong Support at $98K, Glassnode Says","Bitcoin holders are tightening their grip on their coins, with Glassnode reporting Tuesday that the majority of investors now sit on unrealized profits after BTC’s rebound to $107,000. Key Takeaways: Most Bitcoin investors are sitting on unrealized gains averaging 125%, with few rushing to sell. Bitcoin’s support around $98,300 signals strong confidence among short-term holders. Analysts warn long-term holder selling could cap BTC’s momentum despite bullish sentiment. The blockchain analytics firm noted that Bitcoin has found solid support around $98,300, the average price paid by short-term holders, those who bought within the past 155 days, a level proving key in the current consolidation phase. According to Glassnode, total unrealized profits among Bitcoin holders have climbed to $1.2 trillion, closing in on the all-time high of $1.3 trillion set late last year. Bitcoin Investors Up 125% on Average The average investor is sitting on a paper gain of 125%. Yet despite these significant profits, selling activity has slowed dramatically, with investors preferring to HODL rather than cash out at current price levels. “Despite this surge in profitability, investor behavior signals a strong preference for HODLing, as the current price range appears insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking,” Glassnode said in its report. Metrics such as realized profits and new highs in long-term holder supply further indicate that holders are content to wait for higher prices. The analytics firm highlighted that after a burst of selling around Bitcoin’s May all-time high, short-term holders have backed off, signaling they believe the market has room to move higher. Glassnode concluded that a price shift, either above current highs or significantly lower, may be necessary to unlock more supply. The Futures tab adds derivatives context.

Helps you understand positioning and market expectations. pic.twitter.com/jakRiTfi2G — glassnode (@glassnode) July 1, 2025 At press time, Bitcoin is trading around $106,170, just 5.5% below its record of $111,970 reached on May 22. The strong monthly close in June above $107,000 has fueled expectations for another leg up. Still, some analysts caution that selling by long-term holders could be capping Bitcoin’s momentum. Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments said persistent unloading by these investors since January’s spot ETF launches has weighed on the price, keeping BTC stuck near the $100,000 level despite strong institutional interest. Bitcoin Rally Stalls as Profit-Taking Rises As reported, Bitfinex strategists have said that Bitcoin’s surge from $73,000 to over $107,000 since April appears to be stalling amid fading momentum and increased profit-taking by investors who bought under $80,000. The analysts noted a slowdown in spot volumes and weaker buy pressure, signaling a potential consolidation phase or local top. Bitfinex experts said Bitcoin’s next significant move will depend on macro factors, especially the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, and ongoing institutional demand driven by US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Those ETFs have pulled in $4.63 billion since June 9, with expectations for positive flows to continue. Despite near-term caution, analysts stressed that Bitcoin’s higher time frame structure remains intact, with key support levels holding firm. For one, economist Donald Dean suggested Bitcoin is primed for a breakout following tight consolidation near recent highs. $BTCUSD $BTC Bitcoin – Getting Ready to Move Price Target: $130,981 Bitcoin is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf.

2025-07-02T08:46:40,"US Degens Drive $500k Stampede Into Bitcoin Pepe","US degens have just poured $500,000 into Bitcoin Pepe as MEXC just confirmed it will list Bitcoin Pepe after the presale ends, joining BitMart, which announced support back on June 17, triggering another $300k surge. In total, over $16.2m has been raised. At a current price of only $0.0437 and just days left until the final announcement on July 31, early backers might be sitting on the next generational 100x rocket, and new investors are piling in fast. Bitcoin Pepe is building the first-ever meme layer on Bitcoin, with its own token standard, L2, and a vision to become Solana on Bitcoin. At this pace, presale prices won't last long. Visit the official Bitcoin Pepe website to stay ahead. Bitcoin Pepe: DeFi and Bitcoin converge on this layer 2 Bitcoin’s strength has always been its stability, but that same strength has made it hard to build anything new on it. While other chains became home to tokens, games, apps, and memes, Bitcoin mostly stayed untouched, useful for holding, but not much else. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is transforming this situation by providing a platform for activities that have traditionally been off the OG chain. PEP-20, its token standard, enables the direct issuance of assets on Bitcoin, thereby enabling projects that were previously unable to launch there. Not just tokens for speculation, but memes, community coins, and tools that make Bitcoin feel connected to the broader crypto world. Alongside this, a dedicated layer 2 is in the works, something that brings faster transactions and lower fees without giving up Bitcoin’s security. Early looks at the bridge interface suggest a focus on simplicity: wallet support is clear, flows are intuitive, and there’s none of the awkwardness that’s made BTC feel inaccessible. What makes Bitcoin Pepe stand out isn’t just what it adds, but where it does it. Memes, once scattered across faster but riskier chains, can finally find a home on the most established network in crypto—with tools that make everything simple. Bitcoin Pepe is about to go live: What could happen to the price? What started as a niche experiment is now drawing sustained capital, with US traders pouring in $500k. Two exchange listings have already been confirmed. BitMart was first, followed by MEXC, which brings significantly more liquidity and global exposure. Tier 1 listings aren’t typical for projects still in presale, and the timing matters. Interest has also spilled into staking, which stabilizes the project. The initial pool filled in minutes, and a second was launched with 1.5 million BPEP and a 15,000% APY, proving that there is enormous demand for long-term holding of BPEP tokens, a major bullish signal. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Pepe is forming partnerships around its perimeter. Recent integrations with Me3, Plena Finance, and GETE Network point to a strategy that goes beyond memes and into infrastructure: AI, gaming, DeFi, and creator tools. With Bitcoin pushing upward again and liquidity returning to the market, lower-cap projects that sit close to core narratives, like BPEP’s infrastructure on BTC, will move first and fastest. Bitcoin Pepe may still be under the radar, but it’s unlikely to stay there once trading opens and listings go live. $500K inflows, Tier 1 listing confirmed: Is this Bitcoin’s first 100x trade? Bitcoin Pepe has already done more in presale than most projects manage post-launch. It’s raised over $16.2m, secured a Tier 1 listing on MEXC—rare for anything at this stage—and leaked early builds of its bridge, DEX, and explorer interface. At only $0.0437, the presale momentum is accelerating day by day as US degens and influencers are backing the project across crypto X and other social media platforms. And now, the final reveal is one last reveal before the project crosses from buildup to breakout. If recent momentum is any indication, the remaining allocation may not last that long. This is the last stretch before the July 31 announcement could trigger a 100x moonshot. To learn more and purchase BPEP, visit the official Bitcoin Pepe website .

Anyone can take part in mining activities without buying equipment and keep track of their earnings as they go. Created 6 years ago, ECOS has 550,000 users and always provides 24/7 support to optimize how mining works.

Users should clearly understand the hosting terms, delivery timelines, and ownership rights to avoid disputes. 8. Unmineable This mining pool is suitable for mining difficult cryptocurrencies that most other mining pools won’t support. The outlet’s mobile app lets users keep an eye on several mining addresses, review specific info on stats, payments and referrals and customize things on the dashboard with private and theme settings. The location tracking app can be used only if you begin by mining on a compatible device. Risk Note: The platform simplifies mining for beginners, but as it relies on token conversion mechanisms, payout efficiency may vary. Transaction fees and conversion rates can impact your final earnings. 9. Bitdeer Along with its high performance, Bitdeer supports data centers and infrastructure all over the world. You can buy cloud mining contracts easy and cheaply, watch your hash rate in real time and receive updates instantly. The company operates mining farms in the US, Norway and Bhutan by emphasizing clean energy and advanced ways of managing things. Risk Note: Bitdeer collaborates with major hardware suppliers, but long-term contracts may be exposed to market downturns. Users should assess cost structures and potential ROI timelines before purchasing plans. 10. BitFuFu BitFuFu is recognized worldwide for Bitcoin cloud mining and oversees more than 5 EH/s of hashrate and 50 MW of power supply. There are low-cost, adjustable leases with a fast repayment term and a high level of uptime, reaching 95% and above. Mining can start the moment users have their rental miners and they can then opt to own the miner once the hosting is finished. BitFuFu handles every operational detail, so you do not need to worry about being involved. Risk Note: The service offers turnkey mining operations, but the ownership, maintenance, and operational responsibilities should be reviewed in full before signing a rental contract. Transparency in terms is crucial. In closing In 2025, mining Bitcoin and Dogecoin became much simpler because of AI. Noise isn’t even a concern since you won’t need your machines for the activity.

The Paris-based watchdog called on countries to ensure the global implementation of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CFT) in virtual assets. FATF Report for Stricter Crypto Regulation FATF stated that while some progress has been made since 2024 in regulating virtual assets, many jurisdictions still have to combat risks as crypto scams surge. As part of its sixth targeted update, the agency highlights the need for licensing and registration since many jurisdictions have reported challenges in mitigating the risks of offshore virtual asset service providers (VASPs). As 99 jurisdictions have either passed or are in the process of implementing travel rules, FATF released a report on Travel Rule Supervision to ensure transparency around cross-border payments. “To assist global implementation of the Travel Rule, the FATF has also published Best Practices on Travel Rule Supervision today. This report provides examples of good practices that jurisdictions may consider when developing their supervisory frameworks,” FATF said . [post_titles_links postid=”477206″] What triggered it? As of 2025, only 40 out of 138 jurisdictions assessed were largely compliant with FATF crypto standards, as countries continue to find difficulty in identifying the entity behind crypto transactions. FATF states, “With virtual assets inherently borderless, regulatory failures in one jurisdiction can have global consequences.” This FATF report is a response to the rising concerns about illicit risk in the financial domain related to crypto. As the crypto hacks have surged in 2025, reaching over $2.47 billion, FATF appears to be laying the groundwork for safety and transparency measures in crypto transactions. Crypto Thefts in 2025 As the crypto thefts have skyrocketed from 2024— A North Korean criminal gang stole $1.46 billion from VASP Bybit (in 2025), without much recovery. Another $51 billion was stolen in illicit on-chain activity in 2024 These thefts prompted the regulator to urge stricter regulations and action for crypto transactions and norms for VASPs.

2025-07-02T08:05:03,"Connecticut passes law blocking the state from creating a Bitcoin reserve","Connecticut has officially passed a law that restricts the state government from accepting, holding, or investing in virtual currency, effectively banning the creation of a cryptocurrency reserve. On June 30, Governor Ned Lamont signed House Bill 7082 into law, following unanimous approval by both chambers of the state legislature. The legislation, now enacted as Public Act 25-66, is scheduled to take effect on October 1, 2025. The bill, introduced in February by Representative Jason Doucette, advanced swiftly through the legislative process. It passed the House and Senate without a single opposing vote, which confirms a strong bipartisan consensus on limiting state involvement with digital assets such as Bitcoin. The new law prohibits Connecticut and its political subdivisions from accepting virtual currencies for payments or from purchasing, holding, or establishing any form of digital asset reserve. The statute adopts a broad definition of “virtual currency” under section 36a-596 of the state’s general statutes, encompassing most cryptocurrencies in circulation today. Further, it implements extensive regulatory updates to the state’s money transmission framework and mandates that crypto businesses operating under the state’s jurisdiction maintain a 1:1 reserve backing for all customer-held digital assets. The law also introduces mandatory risk disclosures, fraud protection measures, and strict transaction limits for virtual currency kiosks commonly known as crypto ATMs. You might also like: Arizona governor vetoes bill to create Bitcoin Reserve from seized assets The legislation effectively removes Connecticut from ongoing state-level efforts to integrate Bitcoin into public treasury strategies. While some states have moved to adopt strategic reserves as part of broader digital asset initiatives, Connecticut’s blanket prohibition makes it one of the most restrictive jurisdictions in the country regarding cryptocurrency adoption by state institutions. By contrast, at least 17 U.S. states are currently reviewing legislation focused on creating state-managed Bitcoin or digital asset reserves, according to data from crypto legislation tracker Bitcoin Laws. Among them, New Hampshire and Arizona have fully enacted such frameworks, while Texas has cleared similar legislation through both chambers. However, not all efforts have succeeded. On July 1, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed House Bill 2324, which sought to establish a Bitcoin reserve fund using cryptocurrencies seized by the government. Hobbs argued that the proposal could discourage local law enforcement from engaging in digital asset investigations by redirecting forfeited assets away from local agencies.

2025-07-02T08:01:13,"US Bitcoin ETFs end 15-day inflow streak as BTC price faces bearish momentum","Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. saw net outflows for the first time in nearly three weeks as investors positioned cautiously ahead of what has historically been a slower quarter for Bitcoin. According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined $342.25 million in net outflows on July 1. This marked the end of a robust 15-day inflow streak that had brought in a cumulative $4.73 billion into the funds since mid-June. Fidelity’s FBTC led the withdrawals with $172.73 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw $119.51 million redeemed. ARK 21Shares’ ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB also contributed to the net redemptions, recording outflows of $27.03 million and $22.98 million, respectively. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT, the top-performing ETF during the recent inflow streak, saw zero net movement on the day, while the remaining ETFs also recorded no activity. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a third consecutive day of net inflows. On Tuesday, ETH-focused funds collectively attracted $40.68 million. The majority of these inflows came from BlackRock’s ETHA, which posted $54.84 million in net additions, and Grayscale’s ETHE, which added $9.96 million. These gains were partially offset by $24.11 million in outflows from Fidelity’s FETH. You might also like: Dow Jones up 300 points as Senate passes Trump’s budget, Tesla drops 8% The sharp reversal in Bitcoin ETF flows coincided with the U.S. Senate’s passage of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” on July 1, a sweeping $3.3 trillion spending package passed with a narrow 51–50 vote, with Vice President J.D. Vance breaking the tie. Despite lobbying from pro-crypto lawmakers, the 1,000-page legislation did not include any specific provisions related to Bitcoin, crypto mining, or staking, disappointing portions of the digital asset industry. The bill will now return to the House for final reconciliation ahead of the July 4 deadline set by the president for signature. The absence of crypto-related language in the legislation, despite initial optimism, may have contributed to the profit-taking seen across Bitcoin-related funds. The broader cryptocurrency market reacted by dropping nearly 2.3% to an intraday low of $3.36 trillion as of press time. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped close to 2% to a session low near $105,000 on Wednesday morning. According to CoinGlass data , total crypto market liquidations reached $242.6 million on July 1, with the majority stemming from long position liquidations. This indicates that bullish traders either closed or were forced out of their positions, likely securing profits or limiting downside exposure, while bearish positioning remained intact. Historically, the third quarter has underperformed relative to other periods, as noted by analysts. Since 2013, Bitcoin has averaged just a 5.47% gain in Q3, making it the weakest of the four quarters in terms of historical returns, according to CoinGlass data. This trend may be contributing to the cautious repositioning among investors. When writing, Bitcoin had shed some of its intraday losses and was back above $107k, up nearly 40% from its year-to-date low of $76,300 seen in early April.

2025-07-02T08:00:59,"Malaysia Proposes Crypto Exchange Rules Overhaul To Boost Competitiveness – Details","The Malaysian regulator is seeking public feedback on its proposed reform of the country’s crypto exchange framework, aiming to enhance the market’s competitiveness and improve investors’ protection. Securities Commission Seeks Feedback On Monday, Malaysia’s Securities Commission (SC) published a consultation paper seeking the public’s feedback on the proposed changes to the regulatory framework for Digital Asset Exchange (DAX). The regulator explained that Malaysia’s crypto market has grown since the SC’s DAX framework was introduced in 2019. Last year, the total trading value increased 2.6 times the value of 2023, reaching RM13.9 billion, worth around $3.31 billion. During this period, the SC noted that regulated crypto exchanges have faced strong competition from unregulated platforms and avenues, which are perceived as more attractive due to their broader token offerings and better pricing. Notably, the current regulatory framework requires DAXs to list only the crypto assets that meet the regulator’s minimum criteria and have received approval beforehand. Under the current rules, the SC also has the power to impose additional terms and conditions or directions to the regulated exchanges. Meanwhile, regulated digital assets trading is “primarily driven by retail investors, with institutional participation still limited,” leading DAX operators to “play a crucial role in enabling responsible access to digital asset investments by offering a secure and well-regulated environment for both retail and institutional investors.” Based on this, the Malaysian regulator considers that the industry must shift from an entrepreneur-led to a more institution-led industry to enhance credibility and increase confidence towards the market. To further enhance and facilitate sustainable growth of digital assets in Malaysia, the regulatory framework for DAXs needs to be strengthened. This is intended to enhance competitiveness to our regulated digital asset market and better serve investors’ needs, whilst ensuring there is adequate investor protection, which is crucial towards fostering responsible and sustainable growth and confidence in the capital market. Malaysia’s Crypto Framework Reform The regulator expects the overhaul to encourage wider participation of investors and promote better interaction between DAXs with the broader ecosystem of the Malaysian capital market. In its consultation paper, the SC proposes key changes to the current framework, including easing the listing process of crypto assets and strengthening requirements for DAX operators. Under the proposed framework , digital assets that meet SC’s minimum specific criteria could be listed on regulated platforms without the regulator’s approval. This key change aims to accelerate the time-to-market period during the listing process, increase crypto exchanges’ accountability, and expand product offerings. Moreover, DAX operators would be subject to stricter operational governance and control requirements, including criteria related to the segregation of clients’ assets to ensure adequate governance and operational practices for the risks associated with their operations. Crypto exchanges would also need to meet new financial criteria to ensure stronger integrity and resilience. This includes robust investor protection mechanisms to increase confidence among capital market participants. The proposed reform comes amid the Malaysian government’s efforts to boost competitiveness against international markets. Malaysia’s Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, announced in January that the government was exploring policies to regulate the digital assets sector and improve its “outdated” financial system. As reported by Bitcoinist, authorities were considering establishing a clear regulatory framework to “eventually see cryptocurrency and blockchain technology recognized in the country.” Anwar affirmed that he had suggested that Malaysian agencies, including the SC, Treasury, and Bank Negara Malaysia, study how the country can regulate the industry so that the Malaysian market isn’t “left behind” and can safeguard the people’s interests.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/malaysia-proposes-crypto-exchange-rules-overhaul-to-boost-competitiveness-details/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Exchange Rules|crypto framework overhaul|Crypto Market|Crypto Regulations|Malaysia Crypto|Malaysia government|Malaysia Securities Commission|Securities Commission",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T08:00:48,"Altcoin Season Starting Soon? Analyst Predicts 37% Crash In Bitcoin Dominance","The Bitcoin dominance remaining on the high side has been one of the major hindrances for the altcoin season. Going by past performances, the Bitcoin dominance would have to crash for altcoins to have a chance to rally, but with the dominance still climbing, the chances of an altcoin season remain slim. As this trend continues, a crypto analyst has predicted a possible turn in the tide for the Bitcoin dominance, predicting a crash that could give altcoins a chance. Bitcoin Dominance Rejection From Trendline Is Key Over the years, the Bitcoin dominance has been following a trendline that has often marked the point of resistance. This trendline rises from 2017 and has sloped down past 2021 and now into the year 2025. The significance behind this is the breakdown from the trendline and the Bitcoin dominance receding sharply from here. Related Reading: Pundit Warns Bitcoin Is Setting Up Liquidity Traps As It Campaigns For New ATHs Presently, the Bitcoin dominance is still sitting high above 65% at the time of this writing, but this recent rise has seen it touch the resistance trendline. According to crypto analyst CoreCrypto, this is a critical inflection point, especially on the weekly chart. More importantly, this is usually the point where dominance recedes, giving rise to altcoin dominance. Some major developments that the analyst tells investors to watch on the dominance chart include a rejection from the resistance trendline, where the dominance currently lies above 65%. There is also support for the dominance, as shown by the yellow line in the chart below. A break below this support is critical for the fall in the dominance. Another development to watch out for is for rising Ethereum strength. In the past, the Ethereum price starting to outperform the Bitcoin price has often signaled the start of the altcoin season. So, as the ETHBTC chart begins to strengthen and Bitcoin succumbs to sideways movement, it opens the door for altcoins to rally into the next altcoin season. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move In the event of a break from the resistance trendline, the analyst sees the possibility of a sharp decline. CoreCrypto predicts a 36.91% drop to the 42%-45% levels. This is lower compared to previous altcoin seasons, but follows the declining trend of a 50.79% drop in 2017 compared to a 45.10% drop in 2021. “If BTC.D gets rejected from this resistance again, it could mark the start of the long-awaited Altseason 2025,” the crypto analyst explained. “A breakdown from this wedge would likely result in capital rotation from BTC into altcoins — just like in previous cycles.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-bitcoin/,"ETH|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING","Altcoin|altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin Season|Altcoin season news|bitcoin|bitcoin dominance|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc dominance|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T07:47:49,"Bitcoin Slips to $106K Amid Market Caution, Powell Offers No Timeline on Rate Cut","Bitcoin has witnessed a dip below the support area on Wednesday, resulting in the expected quick decline. The descending triangle comes amid Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell having a long-term hold on his “wait and see” approach to Fed interest rate cuts. Similar to the stock market, Bitcoin’s price have become increasingly tied to interest rates and other macroeconomic indicators recently. As a result, escalating tensions between Powell and President Trump have caused BTC and other tokens to slump. The world’s largest crypto dropped below $106,000 on Wednesday, extending its decline by 2.47% over the last two days. Last week, Bitcoin rose sharply by 7.32%, closing above $108,000. However, since Monday, Bitcoin has continued its decline after facing a correction, closing below $106,000. At the time of writing, the token hovered around $106,998. “Rate cut expectations, political tensions, and a declining apparent demand signal some short-term caution,” James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet, told Cryptonews. However, he is optimistic that despite the scenario, markets would experience momentum into Q3. Crypto Markets Dip Following Powell Comments Fed Chair Powell on Tuesday commented on the President’s aggressive lobbying to cut interest rates. Trump has been putting pressure to follow central banks worldwide that have acted faster. During the European Central Bank’s annual conference in Portugal, Powell said that the decision depends on “how the data evolves.” However, he did not hint at the timing of rate cuts. Trump and Powell have been playing a blame game recently over the Fed rate cuts. The President had sent a handwritten note to Powell on Monday, accusing the Fed Chair “for allowing this to happen to the United States.” “If they were doing their job properly, our Country would be saving Trillions of Dollars in Interest Cost,” Trump’s note read. Besides, the President has encouraged Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May. “No inflation, our country’s strong, our interest rates should be 3 points lower…you’ve got a moron at the head of the Fed.

Further, interest rates would have lowered by now if not for the president’s tariff agenda, Powell added. Following Powell’s comment, Bitcoin saw a 1.3% slump, trading at $105,859 on Tuesday. “President Trump is yet again voicing his intent to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and this, more than any other macroeconomic factor, has the ability to cause more short-term financial havoc,” Toledano told Cryptonews. However, he added that these provoke short‑term moves, while long‑term direction is driven by fundamentals. “Bitcoin is only going one way as far as the arc of history is concerned.” The post Bitcoin Slips to $106K Amid Market Caution, Powell Offers No Timeline on Rate Cut appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-dips-to-106k-after-fed-powell-remain-mute-on-rate-cuts/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|FIAT","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Donald Trump|fed rate cut",cryptocompare

Crypto ownership in the US has nearly doubled since 2021, rising from 15% to 28%. 14% of non-owners plan to buy crypto in 2025, and 67% of current owners plan to buy more this year. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are the top three cryptocurrencies Americans plan to purchase in 2025. Crypto mining in the USA In 2025, the US leads the world in Bitcoin mining , accounting for over one-third of global mining power. On March 20, 2025, the SEC clarified that proof-of-work crypto mining is not subject to federal securities laws, removing registration requirements for miners. There is no federal ban on crypto mining; regulation is handled at the state level, with some states offering incentives and others imposing environmental restrictions. The Trump administration’s deregulatory approach in 2025 has encouraged domestic mining growth, but all miners must still comply with federal AML and CFT rules. Environmental concerns and energy usage debates continue, especially in states considering stricter oversight or moratoriums on mining operations. US Government’s Crypto Holdings As of April 2025, the US government holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoins, valued at about $18.3 billion. The US is the world’s largest state holder of Bitcoin, with these assets primarily acquired through law enforcement seizures and forfeitures. In March 2025, President Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile, consolidating all federally held Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies (including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP) as permanent reserve assets. Conclusion US crypto regulation in 2025 marks a major turning point. The old approach of punishing innovation is being replaced with clear rules, legal support, and a national strategy for digital assets. While financial crimes are still a concern, the overall direction is bold, business-friendly, and built for long-term crypto adoption.

Analysts predict a gradual price increase, with potential highs reaching $175 by 2030. Bitcoin SV price (BSV) has been on muted growth trajectory compared to other altcoins. Since the beginning of the year, signaling prolonged bearish sentiment, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has consistently traded below its 200-day EMA band. Despite attempts to gain traction, the asset has failed to show any long-term bullish reversal, raising doubts among investors and traders about its recovery potential. Even it’s a non-profit organization, BSV association, optimistic activities like successful collaboration and hackathon events are not manifesting on the BSV price chart Many ask: “Can BSV Price break bearish trend above 200-day EMA?, “Is BSV a hidden gem waiting for its breakout, or just another risky bet?”. In this Bitcoin SV price prediction 2025 article, we’ll explore the future for BSV Price from 2025 through 2030.

With an average of $86, the BSV token price can hit a high of $117 and a low of $55. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 Bitcoin SV Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Bitcoin SV (BSV) faced challenges as it fell back to April’s lows. Despite previous attempts to rise, the price action remained muted due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and market conditions. But, at the current level, odds are higher that if BSV bulls regain strength, there is potential for a rally; in the short term, it might retest the $35 mark. Conversely, if the downward trend continues, BSV’s price may drop to new lows like $20 round level. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) BSV Coin Price Prediction July 2025 20 27.5 35 Bitcoin SV Price Prediction 2025 In the second half of 2024, Bitcoin SV (BSV) formed an ascending broadening wedge pattern. This led to a strong buying movement in Q4 2024, pushing prices from the wedge’s lower to upper border. Many experts believed this bullish momentum could continue, but the upper border coincided with a strong resistance zone. Consequently, BSV’s price trajectory fell in the first half of 2025, erasing over 60% of its gains. Despite seen attempts to rise in Q2 2025, BSV struggled to gain bullish strength. It ended up forming another declining wedge. Investors had hoped BSV would reach $50 but it fell short, dampening morale. The last significant momentum was in Q4 2024, which is now missed by BSV holders. In April, BSV peaked at $47 but faced rejection at resistance and began forming lower lows. A recent bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMA indicates increasing short-term bearish pressure. Several optimistic factors emerged in Q2 2025, yet price action remained muted. The worsening conflict between Iran and Israel, along with U.S. intervention in June, created further pessimism. Even a ceasefire announced in late June failed to boost BSV’s price. As July began, BSV fell back to April’s lows. However, if BSV bulls regain strength, a rally could occur. A decisive move above the 200-day EMA could provide the momentum needed to retest the $50 mark by the end of June. If this breakout is supported by increased adoption, BSV could target $65 by the end of 2025. Conversely, if BSV continues to decline within the downward wedge, its price may drop toward $24. Nevertheless, a breakout from this pattern and a move above the 200-day EMA or the $40 level could shift the trend to bullish.

At least ten XRP spot ETF applications are currently under SEC review. Ripple-SEC lawsuit resolution and regulatory easing increase the likelihood of XRP spot ETFs. A recent breakthrough by Grayscale has significantly boosted expectations that XRP spot ETFs will soon receive the green light in the United States. With the SEC now approving a product that includes direct XRP exposure, the case for standalone XRP ETFs just got stronger. Grayscale’s Multi-Asset Spot ETF Ushers in a New Era On July 1, the U.S. SEC officially approved Grayscale’s request to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into a spot ETF. This fund includes five major digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP , Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). This marks a pivotal moment for XRP and other altcoins.

2025-07-02T07:30:01,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Satsuma Technology’s Bold Move Towards Digital Asset Dominance","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Satsuma Technology’s Bold Move Towards Digital Asset Dominance In a significant development echoing across the financial and technology sectors, AI-focused software development company Tao Alpha has announced a strategic rebrand to Satsuma Technology . This isn’t just a name change; it’s a profound shift that solidifies their commitment to a robust Bitcoin treasury strategy , setting a new precedent for corporate digital asset allocation. This move highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. What’s Behind the Tao Alpha Rebrand to Satsuma Technology? The transition from Tao Alpha to Satsuma Technology signifies more than just a fresh corporate identity. It reflects a strategic realignment with their core vision and an emphatic embrace of the evolving digital economy. Announced via a statement on Vox Markets, this rebrand positions the company at the intersection of cutting-edge AI development and astute financial management. The original name, “Tao Alpha,” hinted at a philosophical approach to achieving superior returns (“alpha”). The new name, “Satsuma Technology,” evokes a sense of precision, innovation, and perhaps even a subtle nod to the digital “satoshi” unit of Bitcoin, reinforcing their commitment to digital assets. This rebranding is a clear signal to investors and the market that the company is doubling down on its strategic direction, with a focus on both technological advancement and astute financial stewardship. This evolution is key to understanding their broader digital asset allocation framework. Unpacking Satsuma Technology’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The most compelling aspect of Satsuma Technology’s announcement is their reinforced Bitcoin treasury strategy . The company had previously signaled its intent to allocate a substantial portion—up to two-thirds—of its cash reserves to Bitcoin and stablecoins. This latest statement confirms a deepening of that commitment, moving beyond mere exploration to active implementation. Why Bitcoin? For many corporations, holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset offers several potential advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against fiat currency devaluation, preserving purchasing power over time. Growth Potential: Despite its inherent volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, offering a potential appreciation for corporate reserves. Balance Sheet Optimization: For companies with excess cash, Bitcoin can offer a yield-generating or appreciation-focused alternative to traditional low-interest bank accounts, improving overall financial health. Innovation Alignment: Embracing Bitcoin strategically aligns a technology company with the broader trends of decentralization and digital innovation, enhancing its market position. Satsuma Technology’s decision to allocate a significant portion of its reserves, including stablecoins, indicates a balanced approach – leveraging Bitcoin for potential upside while using stablecoins for liquidity and stability within the digital asset ecosystem. This prudent approach to digital asset allocation aims to mitigate risks while maximizing opportunities. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Satsuma Technology is not an isolated case; their move is part of a larger, accelerating trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption . Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square (now Block) have famously integrated Bitcoin into their balance sheets, paving the way for others to follow suit. This trend is driven by several factors: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Persistent inflation fears, rising interest rates, and geopolitical instability push companies to seek alternative store-of-value assets beyond traditional fiat currencies. Institutional Infrastructure Maturation: The development of robust crypto custodians, regulated exchanges, and sophisticated financial products makes it safer and more feasible for corporations to acquire and hold digital assets. Competitive Advantage: Early adopters gain invaluable experience and potentially a first-mover advantage in navigating the rapidly evolving digital economy, setting them apart from competitors. For an AI software company , this adoption also sends a strong message: they are not just building the future of technology, but also actively participating in the future of finance. It positions them as forward-thinking, adaptable, and innovative. Implications for an AI Company Rebrand and Future Growth The combination of an AI company rebrand and a strong Bitcoin treasury strategy creates a powerful narrative for Satsuma Technology. It suggests a company that is not afraid to innovate on all fronts – from its core technology offerings to its financial management practices. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Brand Image: Positions Satsuma Technology as a leader in both cutting-edge AI development and forward-thinking digital asset integration, appealing to a broader market. Increased Investor Appeal: May attract a new class of investors specifically interested in companies with strategic exposure to the burgeoning crypto market and its growth potential. Strategic Flexibility: A robust digital asset treasury provides potential for future crypto-native initiatives, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations, Web3 projects, or even blockchain-based AI applications. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s inherent price fluctuations can introduce volatility to the company’s financial statements, requiring careful risk management. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving and often fragmented regulatory landscape for digital assets requires careful navigation and adherence to compliance standards. Public Perception: Some traditional investors and stakeholders may view significant Bitcoin holdings as overly risky or speculative, necessitating clear communication of the strategy. Despite these challenges, Satsuma Technology’s decision underscores a profound belief in the long-term value and utility of digital assets. Their strategic move could inspire other tech companies, especially those in the AI sector, to re-evaluate their treasury strategies and consider the strategic advantages of holding Bitcoin as part of a comprehensive digital asset allocation plan. The rebranding of Tao Alpha to Satsuma Technology and its deepened commitment to a Bitcoin treasury strategy marks a pivotal moment for the company and a notable development in the corporate world. By strategically allocating a significant portion of its reserves to Bitcoin and stablecoins, Satsuma Technology is not only securing its financial future against traditional economic headwinds but also boldly aligning itself with the burgeoning digital economy. This pioneering step by an AI software company reinforces the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption , setting a compelling example for how businesses can innovate beyond their core products to embrace the future of finance. As Satsuma Technology embarks on this new chapter, its strategic vision could very well serve as a blueprint for other forward-thinking enterprises looking to optimize their digital asset allocation and embrace the opportunities presented by the decentralized future.

DOGE has gained over 2% to over 16 cents since early Asian hours, reversing part of Monday's slide from 16.63 cents to 15.67 cents, according to data source CoinDesk. Per CoinDesk's AI research, the cryptocurrency formed a ""double bottom pattern"" around the 15.7-15.8 cents zone with above-average volume. The bounce is consistent with the recovery in market leader bitcoin (BTC), which has bounced to $107,000 from the overnight low of around $105,200. The double bottom forms after a notable sell-off and is characterized by two bottoms at approximately the same level, separated by a brief recovery. An eventual move above the high logged during the interim recovery, as seen in DOGE's case, is said to confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change. While the intraday momentum has shifted bearish, the broader bearish lower highs pattern, representing a consistent downtrend since the second half of May, remains intact. The daily price chart indicates that a convincing move above the lower high of 17 cents, established over the weekend, is required to invalidate the broader bearish setup. Key AI insights DOGE formed a clear double bottom pattern around the $0.157-$0.158 zone, with above-average volume, particularly during the 13:00-14:00 hours on July 1. The cryptocurrency experienced a steady climb culminating in a bullish close at $0.161, with increasing volume confirming buyer interest. In the last 60 minutes from July 2, 05:37 to 06:36, DOGE demonstrated a clear bullish trend, rising from $0.1605 to $0.1611, representing a 0.36% gain. Price action formed an ascending channel, with notable volume spikes at 06:06 and 06:07 (over 4.4M and 6.0M respectively), confirming strong buyer interest.

2025-07-02T07:04:40,"Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Buys More Bitcoin, Touts $1,000,000 BTC Price Prediction","The author of the best-selling personal finance series Rich Dad Poor Dad is continuing his journey to accumulate a total of 100 Bitcoin ( BTC ). In a new post on the social media platform X, Robert Kiyosaki says that he bought another Bitcoin as he expects BTC’s price to hit the seven-figure level. But Kiyosaki notes that he is aware that the $1 million price prediction for Bitcoin may not come to light. “I realize I could be wrong and a sucker. Would not be the first time in my life I was played for a FOOL. Yet I believe Bitcoin will one day soon… be $1 million a coin. If I am a sucker…. I’d rather be a sucker than a LOSER if Bitcoin does go to $1 million. Nobody likes being suckers or losers… Yet that is what makes life exciting. Think for yourself… Do not listen to my ramblings. I can afford to lose a $100,000 because I have been a sucker and a loser many times in my life… and learned from my losses. That’s life. That’s called wisdom and experience… which can be priceless.” The Rich Dad Poor Dad author also says that while it may be considered that Bitcoin is expensive at over $100,000, he points out that he had the same thoughts years ago when BTC was trading below $10,000. According to Kiyosaki, BTC at $100,000 will be cheap if the crypto king hits his ultimate price target. “WHAT IS EXPENSIVE? I was late into Bitcoin. I waited too long… which may have been a good thing. I waited because I did not understand today’s modern money. So I bought my first Bitcoin at $6,000 a coin. It was expensive. Today I wish I had bought more at $6,000. Today Bitcoin is $107,000 a coin. Again my mind says, ‘That’s expensive,’ but I am buying more. Why? Because if and when Bitcoin sells for $1 million a coin, I will once again be saying ‘I wish I had bought more.’ Even if you can afford only one Satoshi today….I believe five years from now, you will be saying, ‘I wish I had bought more.’ Will Bitcoin hit $1 million a coin? I do not know. What I do know is… I will be saying, ‘I will wish I had bought more at $107,000. At $107,000, Bitcoin was priceless.'” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $105,778.

2025-07-02T06:59:41,"Expert Lists Coming Developments That Could Send XRP to $25 In July","As July begins, the XRP community is closely watching a series of rapid institutional and regulatory shifts that appear to align in favor of the asset. Despite the noise and routine volatility in crypto markets, the combination of legislative movement, ETF proposals, and leadership changes has introduced a unique moment for XRP, according to Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX), a known voice in the space. The anticipation isn’t driven only by speculation. A sequence of confirmed developments now appears to be converging. These include the SEC’s approval of Grayscale’s amended ETF proposal, which would include XRP, BTC, ETH, SOL, and ADA. Remi shared a post from Crypto Briefing confirming this acknowledgment on June 30, signaling that XRP’s inclusion in major institutional products is no longer a distant possibility. XRP $25.00 – $75.00 In July -New Fed Chair -Stablecoin Legislation -Spot ETFs XRP -ISO20022 -Basel 3 -FedNow -FedWire -DTCC (FedWire) -SEC Lawsuit Done We Did It Ladies & Gents We Did It Hide your XRP & XLM on a cold wallet. Take profits but save a little something… pic.twitter.com/6Ku5NDLKgB — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) June 30, 2025 New Leadership and Stablecoin Regulation Near Completion Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made headlines when he confirmed a new Federal Reserve Chair could be appointed “in weeks,” with planning already underway for Powell’s successor. Though details remain limited, the timing coincides with broader monetary restructuring. Powell has refused to cut interest rates despite pressure from Donald Trump, and the appointment of a new Fed Chair with a more favorable monetary policy could give the crypto market a notable boost. Bessent also noted that tariffs aren’t contributing to inflation, which may allow more flexibility for digital asset integration within financial systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In addition, Bessent confirmed stablecoin legislation could be finalized by mid-July. This timeline places crypto regulation in a critical stage in a month when institutional support and infrastructure upgrades are also scheduled to take effect. Regulation of stablecoins is widely seen as a precursor to broader crypto adoption by banks and financial institutions. For XRP, which is already aligned with banking infrastructure through ISO 20022 and Ripple’s enterprise partnerships, this timing is significant. Institutional Infrastructure and Potential Targets Institutional infrastructure is now primed for digital asset integration. With ISO 20022, FedNow, the upcoming FedWire upgrade , and DTCC linked to FedWire, XRP stands ready for broader adoption. Basel III rules may also benefit compliant assets, such as XRP, especially with its legal clarity following the SEC case. Summarizing the situation, Remi told followers that XRP could reach between $25 and $75 in July. XRP is currently trading at $2.21, and Remi suggests an increase ranging from 1031.2% to 3,293.7%. He advised users to move their holdings to cold wallets , anticipating a greater climb in the coming years, and stating that holding 100 XRP would be great, and 1,000 tokens would be amazing.

2025-07-02T06:47:04,"Pi Network Price Will Not Fall Below $0.40, Here’s Why","The post Pi Network Price Will Not Fall Below $0.40, Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Pi Network has seen its price drop steadily over the past months. From once trading as high as $2.79, Pi is now hovering around $0.49. This has left many holders and miners frustrated, wondering how much lower it could go. But here’s some good news, according to expert Dr Altcoin, Pi Network price may not fall below $0.40 anytime soon. Here’s why: The Pi Core Team Controls 90% of the Supply One reason Pi is expected to stay above $0.40 is because the Pi Core Team (PCT) holds around 90% of the total Pi tokens. Since they control such a large amount, they have the power to manage how many coins enter the market and when. If the price falls too low, especially below $0.40, it would hurt the coin’s image and market rank. A drop like that could push Pi out of the top 30 crypto rankings, making it seem less attractive to investors and traders. Will Pi go below $0.4? No, I do not think so. Why? Because the Pi Core Team owns 90 percent of the coins and is smart enough to avoid letting the price fall below $0.4. Dropping below that level could push Pi’s market cap ranking out of the top 30, making it appear riskier to… — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) July 1, 2025 The Pi team knows this and will likely take steps to prevent such a drop, either by slowing down token unlocks or making announcements. [post_titles_links postid=”477551″] Too Much at Stake for the Pi Network If Pi’s price falls under $0.40, it won’t just affect traders, it could hurt the whole project’s reputation. Big investors, developers, and ecosystem partners might lose interest. That’s why keeping the price stable is important for the Pi Core Team. They’ve already shown they can manage the market by controlling how many tokens get unlocked and by making timely ecosystem updates. Price Forecast: What’s Next? According to chart patterns, Pi’s price might aim to stay between $0.40 and $0.70 until the end of August. After that, as the number of new tokens entering the market decreases, the price could start to rise slowly. Unless there’s a big announcement or sudden hype wave, no major jump is expected in the short term. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs Will the Pi Core Team’s control over 90% of Pi’s supply prevent a major price crash? The Pi Core Team’s control over 90% of the supply is expected to act as a significant barrier against a major price crash, particularly below $0.40. They can manage token unlocks and make strategic announcements to maintain the coin’s image and market rank, as a severe drop would hurt the project’s reputation and deter investors. What factors could potentially trigger a sudden drop below $0.40 for Pi Coin? While the Core Team aims to prevent it, factors that could trigger a sudden drop below $0.40 for Pi Coin include: massive scheduled token unlocks (like the 276 million Pi tokens unlocked in July 2025), a lack of real tech delivery, continued delays in Mainnet migration or KYC, broader bearish market conditions, or a significant loss of community trust due to perceived centralization or lack of transparency. How does Pi’s token centralization affect its future exchange listings and decentralization goals? Pi’s high degree of token centralization, with 90% controlled by the Core Team, significantly impacts its future exchange listings. Major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance have shown hesitation, sometimes even running community polls before listing, due to concerns about centralization and the project’s legitimacy. This also poses a challenge to Pi’s long-term goal of decentralization, which is a core tenet of blockchain technology.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-price-will-not-fall-below-0-40-heres-why/,"TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BTC|EXCHANGE","News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

The official notice released by the SEC outlines the role of crypto issuers and the information they must include in their filings. It provides detailed information on how users calculate NAV and select benchmarks to custody practices, service provider agreements, governance structure, and potential conflicts of interest. SEC’s Views on Clarity in Crypto Assets The SEC guidance aims to provide greater clarity for the crypto assets regulatory framework, outlining certain disclosure requirements under federal law. SEC stated that ETP issuers must register their offerings and classes of securities under the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. SEC added : “Issuers of crypto asset ETPs are also subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. However, the crypto asset ETPs addressed in this statement are not registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940.” Was the SEC Notice Necessary? Token ETPs (exchange-traded products) are becoming more popular as big investment firms start using them. With more money flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs , the SEC is working on new rules to better manage digital assets. These rules will require token ETPs to report any suspicious activity to help reduce risks. [post_titles_links postid=”477508″] Key Highlights of SEC Crypto ETP Guidance Provides a description of the objective of trust and tracking guidelines, the issuer’s policies– use and limitations, the issuer’s rights, the issuer’s guidelines on forks, airdrops, and other similar events. Described the associated risks of liquidity, cybersecurity, technology, regulation, and tax. Provides detailed calculation of NAV, describes securities, and defines the roles of Directors, Executive Officers, and Significant Employees involved in crypto ETP. Final Thought As the SEC is collaborating with crypto exchanges to create universal listing standards for token ETFs, potentially allowing users to bypass the lengthy 19b-4 process. After 75 days of review, crypto exchanges can release the qualified ETPs. SEC’s purpose with the guidance is to ensure investor protection, maintain fair and orderly markets, and facilitate capital formation.

It also revealed plans for a $250 million private placement to stack Ethereum as part of the company’s treasury strategy, and its stock surged 400% as a result. The firm will stake its ETH to earn extra income and will measure success using an “ETH per share” model of how much Ethereum each stock share represents. This is very similar to how Bitcoin treasury companies use BTC Yield to show stockholders. Lee believes Ethereum will benefit as traditional finance moves onchain, stating that more tokenized dollars as stablecoins will increase demand for Ethereum. “Stablecoins have proven to be the ‘ChatGPT’ of crypto, leading to rapid adoption by consumers, merchants, and financial services providers,” he said. “We’re kind of like the plumbing of what banks will look like in the future because they will be staking Ethereum on their balance sheet of crypto in order to fund and operate their stablecoin.” We asked @fundstrat (Chief Investment Officer of @FundstratCap ) to explain the strategic decision for $BMNR to focus on Ethereum due to its role in stablecoins. “Stablecoins are the ChatGPT of Fintech.” “They provide a logarithmic benefit over traditional systems.”… pic.twitter.com/nNQ7pKrCaR — TBPN (@tbpn) June 30, 2025 BitMine’s mining DNA lets it spin up validators and “tap DeFi rails, turning a once-capital-intensive operation into a cash-flow engine secured by Ethereum,” said Conner. Meanwhile, ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin is taking a bigger gamble with his gaming firm SharpLink, which raised $425 million to stack and stake Ethereum. Conner concluded that this is just the beginning of the Ethereum treasury company phase, and more firms will follow. “Firms are waking up to ETH’s combo of reserve asset and native yield. Expect the ETH-per-share scoreboard to get crowded fast.” Ethereum Price Dips Regardless of the clear impact on Ether supply and demand this will have, spot ETH prices remain lackluster. ETH has lost 2.3% on the day, falling back below $2,400 during the Wednesday morning Asian trading session. However, it found support there, and downsides were limited. The asset has done very little since it cleared $2,200 in early May, with some investors describing it as a “stablecoin.” Even with the bullish fundamentals and institutional interest in the asset, many are clearly still selling at these prices.
