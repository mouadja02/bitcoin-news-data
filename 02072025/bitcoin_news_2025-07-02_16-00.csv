2025-07-02T13:54:29,"Crypto Regulation In Nigeria 2025","The post Crypto Regulation In Nigeria 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Nigeria usually ranks among the top countries in terms of crypto adoption. The country that instructed banks and other financial institutions to avoid using, holding, or transacting virtual assets in 2017 has now built a regulatory framework to consider crypto as securities in 2025. Individuals can now use crypto as money to buy goods and services while complying with the Nigerian rules related to digital assets. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in Nigeria 2025 What the Nigerian Government is Saying About Crypto? Crypto License in Nigeria 2025 Crypto tax in Nigeria 2025 Crypto Adoption in Nigeria 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in Nigeria 2025 June 2025- Digital Asset Rules SEC released new digital asset rules for crypto asset services providers and platforms while gaining authority over them. While the authorization was granted to the SEC in March, the digital asset rules came into force in June 2025. April 2025- SEC Delay in Licensing Despite regulating the licensing in March, the SEC delayed the licensing for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), citing the “additional due diligence.” SEC jurisdiction was laying the groundwork for a more structured crypto ecosystem in Nigeria, as Director General Emomotimi Agama outlined the importance of level 3 due diligence. March 29, 2025- Investments and Securities Act (ISA) 2025 President Bola Ahmed Tinubu officially signed the ISA 2025 law, classifying cryptocurrencies and other digital assets as securities . This move also reaffirms the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the apex regulator of the Nigerian capital market. Virtual Asset Services Providers (VASPs), Digital Asset operators (DOPs), and Digital Asset Exchanges (DAEs) are now required to register and obtain authorization from the SEC. What the Nigerian Government is Saying About Crypto? While ISA 2025 officially recognizes digital assets and cryptocurrencies as securities, replacing the 2007 law, bringing them under the Nigerian SEC, national banks still retain the ability to disagree and restrict transactions. By aligning the cryptocurrency framework with the SEC, Nigeria is aiming at: Innovation with Security: Nigeria is accelerating its innovation with fintech laws and crypto regulations, and NFTs, while also maintaining the protection measures for investors. Nigeria also focuses on talent development and blockchain development to increase innovation in the nation. Alignment with Global Standards: With the Companies and Allied Matters Act (2020), Nigeria is actively working to retain credibility in international markets. With new crypto and fintech laws, Nigeria is encouraging the use, adoption, and integration of blockchain technology across various sectors to enhance economic prosperity, efficiency, innovation, transparency, security, and trust. Crypto License in Nigeria 2025 Under Section 357 of ISA 2025, virtual assets now fall under the legal definitions of securities, making them mandatory for a license while complying with anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) obligations. All VASPs targeting Nigerian users, whether foreign or local, must apply for an SEC license. This includes: Exchanges Wallet DeFi Front ends Token platforms Custodians Impact of new rules Stakeholders Changes in 2025 Immediate action Retail Users Mandatory KYC, possible delisting of high-risk tokens Reverify identity, read new terms Developers/ DeFi Teams Must avoid “investment contract” classification without a license Review the token’s legal status Businesses accepting crypto Must use SEC-licensed payment partners and issue proper receipts Choose a licensed PSP and update invoicing Foreign Exchanges Must apply for the Nigerian VASP license or appoint a local representative Hire a compliance team and legal counsel Crypto tax in Nigeria 2025 Is crypto taxable in Nigeria? Yes, crypto is subject to tax in Nigeria since it is considered securities under the new ISA law. Taxable Events: Selling, trading, spending crypto, receiving crypto as payments, mining, staking, masternodes, airdrops, and hard forks. Penalty: Non-compliance leads to penalties; to avoid such situations: Individuals must stay updated on developments from the FIRS and the SEC Maintain accurate records of crypto transactions If necessary, individuals must seek professional advice for crypto tax Tax Type Tax Rate Application Capital Gains Tax (CGT) 10% (proposed 0.5–1% on all profits) Selling and swapping of crypto Income Tax 7%–24% (individuals), 30% (companies) Mining, staking, airdrops, and other crypto-related income VAT 7.5% (on platform fees only) Fees charged by crypto exchanges Crypto Adoption in Nigeria 2025 Crypto Adoption Rate: Nigeria is one of the top countries in terms of crypto adoption, with nearly one-third of Nigerians using crypto, marking 32% of the total population. The penetration rate projected for 2025 is 11.66% and is expected to reach 11.83% by 2026. Crypto Revenue: Current crypto revenue in Nigeria is expected to reach US$2.4 billion and is expected to show an annual growth of 3.46% resulting in a projected revenue of US$2.5 billion by 2026. Government’s Crypto Holdings: Not publicly known; policies rather focus on emerging technologies. Conclusion Nigeria has taken a big leap in the digital assets domain, shifting from not allowing crypto to recognizing crypto as securities. Currently, the government is aiming to increase the adoption and user rate of cryptocurrency. If the stability of innovation and security is continued in the nation, Nigeria will soon accelerate its economic power.

2025-07-02T13:51:19,"Bitcoin Price Prediction – $200,000 Forecast Reaffirmed by Bitwise: Could BTC Outshine ETH and SOL in 2025?","Bitcoin is holding steady at $107,568 after up 0.8% in 24 hours, and Bitwise has reaffirmed its $200,000 forecast for the end of 2025. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer, cited three main drivers: post-halving supply tightening, institutional adoption and growing regulatory clarity. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already transformed the market and attracted mainstream capital. Institutions are allocating BTC as a reserve asset, and regulated access has given confidence. Bitwise says this institutional demand is structural, not speculative, and will continue to support price. JUST IN: Bitwise doubles down on $200K $BTC target for 2025 but casts doubt on new highs for $ETH and $SOL . pic.twitter.com/45ojQaLN6h — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) July 1, 2025 Bitcoin’s 21 million hard cap and its perceived role as an inflation hedge make it a standout in a volatile macro environment. Key Drivers: Institutional Entry: ETF inflows are sustaining interest. Supply Constraints: Halving reduces new issuance. Regulatory Progress: Clarity brings cautious capital off the sidelines. Bitcoin Outperforms ETH and SOL While Bitcoin is looking up, Ethereum and Solana are facing headwinds. Ethereum’s high gas fees, congestion and uncertainty over its status as a security are weighing on it. Despite its role in DeFi and NFTs, ETH has yet to show post-Merge resilience that matches investor expectations. Solana, once touted as an “Ethereum killer” is dealing with reliability issues and validator centralization questions. Network outages have eroded confidence, even as its fast transactions and low fees are appealing. Bitwise is cautious on both altcoins for 2025. While stablecoin growth and ETF approvals could eventually turn sentiment around, Bitwise doesn’t think ETH or SOL will make new all-time highs in the near term. Bitcoin Chart Structure Points to Near-Term Upside On the chart, Bitcoin’s bounce from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $103,270 is a continuation of the bullish trend. The price is now testing resistance at $107,832 with a breakout to $108,957 and $110,448. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview EMA Support: 50-period EMA ($106,993) is acting as support. MACD Signal: Histogram is positive. Candlestick: Bullish engulfing near support. BTC Trade: Long: Above $107,832 Stop: Below $105,400 Target: $108,957 to $110,448 Summary: Bitwise’s $200K Bitcoin price prediction is shaping up to be a compelling narrative for the next leg higher. While Ethereum and Solana continue to face network and regulatory challenges, Bitcoin stands out as the strongest institutional-grade digital asset heading into 2025. Volatility will persist, but with tightening supply, rising institutional demand, and growing ETF inflows, the fundamentals and momentum remain firmly on Bitcoin’s side. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.8M Hard Cap as Presale Enters Final Hours With Bitcoin trading near $107,000, investor focus is shifting toward BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a rising altcoin that is nearly fully allocated during its presale. As of today, the project has raised $7,900,293 of its $8,873,431 target, leaving under $1 million to be raised before the token price moves to the next tier. Currently priced at $0.002585, early buyers have a limited time to enter before the subsequent price increase takes effect. Bitcoin-Linked Tokenomics and Burn Mechanism BTCBULL ties its value directly to Bitcoin’s price through two smart systems: BTC Airdrops: Distributed to holders, with priority for presale participants. Supply Burns: Triggered automatically when BTC rises in $50,000 increments. APY: 55% annually Lockups: None Liquidity: Immediate Total Pool: 1,925,149,417 BTCBULL This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

2025-07-02T13:45:43,"Fact Check: Is Elon Musk Secretly Buying Bitcoin?","The post Fact Check: Is Elon Musk Secretly Buying Bitcoin? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It all started with a like. Elon Musk and Bitcoin – it’s a relationship that never really goes quiet. For years now, there’s been constant chatter around whether the Tesla CEO is quietly buying more BTC, especially during uncertain times. Some even believe he’s stacking to protect against what they see as a weakening U.S. dollar. That buzz just got louder again. Here’s why. The Tweet That Sparked It All A crypto analyst and reporter from Bitcoin Magazine shared a bold update on X: “$400 BILLION WORLD’S RICHEST MAN JUST LIKED A X POST SAYING HE’S SECRETLY BUYING #BITCOIN ELON MUSK IS BUYING BTC!!! ” $400 BILLION WORLD’S RICHEST MAN JUST LIKED A X POST SAYING HE'S SECRETLY BUYING #BITCOIN ELON MUSK IS BUYING BTC!!! pic.twitter.com/yLa6k7x2I2 — Vivek (@Vivek4real_) July 2, 2025 It all started with a tweet pointing out how Musk has been vocal about government overspending and economic mismanagement – but hasn’t mentioned Bitcoin in a while. A reply suggested he might be quietly buying. That’s the post Musk liked and yes, it looks like the like came from his verified profile. Some users were quick to call it fake, but @coinjoined , the original poster, shared a screen recording showing the like came from Musk’s official account. There’s been no official comment, but it hasn’t stopped Crypto Twitter from going all-in on speculation. Timing Matters – Musk vs Trump Over the “Big Beautiful Bill” The timing is definitely interesting. It comes at a time when Musk is clashing with Donald Trump over the controversial “Big Beautiful Bill” – a massive spending plan that includes tax breaks for the wealthy, plans for mass deportations, and a $5 trillion debt ceiling raise. Musk, who was once head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), slammed the bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination.” Trump hit back on Truth Social, suggesting Musk wouldn’t survive without government subsidies and he would have to “pack up and move back to South Africa”. All of this adds to the tension and gives more weight to the idea that Musk could be quietly moving money into Bitcoin as a hedge. Tesla’s Bitcoin Holdings: No Sales, More Rumors Tesla already holds 11,509 BTC, worth around $1.24 billion at current prices. And they haven’t sold a single coin recently, even as Bitcoin hit new highs. That alone is enough to raise eyebrows. In fact, rumors have been floating for a while now that Tesla might be planning to buy another $3 billion worth of Bitcoin. Nothing confirmed, but the company already has Coinbase Prime Custody in place, so it’s well-positioned to scale up. So, Is Musk Buying Bitcoin Again? There’s no official confirmation – just a liked tweet and a very active rumor mill. But with Musk, subtle moves often lead to big headlines. And given the political drama, economic uncertainty, and his history with crypto, it wouldn’t be surprising if he’s once again betting on Bitcoin. Whether it’s a sign of things to come or just Musk being Musk, the crypto world is watching closely.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/fact-check-is-elon-musk-secretly-buying-bitcoin/,"BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T13:45:00,"Bitcoin treasury watch: Coffee sellers, chipmakers, and London financiers make BTC moves","A quiet but powerful trend is taking shape across corporate boardrooms, as treasuries are piling into Bitcoin. Recent data reveals a surge in corporate adoption. From June 23 to 27 alone, 64 separate announcements referenced corporate Bitcoin activity. This involved over 10,000 BTC in total moving into treasury accounts. This comes in when Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is on track for a casual $14 billion unrealized gain in Q2. All credit goes to BTC’s fresh rally. Despite generating just $112.8 million in revenue from its legacy software business, Strategy has outperformed even the largest S&P 500 corporations. Macro fears drive Bitcoin treasury surge With mounting macroeconomic uncertainty, inflation fears, and rising institutional acceptance of crypto, companies from Norway to London to Wall Street are steadily adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. As per the data provided by NLNico, nine new corporate treasuries purchased nearly 5,900 BTC, while 21 existing holders added another 4,126 BTC last week. He added that seventeen firms announced future treasury strategies while hinting at billions in upcoming buy-side pressure.

BTC is trading at an average price of $107,381, below by just 4% from its all-time high of $112K. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 10% to hit $47 billion. As reported , K33 AB, a digital asset brokerage and research firm, confirmed the purchase of 10 BTC for SEK 10 million (worth $1.49 million). This follows K33’s recent launch of a formal Bitcoin treasury strategy and a successful share issue aimed at funding the acquisition of up to 1,000 BTC. The firm now holds 35 Bitcoins. Vaultz Capital PLC isn’t far behind. They’re looking to raise £1 million to fuel their Bitcoin ambitions. They’ve already raised £4 million, swapped it for 50 BTC, and now want to become a leading corporate HODLer. MSTR up by 3,300%, who’s next? The movement isn’t limited to startups, as Norwegian Block Exchange ($NBX.OL) raised NOK 5.4 million ($532,000) through a put option, partially allocated for Bitcoin purchases. However, Green Minerals inked a NOK 250 million ($25 million) structured financing agreement to expand its position. It already holds 4 BTC. DDC Enterprise recently closed a massive $528 million financing package to fund its Bitcoin treasury strategy. This includes a $26 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), $25 million in convertible notes, and a $200 million equity line of credit. Similarly, Sequans ($SQNS) announced a $384 million strategic investment. This included $195 million in PIPE and $189 million in convertible notes, with execution support from Swan Bitcoin. Smaller firms are also making bold moves in the Bitcoin race. UK-listed Anemoi ($AMOI.L) increased its BTC+Gold ETF exposure to 40% of its cash reserves. It cited concerns about the ballooning US fiscal deficit. On the other side, Coffee company Vanadi added another 10 BTC to bring its holdings to 64. The Smarter Web Company also acquired 230.05 BTC. It is now holding 773.58 BTC in total, with £38 million (worth $52 million) in reserve to potentially buy more. Perhaps the most headline-grabbing development is from American Bitcoin Corp, a private company backed by Hut 8 and Eric Trump. The firm recently raised $215 million for its treasury strategy and currently holds 215 BTC. This all started when Michael Saylor’s Strategy started the BTC accumulation race. Its shares are now up over 3,300% since the CEO first bet on Bitcoin in mid-2020. MSTR shares closed trading at $373 in the last session.

2025-07-02T13:40:06,"Bitcoin Investment: Michael Saylor’s Profound Truth on Price","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment: Michael Saylor’s Profound Truth on Price In the dynamic and often bewildering world of cryptocurrencies, few voices resonate with the conviction and philosophical depth of Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy. His recent declaration on X, stating, “Everyone gets Bitcoin at the price they deserve,” struck a chord with many, sparking contemplation on the nature of value, timing, and personal conviction in the realm of digital assets. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a profound statement that encapsulates a significant aspect of the Bitcoin Investment journey. But what does it truly mean to “deserve” a price in a market as volatile and unpredictable as Bitcoin’s? Let’s delve into the layers of this intriguing philosophy and explore its implications for every investor. What Does ‘Everyone Gets Bitcoin at the Price They Deserve’ Truly Mean for Bitcoin Investment? Michael Saylor’s statement isn’t about fate or predestination in a mystical sense. Instead, it speaks to the interplay of an individual’s conviction, time horizon, and understanding of Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. It suggests that the price an investor acquires Bitcoin at is a reflection of their preparedness, patience, and perspective on this revolutionary asset. Consider these facets: Conviction and Understanding: Those who deeply research and understand Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized, scarce, and immutable store of value—a form of digital gold—are more likely to accumulate it steadily, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Their conviction allows them to see beyond daily noise. Time Preference: An investor with a low time preference prioritizes long-term gains over immediate gratification. They are willing to hold Bitcoin for years, even decades, believing in its eventual global adoption and appreciation. This patience often allows them to weather market downturns and benefit from long-term growth. Risk Tolerance and Preparedness: The “deserved” price can also reflect an individual’s readiness to take on the inherent volatility of a nascent asset class. Those who are prepared for significant swings and have allocated a responsible portion of their portfolio are less likely to panic sell at a low point. Serendipity and Opportunity: While conviction is key, sometimes opportunities arise unexpectedly. However, even these opportunities are often seized by those who have done their homework and are ready to act. Ultimately, Saylor’s quote nudges us to reflect on our own investment philosophy. Are we chasing quick gains, or are we building a long-term position in what many believe is the future of money? Decoding Michael Saylor Bitcoin Wisdom: Beyond the Price Tag When we talk about Michael Saylor Bitcoin insights, we’re not just discussing market predictions; we’re exploring a comprehensive worldview. Saylor, through MicroStrategy, has become one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, accumulating billions of dollars worth of the digital asset. His strategy isn’t about trading; it’s about converting corporate treasury assets from depreciating fiat currency into appreciating digital scarcity. His wisdom stems from a deep understanding of: Monetary Debasement: Saylor frequently articulates concerns about inflation and the ongoing debasement of fiat currencies. He views Bitcoin as a necessary hedge against this trend, a superior form of money that cannot be inflated away by central banks. Technological Superiority: He sees Bitcoin as a network, a protocol, and an engineering marvel that offers unprecedented security, decentralization, and global reach. It’s not just a coin; it’s a foundational technology. Long-Term Accumulation: Saylor advocates for a “stacking sats” mentality, encouraging continuous accumulation of Bitcoin over time, irrespective of price. This dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach smooths out volatility and builds a substantial position over the long run. For Saylor, the “deserved price” isn’t about timing the market perfectly; it’s about understanding the inevitable trajectory of a superior monetary network. Those who grasp this fundamental truth will, by their actions and conviction, naturally acquire Bitcoin at prices that reflect their long-term vision, even if those prices seem high in the short term. Navigating Bitcoin Price Action: The Role of Conviction and Patience The history of Bitcoin Price Action is a rollercoaster of exhilarating highs and gut-wrenching lows. From its humble beginnings to its multi-thousand-dollar peaks, Bitcoin has demonstrated extreme volatility. This volatility is precisely why Saylor’s philosophy is so pertinent. Many investors are swayed by short-term price movements, leading to emotional buying at peaks and panic selling during dips. Consider the following comparison of investor mindsets: Aspect Short-Term Trader Long-Term Investor (Saylor’s Philosophy) Focus Daily/weekly price swings Fundamental value, adoption curve Emotional Impact High (fear of missing out, fear of losing) Low (sees dips as opportunities) Strategy Timing entries/exits, technical analysis Dollar-cost averaging, HODLing “Deserved” Price The lowest possible entry, highest exit The price reflecting one’s conviction and time horizon Outcome Often misses major moves, higher stress Potentially significant long-term wealth, lower stress The role of conviction here is paramount. When the market experiences a significant downturn, those with strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential view it as a buying opportunity, or at least a reason to hold firm. Conversely, those lacking conviction might succumb to fear, selling their assets at a loss. In this context, the price you “deserve” is the price you are willing to hold through, demonstrating your belief in the asset’s future. Unpacking Crypto Market Philosophy: Time Preference and Personal Responsibility Saylor’s quote delves deep into Crypto Market Philosophy , particularly the concept of time preference. High time preference individuals prioritize immediate gratification and consumption, often leading to impulsive decisions and a focus on short-term gains. Low time preference individuals, on the other hand, defer gratification, save, and invest for the future, understanding that patience can yield greater rewards. In the context of Bitcoin: High Time Preference: Might buy Bitcoin on a whim, hoping for a quick pump, and sell at the first sign of trouble. They often end up buying high and selling low, thus “deserving” a less favorable price due to their impatience. Low Time Preference: Views Bitcoin as a long-term savings technology. They accumulate it consistently, understanding that its true value will unfold over decades, not days. Their patience and foresight allow them to “deserve” a better average price over time, as they benefit from compounding gains and weather market cycles. This philosophy also ties into personal responsibility. In a decentralized market like crypto, there’s no central authority to bail you out or guarantee returns. Your success is largely dependent on your own research, discipline, and emotional control. The price you get is a direct reflection of these attributes. Building Your Digital Gold Strategy: Actionable Insights for the Long Haul If Saylor’s philosophy resonates with you, how can you apply it to build a robust Digital Gold Strategy ? It’s not about wishing for a lower price; it’s about cultivating the mindset and habits that lead to favorable long-term outcomes. Here are some actionable insights: Embrace Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, commit to investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly). This strategy averages out your purchase price over time, reducing the impact of volatility and removing emotional decision-making. Focus on Conviction, Not Speculation: Understand why you’re investing in Bitcoin. Is it for its scarcity, decentralization, censorship resistance, or its potential as a global reserve asset? A strong conviction will help you hold through bear markets and avoid chasing fleeting trends. Practice Self-Custody: Once you’ve accumulated a significant amount of Bitcoin, consider moving it off exchanges into a hardware wallet. This gives you true ownership and control, reducing counterparty risk. Continuous Learning: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Stay informed about Bitcoin’s technological advancements, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic trends. The more you learn, the stronger your conviction will become. Manage Your Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose. While Saylor is bullish, it’s crucial for individual investors to maintain a diversified portfolio and not overexpose themselves to any single asset, no matter how promising. The “deserved price” is not just a point on a chart; it’s the culmination of your journey, your learning, your discipline, and your conviction. It’s the price you acquire when you align your actions with a long-term, sound money philosophy. Challenges and Considerations on the Path to Deserved Prices While Saylor’s philosophy offers a powerful framework, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges inherent in the Bitcoin Investment landscape: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings can be extreme, testing even the most seasoned investor’s resolve. Maintaining conviction during significant drawdowns requires immense mental fortitude. Information Overload and FUD: The crypto space is rife with misinformation, fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Distinguishing credible information from noise is crucial. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, which can introduce unpredictable market shifts. Technological Risk: While Bitcoin’s protocol is robust, the broader crypto ecosystem is still evolving, and new technologies or vulnerabilities could emerge. Overcoming these challenges requires not just financial planning but also psychological resilience. The “deserved price” often comes after navigating these hurdles with patience and an unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. The Grand Vision: Bitcoin’s Role as a Global Digital Gold Michael Saylor’s vision for Bitcoin extends beyond personal investment; he sees it as the ultimate form of Digital Gold Strategy for institutions, corporations, and even nation-states. He posits that in a world grappling with unprecedented levels of debt and monetary expansion, Bitcoin offers a mathematically sound, globally accessible, and permissionless alternative to traditional assets. This grand vision underscores why he believes every price is a “deserved” one. For those who understand Bitcoin’s role as an escape hatch from a depreciating fiat system, any price paid today is potentially a bargain compared to its future purchasing power. It’s about accumulating a piece of the hardest money ever invented, rather than trying to perfectly time a speculative asset. The journey of accumulating Bitcoin is unique for everyone. Some enter early, benefiting from exponential growth; others discover it later, facing higher price points but perhaps with greater clarity on its long-term potential. Each path, each entry point, contributes to a personal narrative shaped by individual conviction, research, and patience. The “deserved” price is not a judgment, but a reflection of this individual journey and the commitment one makes to the future of sound money. Ultimately, Michael Saylor’s statement is an invitation to introspection. It encourages us to look beyond the daily fluctuations and ask ourselves: What is our conviction? What is our time horizon? And how much do we truly understand the profound shift that Bitcoin represents?

2025-07-02T13:38:50,"Ripple just unlocked 500 million XRP","Ripple has flooded the market with a significant number of XRP unlocks that are likely to influence the asset’s price. On July 1, the blockchain company unlocked 500 million XRP from escrow, well below its usual monthly release of one billion tokens. The release began with the Ripple (27) wallet receiving the full 500 million XRP, valued at around $1.1 billion. This triggered a series of rapid transfers as Ripple carried out its routine token rebalancing. https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1940181423396155545 Within minutes, 200 million XRP (worth approximately $440 million) was transferred to the address “rN8pqR,” followed by another 300 million XRP (valued at about $660 million) sent to “rKwJaG.” Despite these outflows, the Ripple (27) wallet still held 500 million XRP after the transactions. Continuing its monthly token management strategy, Ripple then locked 400 million XRP back into escrow. This re-locking was handled by the Ripple (15) wallet, which received two separate transfers of 200 million XRP from the addresses “rGKHDy” and “rHGfmg,” executed within minutes of each other. Ripple 1 billion XRP unlocks Since late 2017, Ripple has typically released one billion XRP from escrow each month. However, beginning earlier this year, the company began conducting internal transfers before formal unlocks. In March, Ripple created new escrows using existing XRP holdings, a pattern that has continued in recent months. Attention now turns to how XRP will react to the latest unlock. Notably, past releases have had little impact on the token’s price, which has generally moved in line with the broader cryptocurrency market . Regulatory developments, especially the ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission case nearing its conclusion, have had a greater influence. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.17, down about 1% in the last 24 hours and 0.8% lower over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical perspective, XRP is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.27, signaling potential short-term weakness. However, it remains well above the 200-day average at $1.81, suggesting a positive long-term trend. The relative strength index ( RSI ) at 50.04 indicates neutral momentum, with no clear buying or selling pressure.

2025-07-02T13:31:26,"Google Gemini Predicts XRP Price for July 31, 2025","To kickstart July, we prompted Google’s Gemini AI for insight into XRP’s trajectory for the month and its potential price by July 31. Gemini considered multiple factors, including recent momentum, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions, and provided a bullish prediction that could see XRP reach its highest level since 2018. XRP is currently trading at $2.19, up 0.29% from the previous day, and has been showing signs of strength amid a broader market recovery. Catalysts Behind the Forecast Gemini based its response on current trends, XRP’s historical behavior, and known catalysts. The AI highlighted Ripple’s continued expansion into real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, institutional partnerships, and U.S. political shifts favorable to crypto. These factors have created a more favorable environment for XRP, especially as use cases, such as tokenization , become more prominent. One of the key elements shaping Gemini’s assessment is XRP’s regulatory status. Ripple recently dropped its appeal against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expects the SEC to do the same. With the end of the long-running legal battle on the horizon, XRP could be on the verge of a massive surge, as market participants anticipate an influx of institutional investors and adoption in the U.S. once the legal battle officially ends. Gemini also considered the broader crypto market environment, particularly the role of Bitcoin. According to the AI model, XRP’s price performance is partially dependent on BTC remaining above $90,000 by late July. Historically, altcoins like XRP tend to benefit from strong Bitcoin-led market momentum, especially when accompanied by increased liquidity and capital inflows across the sector. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Forecast for July 31 Based on this analysis, Gemini predicted that XRP will trade between $2.7 and $3.5 by July 31. The AI described this as a “realistic near-term range assuming no black swan events or abrupt crashes.” While some in the XRP community anticipate larger moves, Gemini was clear that without additional factors, such as a spot ETF approval , a major rally above current levels is unlikely in the short term. Gemini’s forecast reflects optimism for XRP, grounded in present-day trends rather than speculation. With Ripple continuing to expand its utility offerings and political sentiment in the U.S. shifting in favor of crypto, XRP is positioned for stable growth.

2025-07-02T13:30:58,"Spot XRP, Solana And Cardano ETFs Are ‘Up Next’, Says Expert–But When?","The United States Securities and Exchange Commission on 1 July approved Grayscale Investments’ Digital Large Cap Fund for uplisting as a spot exchange-traded fund, clearing the way for the five-asset vehicle—weighted predominantly to bitcoin but also holding ether, XRP, Solana and Cardano—to begin trading on NYSE Arca under the Investment Company Act of 1933. The conversion turns a six-year-old private trust, now managing roughly $755 million, into what Grayscale describes as the largest multi-token digital-asset ETF yet sanctioned in the United States. XRP, Solana And Cardano ETFs Are ‘Up Next’ For market-structure analyst Nate Geraci, who heads ETF Store and co-hosts the ETF Prime podcast, the ruling is more than the launch of a diversified product. “XRP, SOL & ADA will now be available in a ‘33 Act ETF wrapper,” he wrote on X, adding that the SEC simultaneously issued fresh guidance on crypto-ETF disclosure and registration. “See where this is all heading? Individual spot XRP, SOL, ADA, etc. ETFs up next.” In a separate post he called the moment “full circle,” noting that “after nearly five years of SEC vs Ripple litigation … anyone will be able to easily access XRP in an SEC-regulated investment vehicle.” Just two years ago the agency was still locked in court with Grayscale after rejecting the firm’s bid to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust; the District of Columbia Circuit ultimately ruled that the SEC’s denial was “arbitrary and capricious,” a decision the Commission declined to appeal and which proved pivotal to January 2024 approvals of spot-bitcoin ETPs. That litigation backdrop makes the regulator’s latest about-face especially striking to policy watchers. Momentum around single-asset products is already building. When an X user asked Geraci whether spot XRP, SOL and ADA ETFs were “most likely in Q4,” he replied, “I think sooner, but Q4 at latest.” Separate reporting by Fox Business correspondent Eleanor Terrett indicates that the SEC has begun drafting a “generic listing standard” that would let exchanges list token-based ETFs without filing the customary Rule 19b-4—provided a coin meets thresholds that may include market capitalization, trading volume and liquidity. Under the working proposal, issuers could file a simple S-1 prospectus and launch 75 days later, a pathway that would drastically reduce procedural friction for new products. The agency declined to comment on the deliberations. Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas argues that such a framework would open the floodgates. “This is what everyone wants… and why we’re so bullish—95 percent on most of the coins—for approval,” he posted, predicting listing standards “loose enough where the vast majority of the top-50 coins would be ok to be ETF-ized.” His colleague James Seyffart injected a note of caution, pointing out that “the demand for some of these coins in an ETF wrapper is a whole other question,” a reminder that regulatory green lights do not necessarily guarantee commercial success. Whether the first single-asset altcoin ETFs hit the tape before year-end will depend on how quickly exchanges, issuers and the SEC finalise the proposed standards, and on how fast S-1 filings can be turned around. Recently, Bloomberg’s ETF experts Blachunas and Seyffart updated their approval odds for XRP, Solana and Cardano to 95%. Overall, the question seems to be when (this year), not if.

2025-07-02T13:30:16,"Public Firms Snag 131,000 BTC, Surpassing ETFs In Bitcoin Purchases","According to CNBC, corporate treasuries around the globe have surpassed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions for three consecutive quarters. This indicates a growing interest among public companies to adopt strategies similar to those pioneered by Strategy, especially in a more favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump’s administration. Bitcoin Holdings Surge Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that public companies acquired approximately 131,000 Bitcoin in the second quarter of the year, marking an 18% increase in their BTC holdings. In contrast, exchange-traded funds managed to secure about 111,000 Bitcoin, representing an 8% growth during the same period. Related Reading: Ethereum Indecision Masks A Bullish Setup – Here’s Why BTC Holds The Key Nick Marie, head of research at Ecoinometrics, emphasized that the motivations behind these purchases differ significantly. While institutional buyers utilizing ETFs seek exposure to BTC for a variety of reasons, Marie asserted that public companies are primarily focused on accumulating Bitcoin to enhance shareholder value. The market dynamics have also shown that public company BTC holdings increased by 4% in April, a month marked by significant volatility following President Trump’s announcement of initial tariffs. During the same time frame, ETF holdings rose by only 2%. Marie noted that public companies are less concerned with Bitcoin’s current market price, prioritizing the growth of their Bitcoin reserves to appear more attractive to potential investors. ETFs Still Dominate In This Key Metric Despite the increasing activity from public companies, Bitcoin ETFs remain the largest holders of the cryptocurrency, collectively holding over 1.4 million BTC, or about 6.8% of the total capped supply of 21 million coins. Public companies, on the other hand, hold around 855,000 Bitcoin, approximately 4% of the total supply. The recent surge in corporate BTC accumulation is also a reflection of significant regulatory changes favoring the crypto industry. The last time ETFs outperformed public companies in Bitcoin purchases was during the third quarter of 2024, prior to Trump’s re-election. Several notable companies have entered the Bitcoin market recently. GameStop began acquiring Bitcoin after its board approved it as a treasury reserve asset earlier this year. Similarly, health-care firm KindlyMD merged with Nakamoto, a Bitcoin investment company, while investor Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap launched its own BTC purchasing initiative and plans to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Direct Exposure May Ease Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, continues to lead the charge in the Bitcoin treasury space with approximately 597,000 Bitcoin in its possession. Following closely is Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings, which holds nearly 50,000 coins. Ben Werkman, chief investment officer at Swan BTC, remarked on the challenges smaller firms face in trying to match Strategy’s scale. He predicted that institutional capital will continue to gravitate toward Strategy due to its deep liquidity and established presence. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury Looking ahead, Marie suggested that the number of companies adhering to a BTC treasury strategy may dwindle over the next decade as the market matures. He noted that as more firms enter the space, the individual impact of each company will likely diminish. Additionally, as Bitcoin becomes more normalized, investor constraints regarding direct exposure may fade.

2025-07-02T13:30:04,"CME Bitcoin Futures Premium Drop: A Concerning Signal for Institutional Demand","BitcoinWorld CME Bitcoin Futures Premium Drop: A Concerning Signal for Institutional Demand Are institutional investors losing their appetite for Bitcoin? Recent data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) suggests a crucial shift, sending ripples of concern through the crypto market. The premium on Bitcoin (BTC) futures traded on the CME has plummeted to 4.3%, marking its lowest level since October 2023. This significant narrowing of the ‘basis’ – the gap between Bitcoin’s spot price and its futures price – comes despite BTC holding steady at strong price levels, defying expectations of a sharp downturn. What does this tell us about the current state of institutional Bitcoin demand , and what implications does it hold for the broader market? Understanding CME Bitcoin Futures : The Institutional Barometer To grasp the significance of this drop, it’s essential to understand what CME Bitcoin futures are and why their premium acts as a key indicator. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is one of the world’s largest and most diverse derivatives marketplaces. Unlike many offshore crypto exchanges, CME is a highly regulated environment, making its Bitcoin futures contracts a preferred choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to BTC within a traditional financial framework. What are Futures Contracts? A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specified future date. In the context of Bitcoin, it allows investors to speculate on the future price of BTC without actually owning the underlying asset. What is the Premium (Basis)? The ‘basis’ or premium refers to the difference between the futures price and the spot (current market) price of an asset. A positive premium means the futures price is higher than the spot price, indicating that traders are willing to pay more for future delivery, often signaling bullish sentiment and strong demand. Conversely, a shrinking or negative premium suggests weakening demand or a shift towards bearish sentiment. Why is it an Institutional Barometer? Because CME is a regulated exchange, it attracts large financial institutions, hedge funds, and professional traders who typically have stricter compliance requirements. Therefore, the activity and sentiment reflected in CME Bitcoin futures are often seen as a reliable proxy for institutional interest and confidence in Bitcoin. The recent dip to 4.3% is a stark indicator. When institutions are eager to gain exposure to Bitcoin, they drive up the demand for futures contracts, pushing the futures price above the spot price and widening the premium. A shrinking premium, as we’re currently observing, suggests that this institutional appetite is waning, or at least becoming more cautious. The Alarming Drop in Institutional Bitcoin Demand The data, cited by CoinDesk from 10x Research, paints a clear picture: the premium on CME Bitcoin futures is at its lowest point since October 2023. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a multi-month low, and it carries significant weight. While Bitcoin itself has shown resilience, holding strong at crucial support levels, the underlying institutional interest appears to be softening. What could be driving this decline in institutional enthusiasm? Profit-Taking and De-risking: After a significant rally, some institutional players might be taking profits off the table or reducing their exposure to manage risk, especially as macroeconomic uncertainties persist. Shift in Investment Strategies: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has provided institutions with an alternative, perhaps simpler, avenue for Bitcoin exposure. This might be diverting some capital away from futures markets. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite some positive developments, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains complex and fragmented globally. Ongoing uncertainties can lead institutions to adopt a more conservative stance. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation, interest rate policies, and geopolitical tensions, often lead institutional investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Market Saturation/Consolidation: As the market matures, the initial rush of institutional capital might be slowing down, leading to a more normalized level of demand. This weakening basis is a signal that the ‘smart money’ might be reassessing its position, indicating either reduced conviction in immediate upside potential or a growing sense of caution about future price movements. It suggests that the institutional bullishness that often fuels significant rallies might be taking a temporary backseat. Unpacking the Broader Bitcoin Market Analysis : Funding Rates and Offshore Echoes The trend observed on CME is not isolated; it’s echoed across the broader crypto landscape, particularly in the funding rates for perpetual futures contracts on major offshore exchanges. This parallel movement provides a more comprehensive picture of the shifting market sentiment. What are Perpetual Futures and Funding Rates? Perpetual futures are a type of futures contract that, unlike traditional futures, have no expiry date. This means traders can hold them indefinitely. To keep the perpetual futures price tethered to the spot price, a mechanism called ‘funding rate’ is used. Positive Funding Rate: When the funding rate is positive, long position holders pay short position holders. This typically occurs when the market is bullish, and the perpetual futures price is trading at a premium to the spot price. Negative Funding Rate: When the funding rate is negative, short position holders pay long position holders. This happens when the market is bearish, and the perpetual futures price is trading at a discount to the spot price. The fact that funding rates for perpetual futures on offshore exchanges are also falling reinforces the narrative of waning bullish sentiment. A decline in funding rates indicates that the demand for long positions (betting on price increases) is decreasing relative to short positions (betting on price decreases). This suggests a broader shift in speculative sentiment, moving away from aggressive long-biased trading. While CME futures are predominantly used by institutions for hedging and regulated exposure, offshore perpetual futures are often favored by retail traders and more aggressive institutional players for speculative purposes due to higher leverage options and 24/7 trading. The alignment of these two distinct market segments in signaling reduced bullishness is a powerful indicator for any comprehensive Bitcoin market analysis . What Do Falling Crypto Funding Rates Mean for Investors? The convergence of a declining CME premium and falling crypto funding rates across offshore exchanges has several implications for investors and market participants: 1. Increased Volatility Potential: A reduction in bullish leverage and speculative demand can lead to periods of higher volatility. Without strong buying pressure from institutions or aggressive retail longs, the market could be more susceptible to downward price movements or sharper corrections. 2. Arbitrage Opportunities: For sophisticated traders, a narrowing basis or fluctuating funding rates can create arbitrage opportunities. For example, if the premium on futures becomes too low, it might present a chance to buy spot Bitcoin and sell futures, locking in a small profit if the basis normalizes. 3. Shift in Market Sentiment: This trend points to a cooling of speculative fervor. It suggests that the market might be transitioning from a phase of aggressive accumulation to one of consolidation, profit-taking, or even cautious de-risking. This shift in sentiment could influence retail investor behavior as well, potentially leading to reduced participation or increased FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). 4. Liquidity Concerns: While not immediately critical, a sustained drop in institutional interest could eventually impact market liquidity, especially in derivatives markets. Lower liquidity can lead to larger price swings on smaller trade volumes. Investors should view these indicators as part of a larger puzzle. They don’t necessarily signal an impending crash, but rather a re-evaluation of risk and reward by significant market players. It highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of market dynamics beyond just spot price movements. Navigating Bitcoin Price Trends : Challenges and Opportunities Ahead The current signals from the derivatives market present both challenges and potential opportunities for those looking to navigate future Bitcoin price trends . While the immediate outlook might suggest a period of consolidation or even a slight correction, it’s crucial to consider the broader context. Challenges: Sustained Price Pressure: If institutional demand remains subdued, it could remove a significant buying force from the market, potentially leading to slower price appreciation or even downward pressure in the short to medium term. Market Uncertainty: The lack of clear institutional direction can fuel uncertainty, making the market more reactive to news and less predictable. Risk of Cascade Liquidations: If funding rates turn significantly negative or a sharp price drop occurs, it could trigger liquidations of leveraged long positions, exacerbating downward movements. Opportunities: Buying the Dip: For long-term investors, periods of reduced institutional demand and subsequent price consolidation can present opportunities to accumulate Bitcoin at more attractive price points. Focus on Fundamentals: A shift away from speculative fervor allows investors to focus on Bitcoin’s core fundamentals: its decentralized nature, scarcity, and growing adoption as a global store of value and medium of exchange. Arbitrage and Hedging: Sophisticated traders can leverage the basis narrowing for arbitrage strategies or use futures for effective hedging against spot market volatility. Ultimately, understanding these dynamics empowers investors to make more informed decisions. It’s a reminder that while Bitcoin’s price is often driven by narratives and hype, underlying institutional flows and derivatives market health provide a more grounded perspective on market sentiment. Conclusion: What This Means for Bitcoin’s Future The drop in CME Bitcoin futures premium and the concurrent fall in offshore funding rates are undeniable signals of a shift in institutional and speculative sentiment. While Bitcoin has maintained its price stability at significant levels, the enthusiasm from large players appears to be waning, at least temporarily. This doesn’t necessarily spell doom for Bitcoin; rather, it suggests a period of re-evaluation and consolidation after a robust rally. It highlights the growing sophistication of the crypto market, where derivatives play a crucial role in reflecting underlying demand and risk appetite. For investors, this period calls for vigilance and a balanced perspective. Monitoring these key indicators, understanding the interplay between regulated and offshore markets, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term speculative whims will be paramount. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the insights gleaned from institutional activity on platforms like CME will remain vital in charting Bitcoin’s ongoing journey.

Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund Converts To Spot ETF The SEC has approved Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) to convert into a spot crypto ETF, according to a Tuesday filing . “It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSEARCA-2024-87), as modified by Amendment No. 1, be, and hereby is, approved on an accelerated basis,” the regulator wrote.

2025-07-02T13:26:02,"Coinbase, Strategy lead losses as Trump's bill underdelivers on crypto taxation","Shares of crypto-related firms plunged Wednesday morning, with Coinbase Global Inc. and Strategy Inc. leading losses in US pre-market trading. The declines came amid political letdowns in Washington as President Donald Trump’s tax and spending “Big, Beautiful Bill” narrowly passed the Senate floor. Coinbase stock was down more than 15.6% to $335 as of Wednesday’s pre-market session. Meanwhile, shares of Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc ., heavily exposed to Bitcoin, dropped over 30%, trading at $373.30, per data from Google Finance. The slump contrasts with the US equities market at large, where the S&P 500 index rose to 6,210 points, a modest 0.19% gain from the previous day. Crypto provisions from Trump’s budget bill underwhelm Investors are still finding their footing from the fallout from President Donald Trump’s reconciliation budget bill , which narrowly passed in the Senate on Tuesday. The legislation is now headed to the House for a final vote, and conservatives are poised to finalize the package before the July 4 deadline, supposedly set by the US president. A recent estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected the House-passed version would increase the federal deficit by approximately $2.8 trillion. That outlook, combined with missed opportunities for the crypto industry, could have contributed to the pessimism driving crypto-related businesses’ shares lower. Pro-crypto lawmakers failed to include tax provisions in the budget package that were intended to benefit stakers, miners, and retail users of digital assets. The amendment , led by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), was not ready in time to be included in Tuesday’s deliberations. “More than 24 hours into the Senate’s amendment process, there’s still no sign of Senator Lummis’s crypto tax proposal,” wrote Fox News correspondent Eleanor Terrett on X, “at this point, the window to get something to the floor may have closed.” By the time Vice President JD Vance cast the deciding vote to pass the legislation, crypto amendments were already left behind. “It’s a missed opportunity. We just ran out of time,” one industry policy leader told reporters. Coinbase and crypto companies endure share dump Coinbase shares had been on an upward trajectory ahead of this week’s decline. The stock hit a record high of over $380 on June 26. Institutional holders, however, appeared to take profits near the top. Ark Invest , led by Cathie Wood, sold off nearly $43.8 million worth of Coinbase shares on Monday, following an earlier sale of $12.5 million last Thursday. The selloff came just days after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins bill, the crypto legislation now heading to the House. The selloff in Strategy Inc. shares may come as a surprise to some, given the company’s reported gains tied to its Bitcoin holdings. On June 30, Strategy disclosed the purchase of 4,980 BTC for approximately $531.9 million, acquired at an average price of $106,801 per coin. This latest acquisition brought Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325 BTC, valued at over $14 billion in unrealized gains for the second quarter of 2025, as reported by Cryptopolitan yesterday. The company financed its recent purchases through the sale of Class A shares and preferred equity units STRK and STRF. On Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote a letter to Congress to rally them against the GENIUS Act, arguing that it lacks the proper safeguards to protect consumers and the US financial system. James asked lawmakers to slow the bill’s passing in an eight-page letter addressed to the Senate. She lambasted the proposal for leaving “room for foreign issuers of US dollar-denominated and backed stablecoins to operate,” which she said could enable the “Tether loophole.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-02T13:20:01,"Bitcoin Investors Show Unwavering Conviction with Trillions in Unrealized Gains","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investors Show Unwavering Conviction with Trillions in Unrealized Gains Imagine sitting on a goldmine, knowing its value could soar even higher, yet choosing not to cash out. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario for many Bitcoin (BTC) holders. In a remarkable display of market conviction, Bitcoin investors are currently holding onto an astounding $1.2 trillion in unrealized gains, a figure just shy of the all-time high of $1.3 trillion. This isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to a profound shift in market psychology and a strong indicator of underlying strength in the cryptocurrency landscape. What makes this even more compelling is the minimal selling pressure, especially from those who bought more recently. Let’s dive deep into what this means for the future of the crypto market. Understanding Unrealized Gains: What Are Bitcoin Investors Holding Onto? Before we explore the ‘why,’ let’s clarify the ‘what.’ Unrealized gains refer to the profit an investor has on paper from an asset that they still own. It’s the difference between the current market value of an asset and its original purchase price. For Glassnode data, the average Bitcoin investor is currently sitting on a staggering 125% in paper gains. This means, on average, their Bitcoin holdings have more than doubled since they acquired them. This massive accumulation of unrealized gains approaching a record high suggests a collective belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Unlike traditional assets where such profits might trigger significant profit-taking, Bitcoin’s community appears to be playing a different game. This holding pattern signals a maturity in the asset class and a strategic mindset among its participants. Consider these key aspects of unrealized gains in the Bitcoin market: Paper Profits: These gains only become ‘realized’ when the investor sells their Bitcoin. Until then, they are subject to market fluctuations. Investor Confidence: Holding onto such substantial gains indicates a high level of confidence that the price will continue to appreciate, or that current prices are still undervalued relative to future potential. Historical Context: While $1.2 trillion is immense, it’s crucial to remember Bitcoin’s history of volatility. Past cycles have seen rapid increases followed by significant corrections, yet the current holding behavior suggests lessons learned and stronger conviction. Why Are Bitcoin Investors Exhibiting Such Strong BTC Holding Behavior? The phenomenon of minimal selling despite massive profits isn’t accidental; it’s rooted in a combination of philosophical conviction, strategic foresight, and evolving market dynamics. This BTC holding behavior, often dubbed ‘HODLing’ (Hold On for Dear Life), has become a core tenet of the Bitcoin community. Several factors contribute to this unwavering conviction: Long-Term Vision: Many Bitcoin investors view BTC not merely as a speculative asset but as a foundational shift in finance – digital gold, a hedge against inflation, or a decentralized store of value. Their investment horizon stretches years, even decades, making short-term price swings less relevant. Scarcity and Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins and its programmed halving events (which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market) reinforce its scarcity narrative. Investors anticipate that reduced supply, coupled with growing demand, will inevitably drive prices higher over time. Avoiding Capital Gains Tax: In many jurisdictions, selling an asset triggers a taxable event. By holding onto their Bitcoin, investors defer or avoid these taxes, which can be substantial on large gains. This incentivizes long-term holding. Maturing Market Infrastructure: The entry of institutional players, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, and increasing regulatory clarity provide a sense of legitimacy and stability to the market, encouraging long-term capital allocation rather than quick flips. The ‘Laser Eyes’ Mentality: A cultural phenomenon within the crypto community, HODLing has become a badge of honor. It signifies belief in the technology and a collective resistance to market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). Decoding Short-Term Holders: A Shift in Market Dynamics? While long-term holders are known for their diamond hands, the behavior of short-term holders (STHs) often provides crucial insights into immediate market sentiment. These are individuals or entities who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days and are typically more reactive to price movements, often taking profits at the first sign of significant gains or cutting losses during dips. What’s particularly noteworthy in the current market cycle is the sharp drop in selling pressure from STHs since Bitcoin’s all-time high in May. This suggests a significant shift: Increased Conviction Among Newcomers: Newer investors, who typically constitute the STH group, are showing unusual resilience. Instead of panicking or taking quick profits, they appear to be holding on, perhaps having learned from previous cycles or influenced by the broader HODLing ethos. Absorption of Supply: This reduced selling from STHs indicates that any supply coming onto the market is being readily absorbed by new buyers or existing holders looking to accumulate more. This creates a supply-side squeeze. Reduced Speculative Trading: A decline in STH selling pressure often points to less speculative trading activity and a more fundamental-driven market. This can lead to more stable price action in the absence of external shocks. The fact that Bitcoin has established strong support around $98,300, yet this level has not been enough to trigger significant selling, further underscores this point. It implies that even at what might seem like a high entry point for some, investors are not easily shaken into selling their holdings. Broader Crypto Market Analysis: What Does This Mean for the Ecosystem? The strong holding behavior of Bitcoin investors has ripple effects across the entire crypto market analysis. Bitcoin, being the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often acts as the bellwether for the rest of the altcoin market. When Bitcoin shows strength and stability, it typically instills confidence in other digital assets. Here’s what this trend could signify for the broader ecosystem: Implication Description Altcoin Resilience A stable Bitcoin foundation can provide a launchpad for altcoins, allowing them to gain traction and build their own ecosystems without constant fear of a major BTC correction. Institutional Confidence Consistent holding behavior and less volatility (due to reduced selling) make the asset class more attractive to traditional financial institutions seeking long-term exposure. Reduced Market Noise Less speculative selling means less ‘noise’ in the market, allowing for more fundamental-driven price discovery and a focus on technological advancements and adoption. Future Price Action If supply remains constrained due to strong holding and demand continues to grow, the stage is set for potential future price appreciation, especially as global economic uncertainties persist. However, it’s crucial to remember that no market moves in a straight line. While the current signals are overwhelmingly positive, factors like macroeconomic shifts, unexpected regulatory changes, or significant technological breakthroughs (or failures) could still influence market sentiment. Investors should always conduct their own research and understand the inherent risks. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor: Navigating the Current Landscape So, what does this deep dive into Bitcoin investor behavior mean for you? Understanding these trends can help you make more informed decisions in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Embrace a Long-Term Perspective: The success of long-term holders underscores the power of patience. If you believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value, consider adopting a HODLing strategy rather than trying to time every market fluctuation. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin shows immense strength, a diversified portfolio across different crypto assets and traditional investments can mitigate risk. Stay Informed, Not Emotional: Market narratives can change quickly. Rely on data and fundamental analysis rather than succumbing to fear or greed. The current data points to a resilient market, but vigilance is always key. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin, despite its growing maturity, remains a volatile asset. Invest only what you can afford to lose and ensure your portfolio aligns with your personal risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Resilient Future for Bitcoin? The current market landscape, characterized by Bitcoin investors sitting on trillions in unrealized gains with minimal selling, paints a compelling picture of conviction and maturity. This isn’t just about large numbers; it’s about a fundamental shift in how participants view and interact with the world’s leading cryptocurrency. The robust BTC holding behavior, even among short-term holders, suggests a market less prone to knee-jerk reactions and more aligned with long-term growth trajectories. As the crypto market analysis continues to evolve, this strong foundation of investor confidence could prove to be a crucial factor in Bitcoin’s journey towards wider adoption and price stability. While challenges and volatility will always be part of the equation, the collective unrealized gains being held reflect an unwavering belief in the digital asset’s enduring value.

Recently, Bitwise released a report stating that history shows Bitcoin has rebounded strongly after geopolitical shocks. On June 30, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and head of research Ryan Rasmussen confirmed their $200,000 price target for 2025. They are also optimistic about Bitcoin ETF flows in the second half of the year. For strategic reasons, many countries are quietly exploring or accumulating Bitcoin. We anticipate that more nations will reveal their plans by year-end, leading to massive adoption in H2. With this growing optimism, experts like Mister Crypto expect the current consolidation in a flag pattern to result in a breakout soon. Why Is Bitwise Bullish On Bitcoin Price In July? In June, Bitcoin price experienced consolidation due to rising geopolitical risks in the Middle East. After reaching new all-time highs, Bitcoin traded sideways throughout the month. Despite these consolidations and geopolitical pullbacks, data indicates strong institutional demand through Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries, which are reducing supply. Therefore, Bitwise believes that as trade-policy clarity and potential Fed easing approach, these factors create a positive environment for Bitcoin in July. [post_titles_links postid=”477768″] Bitcoin Price Chart Analysis: Breakout Likely From Flag Pattern Bitcoin price is nearing its all-time high of $112K, currently trading at $107,685 after a recent 2% jump. The MACD tool indicates increased bullishness, showing a golden cross . Also, the CMF is at 0.12, reflecting rising inflows, while the RSI supports at 55.24. From late June to early July, both the AO and MACD histogram suggest growing bullish momentum. Short-term EMA bands also indicate a positive outlook, with the recent surge stemming from the 20-day EMA band. If it breaks above the wedge’s upper border on the Bitcoin chart, it could target $112K and potentially reach $120K by the end of July if short-term Bitcoin news triggers bullish accumulation.

2025-07-02T13:12:33,"Macroeconomic Impacts on Crypto, Hyperliquid, Altcoin Season, and 4-Year Cycles With Binance France President David Prinçay (Interview)","2025 has so far been a year marked by persistent geopolitical tensions, monetary challenges, and evolving investor behavior. Amid all this, the crypto markets continue navigating a complex macroeconomic landscape. Bitcoin’s performance, the increasing institutional adoption, the rise of certain fields in decentralized finals, as well as questions around traditional 4-year market cycles are all interesting and constantly discussed topics within the community. In the following conversation, David Prinçay, President of Binance France, offers his perspective on the current state of the market, the competition between centralized and decentralized exchanges, as well as the broader relevance of long-held theories such as the four-year crypto market cycle. What is your take on the current macroeconomic environment and the way Bitcoin is responding to global turmoils? Macroeconomic factors have increased market uncertainty, which has affected crypto in similar ways to traditional asset classes. Crypto increasingly behaves like risk assets, which means that prolonged trade wars or geo-political tensions could result in capital that might have entered crypto either staying on the sidelines or shifting into perceived safe havens like gold. Despite its reputation as ‘digital gold’ and a potential safe-haven, BTC has shown a stronger correlation with equities in the first half of the year than with traditional hedges like gold. However, a deeper look at the market also shows that BTC was less affected by ‘risk-off’ episodes than other crypto assets. According to Binance Research, in April, BTC had dropped 19.1%, while ETH dropped over 40%, and categories like Memecoins and AI plunged more than 50%, suggesting that it is much more resistant to shocks than it may have been in the past. While we have seen price recoveries since then, these types of movement show there can be a vulnerability to sudden policy shifts and macroeconomic drivers. However, analysts will be watching closely to see if BTC is able to retain its appeal as a non-sovereign, permissionless asset in an increasingly protectionist global economy. If inflation and rate cuts become a concern, we could expect to see BTC grow its appeal as an inflation resistant asset once again. This cycle is turning out to be one where Bitcoin is dominating heavily, as the majority of altcoins fail to keep up. Do you think we will see a reversal and the much-anticipated (by many) altcoin season? There are a number of reasons for Bitcoin’s current dominance. We continue to see strong interest in crypto from institutional investors and corporate treasuries (and even from sovereign wealth funds), and naturally their primary interest is in Bitcoin as the most established cryptoasset. There has also been a great deal of economic uncertainty in global markets, whether caused by national economic policies, conflicts or other factors. Both of these factors typically drive BTC dominance in different ways, one as an effect of sustained interest and investment in it as a novel asset class, and the other as a familiar impact of uncertainty and volatility in traditional markets. In the longer term, it’s not possible to say how this might impact the next altcoin season. We may see institutions and corporations seek further diversification in their crypto holdings if or when BTC prices plateau, and markets for traditional assets will eventually regain their confidence. How an altcoin season plays out in a more mature and regulated crypto market will be interesting to see. What is your take on the rising competition centralized exchanges are seeing from decentralized perp trading solutions like Hyperliquid? We are watching these developments with interest and it’s always good to see innovative projects challenging the status quo, it drives competition and inspires product innovation across the industry. We are constantly taking inspiration from across the industry and adding new products that our users love, such as Binance Wallet which recently hit an ATH of $12.5 billion in daily transaction volumes driven by TGEs and airdrops through Binance Alpha. Alpha allows our users to explore early-stage crypto projects with the potential to grow within the Web3 ecosystem as well as earning ‘Alpha Points’ which grant access to exclusive rewards for our most engaged community members. Our focus is to ensure that we continue to develop our business in compliance with our regulatory obligations around the world. We are the largest exchange in the world, and we have a responsibility to ensure that we grow sustainably and, as always, prioritise user protection. Do you think the “four year market cycle” theory is still in play? There’s not yet been any strong evidence to suggest that the four year cycle has been broken. Certainly, there have been corrections that correlate to macroeconomic events but we have also seen price recoveries and fresh all time highs. Over the longer term it will remain to be seen whether macroeconomic factors and maturation of the crypto market will affect the historical pattern of cycles, but it’s not likely that we have reached that point yet.

2025-07-02T13:03:39,"JP Morgan Chase tests tokenized carbon credits system as crypto involvement deepens","JP Morgan Chase is working on a new approach for tokenized carbon credits. Kinexys, the bank’s blockchain unit, is partnering with S&P Global Commodity Insights and other carbon experts to offer tokenized carbon credits. JP Morgan Chase and its on-chain unit Kinexys will launch a pilot program for tokenized carbon credits. The bank’s move deepens the reach of RWA tokenization , linked to a growing global market. The US bank will partner with S&P Global Commodity Insights, EcoRegistry and the International Carbon Registry to tokenize carbon credits listed in registry systems. “ The voluntary carbon market is ripe for innovation,” said Alastair Northway, head of natural resource advisory at JPMorgan Payments. “ Tokenization could support development of a globally interoperable system that adds confidence into the integrity of the underlying infrastructure. This technology could support greater information and price transparency, which could ultimately lead to greater liquidity in the market.” The companies will oversee the movements of credits and explore whether blockchain technology can be applied to tracking ownership and transactions from the initial issuance of credits to their retirement. Tokenized carbon credits seek to improve efficiency in trading JP Morgan Chase has been one of the leading mainstream banks to offer various forms of tokenization, mostly targeted at its clients. The bank recently prepared to launch its patented JPMD deposit-based token on the Base chain. Tokenization remains a trend among mainstream financial companies as a more efficient tool for settlement and proof of ownership. A tokenized form of carbon credits can streamline inefficiencies and offer a standard way of tracking ownership. JP Morgan Chase hoped for a single tokenized carbon ecosystem where credits are seamlessly moving between sellers and buyers, with no need for central settlement. Carbon credits represent one metric ton of emissions, either removed or not added to the atmosphere. The tokens would represent the so-called carbon offsets that are required of some polluting businesses. As of 2025, the global carbon credit market is valued at $933.23B and is expected to reach trillions by 2030. The market still faces some skepticism due to allegations of greenwashing without actually supporting reduced pollution. On-chain projects offer informal tokenized carbon credits Tokenized carbon credits are one of the use cases for a whole class of blockchain projects. So far, tokenized carbon trading has happened informally, with no unified standard. The tokens offering exposure to the carbon offset market are also known as Regenerative Finance (ReFi). Currently, their value is low compared to other narrative tokens, though there is some demand for tokenized ecological projects. Since carbon credits are often the provenance of big business, there are few platforms to offer more reliable tokenization and settlement. The involvement of JP Morgan Chase may be the jolt the carbon credit on-chain market needs to start a new drive toward a common standard. The main driver of demand for carbon credits is the net-zero commitment, which some of the world’s largest companies have made. The cut-off date of 2030 is just five years away, sparking expectations of suddenly rising demand for carbon offsets. Carbon offsets can range between $1 to $100 per ton depending on the type of anti-pollution action and its efficiency. In the coming years, companies may have to expand their buying of offsets to meet the carbon emissions quota.

2025-07-02T13:00:29,"Western Europe’s Crypto Media Enters Freefall as MiCA Bites and Google Cracks Down on AI Content, Outset PR Says","Q1 2025 opened with an unmistakable paradox, as public appetite for crypto surged across Western Europe. A joint study by Adan, Deloitte, and Ipsos painted a bullish picture: digital assets were becoming a household topic, decentralized finance use cases were gaining traction, and platforms like Revolut were onboarding new users at pace. Italy led with 37% of its population expressing interest in crypto, and even traditionally skeptical France saw a 10-point rise in purchase intent. And yet, while the public leaned in, the media serving this growing audience was collapsing. According to new data from Outset PR, 82% of crypto-native publications across the region experienced a drop in visibility in Q1 2025. The report makes one thing clear: even as crypto draws more public attention, the media meant to cover that growth is slipping out of view — a pattern Outset PR first observed in its LATAM analysis . Visual breakdown of crypto outlet traffic in Western Europe (Q1 2025): data sourced from Outset PR Between Markets in Crypto-Assets’ (MiCA) compliance demands, Google’s March algorithm update, crypto market stagnation, and widespread reliance on thin, AI-generated content, crypto media across Western Europe found itself squeezed on all sides. The very platforms meant to inform and connect users were being penalized, restructured, or left behind. MiCA and Google: A One-Two Punch That Knocked Out an Industry At the center of the collapse sits the MiCA regulation, which began its soft rollout across the EU in January 2025. Though aimed at crypto service providers, MiCA’s reach extended deep into the media landscape. Outlets that featured sponsored content, token promotions, or loosely worded investment guidance — even if unintentionally — found themselves under regulatory scrutiny. In parallel, Google’s March 2025 algorithm update penalized content that lacked depth, transparency, or editorial differentiation. Sites running undifferentiated AI content, regurgitated press releases, or recycled newswire stories were downgraded. The result? A perfect storm that punished both the careless and the unlucky. Take the Netherlands and Belgium, where no major domestic regulatory crackdowns occurred in Q1, yet the crypto media ecosystems still suffered steep declines. Why? SEO dependence. Dutch-language outlets, such as Bitcoin Magazine NL and Newsbit NL, relied heavily on search traffic. When Google's update began penalizing thin or unclear content, these sites lost visibility. In Belgium, Dutch-speaking readers — mostly served by Netherlands-based platforms — were caught in the crossfire. Despite no MiCA clampdown from Belgian authorities, algorithmic ripple effects across language regions suppressed crypto coverage and discoverability. In short, even countries with lenient enforcement saw their ecosystems crumble under digital pressure. Editorial Fatigue and the Rise of AI Sameness But regulations and algorithms weren’t the only culprits. The crypto media sector entered 2025 already carrying significant baggage: editorial fatigue, oversaturation, and an identity crisis accelerated by the overuse of AI-generated content. As user expectations matured, audiences sought insight, not redundancy. Instead, many outlets flooded the market with near-identical stories. Newswire-fed updates, clickbait token analyses, and templated articles made discoverability harder and diluted trust. Google, armed with machine learning classifiers tuned to detect ""thin"" content, began actively demoting these formats. The editorial challenge became existential. What differentiated one outlet from another when they were all publishing the same headlines about Bitcoin ETF speculation or DeFi security breaches? Outset PR’s analysis goes further, identifying a qualitative erosion in crypto journalism. The report cites growing compliance stress among editorial teams, who were suddenly forced to add disclaimers, vet partners, and reorient language — often without legal resources or precedent. For smaller independent publications, these added burdens became existential. Outset PR Findings: Freefall and Measurable Collapse Outset PR’s Q1 2025 report offers a comprehensive explanation layer. Of the 133 Western European outlets tracked, only 18.39% saw any growth — and even that growth was mostly measured in percentages, not scale. In fact, just 16 crypto-dedicated publications posted quarterly gains, and only Newsbit.de consistently exceeded 1M monthly visits. The rest operated in the sub-100K monthly range. Traffic across the sector dropped from 26.57 million visits in January to 22.22 million by March — a 16.37% fall in just one quarter. Visualization of changes in crypto outlet traffic in Western Europe (Q1 2025): data sourced from Outset PR But it wasn’t just about numbers. The crisis had a qualitative dimension. Editors scrambled to understand shifting compliance standards. Previously viable traffic acquisition channels like Google Discover vanished for many. Only 22.99% of crypto-native outlets still had consistent Discover visibility. Brands built on visibility and reach now found themselves in the shadows. In Germany, BaFin took a hardline stance, aggressively penalizing investment-style promotion without proper licensing. The German-language segment, representing the largest bloc of crypto-native outlets, was battered — over 60% of these publications lost traffic. Even in markets with milder enforcement like France or the UK, the impact was visible. France saw a 72% drop among its crypto outlets, with many failing to adapt content to new transparency guidelines. The UK, outside MiCA’s direct jurisdiction, still felt the pressure through the FCA’s new promotion rules and Google’s AI-content purge. The Winners: Percentage Gains, Not Visibility Gains Among the few winners were sites like The Market Periodical, Blockchain Stories DE, and ActuCrypto.info. These outlets embraced multilingual content, clarified editorial scope, and adopted MiCA-aligned formatting quickly. The Market Periodical, in particular, saw a 261% surge in Q1 — by expanding into new language markets. The Dutch site Beste Bank posted 31% growth, and Spain’s Bit2Me News grew 149% — the latter due to a rare content pivot and deep local engagement strategy. Still, almost all of these outlets remained small, serving more as proof of concept for adaptive publishing than as a solution to the wider industry collapse. Generalist Media: The Outsiders Who Thrived Outset PR’s findings show that general finance and tech outlets with crypto sections fared significantly better. Of 46 such platforms, 54% posted traffic growth. Unlike crypto-native sites, these publications had stronger domain authority, more editorial flexibility, and diversified content portfolios. Finanzen.net, Investing.com (DE, FR, IT), and Boursier.com all maintained Discover visibility and robust growth, proving that when crypto media narrows its lens, broader players step in to fill the gap. In total, non-crypto-native sites generated over 106 million visits in Q1 2025 — more than four times the reach of their crypto-dedicated counterparts. Crypto Media Is Fragmented, While Generalist Portals See Consolidation The fragmentation of crypto-native outlets contrasts sharply with the growing consolidation among broader media. Just seven crypto-dedicated publications accounted for over 60% of the entire market’s visibility. The rest were scattered, with the majority operating under 100K visits per month. Fragmentation of Western Europe’s crypto media landscape in Q1 2025, per Outset PR In contrast, 19 finance-first platforms, each surpassing 1 million monthly visits, captured more than 95% of the total audience in this segment. The implication for crypto PR is clear: survival now depends on hybrid strategies that mix top-tier generalist partnerships with highly targeted, compliant crypto-native campaigns. A New Playbook for Crypto Media Strategy For crypto brands, protocols, and investors hoping to build traction in Western Europe, the lessons of Q1 2025 are sobering — but actionable. Editorial compliance is non-negotiable. Outlets must adapt to MiCA and national policy interpretations, even if they aren't directly regulated as CASPs. SEO and Google Discover are volatile. Without editorial depth, multilingual support, and proper content attribution, visibility will suffer. Multilingual expansion is a growth lever. Sites like The Market Periodical and CoinJournal DE prove that language agility can shield against geographic policy headwinds. Broader media is now central. With 4x the traffic, finance and tech newsrooms have become essential for reach, even if they lack deep crypto DNA. The contradiction of Q1 2025 was more than just ironic — it was symbolic. As Europe’s citizens leaned into crypto, the media meant to guide them fell into disrepair. The causes were complex: regulatory shockwaves, algorithmic overhauls, editorial burnout. But the outcome was simple and stark: a media landscape hollowed out just as the need for clarity grew most urgent. Whether crypto media in Western Europe can rebuild — and how — remains an open question. But one thing is clear: it won’t be business as usual. With Outset PR mapping these shifts in detail in accordance with their data-driven approach to crypto media campaigns, it’s clear that media strategy now demands more precision than ever.

2025-07-02T13:00:00,"Celsius Wins Legal Victory as Tether Lawsuit Moves Forward","The lawsuit alleges that Tether improperly liquidated over 39,500 Bitcoin during Celsius’s 2022 collapse, which violated contractual terms and US bankruptcy law. Celsius claims the fire sale caused billions in losses and accuses Tether of bad faith and fraudulent transfers. Meanwhile, the DOJ charged four North Koreans with infiltrating US and Serbian crypto companies, and stealing nearly $1 million to support Pyongyang’s illicit programs. Separately, the US Treasury sanctioned Russia-based Aeza Group and its leadership for providing infrastructure to cybercriminals. Judge Clears Celsius Lawsuit Against Tether A US bankruptcy judge ruled that Celsius Network’s multibillion-dollar lawsuit against Tether can proceed, and rejected key parts of Tether’s motion to dismiss the case. The lawsuit was filed in New York, and it accuses Tether of improperly liquidating more than 39,500 Bitcoin belonging to Celsius in June of 2022, during the crypto lender’s collapse. Celsius alleges that Tether acted in bad faith by executing a “fire sale” of the collateral at an average price of $20,656—below market value—and applied the proceeds to an $812 million loan without observing a mandatory 10-hour waiting period. The funds were reportedly later moved to Tether’s affiliated Bitfinex accounts. Judge’s denial of motion to dismiss (Source: CourtListener ) Celsius claims that Tether’s actions breached their lending agreement, violated good faith obligations under British Virgin Islands law, and constituted fraudulent and preferential transfers under US bankruptcy regulations. These allegations are based on the premise that, despite Tether being incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, the actions in question involved US-based elements, including personnel, communications, and financial accounts. The judge agreed that the case had enough domestic ties, countering Tether’s claim that the lawsuit represented an overreach of US jurisdiction. Although some claims were dismissed, the court allowed Celsius to move forward with its core allegations of breach of contract and improper transfer of assets. The company argues that the premature liquidation cost it over $4 billion at current Bitcoin prices. Celsius was once a major player in crypto lending, and exited bankruptcy in January of 2024 after 18 months of restructuring, It has since started repaying creditors. Separately, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino recently dismissed speculation about the company launching an IPO, despite industry chatter valuing Tether at over $500 billion. Ardoino called such a valuation a “beautiful number” but hinted that it may still undervalue Tether, given its vast reserves in Bitcoin and gold. The company is also building its Bitcoin holdings, including a recent transfer of nearly 37,230 BTC—valued at approximately $3.9 billion—to addresses associated with its majority-owned Twenty One Capital, now the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. DOJ Charges 4 North Koreans In other crypto-related legal news, four North Korean nationals have been charged in Georgia with wire fraud and money laundering after allegedly infiltrating US and Serbian blockchain companies by posing as remote IT workers and stealing nearly $1 million in cryptocurrency. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) named the defendants as Kim Kwang Jin, Kang Tae Bok, Jong Pong Ju, and Chang Nam Il, who used stolen and fake identities to mask their North Korean origins. The group reportedly operated out of the United Arab Emirates in 2019 before securing employment at a blockchain startup in Atlanta and a Serbian virtual token company between late 2020 and mid-2021. Press release from the US Attorney's Office According to prosecutors, Kim and Jong submitted fraudulent documents, including counterfeit and stolen IDs, to secure their positions. Once embedded in the companies, they exploited their access to steal funds. In February of 2022, Jong allegedly diverted $175,000 in crypto assets, and in March of the same year, Kim reportedly manipulated smart contract code to steal an additional $740,000. The proceeds were laundered through crypto mixers and transferred to accounts controlled by Kang and Chang, who used fraudulent Malaysian identities to open the accounts. The DOJ explained that the scheme aimed to bypass international sanctions and funnel money into North Korea’s illicit programs, including its weapons development initiatives. Assistant Attorney General John A. Eisenberg described the operation as a calculated effort to target and exploit US businesses. This case is part of the DOJ’s DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative, which was launched in 2024 to disrupt North Korea’s global revenue-generating operations. As part of this crackdown , federal agents conducted raids across 16 states, seized nearly 30 financial accounts, over 20 fake websites, and around 200 computers from “laptop farms” that were designed to make North Korean operatives look like US-based workers. The DOJ stated that these elaborate schemes allowed IT workers to gain remote jobs at more than 100 American companies, diverting millions of dollars to Pyongyang and, in some instances, accessing sensitive military data. Aeza Group Hit with US Sanctions The US Treasury also recently imposed sanctions on the Russia-based Aeza Group, its leadership, and a connected cryptocurrency wallet for allegedly aiding cybercriminal operations through its bulletproof hosting (BPH) services. According to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ), Aeza Group provided specialized servers and infrastructure to ransomware groups and info-stealer operators, facilitating campaigns that targeted victims globally. Among the sanctioned entities are several Russia- and UK-based companies and four Russian nationals who either own or help run Aeza, including CEO Arsenii Aleksandrovich Penzev and general director Yurii Meruzhanovich Bozoyan. OFAC also sanctioned a Tron blockchain wallet tied to Aeza’s payment processor. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said this wallet was used to receive payments for Aeza’s hosting services and to forward funds to cryptocurrency exchanges, which made it difficult to trace customer deposits. The address held around $350,000 in crypto and was also reportedly used for direct payments. TRM Labs added that this wallet is linked to other cybercrime infrastructure and sanctioned entities, including the Russian crypto exchange Garantex. Sanctioned Tron address (Source: Chainalysis ) Aeza’s services were allegedly used by various threat actors, including the Meduza and Lumma infostealer operations, BianLian ransomware, RedLine info-stealer panels, and the darknet marketplace BlackSprut. OFAC’s action also targeted Aeza’s board of directors, including Penzev, Bozoyan, technical director Vladimir Vyacheslavovich Gast, and part owner Igor Anatolyevich Knyazev, who is said to be managing operations after Penzev and Bozoyan were arrested in Russia over links to illicit online markets. With these sanctions, any assets in the US linked to Aeza and its executives are now frozen, and US persons are barred from engaging in financial or business dealings with the sanctioned people or entities. The move is part of a global effort to disrupt cybercrime infrastructure. Chainalysis described the sanctions as a key step in dismantling the supply chains that enable large-scale cyberattacks. TRM Labs believes that targeting service providers like Aeza helps reduce the “surface area of abuse” and creates leverage points for law enforcement to disrupt illicit online networks.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9780/celsius-wins-legal-victory-as-tether-lawsuit-moves-forward,"USDT|REGULATION|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ASIA","News|Legal",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T13:00:00,"Bitcoin DeFi Project BOB Launches BitVM Bridge Testnet","Layer-2 network BOB has launched its testnet ahead of the mainnet going live in Q4 of this year. Describing itself as a hybrid layer-2, BOB's aim is to combine Bitcoin's security and reserves with Ethereum's programmability using the BitVM computing paradigm to create a decentralized finance (DeFi) hub. BitVM was introduced in late 2023 by Robin Linus as a means of enabling rollups atop Bitcoin, thus allowing faster and cheaper transactions without compromising the network's security. BOB's bridge harnesses BitVM to allow BTC to be transferred to the rollup and later bring it back so that it can be withdrawn. Central to BOB's ethos is that it will use actual BTC rather than a wrapped version of the asset as the fuel for DeFi services. Some projects use a form of wrapped bitcoin to bring BTC's value to their ecosystem for use in DeFi applications, such as Stacks with its sBTC token . ""Just as ETH remains 'ETH' on Ethereum rollups like Optimism and Arbitrum, BTC on BOB remains native and simply called 'BTC',"" BOB said in an announcement shared with CoinDesk on Wednesday. Rollups such as Arbitrum bundles transactions which it then settles on Ethereum on the cheap, using fraud proofs to ensure their correctness. BOB says it is doing something akin to this on Bitcoin. Co-founder Alexei Zamyatin described this as a ""clear distinction,"" between its offering and wrapped versions of BTC, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. The testnet debuts with support from a host of major crypto firms who will be operating nodes on the BitVM bridge, such as staking developers P2P.org and Lombard, DeFi platform Solv Protocol, crypto venture capitalists RockawayX and digital asset manager Amber Group.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/07/02/bitcoin-defi-project-bob-launches-bitvm-bridge-testnet,"BTC|ETH|ARB|BLOCKCHAIN","Tech|Bitcoin|layer 2|DeFi|Testnet|Bitvm|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

Traditional assets like gold, silver, and stocks are hitting record highs. Big investors prefer crypto stocks over altcoins. The crypto market is stuck in one of its most confusing and frustrating phases, says expert Ran Neuner . Even though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved a new Grayscale ETF featuring top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP, prices haven’t moved much, with altcoins suffering the most. While traditional markets like the S&P 500, gold, and silver are hitting record highs, altcoins remain stuck. Bitcoin is holding near its highs, but smaller tokens can’t gain momentum. Why Are Altcoins Stuck in Neutral? One reason highlighted by the expert is that crypto is becoming more controlled as big financial firms like BlackRock move in.

2025-07-02T12:56:11,"XRP Price Today Slides After Ripple Unlocks 500M Tokens","The post XRP Price Today Slides After Ripple Unlocks 500M Tokens appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP price today is facing renewed selling pressure, triggered in part by Ripple’s scheduled escrow unlock. On July 1st, blockchain tracking service Whale Alert reported that Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP tokens from escrow, sending a wave of speculation through the market. As the XRP price hovers around $2.18, many investors are now questioning whether July will bring a breakout or a further pullback. Let’s break down the price movements, Ripple’s escrow mechanics, and what may come next. XRP Price Today: Sharp Drop Amid Fresh Token Release At press time, XRP is trading at $2.18, down 1.1% over the last 24 hours and 0.9% in the past 7 days. The price fell sharply by 0.6% in the last hour alone, continuing a bearish trend that began as July kicked off. On July 1, XRP dropped by 2.85%, wiping out some of the gains it accumulated in the final week of June. During June 23–27, XRP surged over 6.11%, reaching a monthly high of $2.32 on June 30. Despite this recent weakness, XRP remains one of the best-performing major cryptocurrencies over the last 12 months, with a staggering 350% annual gain, outperforming both Bitcoin (71.8%) and Ethereum (-29.1%). Ripple Escrow Activity Ripple operates a monthly escrow system that releases 1 billion XRP on the first of every month. This ensures predictable supply and market transparency. This month, Whale Alert confirmed that Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP, which was moved to its well-known wallet, Ripple 27. From there, 200 million XRP was sent to wallet rN8pqR, and 300 million XRP to wallet rKwJaG. Later, Ripple re-locked 400 million XRP into a new escrow via Ripple 15, according to on-chain data. Such moves typically trigger short-term volatility in XRP price today, as traders respond to the potential increase in circulating supply. XRP Price Performance in 2025 In Q1 2025, XRP closed with a modest 0.45% quarterly return, held back by 29.3% and 2.52% drops in February and March, respectively. However, the sentiment shifted in Q2: April : +4.98% May : -0.80% June : +2.95% With a strong rebound at the end of Q2, bulls had hoped for a positive July. However, the market’s early pullback raises short-term concerns. [post_titles_links postid=”477575″] XRP Price Forecast: Can It Still Reach $6.50 or $8? Despite the current dip, analysts remain bullish. A top crypto market analyst predicts that XRP could climb to $6.50 – or even $8 – in July , driven by increasing institutional interest and macro-level crypto momentum. But to get there, XRP must first reclaim key resistance levels at $2.25 and $2.32. If those levels are cleared with volume, the next leg up may follow quickly. Conclusion XRP price today is under pressure following the latest Ripple escrow unlock, but long-term sentiment remains positive. With a strong historical performance, predictable token releases, and growing community optimism, XRP remains a coin to watch. As always, investors should monitor key resistance levels and on-chain activity closely. If Ripple maintains its careful supply management and market demand holds, the path to $6+ might still be open. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs Why does Ripple’s monthly escrow unlock sometimes cause selling pressure on XRP’s price? Ripple’s monthly escrow unlock, which releases 1 billion XRP, can cause selling pressure because it increases the circulating supply of XRP. While Ripple often re-locks a significant portion, the initial release creates an expectation of increased supply, which, if not met by proportional demand, can lead traders to sell, thus pushing the price down in the short term. How does Ripple’s escrow system help ensure market transparency and stability for XRP? Ripple’s escrow system ensures market transparency and stability by providing a predictable, scheduled release of XRP tokens on the first of each month. This controlled distribution prevents sudden market shocks from an unmanaged supply. By re-locking unused XRP, Ripple also demonstrates an active management strategy aimed at balancing supply with market demand, fostering long-term confidence. What role does institutional interest play in XRP’s potential price surge? Institutional interest plays a crucial role in XRP’s potential price surge. Growing institutional adoption, often spurred by increasing regulatory clarity (like the recent SEC developments) and the utility of XRP in cross-border payments, can significantly increase demand. This inflow of “smart money” from large financial players is a key factor analysts point to for driving XRP towards higher price targets like $6.50 or $8. What are the risks of investing in XRP given its current volatility and escrow unlocks? Investing in XRP carries risks due to its price volatility, which can be influenced by monthly escrow unlocks creating short-term supply fluctuations. While the long-term outlook remains positive for many, investors face potential short-term dips if demand doesn’t absorb new supply. Broader market trends and regulatory developments also contribute to its price uncertainty.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-price-today-slides-after-ripple-unlocks-500m-tokens/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS","Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

The executive chairman of MicroStrategy (now known as Strategy) captured the market’s attention—just as Bitcoin rebounded from an intraday low—pushing its price back to around $104,720 from lower levels. Saylor’s message came on the same day Strategy deployed an additional $100 million to acquire Bitcoin, uplifting its total holdings to 582,000 BTC, valued at roughly $61 billion. https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1940305319835615541 While the price impact was modest, the broader narrative underlined Michael Saylor’s practice : tweet, then buy more Bitcoin. His approach links sentiment with strategy—and the market listens. On June 13, Bitcoin had dropped about 4.2% intraday before stabilizing near $104,720—just as Saylor’s tweet landed. The message buoyed prices and repositioned investor sentiment, reinforcing Bitcoin’s emotional value amid volatility. This mirrors his past communications—like “Fight for Bitcoin” during the $108K–$99K dip—or earlier rally-supporting tweets such as “Fade to Orange” in March 2025. Strategy’s Bitcoin accumulation is turning heads. The average entry price stands at $70,982 per coin, reflecting disciplined purchases across macro dips. In the first half of 2025, the firm posted a BTC yield nearing 19.7% after issuing another $1 billion in its tokenized share offering (STRD). Saylor isn’t merely amplifying buzz. He’s reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in preserving value during macro uncertainty. His messaging aligns with heightened ETF flows, weakening dollar sentiment, and global financial uncertainty. The simplicity of “Bitcoin is hope” echoes through institutional and retail layers. For fund managers, the phrase underscores resiliency. For traders, it signals a renewed phaseshift: not just a rally, but a recovery underpinned by narrative and capital. Bitcoin Bigger Picture Bitcoin remains in a consolidation range—hovering near $108,500 as of late June, with on-chain metrics showing neutral-to-bullish momentum. Meanwhile, Saylor’s buying pattern—focused on dips—contrasts sharply with passive holding models. As Strategy approaches the milestone of 600,000 BTC, analysts will monitor two benchmarks: the company’s continued share-based funding and any shifts in Bitcoin yield and price correlation. Saylor’s recent tweet and accompanying buy underline the evolution of his playbook: signal with words, execute with capital.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/michael-saylor-breaks-the-internet-with-just-8-words-about-bitcoin/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor",cryptocompare

Here Are the Latest Data","The 15-day uninterrupted series of net inflows totaling $4.7 billion in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) traded in the US ended on Tuesday, July 2, with a net outflow of $342.2 million. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs End 15-Day Net Inflow Streak: $342 Million Outflow With the end of the series, BlackRock’s flagship product IBIT ended a 15-day trend of $3.8 billion in inflows, closing the day with zero net flows. The day’s highest outflow came from Fidelity’s FBTC fund of $172.7 million. Grayscale’s GBTC fund saw an outflow of $119.5 million, Ark Invest’s ARKB fund $27 million, and Bitwise’s BITB fund $23 million. “This shows that institutional accumulation is taking a break, but it does not mean that the trend is reversing,” said BRN Chief Analyst Valentin Fournier, who had said in an assessment he made at the beginning of the week that the slowdown in daily inflows indicates a short-term cooling in institutional interest. He noted that this situation weakens the chances of Bitcoin exceeding $110,000 without new catalysts. Launched in January 2024, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have generated a total net inflow of $48.9 billion to date. Since the beginning of the year, inflows have reached $13.5 billion, while total assets under management have reached $128 billion. Ethereum ETFs Continue to Inflow On the same day, spot Ethereum ETFs saw net inflows of $40.7 million. The largest contribution came from BlackRock’s ETHA fund: $54.8 million. This is the third consecutive day of net inflows for spot Ethereum ETFs, bringing the total to $150 million over the three days and $4.3 billion since launch. On Wednesday morning, the price of Bitcoin fell below $105,500 ahead of key economic data from the U.S., but has since recovered to around $107,800. “Markets are currently in a data-driven wait. Macro data like the July 3 jobless claims could be a game-changer,” said Vincent Liu, CIO of Kronos Research. BRN’s Fournier, on the other hand, emphasized that Bitcoin’s consolidation in the $105,000 to $110,000 range constitutes a structurally bullish setup, and new regulatory clarity or institutional involvement could re-accelerate the rally. *This is not investment advice.

This is because of strong demand from corporate treasuries and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to the bank. Geoff Kendrick, head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered, noted that these new flows have changed the usual halving cycle dynamics. “BTC has moved beyond the old dynamic where prices fell 18 months after a halving,” he said in the report. Halving Impact Fades in 2025 Cycle Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events—when mining rewards are reduced by 50% approximately every four years—have resulted in massive price rallies and then sharp corrections about 18 months later. But Standard Chartered maintains that this cycle will be different. Kendrick explained how the April 2024 halving may not result in a typical post-halving decline due to the new presence of ETF inflows and corporate buying that were absent in past cycles. Despite the bullish forecast, the bank does not completely discount potential volatility in late Q3 and early Q4, citing the lingering risks of historical correction patterns. ETFs and Corporate Buying to Outdo Past Quarters In Q2 2025, ETF and treasury purchases totaled 245,000 BTC, Standard Chartered noted. The bank expects that figure to be surpassed in the coming few quarters, citing ongoing institutional interest. But this optimism is against the backdrop of a recent pause in ETF momentum. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows of $342.3 million on Tuesday—their first net outflow in over two weeks, per SoSoValue data . But Kendrick sees this as a short-term low point instead of a reversal of the broader bullish trend. Long-Term Vision: $500K by 2028 Standard Chartered reiterates its long-term bullish view, reaffirming its $500,000 price target for Bitcoin by 2028. The bank’s forecast is based on the presumption of ongoing institutional adoption and the further integration of Bitcoin within the international financial system. The bank’s view adds to growing confidence in Bitcoin’s strength and status as a developing asset class with increasingly institutional-driven as opposed to cyclical mining event-driven dynamics.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/bitcoin-135k-q3-says-standard-chartered-citing/,"BTC|TRADING|FIAT|REGULATION|MINING","Bitcoin|Regulation",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T12:43:14,"Spot Ripple (XRP) ETF Coming Up Next? SEC Approves Grayscale’s Multi-Crypto ETF","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved Grayscale Investments’ application to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). The move will see GDLC become a publicly traded ETF offering exposure to several crypto assets within a single structure. Optimism for Altcoin ETFs The GDLC fund currently includes a mix of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA). It is modeled on the CoinDesk 5 Index, which measures the performance of the five largest and most liquid digital assets. Earlier in the week, investment advisor Nate Geraci predicted a “high likelihood” of GDLC getting the regulatory thumbs up following a pro-crypto turnaround at the SEC and U.S. President Donald Trump’s open embrace of the industry. The green light, confirmed in a Monday filing , has seen optimism grow among investors who see the move as a positive signal for potential future approval of altcoin-specific ETFs. This is due to the inclusion of these assets in GDLC’s structure. Geraci noted that the fund could be seen as a low-risk “test run” for the SEC before it gradually starts considering other crypto assets. “See where this is all heading? Individual spot XRP, SOL, ADA, etc, ETFs up next,” wrote the expert. His optimism was shared by Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, who recently released an update to their crypto ETF approval odds. The two said there is now a 95% probability that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for LTC, SOL, and XRP this year. In May, the financial watchdog extended its review timeline for several crypto ETFs, including those tied to XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), to obtain public feedback. However, Canadian financial authorities have been quicker off the mark, approving a couple of spot ETFs tracking XRP in June, 3iQ’s XRPQ, and Purpose Investment’s XRPP. GDLC Trading to Start Soon GDLC will join Grayscale’s existing lineup of converted products following the approval of the firm’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) in January 2025. It introduces one of the first regulated products tracking several digital assets. Subject to periodic rebalancing, the fund’s structure allows daily share creation and redemption, potentially reducing the premium and discount issues that affected GDLC as a closed-end product.

But in a rare and revealing interview with Anthony Pompliano, the former Binance CEO opened up about his journey, the bold risks he took, and his bullish outlook for the future of crypto. One of the best interviews I have done so far. This one went a bit more personal. Lots of little details. Thanks @APompliano https://t.co/B67USoIsE1 — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) July 2, 2025 From Humble Beginnings to Billion-Dollar Bets CZ’s entry into crypto was anything but glamorous. He reminded viewers that he once sold his house and quit a secure job to go all-in on the nascent crypto industry. That leap of faith became one of the most iconic success stories in crypto history. While CZ didn’t disclose his exact net worth during the interview, Forbes estimates it at $65.1 billion, largely tied to his substantial holdings of BNB , the native token of Binance. It’s believed he controls about 64% of BNB’s total supply. But CZ made it clear: money is no longer the goal. “Money is not the limiting resource,” he said. “Time and energy are.” He now chooses projects based on passion and long-term impact, not financial returns. Bitcoin vs. Real Estate and Caution on Treasury Strategies CZ also weighed in on Bitcoin’s value trajectory, stating that Bitcoin will soon be worth more than an average American house. While he’s bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term value , he cautioned companies against blindly adding Bitcoin to their treasuries without proper risk assessment. According to CZ, corporate adoption needs strategy, not just hype. [post_titles_links postid=”477688″] Institutional Adoption, ETFs, and XRP’s Role The conversation wasn’t just about reflection. CZ said the crypto industry is entering an “extremely bullish” phase, driven by institutional interest. He highlighted the growing wave of crypto ETFs , corporate treasuries embracing Bitcoin and Ethereum, and even traditional stock exchanges integrating digital assets. Notably, CZ also addressed XRP. He explained why Binance continued to list XRP even during its legal troubles, emphasizing that XRP remained one of the top-traded coins on the platform, generating massive trading volume and fee revenue. AI, Blockchain, and the Next Wave of Innovation Looking ahead, CZ is particularly excited about the intersection of AI and blockchain . He envisions AI-powered crypto tools and governments adopting blockchain for digital IDs, tax systems, and public services. “Just nine months ago, I wouldn’t have said this,” CZ admitted, “but now I see a new wave coming.” Final Thoughts From sacrificing stability for vision to shaping the future of digital finance, CZ’s story is a reminder that the crypto space is still evolving and the next chapter might just be the most revolutionary yet.

2025-07-02T12:30:59,"Ethereum ETFs Witness Amazing $40.7M Inflow Surge","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETFs Witness Amazing $40.7M Inflow Surge The digital asset landscape is buzzing with exciting news! On July 1, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a combined net inflow of an impressive $40.7 million. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the third consecutive trading day of positive net inflows for these crucial investment vehicles. For anyone watching the evolution of cryptocurrencies, this consistent flow of capital into Ethereum ETFs is a powerful signal, hinting at growing confidence and momentum in the market. What’s Fueling the Surge in Ethereum ETFs? This recent surge in capital entering Ethereum ETFs isn’t just a random fluctuation; it reflects a broader trend of increasing investor interest and comfort with digital assets. The $40.7 million figure, as reported by Farside Investors, highlights a significant vote of confidence from market participants. But what exactly does a ‘net inflow’ mean, and why is it so important? Net Inflow Defined: A net inflow occurs when the total value of new money invested into an ETF exceeds the value of money withdrawn from it on a given day. It’s a clear indicator of demand. Consistent Momentum: Three consecutive days of inflows suggest sustained buying interest, rather than just a one-time purchase. This builds positive sentiment. Market Maturity: The very existence and growing popularity of spot Ethereum ETFs signify a maturing market, offering traditional investors regulated pathways to gain exposure to Ethereum. This consistent positive trend helps to solidify Ethereum’s position as a key player in the evolving financial ecosystem, attracting both retail and institutional capital. A Closer Look at Spot Ethereum ETFs Performance While the overall picture is positive, it’s insightful to dive into the performance of individual ETH ETFs . The data reveals some key players driving these inflows, as well as some interesting dynamics: ETF Ticker Manager Net Inflow (July 1) ETHA BlackRock $54.8 million ETHE Grayscale $10 million FETH Fidelity -$24.1 million (Outflow) Other ETFs Various No change BlackRock’s ETHA clearly led the charge, attracting a substantial $54.8 million. This isn’t surprising given BlackRock’s immense presence in traditional finance and its successful launch of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Grayscale’s ETHE also saw positive movement with $10 million in inflows, indicating some fresh capital, although it still faces significant outflows from its conversion from a trust to an ETF. Interestingly, Fidelity’s FETH recorded a net outflow of $24.1 million. This could be due to various factors, including profit-taking by early investors, rebalancing of portfolios, or reallocation of funds to other investment vehicles. It’s a reminder that even within a generally positive trend, individual fund performances can vary based on specific investor strategies and market conditions. The remaining ETFs reported no change in holdings for the day, suggesting that the bulk of the action was concentrated in these larger players. Why Do Consistent Crypto Inflows Matter for the Market? The significance of these consistent crypto inflows extends far beyond just the numbers. They act as a vital barometer for market sentiment and can have profound effects on the broader digital asset ecosystem. Here’s why they are so important: Boosting Market Confidence: Sustained inflows signal that institutional and retail investors are becoming more comfortable with the asset class, reducing perceived risk and encouraging others to enter. Increasing Liquidity: More capital flowing into ETFs means more liquidity for the underlying asset, Ethereum. This can lead to more stable trading environments and potentially tighter spreads. Potential for Price Appreciation: While not a direct causation, consistent buying pressure from ETFs can contribute to upward price movement for Ethereum, as demand outstrips available supply on exchanges. Validation of the Asset Class: The willingness of major financial institutions to launch and manage these products, coupled with investor demand, validates cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and investable asset class. These inflows represent real money entering the system, demonstrating a tangible shift in how mainstream finance views and engages with cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Paving the Way for Institutional Adoption Perhaps the most profound implication of these sustained inflows into ETH ETFs is their role in accelerating institutional adoption . For years, traditional financial institutions have eyed the crypto space with a mix of curiosity and caution. ETFs provide the perfect bridge, offering a regulated, familiar, and accessible way for large funds, endowments, and wealth managers to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of direct crypto custody or navigating unregulated exchanges. Consider the benefits that attract institutional players: Regulatory Clarity: ETFs operate within existing financial regulations, offering a level of oversight that many institutions require. Ease of Access: Investing in an ETF is as simple as buying a stock, integrating seamlessly into existing portfolio management systems. Security: The custody of the underlying Ethereum is handled by professional, regulated custodians, mitigating security concerns for institutions. Diversification: For many traditional portfolios, adding exposure to digital assets like Ethereum offers a new avenue for diversification and potential growth. The continued success and growth of these ETFs could unlock a ‘wall of money’ from traditional finance, fundamentally reshaping the crypto market’s scale and influence. Navigating the Future of Ethereum and Digital Assets With the positive momentum around Ethereum ETFs , what does the future hold for Ethereum and the broader landscape of digital assets ? Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contract innovation, makes it a compelling investment. The inflows into ETFs are a testament to the belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential as a foundational layer for Web3. For investors considering engaging with this space, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Understand the specifics of each ETF, its fees, and its underlying assets. Understand Volatility: While ETFs offer a more traditional investment vehicle, the underlying asset (Ethereum) remains volatile. Be prepared for price fluctuations. Long-Term Perspective: Many investors view these ETFs as a long-term play on the growth of the digital economy. Diversify: As with any investment, consider diversifying your portfolio across various asset classes, including a measured allocation to digital assets if it aligns with your risk tolerance. The increasing accessibility through regulated products like spot Ethereum ETFs is a game-changer, making it easier for a wider range of investors to participate in the growth of this transformative technology. A Bright Horizon for Ethereum Investments The consistent net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs , culminating in a remarkable $40.7 million on July 1, underscore a powerful and undeniable trend: growing confidence and sustained demand for Ethereum as an investable asset. This momentum, driven significantly by major players like BlackRock, signals a new era of mainstream acceptance and deepens the integration of digital assets into traditional finance. As institutional adoption continues to gather pace, these ETFs will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the crypto market, offering unprecedented access and legitimacy to a once-niche asset class. The horizon looks bright for Ethereum and its journey towards becoming a cornerstone of global investment portfolios.

2025-07-02T12:30:28,"Crypto’s complexity must be solved, but platforms need to get the balance right","Just picture the scene – you’ve just started learning about crypto, and you decide that you want to buy your first Bitcoin, so what do you do? You do what Google and every other source tells you and head straight to a crypto exchange, which you’re told is reputable and the easiest and cheapest way to buy it. But what happens next? Instead of a simple, straightforward process, you’re hit with flashing charts, a long list of abbreviations (BTC, BCH, DOGE, SOL, ETH, TRX etc), cryptic wallet addresses and concepts such as “staking”, “bridging”, and “gas”. Overwhelmed and unsure how to proceed, you simply give up. You don’t get the Bitcoin you wanted. This kind of experience is all too common, and it’s not because blockchain failed, but rather, the user experience. It’s a major challenge that’s stalling crypto’s mass adoption. While blockchain technology has incredible promise, the learning curve associated with it acts as a brick wall that few people are willing to try and scale. A good user experience doesn’t just mean having stylish colors and a sleek design. It means ensuring clarity, trust and showing users how to navigate through an alien landscape. In the world of crypto, where a single mistaken click can cost thousands of dollars, user experience cannot be a luxury. It’s essential. Crypto’s UI barrier Blockchain is, by definition, inherently complex. There’s no getting around it, for concepts such as distributed networks, consensus mechanisms, cryptography, gas fees, and wallet addresses are essential to its operation. Yet they throw up numerous hurdles for newcomers, and something as simple as buying your first Bitcoins, sending a payment, interacting with a smart contract, and even paying the gas fee involves a steep learning curve that few are willing to attempt. The challenge for crypto exchange designers is that many seasoned crypto investors are familiar with these technicalities; they know all about decentralised finance, staking, swapping, and liquidity provision, and they want to be able to engage in these activities. There’s good money to be made, after all, yet any exchange that caters exclusively to this crowd risks alienating anyone who’s just finding their feet. If new users are overwhelmed by complicated charts and alien terminology, it’s highly likely that they’re just going to throw in the towel. Or if not, it will slow them down immensely, leaving a sour taste in their mouth. Why UI accelerates adoption By providing a seamless user interface, platforms can make crypto feel much more familiar. If a crypto wallet is able to mimic the look and feel of a typical mobile banking app, with clearly labeled buttons for sending and receiving funds, checking their balance, purchasing crypto and easy onboarding, new users will feel right at home, dramatically easing the onboarding process. By simplifying essential tasks such as setting up and securing a new wallet, sending payments, and so on, crypto apps eliminate the fear many users have of making a costly mistake. A clear and concise user interface can do wonders for engendering greater trust, which is another essential element when trying to onboard new users. It’s key because the crypto industry has long been associated with hacks and scams that can relieve users of their life savings in a matter of seconds. There’s also the very real risk of user error, which is increased by a poorly designed UX. What’s needed is a transparent, clear and friendly UI that warns users of risks, such as malicious smart contracts. Crypto platforms need to confirm user’s actions in plain language in order to build confidence, letting them know what’s at stake with every interaction. When it comes to building crypto platforms, designers will do well to remember that most new users aren’t concerned with ideals around decentralization and they’re not interested in the inner workings of blockchain. What they want are tools that can solve their problems and achieve their goals. Designers need to create interfaces that are focused on outcomes, such as sending money across borders at lower costs, rather than the complexities that enable them. If crypto can prioritize simplicity, it will attract the legions of users who prioritize convenience over ideology. The need for balance One of the major attractions of crypto is the opportunities it provides, especially with decentralized finance. While most newcomers simply want to “own” some crypto, once they have it they may well be interested in exploring the things they can do with it. Decentralized finance provides myriad ways for users to invest their crypto, such as staking to secure the underlying blockchain network, lending funds to those who want to borrow, providing liquidity for decentralized exchange platforms and so on. The challenge for crypto apps is to incorporate these more advanced features within a simple UI that encourages convenient onboarding, creating a clear and simple pathway for users to explore the options available to them. This means showing people the potential rewards, as well as the risks, and explicit instructions on how to proceed. If crypto designers are looking for a blueprint on how they can strike this balance, they need look no further than the computer they’re using to create their apps. Modern laptops are simple things – everyone knows how to turn it on, open up a browser and start exploring the Web, or find the file they’re looking for within “My Documents”. But at the same time, those laptops are capable of running incredibly complex IDEs for application design, photo editing and accounting, which require a certain level of expertise to operate. Such complexities are buried just beneath the surface, allowing laptops to cater to the most sophisticated users while still being instantly accessible to users without technical skills. This is the kind of design crypto apps must aspire to. Is anyone doing it right? Most crypto platforms are still fairly mind-boggling for new users, but there are a few examples that buck the trend. For instance, Rabby is a rare example of a crypto wallet that virtually anyone can pick up and feel right at home in, thanks to a user-friendly UI that provides immediate clarity on how many assets the user has, how to buy and how to initiate transactions. It also highlights any security risks before the user confirms a transaction, while automating technical aspects such as choosing the correct blockchain. For crypto exchange platforms, few have achieved such an optimal balance as XBO.com , which follows a user-centered ethos in its approach to design. As co-founder Lior Aizik described in an interview with Hackernoon, its designers were heavily influenced by the most successful trading platforms in traditional finance, applying the lessons learned there to crypto. Its UI is focused on clarity and speed, with a fast onboarding process, simple wallet set up and a seamless trading experience that leaves no room for error or surprises. At the same time, XBO.com also incorporates functionality and tools for experienced crypto traders in such a way that beginners won’t feel overwhelmed. Accessibility is a top priority, and that extends to low minimum deposits, a seamless KYC experience, and a comprehensive loyalty program that provides easy access to rewards, encouraging new users to explore everything the platform has to offer. Such is the streamlined nature of XBO’s platform, it was recently named as the “Best Crypto Payment Gateway” by IFX. There’s also Grayscale , which is an example of how simplified design is expanding to institutional crypto users. As one of the top digital asset management platforms in the business, Grayscale stands out for its sleek and intuitive platform that caters to both seasoned investors and more traditional types, with a look and feel that closely resembles mainstream investment tools. Moving Forward These days, mobile banking apps have become so intuitive that they’re almost ubiquitous in modern societies. Crypto needs to do the same if it wants to unlock its potential to empower billions of people globally. To summarize, a better user experience is not a luxury for crypto. It’s an absolute necessity if the industry wants to achieve mass adoption. With a clean and clear UI, crypto can lower barriers to entry, engineer more trust, and make it relatable to the average consumer. Do that and people will not only see the benefits crypto offers, but be eager to try it out for themselves.

2025-07-02T12:30:05,"Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Near Pain Point Last Seen In October 2024","According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, long‑term Bitcoin holders are sitting on unrealized gains last seen during the October 2024 market dip. Right now, those holders show an average profit of 220% on coins they bought and held for the long run. That figure is surprisingly low given Bitcoin’s recent surge back above $107,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming Lower Profit Levels Than Previous Peaks Darkfost used the MVRV ratio — market value relative to the average cost paid by long‑term holders — to track these shifts. In March 2024, when Bitcoin pushed up to $74,500, MVRV hit 300%. Then in December 2024, at the $108,000 peak, it climbed to 350%. By contrast, today’s 220% gain reflects the fact that many long‑term holders bought in at much higher levels than earlier in the cycle. Price Needs To Rise To Match Past Gains Based on an average cost basis of $33,800, Bitcoin would need to climb back to $135,200 just to restore that 300% profit level. If the market aimed to hit the 357% mark again, prices would have to reach roughly $154,400. Both figures track with what history tells us about investor behavior — people tend to sell when profits hit big round numbers. 📉 Unrealized profits of LTH continue to decline and are now approaching levels last seen during the October 2024 correction. The average unrealized profit, based on the MVRV ratio, currently stands at around 220%. That may seem high for BTC, but when compared to previous… pic.twitter.com/NeTCmXZVTY — Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) July 1, 2025 Historical Cycle Comparisons Looking farther back shows how much room remains. In December 2017, at the $19,500 top, long‑term holders saw unrealized profits of 4,000%. Then during the 2020/2021 cycle, Bitcoin spiked to $63,000 in April 2021 and MVRV topped out at 1,230%. By November 2021, prices hit about $68,400 but unrealized gains for long‑term holders had already fallen to 340%. An analyst’s recent outlook lines up with this math, first pegging a cycle top at $135,000 in October 2024. After reviewing new data in May 2025, they revised the target range to $120,000–$150,000 and suggested a likely peak between August and September 2025. That range overlaps with the price levels needed to bring MVRV back to earlier highs. Room For More Upside, But Watch The Risks Based on latest figures, Bitcoin is trading at $106,750, roughly flat over the last 24 hours. Lower profit margins mean fewer long‑term holders are itching to sell right now, which could leave more fuel for higher prices. Still, on‑chain numbers don’t capture the whole picture. Spot-market flows, ETF moves and wider economic shifts can all trigger sharp reversals. Related Reading: Insane Or Insightful? VC Firm Says XRP Could Reach Nearly $9,000 In Just 5 Years For now, the evidence points to a market that isn’t overheated. If Bitcoin follows past cycles, it may have farther to climb before long‑term holders lock in gains at levels seen in March or December 2024. But investors should balance these on‑chain metrics with real‑world signals — and be ready for whatever comes next.
