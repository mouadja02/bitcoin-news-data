2025-07-02T15:54:24,"Outset PR Finds 82% of Crypto Media Lost Traffic as MiCA Took Hold in Western Europe, Italy and Spain Hit Hardest","Four fifths of crypto media outlets across Western Europe lost traffic in Q1 2025. This single statistic defines the quarter — and reshapes how crypto information reaches users across the continent. According to Outset PR’s newly released report — building on their earlier Q1 analysis of crypto media declines in LATAM — the same downward trend played out in Western Europe between January and March, revealing a sharp contradiction: growing public interest in crypto, but shrinking media visibility. The report tracked 133 Western European outlets, of which 87 were crypto-focused, using SimilarWeb and Ahrefs to measure traffic and search visibility. A clear majority of crypto-only sites saw audience declines — driven by the combined effects of MiCA-aligned regulatory pressure, Google’s March algorithm update, and shifting search behaviors tied to market volatility. As the EU’s first comprehensive crypto framework, MiCA began reshaping media visibility by forcing outlets to rethink compliance, language, and even tone — well before full enforcement kicked in. During the aforementioned timeframe, traffic across crypto-native media dropped from 26.57 million to 22.22 million visits, a decline of more than 16%. To understand the full weight of that 82%, it needs to be broken down by region, language, and outlet structure to see who survived, who collapsed, and why. Western Europe crypto media performance: data sourced from Outset PR Where the Declines Were Sharpest: Regional Breakdown Outset PR tracks MiCA’s varied impact on crypto media across Western European countries Based on Outset PR’s findings, the hardest-hit countries were Italy and Spain, with both seeing over 70% of tracked crypto outlets lose visibility in Q1. In Italy, this decline was especially striking given that it leads the region in crypto interest — 37% of the population expresses active engagement. The downturn was largely driven by regulatory scrutiny from CONSOB, which targeted influencer-led content and investment-style messaging. Top Italian outlets lost nearly half their traffic. Only Borsainside maintained consistent growth, ending the quarter up 15.96%. In Spain, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV) began enforcing strict advertising guidelines, which led to a significant reduction in ad-supported content and discoverability. Although Bit2Me News surged 149.4% in March — making it one of the top performers across the region — most other Spanish-language outlets ended the quarter with traffic in decline. Germany: Europe’s Largest Crypto Language Market Still Struggled German-speaking outlets made up nearly 40% of the crypto-native platforms reviewed in Outset PR’s dataset. Despite this dominant share, the German market faced significant visibility challenges in Q1. In February, the financial regulator BaFin issued new guidance that warned against any investment-like promotion from unlicensed parties — including media platforms. Amid these developments, outlets like Coin-Update, Krypto Magazin, and BitcoinBlog.de saw sharp traffic declines. Although a few sites posted gains in March, more than half of the region’s crypto-focused German-language publishers continued trending downward at quarter’s end. A key exception was CoinJournal DE, which grew 23.90% in Q1. Backed by Investoo Group, the outlet benefited from shared SEO expertise, multilingual publishing capabilities, and regulatory infrastructure. These elements allowed it to navigate algorithmic changes and new content standards more effectively than independent competitors. France: Transparent Labels Became the Differentiator In France, regulatory enforcement from the AMF focused on transparency rather than restrictions, prompting algorithmic suppression of outlets that failed to properly label promotions or disclose financial risks. By February, 72% of French-language crypto platforms had lost traffic. Some sites like The Blog saw their visibility collapse almost entirely. Others, such as Blockchain France and InvestX, rebounded by March, likely due to cleaner disclaimer practices, improved metadata, and expansion into multilingual publishing. The divide in outcomes highlights the start of a more polarized crypto media environment in France, where clarity and compliance are now essential for sustainable reach. Dutch-Language Media Faced Algorithmic Whiplash Outlets serving readers in the Netherlands and Belgium faced no direct media restrictions from regulators during Q1. However, their heavy reliance on SEO and Google visibility made them especially vulnerable to algorithmic shifts. Outset PR’s report also shows that in February, 76% of Dutch-speaking crypto outlets reported traffic losses. High-profile names like Bitcoin Magazine NL fell 36.78%, while Bitcoinspot.nl dropped 39.30%. A few properties — such as Beste Bank and Coinmarketcap.nl —bounced back in March, thanks to stronger content quality and diversified link-building strategies. Still, most Dutch-language outlets were unable to regain their January positions, demonstrating the inherent risk of traffic models built almost entirely around search visibility. UK Outlets Felt the Ripple Effects of Domestic Policy Although the United Kingdom is not bound by MiCA, local regulation had a comparable impact. In early January, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) expanded its financial promotions regime to include crypto. This contributed to widespread visibility losses for UK-facing outlets, especially those featuring unverified affiliate offers or poorly labeled advertorials. Most UK crypto-native platforms saw traffic decline across the quarter. Only The Market Periodical and MyCryptoSpaceUK posted quarterly gains, though both averaged well below 100K monthly visits. Meanwhile, Cryptouk.io and Bitcourier continued trending downward, underscoring that even outside of MiCA, enforcement and algorithm shifts are reshaping how crypto media operates in the UK. No UK-based outlet crossed the 500K monthly visit threshold, suggesting that while regulation played a role, overall readership remained modest compared to Germany, France, or the Netherlands. Tiered Media Analysis: Who Still Commands Reach? Outset PR’s analysis revealed that traffic is concentrated among a small group of top-tier publishers. Just seven outlets surpassed 1 million monthly visits, together accounting for 60.26% of the region’s total crypto-native traffic. A mid-tier of six outlets generated between 500K and 900K monthly visits, accounting for another 18% of total visibility. Beyond these two groups, 58 outlets attracted fewer than 100K monthly visits each, combining for only 6.24% of the total audience. While 16 outlets did post traffic increases during Q1, most of them grew by percentage, not by reach. Only Newsbit.de combined high growth with consistently strong reach above the 1 million mark. Mainstream Finance Media Outperformed Crypto-Native Outlets In contrast to crypto-specific sites, generalist finance, tech, and economic publications proved far more resilient. Outset PR tracked 46 such platforms in Western Europe, and 25 of them posted quarterly growth. Together, they generated over 106 million visits, dwarfing the 22 million visits recorded by crypto-only sites. These outlets benefited from strong domain authority, broader editorial scopes, and less reliance on price-based speculation content. Outset PR notes that finance-first platforms have become vital for crypto PR efforts — especially in a MiCA-enforced environment where credibility and compliance now define reach. Google Discover Favors Structured, Compliant Media As Outset PR notes, the battle for traffic in Q1 extended beyond search rankings — into Google Discover, where surfacing now reflects a site’s editorial structure and legal hygiene. Only 22.99% of crypto-native outlets maintained consistent presence in Google Discover in Q1 2025. By comparison, 32.61% of non-crypto-native outlets appeared consistently in Discover. Nine of these sites surpassed 1 million monthly visits, confirming the importance of technical compliance and editorial credibility in Google's evolving news ecosystem. Outset PR’s report makes one thing clear: the traffic drop experienced by crypto-covering media outlets in Western Europe during Q1 2025 was a structural reset. Regulation, platform policies, and evolving search engine standards have raised the bar for visibility, and many crypto publishers found themselves unprepared for the new terrain. In this cycle, survival hinges on multilingual reach, legal clarity, and editorial agility. SEO depth, risk disclaimers, and compliance-ready publishing aren’t just best practices — they’re the price of admission. As the standout data-driven agency with a boutique approach to crypto communications, Outset PR emphasizes the importance of tailoring media planning to business goals, market dynamics, and regional nuances.

2025-07-02T15:41:09,"Bitcoin Price Prediction Experts Now Tracking Bitcoin Solaris: The ‘Next Bitcoin’ Set to Outperform Original 100x","There was a time when buying Bitcoin felt like buying magic internet money. Fast forward to today, and it’s a full-blown global asset. Price predictions for Bitcoin are already climbing toward the $127,000 mark, with analysts forecasting an 18 percent climb. But something surprising is happening in parallel. Those same experts are now tracking a lesser-known token that is igniting early-buyer excitement all over again: Bitcoin Solaris. While Bitcoin moves like a freight train, Bitcoin Solaris is more like a rocket on standby. Bitcoin Still Leads, But It’s Slowing Down Bitcoin remains the king. No dispute there. Its scarcity and security make it the foundation of the crypto market. But innovation isn’t its strongest suit. Its TPS hovers under 10, smart contracts are clunky, and forget about mobile mining. It’s digital gold, yes. But it’s not designed for the mobile-first, app-powered economy we live in now. The Bitcoin Solaris Difference Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just another altcoin chasing Bitcoin’s shadow. It’s designed to go further and faster by solving the limitations that have long held back Bitcoin. From the ground up, Bitcoin Solaris reimagines what Bitcoin could look like if it launched in today’s world. Forget the Old Playbook BTC-S Wrote a New One Its core breakthroughs include: A dual-consensus model combining Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake Validator rotation for decentralization and security Smart contracts that support DeFi, enterprise, and real-world integrations A blazing fast dual-layer architecture that reaches over 10,000 transactions per second Energy efficiency at scale, using 99.95 percent less energy than traditional mining models These aren’t small upgrades. They’re seismic shifts. Mobile Mining: Power in Your Pocket At the heart of the Bitcoin Solaris experience is the upcoming Solaris Nova app. This isn’t some theoretical interface. It’s a real mobile-first infrastructure built to make mining accessible to anyone with a smartphone. The mining calculator available here shows just how powerful the rewards can be. Users don’t need bulky hardware or deep technical know-how. All it takes is a phone and a few taps, and suddenly they’re participating in a decentralized economy with real income potential. Analysts, Investors, and Influencers All Locked In Crypto influencers and market analysts aren’t sitting this one out. A growing number are zooming in on Bitcoin Solaris and its explosive upside. One of the most comprehensive reviews comes from Token Empire , who covered the unique features, performance, and the overall buzz around BTC-S. The takeaway? This isn’t a flash-in-the-pan token. It’s built to scale, adapt, and possibly surpass expectations, the way early Bitcoin once did. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini games for its holders for a chance to earn daily rewards, checkout all the details here. Real Rewards. Real Ecosystem. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t offering just theoretical benefits. Its reward distribution system is designed for long-term sustainability and fairness. Miners, validators, and contributors are all part of an ecosystem that respects both time and effort. Here’s how it works: Rewards are distributed across both consensus layers Time-weighted calculations ensure long-term participants earn more High-performing devices yield higher returns Contribution scores are factored in to prioritize active participation The design doesn’t just reward activity. It rewards loyalty. Presale Momentum: The Window is Closing The Bitcoin Solaris presale is heating up fast. Currently in Phase 10 at $10, it’s preparing to jump to $11 very soon. With a final launch price of $20, early participants stand to gain up to 150 percent just by entering before July 31. More than 13,650 users have already joined, raising over 6 million dollars. It’s being described by many as one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. Less than 5 weeks left to enter Over 11,000 users already on board Dubbed the shortest presale in crypto history To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask for seamless delivery. Security and Trust Already in Place Trust in the crypto world comes with proof. Bitcoin Solaris has already been audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , two of the most respected audit firms in the space. And community growth continues through its Telegram and X pages: Telegram X Investors are not just betting on hype. They’re betting on verified infrastructure. Final Verdict: The Next Bitcoin Might Already Be Here Bitcoin Solaris is not trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s extending its value with speed, utility, and accessibility that Bitcoin can no longer achieve. If you missed out on buying Bitcoin at $100, this might be your second chance. Analysts certainly think so, and judging by the presale momentum, thousands of early adopters agree. The door is open. The question is: Are you stepping through it?

2025-07-02T15:30:39,"Metaplanet Bitcoin: Japanese Firm Unlocks Astounding $7.57M Q2 Revenue Surge","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin: Japanese Firm Unlocks Astounding $7.57M Q2 Revenue Surge Metaplanet Bitcoin has just sent ripples through the financial world, announcing an impressive surge in its second-quarter earnings. This publicly listed Japanese firm, known for its bold pivot into BTC investments , reported a significant revenue increase, highlighting a growing trend of corporate embrace of digital assets. What does this remarkable performance mean for the future of institutional adoption and the broader crypto market? Metaplanet Bitcoin: A Strategic Pivot in Japan In an era where traditional finance grapples with inflation and economic uncertainties, companies are seeking innovative ways to preserve and grow capital. Metaplanet Bitcoin stands out as a prime example of this strategic evolution. Formerly a traditional financial services firm, Metaplanet made headlines when it announced a significant shift in its treasury strategy, opting to convert substantial portions of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. This move, echoing strategies employed by global pioneers like MicroStrategy, positioned Metaplanet as a leading Japanese Crypto Firm committed to leveraging Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. The decision was rooted in a deep understanding of macroeconomic pressures, particularly the weakening Japanese Yen and the global inflationary environment. By embracing Institutional BTC Adoption , Metaplanet aimed to protect its balance sheet from currency devaluation while capitalizing on Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation. Their initial significant acquisitions set the stage for what has now become a testament to their foresight. Decoding Metaplanet’s Impressive Bitcoin Revenue The latest official announcement from Metaplanet reveals a compelling success story. For the second quarter of the year, the company reported a staggering revenue of 1,097.25 million yen, equivalent to approximately $7.57 million in Bitcoin Revenue . This figure represents a robust 42.4% increase compared to their first-quarter performance, signaling accelerated growth and profitability stemming directly from their digital asset strategy. As of June 30, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings reached an impressive 13,350 BTC. This substantial accumulation underscores their unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The revenue reported is primarily attributed to the appreciation of their Bitcoin holdings during the second quarter, demonstrating the tangible financial benefits that can accrue from well-timed and strategic BTC investments . This growth trajectory highlights Bitcoin’s increasing viability as a corporate treasury solution, moving beyond speculative trading to become a recognized asset class for balance sheet management. The Growing Wave of Institutional BTC Adoption in Japan Metaplanet’s success is not an isolated incident but rather a significant indicator of a broader shift towards Institutional BTC Adoption within Japan and across Asia. For years, Japan has been a key player in the cryptocurrency space, with a progressive regulatory framework that has fostered innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Metaplanet’s public commitment and now demonstrated financial success could serve as a powerful catalyst for other Japanese Crypto Firm s and corporations to explore similar strategies. The benefits of such adoption are manifold: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin offers a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies, providing a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Asset Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term appreciation, offering potential capital gains for corporate treasuries. Strategic Diversification: Including Bitcoin diversifies a company’s asset portfolio, reducing reliance on traditional assets and market cycles. Technological Edge: Embracing digital assets positions companies at the forefront of financial innovation, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges, including market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and the need for robust security infrastructure to manage significant BTC investments . What Do Metaplanet’s Q2 Earnings Mean for the Future? The strong Q2 Earnings Crypto report from Metaplanet provides valuable insights into the potential trajectory of corporate Bitcoin strategies. This success story is likely to embolden Metaplanet to continue its accumulation strategy, potentially increasing its Bitcoin holdings further in anticipation of future market appreciation. It also sends a clear message to other corporations contemplating similar moves: Bitcoin can indeed be a powerful tool for financial growth and stability when managed strategically. Looking ahead, Metaplanet’s performance could ignite a ripple effect across the Japanese corporate landscape. As more companies witness the tangible benefits of Bitcoin Revenue generated through strategic digital asset holdings, the pace of institutional adoption is expected to accelerate. This will not only strengthen Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class but also foster a more robust and mature crypto ecosystem globally. Global Implications of Strong Crypto Earnings Japan The impressive Q2 Earnings Crypto from a prominent Japanese Crypto Firm like Metaplanet resonates far beyond Japan’s borders. It reinforces the global narrative that Bitcoin is maturing into a viable, long-term asset for corporate treasuries. While MicroStrategy has long been the poster child for corporate Bitcoin adoption in the West, Metaplanet’s emergence as a significant player in Asia adds a crucial dimension to this trend. This success could inspire more publicly traded companies worldwide to consider Bitcoin as part of their balance sheet strategy. It validates the premise that holding Bitcoin can be a significant driver of shareholder value, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. The consistent reporting of positive Bitcoin Revenue by such firms strengthens the case for Bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset, paving the way for broader acceptance and integration into traditional financial systems. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Vision Pays Off Metaplanet’s second-quarter financial results are more than just numbers; they represent a significant milestone in the journey of institutional Bitcoin adoption. With a remarkable 42.4% increase in revenue, primarily driven by their BTC investments , Metaplanet has showcased the immense potential of integrating digital assets into corporate treasury strategies. Their commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and growth asset positions them as a vanguard among Japanese Crypto Firm s and a model for global corporations considering a similar strategic pivot. This success story reinforces Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its pivotal role in shaping the future of finance, signaling a robust outlook for continued Institutional BTC Adoption worldwide.

2025-07-02T15:30:07,"Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Surge Past 3 Million BTC As Treasury Firms Multiply–Report","Bitcoin’s role on company balance sheets is growing fast. According to a report , 199 entities now hold 3 million BTC, worth about $315 billion. That total has more than doubled since the start of 2024. It marks a clear shift in how big firms view crypto, not just as a trading asset but as a long‑term treasury play. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Surge Among those 199 entities, 147 public and private companies account for 1.1 million BTC (around $115 billion). Strategy, the pioneer in this space, holds 580,250 BTC—about $60 billion—and trades at a market cap of $104 billion. That gives it a Multiple on Net Asset Value (MNAV) of 1.7× today. Investors once paid up to 2× NAV for Strategy’s shares, reflecting confidence in its ability to grow BTC‑per‑share faster than anyone else. Valuing Pure Play Treasury Firms When a firm’s main business is holding Bitcoin , its shares need to outperform Bitcoin itself. That premium, known as MNAV, depends on faith in management and clear execution plans. Strategy has used three main tools since 2020: issuing convertible debt, running an At‑the‑Market stock program, and plowing free cash flow into spot Bitcoin. New rivals are copying and tweaking this playbook—letting holders swap coins for stock, buying underpriced firms to turn cash into BTC, and even adding private deals to raise funds. Debt Risks Loom Large An extended bear market could test these models. If Bitcoin falls and shares trade at or below NAV, debt‑heavy firms might struggle to refinance when notes come due. That could force them to sell Bitcoin into a downtrend, pushing prices lower. Smaller companies without Strategy’s scale will face higher borrowing costs and tougher terms. During a recession, margin calls and forced sales may cascade throughout the market, although most of these companies use equity financing mainly. Wider Industry Influence From September 2021, as soon as El Salvador legitimized BTC as legal tender, corporate demand grew. BlackRock’s launch of IBIT ETF in January 2024 further fueled it, and US President Donald Trump has talked about the economic function of Bitcoin. Now, new players from Japan’s Metaplanet to US‑based GameStop are rolling out treasury plans. Purpose‑built firms like Twenty One Capital and reverse‑merger entrants such as Strive and Nakamoto have staked their futures on Bitcoin. More Companies To Enter The Market? Experts expect more crypto treasury companies to emerge—covering assets like Solana and Ethereum as well. Early names include DeFi Development Corp with 420,000 SOL and SharpLink Gaming, which raised $425 million for ETH holdings. Many will fail, and the strongest will buy up weaker rivals. Thankfully, most rely on stock‑based financing, so a few collapses won’t topple the whole market. But those loaded with debt could still pose a wider threat.

2025-07-02T15:24:55,"MARA Holdings: Levered To Post-Halving Bitcoin Cycle","Summary We initiate coverage on MARA Holdings with a Strong Buy and $44 price target, citing unmatched operational leverage to Bitcoin’s next cycle and cost leadership. Our thesis is built on above-consensus revenue forecasts, driven by a 60 EH/s hash-rate ramp, low $0.04/kWh energy costs, and robust treasury BTC optionality. Valuation is compelling: MARA trades at a deep discount to historical and peer multiples, with 180% upside justified by macro tailwinds and post-halving expansion. Key risks include Bitcoin price volatility, regulatory headwinds, and potential dilution, but we see the risk/reward as highly favorable at current levels. Levered to the Next Crypto Cycle We initiate with a Strong Buy/$44 PT. MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA ) operates one of the world’s most advanced vertically integrated Bitcoin mining platforms, leveraging proprietary technology and low-cost energy infrastructure to deliver digital assets at scale via the US. Beneath the volatile exterior, MARA occupies a sweet spot of structural and cyclical drivers for a step-change in miner economics. More than 100k BTC cleared in the second quarter of 2025 began to reset base-case assumptions, yet consensus underwrites sub-80k BTC and underestimates the length and magnitude of post-halving multiple expansion. We see $1.36 billion in FY 2025E revenue (up 107% y/y, 43% above the Street) as energized Ohio/Texas wind assets, along with forthcoming flare-gas sites, deliver 60 EH/s of hash rate to keep network share elevated despite global difficulty hikes. Embedded in our base case is a self-inflicted above-consensus BTC price path of $105 k/$130 k FY 2025E/FY 2026E annual averages, already realized in spot markets and amplified by MARA’s ops edge: $0.04/kWh energy costs and superior fee per transaction capture, driving 12% outperformance in BTC-denominated revenue. Our valuation embeds a blended FY 2026E P/S of 10.5x, balancing against downside the visibility of its treasury assets and factoring in the concentrated potency of macro tailwinds: (i) a window to imminent Fed easing, (ii) record spot ETF inflows and (iii) the historic miner inflection 12–18 months post-halving. Regulatory overhang and bouts of network hash growth present headline risk to our thesis, but cost structures and balance sheet optionality leave more than enough margin for error. At 180% upside to our PT and trading up short of its historical median multiple, we see R/R as simply too skewed. Maximizing Miner Economics Marathon Digital Holdings exemplifies scale-driven cost leadership in BTC mining. Energized hash rate grew 95% y/y to 54.3 EH/s, capturing over 2x network share, driven by vertical integration and diversified energy inputs with 139 MW of self-generated wind, flare-gas, and data center power. Electric cost per BTC is now $35,728, and Marathon has delivered record 4 quarter-over-quarter hash-cost improvements. The blend of BtM wind and off-grid gas should lower all-in power costs to $10/MW for key ARPs, a breakpoint few peers can reach. This configuration supports an IRR of 30–40% under muted hash-price assumptions. As investors toggle between exahash headlines and transient efficiency gains, Marathon’s scale-plus-cost flywheel stands out as a sustainable platform—combining energized capacity, asset flexibility, power origination optionality, and proprietary ASIC integration—to preserve sector-leading share through mining-cycle volatility. Q1 Earnings Presentation Treasury Arbitrage Strategy embedded optionality. Fundamentally, we think the market has mispriced the strategic merit of MARA’s BTC on balance sheet, both in current balance sheet positioning and in embedded optionality. The 49,375 BTC on treasury ($5.42bn equivalent) offers investors direct participation in digital asset appreciation while buying an operating platform that can generate $852mn of annualized BTC back into the treasury at current network economics. Such a magnitude of treasury represents a uniquely powerful downside hedge versus global mining peers, allowing valuation capital preservation through deep crypto drawdowns and giving management optionality to monetize at cycle highs or deploy collateral opportunistically. Trading at $16.52, implied per-share BTC value stands at $15.41/share, providing the operating business just above $1/share after adjusting for net cash and PP&E. The disconnect continues to widen as MARA’s proven BTC accumulation cadence (950 BTC in a single month, or $104.5mn at $110,000 spot) captures robust upside and offers a meaningful premium to direct mining costs on the books. We believe consensus underappreciates the downside compounding and the asymmetry of MARA’s treasury, which ultimately provides shareholders a volatility buffer and an asymmetric payoff should direct adoption and institutional allocation run further. Case scenarios illustrate that the BTC is over-collateralizing the equity to such a degree that it meaningfully caps downside. We view MARA trading as a rare hybrid asset in which meaningful core value effectively underwrites investor participation in the next mining-led BTC upcycle. Q1 Earnings Presentation Materially Above-Consensus Revenue Outlook We model MARA’s FY 2025E and FY 2026E crypto revenues at $1.36bn (107% y/y) and $1.44bn, respectively, vs. the Street consensus of $948mn, placing us 43% and 32% above the Street based on structural tailwinds we believe the Street underappreciates: 1) Ambitious hash rate ramp to 60 EH/s as Ohio, TX wind and other flare-gas sites fully energize, positioning MARA for sustained 5% network share as difficulty resumes a persistent upward trend; 2) Explicit BTC pricing assumptions of $105k in FY 2025E and $130k in FY 2026E vs. consensus sub-$80k, already clearing $100k in the second quarter of 2025; 3) Proportional transaction-fee capture via MARA pool’s >10% outperformance vs. network average and 100% fee retention, translating to 12% higher BTC-denominated revenues. Source: FMP FY 2025 FY 2026 Estimate # Analysts Estimate # Analysts Revenue $948.02M 9 $1.09B 13 EBITDA $13.85M 9 $15.87M 13 Net Income $-656.60M 9 $-358.66M 13 EPS $-2.11 2 $-0.96 6 SG&A Expenses $535.42M 9 $613.52M 13 Most importantly, we annualize a first quarter 2025 run rate already partially baked in by the Street and layer on unfolding AI/2PIC monetization missing from the Street models. We acknowledge risk of sharp network hash rate acceleration beyond guidance or, less likely, regulatory change, but with visibility into energized capacity, a unique cost profile via $10/MWh ARP sites, and institutional BTC demand, we see the Street as significantly too conservative. Valuation Our $44 PT for MARA is based on a FY 2026E P/S multiple of 10.5x applied to our above-consensus revenue forecast of $1.44bn, yielding an implied 180% upside. The premium multiple is fully justified by outsized revenue growth acceleration powered by a ramped-up 60 EH/s hash-rate and a low $0.04/kWh power edge, plus Bitcoin treasury visibility that effectively limits downside. Company Data, FMP, Moretus Research Our 10.5x multiple aligns with the company’s historical median and stands to benefit from macro tailwinds of Federal Reserve easing and surging institutional ETF flows, which could prime post-halving multiple expansion. MARA trades at 7.7x P/S, below its historical norm (27th percentile) and below peer multiples (5.8x P/S; 17th percentile), despite margin resiliency and a market-leading +5.9% year-over-year revenue growth into FY 2026E. We believe Street assumptions on Bitcoin price and network share are overly conservative, and MARA warrants re-rating for its operational leverage. Risks to Our Strong Buy Thesis Our bullish thesis on Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) is supported by favorable capacity growth, low-cost operations, and a structurally higher post-halving Bitcoin price deck. Key risks include MARA’s operational and valuation leverage to Bitcoin’s price: a sustained pullback below $90,000 or an acceleration in network-wide difficulty could compress margins and force operational retrenchment, given energy costs could rise to $70K per Bitcoin if difficulty increases or electricity prices exceed model assumptions. Regulatory uncertainty poses another risk: state and federal energy restrictions, new environmental mandates, or regional off-grid mining clampdowns could raise compliance costs or force site curtailments, threatening hash-rate growth and undermining our above-consensus FY 2025E–FY 2026E estimates. Finally, MARA’s strategic use of ATM equity issuance could result in dilution and dampen our anticipated multiple re-rating if the Bitcoin market softens or policy risks intensify. Investors should monitor Bitcoin network hash-rate, MARA’s realized electricity costs, and state and federal regulatory developments as potential downside triggers. Conclusion We reiterate our Strong Buy on Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. based on MARA's peer-best operational leverage to BTC's next cycle and differentiated cost structure leading to best-in-class risk-adjusted return in the public minter space. Consensus fundamentally underestimates the scale of MARA's hash-rate ramp and true macro tailwinds (institution ETF flows and post-halving multiple expansion) offering a clear path for outsized revenue / multiple re-rating, in our view. Investors should look through the short-term FOMO cycle and simply focus on execution against energized capacity, accumulating now as multiples are structurally depressed despite structural catalysts remaining fully intact.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798897-marathon-digital-levered-to-post-halving-bitcoin-cycle?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|MINING","MARA",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T15:13:40,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Showing Signs Of Exhaustion After Failing To Clear Key Resistance Zone","Bitcoin (BTC) buyers are showing signs of exhaustion after failing to cross the resistance zone between $108,000 and $108,350. The flagship cryptocurrency risks dropping below $105,000 due to a developing bearish divergence, declining volumes, and repeated failures to push past resistance levels. BTC is up nearly 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $107,455. Senate Passes Big Beautiful Bill With No Exemption For Bitcoin The United States Senate passed President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill by a razor-thin margin after hours of heated negotiations. However, the bill brought little cheer to the crypto industry as it failed to include key crypto-related tax amendments that would have benefited the industry. Pro-crypto senators raced to include an amendment containing numerous tax benefits for crypto stakers and miners, retail digital asset users, and businesses holding crypto stockpiles. The over 1,000-page bill did not mention “digital assets,” “Bitcoin,” “Ethereum,” “crypto,” “web3,” or “blockchain” anywhere, despite efforts by pro-crypto senators to include tax breaks for the industry. Cynthia Lummis, vocal pro-crypto advocate, argued for changing the tax code for crypto mining and staking. Lummis argued that miners and stakers were being taxed twice, once when they received block rewards and again when selling their assets. “For years, miners and stakers have been taxed TWICE. Once when they receive block rewards, and again when they sell it. It’s time to stop this unfair tax treatment and ensure America is the world’s Bitcoin and Crypto Superpower.” Crypto Steady As Bitcoin (BTC) Drops To $105,000 The crypto market remained steady, registering only a marginal decline despite Bitcoin (BTC) dropping to a low of $105,328 on Tuesday. The crypto Fear & Greed Index registered a “Greed” score of 63 out of 100 on Wednesday, one point lower than Tuesday. Analysts speculate Bitcoin could retest its all-time high of $111,970, with optimism high on Monday when the price soared to an intraday high of $108,794 before losing momentum. The analysts also noted that Bitcoin is heading into its third quarter, typically a weak phase for the flagship cryptocurrency. Crypto trader Dann Crypto stated, “From the historical data, this quarter is generally the slowest out of all, for both $BTC and $ETH.” Bitcoin has averaged a gain of 5.47% during the third quarter each year since 2013. If the trend holds, it places BTC around $110,000 on Sept 30, just shy of its all-time high. According to Dann, weaker performances during the third quarter are likely due to slower summer months when volume and liquidity are generally lower. More Institutions Add Bitcoin (BTC) To Holdings Deutsche Bank is venturing deeper into the crypto space. The bank has partnered with Bitpanda and Taurus and plans to launch a full crypto custody service by 2026. The partnership will also focus on tokenized payments and a stablecoin. “NOW: Deutsche Bank to launch its #crypto custody service in 2026, marking a major leap into digital assets by one of Europe’s biggest banks.” Meanwhile, the Smarter Web Company, a UK-based web design and marketing firm, is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy. The firm announced the acquisition of 230.05 BTC , valued at $24.7 million. The company made the purchase at an average price of $107,126 per coin. The latest acquisition takes the company’s total Bitcoin stash to 773.58 BTC , disclosed in a Tuesday filing by the company. The firm has invested over $82 million in Bitcoin and possesses one of the biggest Bitcoin treasuries of a listed firm in the UK. Meanwhile, Belgravia Hartford Capital Inc. also completed its latest Bitcoin purchase as part of its long-term Bitcoin Treasury Reserve strategy. The firm acquired 9.35 BTC for $1 million, at an average price of $106,918 per coin. The latest purchase increases tits total holdings to 15.746 BTC . Genius Group Limited, a leading AI-powered, Bitcoin-first education group, also announced a Bitcoin purchase, increasing its holdings by 20% to 120 BTC . Genius Group is accelerating its Bitcoin acquisition strategy with more frequent purchases. The most recent purchase has doubled the size of its Bitcoin treasury since May 22, when a Preliminary Injunction preventing it from buying Bitcoin was stayed by the US Court of Appeals. Genius Group has reiterated its target of increasing its treasury to 1,000 BTC in the next six months. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a strong recovery during the ongoing session, bouncing from Tuesday’s low of $105,328. The flagship cryptocurrency ended the weekend positively, rising almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,360. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,167. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC slipped below $106,000 before rebounding to current levels. Price action remains sluggish, and analysts have pointed out that Bitcoin realized profits for long-term holders remain significantly lower. According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, BTC must reach $140,000 to give long-term holders profits comparable to 2024. The flagship cryptocurrency has registered a jump in profit-taking as it struggles to maintain its positive price action. According to CryptoQuant, long-term holders have contributed to a substantial chunk of the ongoing selling pressure. The platform compared current realized profits with earlier bull market peaks, finding out that long-term holders are not “as deep in the black” as before. According to CryptoQuant contributor Darkfrost, the average realized profit based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio currently sits at 220%. According to Darkfrost, the price at which long-term holders' unrealized profits will match 2024 levels acts as a market magnet. “Although these profits may seem substantial, we’re still far from the levels observed during the tops of this cycle. To return to those profit levels, BTC would need to reach $140,000. A price level that many are calling for.” The flagship cryptocurrency showed signs of exhaustion after crossing $108,000 on Monday and was rejected from the resistance zone. The resistance sits between $108,000 and $108,300, aligning with the upper level of the current trading range. BTC attempted to push higher, but remained pinned below this level. Analysts suggest the rally is losing momentum, with a bearish divergence forming. If sellers retain control, it could trigger a drop to $100,000. BTC registered a sharp decline over the previous weekend, dropping 1.17% on Saturday and settling at $102,180. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price plunged below $100,000, falling to a low of $98,385 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and settling at $100,985. Bullish sentiment returned on Monday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 0.66%, crossing the moving averages and $106,000 to settle at $106,137. BTC continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising 1.19% to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline to slip below $107,000 and settle at $106,980. Source: TradingView Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. BTC was back in the red on Monday as the week started on a bearish note, dropping 1.09% to $107,167. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 and settling at $105,742. BTC has recovered during the current session and is up over 2%, trading around $108,151.

2025-07-02T15:10:34,"Euro Forecast: Urgent Warning as UBS Predicts Significant Decline Against European Peers","BitcoinWorld Euro Forecast: Urgent Warning as UBS Predicts Significant Decline Against European Peers For those deeply entrenched in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, understanding broader macroeconomic shifts is paramount. Just as Bitcoin’s trajectory is often influenced by global liquidity and interest rate decisions, traditional forex markets offer crucial insights into the health of major economies. A recent declaration from financial giant UBS has sent ripples through the currency landscape, particularly concerning the Euro forecast . After a period of unexpected strength, the common currency is now poised to lose significant ground against its European counterparts. What does this mean for global financial stability, and how might these shifts indirectly impact the crypto ecosystem? What’s Driving the Euro Forecast Downward After Its Recent Ascent? The recent rally of the Euro caught many by surprise, fueled by a combination of factors including a hawkish tilt from the European Central Bank (ECB) and a mild winter that eased energy crisis fears. However, financial analysts at UBS are now sounding a cautionary note, suggesting that this strength is likely fleeting. The core of their Euro forecast hinges on fundamental economic divergences that persist within Europe. While the Eurozone might have dodged a deep recession, its recovery path remains significantly more challenging compared to some of its neighbors. Inflation, though cooling, is still stubbornly high, and the path to sustainable growth is fraught with obstacles. Which European Currencies Are Poised to Gain? A Look at the Landscape When UBS talks about the Euro losing ground against ‘European peers,’ it’s not just speculative talk; it points to specific European currencies that are demonstrating more robust economic fundamentals or more aggressive monetary policy stances. Currencies like the Swiss Franc (CHF), the British Pound (GBP), and potentially even some Nordic currencies such as the Swedish Krona (SEK) or Norwegian Krone (NOK) are on their radar. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been proactive in tackling inflation, maintaining a strong Franc. The UK, despite its own economic challenges, has seen the Bank of England (BoE) adopt a more consistently hawkish tone than the ECB, providing support for the Pound. These relative strengths create a compelling case for capital reallocation away from the Euro. Decoding Current Forex Market Trends and Investor Sentiment The broader forex market trends are often a reflection of global risk appetite and interest rate differentials. Currently, there’s a nuanced interplay of factors at play. On one hand, receding fears of a global recession have encouraged a ‘risk-on’ sentiment, benefiting some growth-sensitive currencies. On the other hand, central bank policy divergence remains a dominant theme. Investors are closely scrutinizing inflation data and employment figures from various regions, seeking clues about future rate hikes. When a major institution like UBS issues a negative outlook on a currency as significant as the Euro, it can trigger a shift in sentiment, leading to repositioning by large institutional players and hedge funds. This creates momentum for the predicted depreciation. Diving Deeper into the UBS Currency Outlook The detailed UBS currency outlook goes beyond simple predictions; it’s rooted in a comprehensive analysis of economic indicators, monetary policy expectations, and geopolitical risks. UBS highlights several key areas of concern for the Euro: Monetary Policy Divergence: While the ECB has tightened, other central banks, particularly the SNB and BoE, may continue with more aggressive or sustained tightening cycles, making their currencies more attractive for yield-seeking investors. Growth Disparities: The Eurozone’s structural challenges, including an aging population and dependence on energy imports, could limit its long-term growth potential compared to more agile economies. Geopolitical Risks: The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and its ripple effects on energy markets continue to pose a disproportionate risk to the Eurozone’s stability and economic recovery. Relative Valuations: After its recent rally, the Euro might be considered overvalued against some of its peers, making it ripe for a correction. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the Eurozone Economy? The health of the Eurozone economy is intrinsically linked to the Euro’s strength. Despite avoiding a technical recession, the region faces formidable headwinds. High energy prices, even if they’ve stabilized, continue to weigh on industrial output and consumer purchasing power. Core inflation remains sticky, indicating that price pressures are broad-based and not just due to energy. Furthermore, the fragmented nature of the Eurozone, with varying fiscal capacities and debt levels among member states, presents a persistent challenge. Any renewed sovereign debt concerns or political instability within a key member state could quickly erode confidence in the common currency. The ECB’s delicate balancing act between taming inflation and avoiding a severe economic downturn adds another layer of complexity to the Euro’s prospects. Challenges and Risks to the UBS Forecast: Can the Euro Defy Expectations? While UBS’s analysis is robust, no forecast is without its risks. Several factors could potentially alter the trajectory of the Euro: Stronger-than-Expected Eurozone Growth: A significant uptick in economic activity, perhaps driven by a faster-than-anticipated recovery in global trade or a breakthrough in energy independence. More Aggressive ECB Tightening: If the ECB surprises markets with more substantial or prolonged interest rate hikes than currently anticipated. Global Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of extreme global uncertainty, the Euro, alongside the US Dollar and Japanese Yen, can sometimes act as a safe-haven, attracting flows. Easing Geopolitical Tensions: A significant de-escalation in the Ukraine conflict could boost confidence in the Eurozone and its currency. Actionable Insights for Investors and Market Participants: Navigating Currency Shifts For investors, particularly those with exposure to global assets, understanding these currency dynamics is crucial. Diversification: Consider diversifying portfolios across various strong European currencies beyond just the Euro, such as CHF and GBP. Hedging Strategies: Businesses with significant Eurozone exposure or those trading across European borders might explore currency hedging strategies to mitigate potential losses from Euro depreciation. Monitor Central Bank Commentary: Keep a close eye on statements from the ECB, SNB, and BoE for shifts in monetary policy outlooks. Economic Data Releases: Pay attention to key economic indicators from the Eurozone and its peers, including inflation, GDP, and employment figures, as these will directly influence currency movements. For crypto investors, while direct correlation is limited, a weaker Euro could signify broader economic weakness in a major bloc, potentially impacting global liquidity or risk appetite, which can, in turn, influence the crypto market. Conclusion: The Shifting Sands of European Currency Dynamics UBS’s recent Euro forecast serves as a stark reminder that even after a period of apparent strength, underlying economic fundamentals and policy divergences ultimately dictate currency trajectories. The anticipated decline of the Euro against its European currencies peers reflects a nuanced view of the global financial landscape, shaped by evolving forex market trends , the specific UBS currency outlook , and the inherent challenges facing the Eurozone economy . While the future is never certain, the insights provided by major financial institutions like UBS offer a valuable compass for navigating the complex currents of international finance. Staying informed about these macro shifts is not just for traditional investors; it’s a critical component for anyone looking to understand the broader forces influencing asset classes, including the dynamic world of digital currencies.

2025-07-02T14:55:42,"XRP Dominance Surges: Can Ripple Outshine Ethereum?","For over a decade, Bitcoin has reigned supreme as the cryptocurrency king, its dominance the benchmark of the entire industry. But as the year 2025 unfolds, there is now a new entrant in the scene: XRP. The digital currency, previously associated with Ripple's cross-border payment schemes, is now observing its share of the entire crypto market capitalization—its ”dominance”—growing at a pace not seen since its peak year of 2017. This is fueling a new wave of discussion: Is XRP's dominance temporary, or does it signal a fundamental change in the crypto landscape? What Is XRP Dominance and Why Does It Matter? XRP dominance refers to the proportion of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization owned by XRP. Though this sounds like just another data point, it's actually a very telling metric of investor attitude, capital shifting, and even the health of the broader altcoin universe. As XRP dominance rises, more capital is flowing into XRP than into other assets—typically at the expense of Ethereum. This can mean anything from growing faith in the technology of Ripple to a wholesale appetite for altcoins. The recent surge in XRP dominance has not gone unnoticed. Cointelegraph and other publications have stated that abrupt changes in XRP's market dominance have happened simultaneously with high-level liquidations of Bitcoin and other altcoins, suggesting that capital is indeed rotating into XRP as investors seek new frontiers. The Drivers Behind XRP's Dominance Surge What's fueling this new energy, then? The answer lies in the convergence of regulatory clarity, real-world adoption, and shifting trader psychology. Ripple's partial victories in its prolonged court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have removed a cloud of uncertainty hanging over XRP for years. With the danger of being ruled a security receding, institutional and retail investors alike are once again flocking to the asset, encouraged by the potential for further regulatory wins. Meanwhile, Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) offering is taking hold. Remittance companies and banks in Asia, Europe, and the Americas are discovering increasingly sophisticated applications for XRP to move money across borders in seconds, rather than days. Each new partnership or corridor opening is a vote of confidence in XRP use—and a potential catalyst for further price appreciation and market share gain. Meanwhile, as volatility fades and Bitcoin price consolidates, yield-hungry investors are moving into altcoins, with XRP often leading the charge. This kind of ”altcoin season” has been a standard characteristic of crypto cycles, but the extent of XRP's present dominance wave is generating particular attention. How XRP Dominance Affects the Market As XRP's dominance increases, the shockwaves permeate the entire crypto landscape. Bitcoin, crypocurrency safe haven, is seeing its leveraged positions de-levered as speculators take the momentum pursuit in XRP. This has triggered a cascade of liquidations with some analysts noting that for every percentage point XRP rises, it moves billions of dollars around the market. Altcoins are not immune either. A rising tide of XRP has the tendency to buoy other large-cap tokens, leading speculation that an even greater altcoin season exists. But it can also mean that capital is moving toward fewer assets and making smaller tokens compete for attention. Crypto market sentiment is unreliable, and the narrative on XRP is shifting. What was once a ”dead coin” to some investors is now in fashion as a come-back story—proof that regulatory clarity and use case continue to be important in a market that at times is hype-driven. Analyst Views Cryptocurrency analysts are still divided regarding what the increased dominance of XRP means: Bullish View : Others believe that Ripple's increasing partnerships and regulatory clarity could cement XRP as an institutional core holding, driving sustained supremacy. Skeptical View : Others take the view that dominance spikes tend to be fleeting, driven by trend following sentiment and news cycles, and that Bitcoin's first-mover remains unchallenged. What Investors Need to Monitor Next? For those watching the charts, the next few months will be telling. Will XRP's supremacy continue its upward march, or will the market revert to normal? Investors must keep a close eye on trading volume and on-chain activity, hoping to catch a glimpse of proof that fresh capital is entering XRP for the long haul—not just getting a speculative jump. Regulatory progress is also a wild card. A grand slam by Ripple in the courts, or some surprise partnership with an overseas bank, could shoot dominance higher still. But any setback or negative headline can trigger a sudden reversal as investors rush to take profits. It's not hard to remember that cycles of crypto dominance are ludicrously unpredictable. What climbs can crash equally as quickly. Dominance highs, especially those driven by speculative demand, usually lead to sudden corrections. And even though there has been regulatory clarity for XRP, circumstances could shift in a single night with one announcement or enforcement action. A New Chapter or a Familiar Cycle? XRP's growing dominance in 2025 is more than a technical metric—it's a gauge of shifting market mood, shifting regulation, and the ever-present battle for crypto supremacy. Whether this marks the beginning of something new or just another installment in crypto's rollercoaster saga remains to be witnessed. For now, XRP is basking in the spotlight, and the globe waits to see whether Ripple's wave is indeed powerful enough to overshadow Bitcoin in the next few months.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9782/xrp-dominance-surges-can-ripple-outshine-etherreum,"XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|BTC","News|Ripple",cryptocompare

Unlike existing spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs, which fall under different regulatory frameworks, SSK is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. That means a qualified custodian — not the fund issuer — is required to hold the underlying assets. Anchorage Digital, currently the only federally regulated bank authorized to both custody and stake digital assets, will fill that role. “Staking is the next chapter in the crypto ETF story,"" said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital, in a release. ""The launch of crypto staking ETFs marks a win for consumers and a significant step forward in full access to the crypto ecosystem."" The ETF gives investors indirect exposure to Solana while also participating in the blockchain’s staking mechanism, which provides additional yield by helping to secure the network. Staking allows holders of certain cryptocurrencies to earn rewards by locking their tokens into the network, a process that previously required technical know-how and direct interaction with crypto protocols. By packaging staking into an ETF structure, REX Shares and Osprey aim to make that process accessible to a wider range of investors through traditional brokerage accounts. SOL is higher by 2% over the past 24 hours to $150. The SSK launch comes as the crypto ETF market continues to evolve beyond bitcoin and ether, with issuers exploring new ways to bring blockchain-based products to regulated exchanges. The introduction of staking ETFs marks a new phase for the industry, combining income-generating features with exposure to digital assets, all within an SEC-regulated investment vehicle.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/02/first-u-s-crypto-staking-etf-begins-trading-with-anchorage-as-staking-partner,"SOL|BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC|TRADING","Markets|Anchorage Digital|Solana|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T14:44:14,"5 Bitcoin-Native Infrastructure Companies Turning BTC Into a Financial Powerhouse","At this juncture, it’s impossible to deny Bitcoin’s status as one of the world’s premier financial assets. If the $2 trillion + market cap didn’t convince you, you need only look at the growing adoption among institutions and the conversations happening in the corridors of power. As nation states stockpile BTC, somewhere in the ether Satoshi is giving a wry smile. Despite Bitcoin’s stratospheric growth, and the preponderance of crypto infrastructure companies in existence, many such entities still straddle the line between fiat and crypto. Thus, while all of them profess to be “all-in” on BTC , precious few are. The following Bitcoin-native pioneers are the exception rather than the rule, the pioneers imagining a future in which digital gold is the DNA rather than a shiny add-on. Roxom Founded in 2019 by Borja Martel Seward and Nicholas Damico, Roxom is ripping up the rulebook of global finance as the world’s first BTC-denominated capital market. Based on the belief that truly sound money should define pricing, settlement, treasury, and revenue, Roxom uses BTC as its unit of account, meaning users get to trade things like stocks, bonds, derivatives, all denominated in Bitcoin and without interfacing with fiat at all. Set to launch within the next few months, Roxom isn’t layering crypto onto legacy finance; it’s building a BTC-native financial system from the ground up, an idea destined to appeal to crypto natives but also the growing audience compelled by the Bitcoin network and its digital gold narrative. Blockstream Led by Bitcoin OG and Hashcash creator Adam Back, Blockstream has, since 2014, been developing sophisticated tools for the blockchain’s ecosystem: the sort intended to make it stronger, faster, and more accessible. A multi-billion dollar company, its arsenal includes Liquid Network, a Bitcoin sidechain interoperable with the Lightning Network; Jade, a Bitcoin-focused self-custody wallet; and Core Lightning, an open-source implementation of Lightning. Last year, Blockstream raised $210 million to accelerate development of new Bitcoin-focused products for institutional, enterprise and consumer users. It’s also raised several billion to launch three investment funds, including two focused on crypto lending. Arch Labs Established in 2023 by Matt Mudano and Amine ElQaraoui, Arch Labs is on a mission to turn Bitcoin into Ethereum. Well, not quite: more accurately, it wants to emulate the Ethereum Virtual Machine by making Bitcoin’s base layer a hub for native applications and, in so doing, unleash Bitcoin’s untapped potential. The company’s version of the EVM, Arch Virtual Machine (ArchVM), is compatible with Bitcoin’s UTXO model, blazingly fast like Solana, and built in such a way that developers can deploy smart contracts directly on the Proof-of-Work chain. Valued at $200 million after a recent $13 million funding round, Arch has already attracted over 300,000 crypto wallets and a slew of decentralized apps. Canaan Over a decade deep in the game, Canaan was set up in 2013 by N.G. Zhang. Since its early days, the company has gradually established itself as a premier destination for Bitcoin mining hardware, specifically the high-performance ASIC chips needed to confirm blocks. Listed on Nasdaq since its 2019 IPO, Canaan expects to hit $1 billion in revenue this year, partly buoyed by sales of its new Avalon Q, a quiet SHA-256 ASIC miner designed to be used at home. It’s no stretch to say Canaan has played a major role in the Bitcoin revolution, indirectly strengthening the network by expanding mining capacity, and now, bringing it back to the masses. BitPay Founded in 2011 by Stephen Pair and Tony Gallippi, BitPay is one of the world’s best-known and most trusted crypto payment processors. Not only does it support BTC buying, selling and swapping, but it has its own self-custody wallet app and its HODL Pay feature lets users borrow stablecoins against crypto for real-world purchases like travel or luxury goods. E-commerce is a big part of BitPay’s business: the company integrates with over 250 merchants around the world, enabling them to accept BTC and other digital assets and thus avoid the cost of high fees/chargebacks associated with card payments. With offices across North America, South America and Europe, and having recently launched in the UK, BitPay shows no signs of slowing down.

2025-07-02T14:44:14,"Ether ETP interest remains high, attracting $2.9B in H1","Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded an inflow of $17.8 billion in the first half of the year. In its report, CoinShares revealed that this figure is down 2.7% from the $18.3 billion recorded during the same period last year. Bitcoin ETPs led the way The CoinShares report revealed that Bitcoin ETPs took the lion’s share, accounting for nearly 84% of the total crypto ETP inflow year-to-date. Bitcoin ETPs raked in $14.9 billion since the start of the year, with $2.2 billion recorded during the last week of June alone. Bitcoin’s dominance is not surprising as it remains the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, with retail and institutional investors interested in the coin and its products. Ether ETPs took the second place, outpacing other major cryptocurrencies. CoinShares added that multi-asset ETPs came in third, with Solana, Cardano, XRP, Chainlink, SUI, and Litecoin ETPs recording underwhelming figures. Crypto exchange-traded products posted $2.7 billion in inflows in the trading week ending Friday, June 27th, marking 11 consecutive weeks of inflows. Ether ETPs rake in $2.9 billion YTD, suggesting strong institutional interest While Bitcoin ETPs accounted for most of the crypto ETP inflow in H1, Ether ETPs recorded excellent inflow, indicating growing institutional demand for Ethereum-based products. The report revealed that Ether ETPs saw a $2.9 billion inflow in the first half of the year, with $429 million recorded during the last week of June. The excellent numbers mean that Ether ETPs accounted for 16.3% of the total cryptocurrency ETP inflow in the first half of 2025. Ether ETP inflow far outweighs that of other leading altcoins, including XRP ($219m), Solana ($91m), and Sui ($104m). According to Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of Falcon Finance, Ether ETP interest can be attributed to Ethereum’s robust infrastructure. Grachev added that, “The persistence of Ether inflows, especially through ETPs, shows investors are aligning with Ethereum’s role as programmable infrastructure. It is not just about price action—it is about the architecture behind stable assets, staking, and tokenized value flows.” Ether remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and currently trades around $2,450. The coin has lost roughly 25% of its value since the start of the year, thanks to the prolonged tariff war and last month’s conflict in the Middle East. The United States leads crypto ETP inflow The CoinShares report also provided some crucial data about the location of crypto ETP investors. The report revealed that most of the inflow recorded in H1 was almost solely from the US, seeing $16.8 billion. In second place is Germany, with $939 million, while Canada ($164 million), Australia ($148 million), and Brazil ($33 million) completed the top five. A few countries, including Sweden, Switzerland, and Hong Kong, recorded negative inflows during the first half of the year.

2025-07-02T14:32:09,"Dymension Is Preparing For Its Season 2 Airdrop & Beyond Upgrade","Moving away from the typical monolithic chains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the concept of modularity emerged. It separates the various functions of a blockchain into specialized platforms. With each specialized layer executing a specific function, blockchains are no longer limited by their architecture and could go beyond what was originally possible. What is Dymension? Dymension is a delegated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) L1 chain that secures modular blockchains within its system, known as RollApps. RollApps are blockchains built on top of Dymension, using their development kit – the RollApp Development Kit (RDK). We can use a familiar analogy and compare RollApps as the front-end of an application we may use, while Dymension is the server on which it runs, connecting it to other apps and supporting various backend functions. The development kit they use is quite similar to the one used on the Cosmos chain for rapid deployment of additional chains. Dymension went live in early February last year, launching their native token DYM. The total supply is set at 1 billion tokens, the market cap is just above the $70M mark, and the current circulating supply is at just below 320 million, as per the most recent data from CoinGecko. Details On The Airdrop & Upgrade The first airdrop they did, on Genesis day, distributed over $400 million in tokens to early adopters of the blockchain. Participation in this airdrop will be organized in “waves”, with the first opportunity for registration reserved for long-time community members who have been staking the DYM token for a prolonged period. The development team has stated that only a rudimentary version of the protocol was released on Genesis day; therefore, users can now expect numerous improvements with the upcoming Beyond upgrade. “Season 2 is designed to reintroduce the Dymension protocol and accelerate its growth as it evolves into a Universal Settlement Layer.” Perhaps the core focus of the upcoming upgrade will be the possibility of building rollups on top of existing L1 chains and ecosystems, without requiring modifications to the underlying core protocols. The network’s block time will also be reduced, from approximately 5 seconds to 1, which brings it in line with major players such as Solana.

2025-07-02T14:30:13,"Dogecoin Under $0.20 ‘Is Free,’ Says Analyst—Predicts 2,000% Upside","Dogecoin is revisiting a technical juncture it has not seen since the months preceding its 2020–21 parabolic rally, according to a comparative chart published by the pseudonymous analyst Kaleo to his 705,000 followers on X. In the annotated TradingView graphic, weekly candles for DOGE-USD trace two multi-year falling wedge structures—one stretching from the January 2018 high to early 2021, and an almost mirror-image pattern extending from the May 2021 peak until today. History Repeating For Dogecoin? The first wedge resolved in late 2020 with a decisive breakout above a descending trend-line that had capped every rally for more than thirty-six months. Kaleo marks that moment with a yellow label reading “We are here” at roughly $0.003, immediately before the price detonated to the cycle top near $0.75 in May 2021. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit The current structure shows the same downward-sloping resistance—now anchored by successive lower highs from $0.16 in late 2022 to $0.11 in late 2023—finally giving way. Since the, DOGE has recorded higher highs in April at $0.22 and in December 2024 at $0.48. Friday’s close printed at $0.1604, still below the psychological $0.20 threshold but fractionally above the dotted secondary resistance that has defined the wedge’s upper boundary since mid-2022. Kaleo’s overlay projects the 2020 breakout trajectory forward in time, mapping a near-vertical thrust from the present $0.16 area to roughly $0.55, a brief consolidation, and a continuation leg that tops close to $3.50. While this upper target hasn’t ever been printed in DOGE’s history, the analyst’s replica path underscores how little overhead structure exists once price escapes the wedge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Rare Buy Signal—But One Move Could Ruin It A key role in the chart are playing the two vertical dashed lines labeled “BTC Halving”: 12 May 2020 and 21 April 2024. In Kaleo’s read, Dogecoin’s macro reversals are synchronized with Bitcoin’s quadrennial supply shock, implying that the breakout could be a post-halving echo of the 2020 move. Price construction within the wedge also mirrors the earlier cycle: successive lower highs and higher lows compress volatility until an impulsive weekly bar pierces resistance. The horizontal line intersecting the new breakout—will be the first major test of post-wedge momentum. Below, the lower dashed boundary intersects in the region between $0.10 and $0.09; a weekly close beneath that floor would invalidate the fractal. Kaleo distills the setup into a single line: “Dogecoin under 20 cents is free.” On the chart’s scale, the red quote-box at $0.1604 sits a hair’s breadth under the $0.20 psychological band, reinforcing the idea that the risk-to-reward profile remains asymmetric so long as price stays below that number. Whether history rhymes as precisely as the analyst’s fractal suggests will hinge on broader market liquidity and Bitcoin’s dominance, but from a purely structural perspective the meme-coin has already checked the same boxes it did four years ago. And the US Federal Reserve money printer hasn’t even started roaring again. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.161.

2025-07-02T14:30:04,"Celsius Lawsuit: Judge Unleashes Crucial Legal Battle Against Tether Over $4 Billion Bitcoin Liquidation","BitcoinWorld Celsius Lawsuit: Judge Unleashes Crucial Legal Battle Against Tether Over $4 Billion Bitcoin Liquidation The cryptocurrency world is once again captivated by a high-stakes legal drama, as a U.S. bankruptcy judge has given the green light for bankrupt crypto lender Celsius to proceed with its lawsuit against Tether. This ruling marks a significant development in a case that could reshape how the crypto industry views asset management, liquidation practices, and contractual agreements. At the heart of this dispute are allegations of improper liquidation of a staggering 39,500 BTC, valued at approximately $4 billion, during Celsius’s tumultuous collapse in 2022. This isn’t just about money; it’s about setting precedents in a nascent yet rapidly maturing financial landscape. The Genesis of the Celsius Lawsuit : A Shocking Allegation The saga began when Celsius, once a prominent name in crypto lending, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022. This move sent shockwaves through the market, freezing billions in user funds and leaving countless investors in limbo. As part of its efforts to recover assets for creditors, Celsius’s legal team turned its attention to Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT. The core of the Celsius lawsuit revolves around claims that Tether engaged in questionable practices during a period of extreme market volatility, specifically concerning a substantial Bitcoin holding. Celsius alleges that Tether’s actions constituted a breach of contract and a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy law. The sheer scale of the alleged liquidation—39,500 BTC—highlights the immense financial implications of this case. For context, this amount of Bitcoin represents a significant portion of Celsius’s total assets at the time of its downfall, making its recovery crucial for creditors hoping to reclaim their funds. This legal action underscores the complex interdependencies within the crypto ecosystem and the often-unclear contractual frameworks that governed relationships between major players during the bull market. Unpacking the Controversial Tether Liquidation What exactly happened during the alleged Tether liquidation ? Celsius claims that Tether, acting as a counterparty, liquidated a substantial amount of Bitcoin collateral held by Celsius at unfavorable terms or in a manner that violated their existing agreements. While the exact details of the contract between Celsius and Tether remain under wraps, Celsius’s legal filings suggest that Tether’s actions were not in line with the agreed-upon terms, particularly concerning the timing and method of liquidation. This is not merely a dispute over price; it delves into the fundamental principles of contract law and the duty of parties to act in good faith, especially when dealing with distressed assets. The allegations of ‘fraudulent transfer’ are particularly severe. In bankruptcy law, a fraudulent transfer typically refers to a transfer of assets made by a debtor with the intent to defraud creditors or a transfer made for less than reasonable value while the debtor was insolvent. If proven, this would imply that Tether gained an unfair advantage at the expense of Celsius’s creditors. This claim suggests a deliberate action rather than simply a market-driven liquidation, elevating the stakes considerably for both parties involved. The court’s decision to allow these claims to proceed indicates that Celsius has presented a plausible argument that warrants further investigation. Navigating the Labyrinth of Crypto Bankruptcy The Celsius case is one of several high-profile examples of crypto bankruptcy that have emerged from the 2022 market downturn, alongside collapses like FTX and Three Arrows Capital. These cases have exposed significant vulnerabilities in the crypto industry, particularly regarding asset segregation, transparency, and consumer protection. Unlike traditional financial bankruptcies, crypto bankruptcies often involve novel legal questions concerning the nature of digital assets, the jurisdiction over decentralized entities, and the enforceability of smart contracts. For Celsius, the lawsuit against Tether is a critical component of its broader strategy to maximize asset recovery for its creditors. The success or failure of this claim could significantly impact the eventual payout for those who had funds locked on the platform. The challenges in navigating crypto bankruptcy are immense, ranging from identifying and tracing digital assets across various blockchains to dealing with international jurisdictions and the sheer complexity of crypto financial products. This lawsuit, therefore, is not just about Tether; it’s a test case for how courts will handle similar disputes in the future, providing much-needed clarity in a murky legal landscape. A Pivotal Bitcoin Legal Battle : What’s at Stake? This unfolding legal confrontation represents a pivotal Bitcoin legal battle , not just for the parties directly involved, but for the entire cryptocurrency industry. With $4 billion in Bitcoin on the line, the financial stakes are astronomical. For Tether, a loss could result in a significant financial penalty and, perhaps more damaging, a blow to its reputation as a reliable stablecoin issuer. The integrity and stability of stablecoins are paramount to the broader crypto market, and any perceived impropriety could erode investor trust. Beyond the immediate financial consequences, the outcome of this lawsuit could set a powerful precedent for how liquidations are conducted in the crypto space, particularly during periods of market stress. It could force crypto firms to adopt more transparent and clearly defined liquidation policies, ensuring fair treatment for all parties. Furthermore, it highlights the growing trend of legal and regulatory scrutiny on major crypto players, pushing the industry towards greater accountability and compliance. This battle underscores that even in the decentralized world, traditional legal principles will ultimately apply. The Authority of the US Bankruptcy Court A crucial aspect of this development is the ruling by the US bankruptcy court . Tether had filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing, among other things, a lack of U.S. jurisdiction and that Celsius’s claims were not legally sufficient. However, the judge rejected key parts of Tether’s motion, finding that there were sufficient U.S. ties to establish jurisdiction and that Celsius’s claims of breach of contract and fraudulent transfer were plausible enough to proceed to discovery and potentially trial. This decision is a testament to the increasing willingness of U.S. courts to assert jurisdiction over global crypto entities when there are clear connections to U.S. financial systems or investors. It signals that simply operating in a decentralized manner or from offshore locations does not automatically shield companies from U.S. legal oversight, especially when U.S. investors or bankruptcy proceedings are involved. The court’s ruling sends a clear message: allegations of significant financial misconduct in the crypto space will be thoroughly examined under existing legal frameworks. What Are the Core Claims Against Tether? Celsius’s lawsuit against Tether primarily rests on two key allegations: Breach of Contract: Celsius alleges that Tether violated the terms of their agreement concerning the management and liquidation of the Bitcoin collateral. This could involve issues related to notice periods, liquidation prices, or the process by which the assets were handled. Fraudulent Transfer: This is a more serious claim, suggesting that the transfer of Bitcoin from Celsius to Tether was made with an intent to defraud creditors or was conducted for less than fair market value at a time when Celsius was insolvent. If proven, this could lead to the recovery of the transferred assets for the benefit of Celsius’s creditors. Why Did Tether’s Dismissal Attempt Fail? Tether’s motion to dismiss was based on several arguments, including a lack of personal jurisdiction and the insufficiency of Celsius’s claims. However, the court found: Sufficient U.S. Ties: The judge determined that Tether had enough operational and financial connections to the U.S. to warrant jurisdiction, allowing the case to proceed in a U.S. court. Plausible Claims: The court concluded that Celsius had presented enough factual allegations to make its claims of breach of contract and fraudulent transfer plausible, meaning they weren’t frivolous and deserved to be litigated further. What Does This Mean for Celsius Creditors? For the thousands of Celsius creditors, this ruling offers a glimmer of hope. While it doesn’t guarantee a recovery, it opens a significant avenue for potentially increasing the pool of assets available for distribution. A successful outcome for Celsius in this lawsuit could add billions to the bankruptcy estate, significantly improving the prospects for creditors to recoup a larger portion of their lost funds. However, legal battles are often long and costly, and the road to resolution remains challenging. The Broader Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem This lawsuit is more than just a dispute between two companies; it has far-reaching implications for the entire crypto ecosystem: Increased Scrutiny: It highlights the growing regulatory and legal scrutiny on major crypto players, especially those involved in lending, stablecoins, and asset management. Importance of Clear Contracts: The case underscores the critical need for robust, legally sound, and transparent contractual agreements between crypto entities, particularly when dealing with large sums of collateral. Risk Management: It serves as a stark reminder for both institutional investors and individual users about the inherent risks in the crypto market, emphasizing the importance of due diligence and understanding the terms of service with any platform. Precedent Setting: The outcome could set a significant legal precedent for how future disputes involving crypto liquidations and alleged fraudulent transfers are handled in U.S. courts. The journey ahead for the Celsius lawsuit against Tether promises to be a captivating and complex one. As the legal proceedings unfold, the crypto community will be watching closely, understanding that the implications extend far beyond the immediate parties. This case is a critical step in defining the legal boundaries and responsibilities within the digital asset space, pushing for greater accountability and clarity in an industry that continues to evolve at breakneck speed. It’s a testament to the fact that even in the decentralized world, the rule of law ultimately prevails.

In early January, he appeared on the Bankless podcast to reaffirm his bullish stance, not just on Bitcoin, but also on a handful of other digital assets that he believes have long-term utility. Scaramucci’s crypto portfolio, based on his public commentary, is structured with 50% allocated to Bitcoin ( BTC ), while the remaining half is split evenly across Solana ( SOL ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), and Polkadot ( DOT ). Among these, Solana stood out as his top pick for a layer-one blockchain due to its low transaction costs and high throughput. How much Scaramucci’s crypto portfolio performed in H1 2025 To understand how his investment approach would have played out over the first half of 2025, we modeled a hypothetical $1,000 investment made on January 1, following his allocation strategy. At the time, Bitcoin was trading at $93,510, Solana at $189.45, Avalanche at $37.63, and Polkadot at $6.64. By mid-year, those same assets were trading at $108,400, $154.94, $17.97, and $3.40, respectively. Bitcoin, which made up the largest share of the portfolio, delivered a positive return of over 15%, helping to partially offset the steep declines elsewhere. Solana ended June down more than 21%, while Avalanche and Polkadot suffered even sharper declines, falling by around 50% each year-to-date. BTC H1 2025 price chart.

2025-07-02T14:18:26,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Price Predicted to Recover","The meme coin market often lags behind major price movements, but when it follows, the swings are typically explosive. Historically, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have acted as psychological triggers for speculative rallies. And with the latest round of pro-crypto sentiment coming out of key government bodies and institutional circles, the stage seems to be setting itself again. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both reclaimed lost ground with increasing conviction, and the overall mood in the market is shifting from risk-off to speculative readiness. As larger cap assets begin to regain dominance, the appetite for higher-risk plays like meme coins tends to follow swiftly. This is not merely about volatility returning, but about the crowd preparing to pour back into projects that once defined peak cycle enthusiasm. And when that happens, the biggest beneficiaries are often the coins with the most visible and loyal communities. Dogecoin and PEPE Show Signs of Life as Technicals Strengthen Dogecoin, long hailed as the face of meme coins, appears to be waking up after an extended drawdown. The chart setup is now flashing a textbook double bottom pattern at around $0.157, which seems to be supported by a significant uptick in volume. This pattern, which typically signals a shift from selling pressure to accumulation, has been reinforced by a recent bullish close above $0.16 . However, the bigger confirmation lies ahead. A decisive move past $0.17 would invalidate the lower highs pattern that has defined Dogecoin’s structure since May. #Dogecoin / $DOGE Dogecoin under 20 cents is free. pic.twitter.com/Rw0mFIPWdg — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) July 1, 2025 This target is now well within range, especially considering the renewed buyer activity and the wider market tailwind provided by Bitcoin’s recent recovery. Investors have shared their positive and bullish views of the same in the form of social media posts as well, highlighting the increasing interest surrounding DOGE. Meanwhile, PEPE is pressing up against the top of a falling wedge, a formation that often precedes strong breakouts. Price action is currently testing resistance at $0.00000987 . If this holds and bulls step in with volume, a rally toward $0.00001291 is not only likely, but structurally sound. On the downside, a drop toward $0.0000090 would still be within healthy consolidation range, as long as the $0.0000087 support remains intact. What’s notable is that dominance metrics for PEPE are beginning to fall, which often signals a transition phase before price discovery kicks in. With buyer interest brewing around key levels, both Dogecoin and PEPE are positioning themselves as front-runners for the next wave of meme-driven inflows. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Memecoins that Could Follow Suit Snorter As the meme market begins to show signs of life again, the appetite for tools that go beyond speculation is growing. Snorter is one such project that meets the moment with perfect timing. While it presents itself in the tone of a meme coin, its actual foundation is deeply utility-focused. Snorter is a Telegram-based AI bot that provides real-time trading tools, smart wallet analytics, and rapid token insight for users navigating early-stage opportunities. What makes it stand out is the blend of meme energy with real-world trading value. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on branding or social hype, Snorter integrates automated alerts, trending token trackers, and even early entry detection within its Telegram bot interface. This allows users to move faster and smarter within the very same platform where they already spend their time. Its native token plays a functional role, unlocking premium features and creating a feedback loop of utility and demand. At the time of writing, Snorter is one of the most popular presales, having been covered by top crypto content creators like Cilinix Crypto and many others already. As Dogecoin and PEPE prepare the ground for another memecoin surge, Snorter is positioned to capture the next wave of trader attention. It is not just riding the meme trend but enhancing it by giving degens actual tools to work with. In a space where humor meets chaos, Snorter delivers structure without losing edge. And in this market cycle, that mix of levity and precision could be exactly what traders seek when the speculative tide rises again. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is not exactly a meme coin, but its presence within this cycle aligns perfectly with where meme-driven sentiment often redirects: speed, simplicity, and low friction. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capitalize on cultural momentum, Bitcoin Hyper answers the core frustration of many who have held Bitcoin long-term but found its utility lacking. Built as a Layer 2 protocol on Bitcoin, Hyper introduces faster transaction capabilities, lower gas fees, and smart contract compatibility without disrupting the original Bitcoin network. This is not about competing with Ethereum or Solana but enhancing what Bitcoin already offers by adding scalability where it is most needed. The project has focused on bridging speculative interest with usable tech, making it a logical next step for retail participants seeking more dynamic environments during bull cycles. When meme coins rally, attention often turns toward projects that extend that momentum into infrastructure. Bitcoin Hyper gives users and developers a way to interact with Bitcoin in more agile, programmable ways. It opens the door to DeFi, NFT deployment, and microtransactions on Bitcoin rails. And in a climate where even casual traders are starting to explore functionality beyond mere buying and holding, Bitcoin Hyper could emerge as the destination for that leap. Its relevance grows as retail interest resurges. If the rally ignited by Dogecoin spills over, Bitcoin Hyper is one of the few non-meme projects that could benefit just as much, thanks to its timing and technical proposition. BTC Bull BTC Bull exists for a very specific purpose: to amplify the upside potential of Bitcoin’s market cycles through a leveraged and milestone-triggered system. While Dogecoin and PEPE capture the attention of meme enthusiasts, BTC Bull taps directly into the core belief that Bitcoin remains the anchor of crypto valuation. What this project does is create structured reward tiers and performance multipliers tied to Bitcoin’s price milestones, offering holders an ecosystem where belief in BTC translates into compounded gains. BTC Bull’s smart contract design includes automatic triggers based on BTC price thresholds. As Bitcoin climbs and hits certain levels, new reward phases activate, distributing benefits to token holders and incentivizing long-term positioning. This is not a derivative or a futures market workaround. It is a native crypto token that mirrors the journey of Bitcoin but adds more velocity when BTC performs. Waiting for $150K BTC. bulls eatin. airdrops flyin. 💸🐂 pic.twitter.com/5b0v3hQBiU — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) July 1, 2025 In a market where memecoins start the fire, BTC Bull is engineered to ride the flames all the way up the slope. Its utility is psychological and financial. It taps into the momentum mindset that often fuels meme rallies but grounds it with a framework tied directly to Bitcoin’s market behavior. If this bull cycle strengthens further and Bitcoin breaks new territory, BTC Bull is uniquely structured to reward conviction and not just hype. That makes it a standout candidate in any meme-fueled environment where investors are looking to do more than simply cheer from the sidelines. Token 6900 At a time when meme coin enthusiasm is beginning to re-emerge, the Token 6900 project leans unapologetically into chaos, irony, and nostalgia. Its visual identity is a deliberate mess; full with glitch effects, pixelated JPEGs, and crude layout choices that feel ripped straight from the early days of the internet. But beneath the absurdity lies a surprisingly effective formula: create noise, invite curiosity, and reward the bold. What separates Token 6900 from the rest is how it plays with expectations. It does not hide its intention to be ridiculous. In fact, that’s its selling point. But behind the satire is a cleverly timed launch designed to capitalize on the very conditions that birthed previous meme booms. Much like the SPX 6900 meme that became a cultural touchstone, this token captures the same unhinged energy with a new face and bolder intent. The presale has already begun attracting interest from seasoned degens and speculative retail participants alike. It is not structured around complex tokenomics or grand visions of utility. Instead, Token 6900 sells a feeling, which is nostalgia of the last cycle, anticipation for the next, and the thrill of being early to something unserious that just might become very real. In a cycle where meme relevance can flip overnight into market dominance, Token 6900 does not try to justify itself. It simply invites you to stop taking things seriously and start paying attention. Conclusion The projects outlined above represent a diverse set of opportunities that combine cultural traction, real-world application, and technical relevance. Each one is positioned to benefit from the current shift in market psychology. Whether the focus is infrastructure, meme-driven energy, or strategic alignment with larger trends, these assets offer more than hype by offering entry points into narratives that are only just beginning to build.

2025-07-02T14:10:58,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Unlocks $24.75 Million for Green Minerals’ Ambitious Growth","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Unlocks $24.75 Million for Green Minerals’ Ambitious Growth In a move that’s turning heads across both the traditional finance and cryptocurrency worlds, Norwegian deep-sea mining firm Green Minerals has announced a significant financial boost. The company recently secured a structured financing agreement worth 250 million NOK, equivalent to an impressive $24.75 million, from the global investment powerhouse LDA Capital. This substantial capital injection isn’t just for general operations; it’s specifically earmarked to fuel and expand Green Minerals’ pioneering Bitcoin Treasury Strategy . This development signals a fascinating convergence of resource extraction and digital asset management, prompting questions about the future of corporate finance. Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Why Are Companies Embracing Digital Gold? The concept of a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin as a significant portion of its corporate reserves, rather than solely relying on traditional fiat currencies or conventional investments. This approach has gained traction among forward-thinking businesses looking to hedge against inflation, seek growth opportunities, and diversify their balance sheets in an increasingly uncertain economic landscape. For a company like Green Minerals, known for its long-term, capital-intensive projects, integrating Bitcoin into its treasury offers several potential advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it attractive as a store of value, potentially preserving purchasing power better than depreciating fiat currencies. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth, offering the potential for substantial capital appreciation. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Adopting a Bitcoin strategy can signal a company’s embrace of innovation and readiness for the digital future, attracting a new generation of investors and talent. Green Minerals’ decision to deepen its commitment to this strategy suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role in modern corporate finance. It’s a bold step that places them among a growing number of public and private companies exploring the benefits of digital assets. Green Minerals: Deep-Sea Mining Meets Digital Innovation – What’s the Connection? At its core, Green Minerals is a Norwegian firm focused on deep-sea mining, an emerging industry dedicated to extracting valuable minerals from the ocean floor. These minerals, such as manganese, cobalt, copper, and nickel, are crucial for the green energy transition, used in everything from electric vehicle batteries to renewable energy infrastructure. The company aims to provide a sustainable and ethical source for these critical raw materials. So, how does a deep-sea mining operation connect with a Cryptocurrency Investment strategy? The link lies in strategic long-term planning and capital management. Deep-sea mining projects require substantial upfront capital and have long development cycles. By allocating a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin, Green Minerals aims to: Optimize Capital Allocation: Potentially grow its reserves faster than traditional low-yield investments, providing more capital for future operations and expansion. Attract Modern Investors: Appeal to a broader range of investors, including those interested in both sustainable resource development and the digital economy. Future-Proofing: Position the company to benefit from the ongoing global shift towards digital finance and decentralized assets. This dual focus on critical minerals for a green future and cutting-edge financial strategy showcases Green Minerals’ unique vision in the market. LDA Capital’s Vote of Confidence: Why This Investment Matters for Cryptocurrency Investment? The $24.75 million financing from LDA Capital is not just a routine capital injection; it’s a significant endorsement of Green Minerals’ overall business model, including its innovative approach to corporate treasury management. LDA Capital is a global alternative investment group with expertise in cross-border transactions and providing growth capital to publicly listed and private companies worldwide. Their investment typically signifies a thorough due diligence process and a belief in the long-term potential of the recipient company. For the broader cryptocurrency space, LDA Capital’s backing of a company with an explicit Cryptocurrency Investment strategy sends a powerful message. It indicates that: Institutional Acceptance is Growing: Major investment groups are increasingly comfortable with and even actively supporting companies that integrate digital assets into their core financial strategies. Validation of Treasury Strategies: It validates the idea that holding Bitcoin can be a legitimate and beneficial part of a corporate treasury, moving beyond speculative trading. Bridge Between Traditional and Digital Finance: This deal exemplifies how traditional financial institutions are finding pathways to engage with and support the burgeoning digital asset economy, even through indirect means. This partnership could serve as a blueprint for other companies considering similar treasury strategies, demonstrating that significant institutional backing is attainable. The Global Trend: More Than Just Green Minerals and Deep-Sea Mining? While Green Minerals is making headlines with its unique blend of Deep-Sea Mining and digital asset strategy, they are part of a larger, evolving trend. Companies across various sectors are increasingly exploring or implementing Bitcoin treasury strategies. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, accumulating billions of dollars worth of BTC. Tesla also made a significant, albeit fluctuating, foray into holding Bitcoin. This trend is driven by several factors: Macroeconomic Climate: Persistent inflation concerns and low-yield traditional investments make alternative assets more appealing. Technological Advancement: Easier access to secure custody solutions and financial infrastructure for managing digital assets. Growing Legitimacy: Increasing regulatory clarity and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. However, it’s not without its challenges. The volatility of Bitcoin remains a primary concern, as does the evolving regulatory landscape. Companies must carefully weigh the potential benefits against the inherent risks, conducting thorough risk assessments and developing robust internal policies. Navigating the Depths: Challenges and Strategic Considerations Despite the optimism surrounding Green Minerals’ financing and its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy , both deep-sea mining and cryptocurrency investment present unique challenges that the company will need to navigate. For deep-sea mining, environmental concerns and complex international regulations are paramount. Critics raise valid questions about the ecological impact on fragile marine ecosystems, demanding rigorous environmental impact assessments and sustainable practices. Regarding its Bitcoin holdings, Green Minerals must contend with: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the reported value of the company’s treasury. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing, which could affect how digital assets are treated for accounting, taxation, and legal purposes. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure storage of significant Bitcoin holdings requires sophisticated cybersecurity measures and robust internal controls. Green Minerals’ ability to successfully manage these dual complexities – the environmental and regulatory challenges of deep-sea mining alongside the financial and security risks of cryptocurrency – will be crucial to its long-term success. Their strategic partnership with LDA Capital suggests they have a well-thought-out plan to tackle these hurdles. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Finance and Sustainable Industries? The financing secured by Green Minerals marks a pivotal moment, not just for the company itself, but for the broader intersection of traditional industries and digital finance. It underscores a growing confidence among institutional investors in companies that are not afraid to innovate beyond conventional boundaries. For Green Minerals, this capital infusion will undoubtedly accelerate its deep-sea mining operations, potentially bringing vital minerals to market faster and supporting the global green transition. More broadly, this deal could inspire other companies, especially those in capital-intensive sectors, to reconsider their treasury strategies. It highlights the potential for Bitcoin to serve as a strategic asset, not merely a speculative one. As the world moves towards a more digital and sustainable future, the ability to creatively leverage diverse financial instruments, including cryptocurrencies, will become increasingly important for corporate resilience and growth. The journey of Green Minerals will be a fascinating case study to watch, demonstrating how an enterprise at the forefront of resource extraction is simultaneously embracing the cutting edge of financial innovation. Their success could pave the way for a new era of corporate treasury management, where digital assets play a central role in long-term strategic planning.

According to CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently trading above $107,400, reflecting a 0.8% daily gain. Despite the short pullback, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index posted a “Greed” score of 63 out of 100, only slightly lower than Tuesday’s reading, indicating that market participants continue to display optimism, even as Bitcoin navigates a period that has historically seen muted performance. Heading Into a Historically Weak Quarter Analysts are closely watching to see when Bitcoin might retest its all-time high of $111,970 , achieved on May 22. Optimism was high earlier this week as BTC traded near $109,000, but the momentum slowed as the third quarter began on July 1. Crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades noted on Tuesday that the third quarter is typically the weakest for BTC and ETH due to slower summer months characterized by reduced trading volumes and liquidity. Historical data from CoinGlass shows that BTC has averaged a 5.47% gain in the third quarter since 2013. If this trend holds, Bitcoin could approach $111,000 by the end of September, just below its all-time high. Indicators Signal Continued Bitcoin Dominance BTC’s second-quarter performance closely aligned with historical trends, delivering a 31% gain to end June at $108,383, outperforming its 27% average Q2 return since 2014. June also closed with Bitcoin’s highest monthly candle, reinforcing bullish sentiment in the market. Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market remains strong, sitting at around 65.5% and marking an increase of nearly 13% this year, according to TradingView data. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index by CoinMarketCap currently sits at a “Bitcoin Season” score of 20 out of 100, indicating that altcoins continue to underperform relative to BTC over the past 90 days. However, caution lingers. CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, noted that their Bitcoin Bull Score Metric has dropped into neutral territory, currently reading 50 out of 100. “Bitcoin Bull Score is in NEUTRAL territory now—50. Needs to be 60 or above for prices to sustain a rally,” Moreno stated , suggesting that while the market remains optimistic, further momentum is needed to break higher in the coming weeks.

2025-07-02T14:00:03,"Big News for XRP Holders","In a defining moment for crypto adoption, XRP is now officially accessible to everyday investors through a regulated U.S. investment vehicle. On July 1, 2025, the SEC approved the conversion of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), opening the door for broad retail access to XRP, alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. The news, highlighted by Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store was hailed as a “full circle moment.” After nearly five years of SEC litigation against Ripple, XRP’s inclusion in a regulated ETF signals a turning point in its journey toward institutional legitimacy. From Courtroom to Trading Floor Since the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple Labs in December 2020, XRP has faced legal and regulatory hurdles that limited its availability on major U.S. platforms. The litigation cast a long shadow over the token’s reputation and accessibility. But with this ETF approval, XRP is entering a new era, reclaiming its seat at the table of mainstream finance. Biggest news from today IMO… xrp will now be accessible to everyday investors via Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF. After nearly 5yrs of SEC vs Ripple litigation. And now anyone will be able to easily access xrp in SEC-regulated investment vehicle. Full circle moment. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 2, 2025 Now, investors no longer need to navigate crypto exchanges or self-custody wallets to gain exposure to XRP. Instead, they can simply buy shares of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF on NYSE Arca, just like they would any traditional stock or fund. What the ETF Includes Grayscale’s ETF will track a diversified portfolio of top cryptocurrencies. According to the latest composition, approximately 80% of the fund is allocated to Bitcoin, 11% to Ethereum, and about 4.8% to XRP alongside smaller portions of Solana and Cardano. For XRP, even a modest share in a regulated ETF marks a huge leap forward, given its previously restricted status during the SEC case. The approval also affirms the SEC’s growing willingness to allow exposure to cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum, especially through multi-asset structures. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Strategic Win for XRP and the Market Nate Geraci underscored the importance of this development, noting that for the first time, U.S. investors can now access XRP through a fully regulated, SEC-approved product. This provides exposure without the complexities of navigating crypto-specific infrastructure, while also offering tax advantages and simplified portfolio integration. The ETF structure also adds an important layer of legitimacy to XRP. Its presence in a vetted investment product sends a strong message to the broader financial market: XRP has passed a major regulatory test, and institutional doors are opening. Looking Ahead This approval may pave the way for more focused XRP-based investment products in the future. As market demand grows, standalone XRP ETFs could emerge , much like what happened with Bitcoin. Additionally, this move may accelerate similar approvals for other altcoins, especially under a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. For long-time XRP holders, this milestone represents more than convenience, it’s vindication. After enduring years of uncertainty, the token now stands proudly alongside the industry’s biggest assets in a fund built for traditional investors. As Geraci aptly put it: “After nearly five years of SEC vs Ripple litigation… full circle moment.” XRP has arrived.

2025-07-02T13:59:17,"Is Bitcoin (BTC) Ready to Break Out of Its Bull Flag Pattern?","The expected $BTC bounce has materialised and the current price is back above $107,000. However, will Bitcoin bulls have enough in the tank to exit from the top of the bull flag and power higher into price discovery? Last tussle between bulls and bears The market awaits, while the bulls and the bears wrestle for dominance. On the side of the bulls is the strong Bitcoin treasuries/ETFs buying pressure, and a very positive chart setup. In favour of the bears is the constant profit-taking of the long-term holders and the OGs who are selling into such strength in order to take some lifestyle chips off of the table. With low volume being traded on exchanges , given that most $BTC is being sourced over the counter (OTC), this kind of environment is ideal for the major exchanges and market makers to manipulate price. Therefore, it just might be that a potential breakout could be when these big players are good and ready for it. $BTC bounces from strong support Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows how the price bounced pretty much as expected from one of the strong support levels. This happened to be at $105,400. So far on Wednesday, the price has reached $107,500, which is a notable level of resistance. It might be expected that the bulls eventually push on through this level and come up against the upper trendline of the bull flag. A breakout and consolidation above could then ensue. If the bears are to spoil the party, they would possibly look to hold the price at the bull flag trendline, or the resistance at $109,000, before forcing the price back down. That said, once a potential breakout has been achieved, coming back to test the trendline before moving higher would be the more likely outcome. Bullish engulfing candle on daily Source: TradingView On the daily time frame things are looking positive. The price is back above the 50-day SMA (blue line), and the current candle is already engulfing Tuesday’s red candle. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index shows that the indicator line has bounced off of the yellow moving average at the 50.00 level. $105,600 support has become important level Source: TradingView The weekly chart reveals how the support at $105,600 is becoming an important level, with at least 5 good touches of this line. If the $BTC price can break out on Wednesday, or perhaps later in the week, the Stochastic RSI indicators at the bottom of the chart are likely to angle up and a bullish cross-up would lend fuel to the breakout.
