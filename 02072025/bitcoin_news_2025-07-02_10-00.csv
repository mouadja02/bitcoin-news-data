2025-07-02T07:47:49,"Bitcoin Slips to $106K Amid Market Caution, Powell Offers No Timeline on Rate Cut","Bitcoin has witnessed a dip below the support area on Wednesday, resulting in the expected quick decline. The descending triangle comes amid Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell having a long-term hold on his “wait and see” approach to Fed interest rate cuts. Similar to the stock market, Bitcoin’s price have become increasingly tied to interest rates and other macroeconomic indicators recently. As a result, escalating tensions between Powell and President Trump have caused BTC and other tokens to slump. The world’s largest crypto dropped below $106,000 on Wednesday, extending its decline by 2.47% over the last two days. Last week, Bitcoin rose sharply by 7.32%, closing above $108,000. However, since Monday, Bitcoin has continued its decline after facing a correction, closing below $106,000. At the time of writing, the token hovered around $106,998. “Rate cut expectations, political tensions, and a declining apparent demand signal some short-term caution,” James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet, told Cryptonews. However, he is optimistic that despite the scenario, markets would experience momentum into Q3. Crypto Markets Dip Following Powell Comments Fed Chair Powell on Tuesday commented on the President’s aggressive lobbying to cut interest rates. Trump has been putting pressure to follow central banks worldwide that have acted faster. During the European Central Bank’s annual conference in Portugal, Powell said that the decision depends on “how the data evolves.” However, he did not hint at the timing of rate cuts. Trump and Powell have been playing a blame game recently over the Fed rate cuts. The President had sent a handwritten note to Powell on Monday, accusing the Fed Chair “for allowing this to happen to the United States.” “If they were doing their job properly, our Country would be saving Trillions of Dollars in Interest Cost,” Trump’s note read. Besides, the President has encouraged Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May. “No inflation, our country’s strong, our interest rates should be 3 points lower…you’ve got a moron at the head of the Fed. He’s a moron!” – @POTUS blasts Jerome Powell as he speaks to the press on Air Force One! pic.twitter.com/wPURpZBdNj — Real America's Voice (RAV) (@RealAmVoice) July 1, 2025 When asked about President Trump’s pressure on Tuesday, Powell said that he is very focused on just doing his job. Further, interest rates would have lowered by now if not for the president’s tariff agenda, Powell added. Following Powell’s comment, Bitcoin saw a 1.3% slump, trading at $105,859 on Tuesday. “President Trump is yet again voicing his intent to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and this, more than any other macroeconomic factor, has the ability to cause more short-term financial havoc,” Toledano told Cryptonews. However, he added that these provoke short‑term moves, while long‑term direction is driven by fundamentals. “Bitcoin is only going one way as far as the arc of history is concerned.” The post Bitcoin Slips to $106K Amid Market Caution, Powell Offers No Timeline on Rate Cut appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-dips-to-106k-after-fed-powell-remain-mute-on-rate-cuts/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|FIAT","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Donald Trump|fed rate cut",cryptocompare

Crypto ownership in the US has nearly doubled since 2021, rising from 15% to 28%. 14% of non-owners plan to buy crypto in 2025, and 67% of current owners plan to buy more this year. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are the top three cryptocurrencies Americans plan to purchase in 2025. Crypto mining in the USA In 2025, the US leads the world in Bitcoin mining , accounting for over one-third of global mining power. On March 20, 2025, the SEC clarified that proof-of-work crypto mining is not subject to federal securities laws, removing registration requirements for miners. There is no federal ban on crypto mining; regulation is handled at the state level, with some states offering incentives and others imposing environmental restrictions. The Trump administration’s deregulatory approach in 2025 has encouraged domestic mining growth, but all miners must still comply with federal AML and CFT rules. Environmental concerns and energy usage debates continue, especially in states considering stricter oversight or moratoriums on mining operations. US Government’s Crypto Holdings As of April 2025, the US government holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoins, valued at about $18.3 billion. The US is the world’s largest state holder of Bitcoin, with these assets primarily acquired through law enforcement seizures and forfeitures. In March 2025, President Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile, consolidating all federally held Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies (including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP) as permanent reserve assets. Conclusion US crypto regulation in 2025 marks a major turning point. The old approach of punishing innovation is being replaced with clear rules, legal support, and a national strategy for digital assets. While financial crimes are still a concern, the overall direction is bold, business-friendly, and built for long-term crypto adoption.

Analysts predict a gradual price increase, with potential highs reaching $175 by 2030. Bitcoin SV price (BSV) has been on muted growth trajectory compared to other altcoins. Since the beginning of the year, signaling prolonged bearish sentiment, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has consistently traded below its 200-day EMA band. Despite attempts to gain traction, the asset has failed to show any long-term bullish reversal, raising doubts among investors and traders about its recovery potential. Even it’s a non-profit organization, BSV association, optimistic activities like successful collaboration and hackathon events are not manifesting on the BSV price chart Many ask: “Can BSV Price break bearish trend above 200-day EMA?, “Is BSV a hidden gem waiting for its breakout, or just another risky bet?”. In this Bitcoin SV price prediction 2025 article, we’ll explore the future for BSV Price from 2025 through 2030.

With an average of $86, the BSV token price can hit a high of $117 and a low of $55. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 Bitcoin SV Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Bitcoin SV (BSV) faced challenges as it fell back to April’s lows. Despite previous attempts to rise, the price action remained muted due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and market conditions. But, at the current level, odds are higher that if BSV bulls regain strength, there is potential for a rally; in the short term, it might retest the $35 mark. Conversely, if the downward trend continues, BSV’s price may drop to new lows like $20 round level. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) BSV Coin Price Prediction July 2025 20 27.5 35 Bitcoin SV Price Prediction 2025 In the second half of 2024, Bitcoin SV (BSV) formed an ascending broadening wedge pattern. This led to a strong buying movement in Q4 2024, pushing prices from the wedge’s lower to upper border. Many experts believed this bullish momentum could continue, but the upper border coincided with a strong resistance zone. Consequently, BSV’s price trajectory fell in the first half of 2025, erasing over 60% of its gains. Despite seen attempts to rise in Q2 2025, BSV struggled to gain bullish strength. It ended up forming another declining wedge. Investors had hoped BSV would reach $50 but it fell short, dampening morale. The last significant momentum was in Q4 2024, which is now missed by BSV holders. In April, BSV peaked at $47 but faced rejection at resistance and began forming lower lows. A recent bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMA indicates increasing short-term bearish pressure. Several optimistic factors emerged in Q2 2025, yet price action remained muted. The worsening conflict between Iran and Israel, along with U.S. intervention in June, created further pessimism. Even a ceasefire announced in late June failed to boost BSV’s price. As July began, BSV fell back to April’s lows. However, if BSV bulls regain strength, a rally could occur. A decisive move above the 200-day EMA could provide the momentum needed to retest the $50 mark by the end of June. If this breakout is supported by increased adoption, BSV could target $65 by the end of 2025. Conversely, if BSV continues to decline within the downward wedge, its price may drop toward $24. Nevertheless, a breakout from this pattern and a move above the 200-day EMA or the $40 level could shift the trend to bullish.

2025-07-02T07:30:01,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Satsuma Technology’s Bold Move Towards Digital Asset Dominance","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Satsuma Technology’s Bold Move Towards Digital Asset Dominance In a significant development echoing across the financial and technology sectors, AI-focused software development company Tao Alpha has announced a strategic rebrand to Satsuma Technology . This isn’t just a name change; it’s a profound shift that solidifies their commitment to a robust Bitcoin treasury strategy , setting a new precedent for corporate digital asset allocation. This move highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. What’s Behind the Tao Alpha Rebrand to Satsuma Technology? The transition from Tao Alpha to Satsuma Technology signifies more than just a fresh corporate identity. It reflects a strategic realignment with their core vision and an emphatic embrace of the evolving digital economy. Announced via a statement on Vox Markets, this rebrand positions the company at the intersection of cutting-edge AI development and astute financial management. The original name, “Tao Alpha,” hinted at a philosophical approach to achieving superior returns (“alpha”). The new name, “Satsuma Technology,” evokes a sense of precision, innovation, and perhaps even a subtle nod to the digital “satoshi” unit of Bitcoin, reinforcing their commitment to digital assets. This rebranding is a clear signal to investors and the market that the company is doubling down on its strategic direction, with a focus on both technological advancement and astute financial stewardship. This evolution is key to understanding their broader digital asset allocation framework. Unpacking Satsuma Technology’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The most compelling aspect of Satsuma Technology’s announcement is their reinforced Bitcoin treasury strategy . The company had previously signaled its intent to allocate a substantial portion—up to two-thirds—of its cash reserves to Bitcoin and stablecoins. This latest statement confirms a deepening of that commitment, moving beyond mere exploration to active implementation. Why Bitcoin? For many corporations, holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset offers several potential advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against fiat currency devaluation, preserving purchasing power over time. Growth Potential: Despite its inherent volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, offering a potential appreciation for corporate reserves. Balance Sheet Optimization: For companies with excess cash, Bitcoin can offer a yield-generating or appreciation-focused alternative to traditional low-interest bank accounts, improving overall financial health. Innovation Alignment: Embracing Bitcoin strategically aligns a technology company with the broader trends of decentralization and digital innovation, enhancing its market position. Satsuma Technology’s decision to allocate a significant portion of its reserves, including stablecoins, indicates a balanced approach – leveraging Bitcoin for potential upside while using stablecoins for liquidity and stability within the digital asset ecosystem. This prudent approach to digital asset allocation aims to mitigate risks while maximizing opportunities. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Satsuma Technology is not an isolated case; their move is part of a larger, accelerating trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption . Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square (now Block) have famously integrated Bitcoin into their balance sheets, paving the way for others to follow suit. This trend is driven by several factors: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Persistent inflation fears, rising interest rates, and geopolitical instability push companies to seek alternative store-of-value assets beyond traditional fiat currencies. Institutional Infrastructure Maturation: The development of robust crypto custodians, regulated exchanges, and sophisticated financial products makes it safer and more feasible for corporations to acquire and hold digital assets. Competitive Advantage: Early adopters gain invaluable experience and potentially a first-mover advantage in navigating the rapidly evolving digital economy, setting them apart from competitors. For an AI software company , this adoption also sends a strong message: they are not just building the future of technology, but also actively participating in the future of finance. It positions them as forward-thinking, adaptable, and innovative. Implications for an AI Company Rebrand and Future Growth The combination of an AI company rebrand and a strong Bitcoin treasury strategy creates a powerful narrative for Satsuma Technology. It suggests a company that is not afraid to innovate on all fronts – from its core technology offerings to its financial management practices. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Brand Image: Positions Satsuma Technology as a leader in both cutting-edge AI development and forward-thinking digital asset integration, appealing to a broader market. Increased Investor Appeal: May attract a new class of investors specifically interested in companies with strategic exposure to the burgeoning crypto market and its growth potential. Strategic Flexibility: A robust digital asset treasury provides potential for future crypto-native initiatives, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations, Web3 projects, or even blockchain-based AI applications. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s inherent price fluctuations can introduce volatility to the company’s financial statements, requiring careful risk management. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving and often fragmented regulatory landscape for digital assets requires careful navigation and adherence to compliance standards. Public Perception: Some traditional investors and stakeholders may view significant Bitcoin holdings as overly risky or speculative, necessitating clear communication of the strategy. Despite these challenges, Satsuma Technology’s decision underscores a profound belief in the long-term value and utility of digital assets. Their strategic move could inspire other tech companies, especially those in the AI sector, to re-evaluate their treasury strategies and consider the strategic advantages of holding Bitcoin as part of a comprehensive digital asset allocation plan. The rebranding of Tao Alpha to Satsuma Technology and its deepened commitment to a Bitcoin treasury strategy marks a pivotal moment for the company and a notable development in the corporate world. By strategically allocating a significant portion of its reserves to Bitcoin and stablecoins, Satsuma Technology is not only securing its financial future against traditional economic headwinds but also boldly aligning itself with the burgeoning digital economy. This pioneering step by an AI software company reinforces the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption , setting a compelling example for how businesses can innovate beyond their core products to embrace the future of finance. As Satsuma Technology embarks on this new chapter, its strategic vision could very well serve as a blueprint for other forward-thinking enterprises looking to optimize their digital asset allocation and embrace the opportunities presented by the decentralized future.

This is the only ETF so far to offer exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The final deadline was today, and it was approved amidst all the acclaim from supporters. Many are calling this the beginning of a ‘crypto ETF summer,’ and we agree. Looking at Ethereum ETF inflows in the past week ( over $1.28M ), they have Bitcoin ETFs beat, and they keep growing by leaps and bounds. With potential Solana and XRP ETFs coming soon in Q3–Q4 2025, we might be looking at an explosion in crypto adoption from institutions and companies. More importantly, this shines a spotlight on the industry as a whole, and feeds the risk-to-reward appetite of many investors today. Meme coins, in particular, should receive significant attention at this time. Have a look at the best meme coins today to see what we mean. TOKEN6900’s Presale Begins with a Boom, Hinting at 1000x Long-Term Gains for the Meme Coin July 2, 2025 • 07:26 UTC TOKEN6900 has just entered its presale phase and has already accumulated over $92K, with a token price of $0.0064. The coin’s meme potential varies between a pantheistic philosophical meditation and a mushroom-infused rant, but it somehow makes sense. As stated in the whitepaper , TOKEN6900 is ‘powered by nothing but vibes, delusion, and the collective hallucination of terminally-online traders.’ The team has allocated up to 80% of the total token supply to be sold during the presale, while the tokenomics distribution looks beyond fair, with only 0.0007% (6,900 tokens) reserved for the devs. The project has been audited by Coinsult and SolidProof , who found no issues with it.

2025-07-02T07:04:40,"Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Buys More Bitcoin, Touts $1,000,000 BTC Price Prediction","The author of the best-selling personal finance series Rich Dad Poor Dad is continuing his journey to accumulate a total of 100 Bitcoin ( BTC ). In a new post on the social media platform X, Robert Kiyosaki says that he bought another Bitcoin as he expects BTC’s price to hit the seven-figure level. But Kiyosaki notes that he is aware that the $1 million price prediction for Bitcoin may not come to light. “I realize I could be wrong and a sucker. Would not be the first time in my life I was played for a FOOL. Yet I believe Bitcoin will one day soon… be $1 million a coin. If I am a sucker…. I’d rather be a sucker than a LOSER if Bitcoin does go to $1 million. Nobody likes being suckers or losers… Yet that is what makes life exciting. Think for yourself… Do not listen to my ramblings. I can afford to lose a $100,000 because I have been a sucker and a loser many times in my life… and learned from my losses. That’s life. That’s called wisdom and experience… which can be priceless.” The Rich Dad Poor Dad author also says that while it may be considered that Bitcoin is expensive at over $100,000, he points out that he had the same thoughts years ago when BTC was trading below $10,000. According to Kiyosaki, BTC at $100,000 will be cheap if the crypto king hits his ultimate price target. “WHAT IS EXPENSIVE? I was late into Bitcoin. I waited too long… which may have been a good thing. I waited because I did not understand today’s modern money. So I bought my first Bitcoin at $6,000 a coin. It was expensive. Today I wish I had bought more at $6,000. Today Bitcoin is $107,000 a coin. Again my mind says, ‘That’s expensive,’ but I am buying more. Why? Because if and when Bitcoin sells for $1 million a coin, I will once again be saying ‘I wish I had bought more.’ Even if you can afford only one Satoshi today….I believe five years from now, you will be saying, ‘I wish I had bought more.’ Will Bitcoin hit $1 million a coin? I do not know. What I do know is… I will be saying, ‘I will wish I had bought more at $107,000. At $107,000, Bitcoin was priceless.'” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $105,778.

2025-07-02T06:59:41,"Expert Lists Coming Developments That Could Send XRP to $25 In July","As July begins, the XRP community is closely watching a series of rapid institutional and regulatory shifts that appear to align in favor of the asset. Despite the noise and routine volatility in crypto markets, the combination of legislative movement, ETF proposals, and leadership changes has introduced a unique moment for XRP, according to Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX), a known voice in the space. The anticipation isn’t driven only by speculation. A sequence of confirmed developments now appears to be converging. These include the SEC’s approval of Grayscale’s amended ETF proposal, which would include XRP, BTC, ETH, SOL, and ADA. Remi shared a post from Crypto Briefing confirming this acknowledgment on June 30, signaling that XRP’s inclusion in major institutional products is no longer a distant possibility. XRP $25.00 – $75.00 In July -New Fed Chair -Stablecoin Legislation -Spot ETFs XRP -ISO20022 -Basel 3 -FedNow -FedWire -DTCC (FedWire) -SEC Lawsuit Done We Did It Ladies & Gents We Did It Hide your XRP & XLM on a cold wallet. Take profits but save a little something… pic.twitter.com/6Ku5NDLKgB — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) June 30, 2025 New Leadership and Stablecoin Regulation Near Completion Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made headlines when he confirmed a new Federal Reserve Chair could be appointed “in weeks,” with planning already underway for Powell’s successor. Though details remain limited, the timing coincides with broader monetary restructuring. Powell has refused to cut interest rates despite pressure from Donald Trump, and the appointment of a new Fed Chair with a more favorable monetary policy could give the crypto market a notable boost. Bessent also noted that tariffs aren’t contributing to inflation, which may allow more flexibility for digital asset integration within financial systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In addition, Bessent confirmed stablecoin legislation could be finalized by mid-July. This timeline places crypto regulation in a critical stage in a month when institutional support and infrastructure upgrades are also scheduled to take effect. Regulation of stablecoins is widely seen as a precursor to broader crypto adoption by banks and financial institutions. For XRP, which is already aligned with banking infrastructure through ISO 20022 and Ripple’s enterprise partnerships, this timing is significant. Institutional Infrastructure and Potential Targets Institutional infrastructure is now primed for digital asset integration. With ISO 20022, FedNow, the upcoming FedWire upgrade , and DTCC linked to FedWire, XRP stands ready for broader adoption. Basel III rules may also benefit compliant assets, such as XRP, especially with its legal clarity following the SEC case. Summarizing the situation, Remi told followers that XRP could reach between $25 and $75 in July. XRP is currently trading at $2.21, and Remi suggests an increase ranging from 1031.2% to 3,293.7%. He advised users to move their holdings to cold wallets , anticipating a greater climb in the coming years, and stating that holding 100 XRP would be great, and 1,000 tokens would be amazing.

Here’s why: The Pi Core Team Controls 90% of the Supply One reason Pi is expected to stay above $0.40 is because the Pi Core Team (PCT) holds around 90% of the total Pi tokens. Since they control such a large amount, they have the power to manage how many coins enter the market and when. If the price falls too low, especially below $0.40, it would hurt the coin’s image and market rank. A drop like that could push Pi out of the top 30 crypto rankings, making it seem less attractive to investors and traders. Will Pi go below $0.4? No, I do not think so. Why? Because the Pi Core Team owns 90 percent of the coins and is smart enough to avoid letting the price fall below $0.4. Dropping below that level could push Pi’s market cap ranking out of the top 30, making it appear riskier to… — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) July 1, 2025 The Pi team knows this and will likely take steps to prevent such a drop, either by slowing down token unlocks or making announcements. [post_titles_links postid=”477551″] Too Much at Stake for the Pi Network If Pi’s price falls under $0.40, it won’t just affect traders, it could hurt the whole project’s reputation. Big investors, developers, and ecosystem partners might lose interest. That’s why keeping the price stable is important for the Pi Core Team. They’ve already shown they can manage the market by controlling how many tokens get unlocked and by making timely ecosystem updates. Price Forecast: What’s Next? According to chart patterns, Pi’s price might aim to stay between $0.40 and $0.70 until the end of August. After that, as the number of new tokens entering the market decreases, the price could start to rise slowly. Unless there’s a big announcement or sudden hype wave, no major jump is expected in the short term.

The Pi Core Team’s control over 90% of the supply is expected to act as a significant barrier against a major price crash, particularly below $0.40. They can manage token unlocks and make strategic announcements to maintain the coin’s image and market rank, as a severe drop would hurt the project’s reputation and deter investors. What factors could potentially trigger a sudden drop below $0.40 for Pi Coin? While the Core Team aims to prevent it, factors that could trigger a sudden drop below $0.40 for Pi Coin include: massive scheduled token unlocks (like the 276 million Pi tokens unlocked in July 2025), a lack of real tech delivery, continued delays in Mainnet migration or KYC, broader bearish market conditions, or a significant loss of community trust due to perceived centralization or lack of transparency. How does Pi’s token centralization affect its future exchange listings and decentralization goals? Pi’s high degree of token centralization, with 90% controlled by the Core Team, significantly impacts its future exchange listings. Major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance have shown hesitation, sometimes even running community polls before listing, due to concerns about centralization and the project’s legitimacy. This also poses a challenge to Pi’s long-term goal of decentralization, which is a core tenet of blockchain technology.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-price-will-not-fall-below-0-40-heres-why/,"TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BTC|EXCHANGE","News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T06:46:56,"New SEC Guidance Clears the Air for Crypto ETP Issuers: Details Inside","The post New SEC Guidance Clears the Air for Crypto ETP Issuers: Details Inside appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On July 1, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) issued guidance for crypto ETP (Exchange Traded Products) users to resolve the regulatory ambiguity. The official notice released by the SEC outlines the role of crypto issuers and the information they must include in their filings. It provides detailed information on how users calculate NAV and select benchmarks to custody practices, service provider agreements, governance structure, and potential conflicts of interest. SEC’s Views on Clarity in Crypto Assets The SEC guidance aims to provide greater clarity for the crypto assets regulatory framework, outlining certain disclosure requirements under federal law. SEC stated that ETP issuers must register their offerings and classes of securities under the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. SEC added : “Issuers of crypto asset ETPs are also subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. However, the crypto asset ETPs addressed in this statement are not registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940.” Was the SEC Notice Necessary? Token ETPs (exchange-traded products) are becoming more popular as big investment firms start using them. With more money flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs , the SEC is working on new rules to better manage digital assets. These rules will require token ETPs to report any suspicious activity to help reduce risks. [post_titles_links postid=”477508″] Key Highlights of SEC Crypto ETP Guidance Provides a description of the objective of trust and tracking guidelines, the issuer’s policies– use and limitations, the issuer’s rights, the issuer’s guidelines on forks, airdrops, and other similar events. Described the associated risks of liquidity, cybersecurity, technology, regulation, and tax. Provides detailed calculation of NAV, describes securities, and defines the roles of Directors, Executive Officers, and Significant Employees involved in crypto ETP. Final Thought As the SEC is collaborating with crypto exchanges to create universal listing standards for token ETFs, potentially allowing users to bypass the lengthy 19b-4 process. After 75 days of review, crypto exchanges can release the qualified ETPs. SEC’s purpose with the guidance is to ensure investor protection, maintain fair and orderly markets, and facilitate capital formation.

2025-07-02T06:45:43,"Does Ethereum Have an Advantage over Bitcoin for Corporate Treasuries?","Ethereum is “getting its own MicroStrategy era,” said former developer Eric Conner on X on Tuesday, drawing comparison to the world’s leader in corporate Bitcoin accumulation: Michael Saylor’s Strategy. The developer highlighted two “live experiments” of companies that have already started Ethereum treasuries, Tom Lee’s BitMine and Joe Lubin’s SharpLink . These two could be the pioneers for the next wave of Ethereum treasury companies seeking additional yields on top of their digital asset investments. 1/ ETH is getting its own MicroStrategy era. Two live experiments: Tom Lee’s BitMine and Joe Lubin’s SharpLink. Here’s how each plans to stack ETH and juice shareholder value — Eric Conner (@econoar) July 1, 2025 ChatGPT of Crypto BitMine announced this week that the company is adding Fundstrat’s Tom Lee as Chairman. It also revealed plans for a $250 million private placement to stack Ethereum as part of the company’s treasury strategy, and its stock surged 400% as a result. The firm will stake its ETH to earn extra income and will measure success using an “ETH per share” model of how much Ethereum each stock share represents. This is very similar to how Bitcoin treasury companies use BTC Yield to show stockholders. Lee believes Ethereum will benefit as traditional finance moves onchain, stating that more tokenized dollars as stablecoins will increase demand for Ethereum. “Stablecoins have proven to be the ‘ChatGPT’ of crypto, leading to rapid adoption by consumers, merchants, and financial services providers,” he said. “We’re kind of like the plumbing of what banks will look like in the future because they will be staking Ethereum on their balance sheet of crypto in order to fund and operate their stablecoin.” We asked @fundstrat (Chief Investment Officer of @FundstratCap ) to explain the strategic decision for $BMNR to focus on Ethereum due to its role in stablecoins. “Stablecoins are the ChatGPT of Fintech.” “They provide a logarithmic benefit over traditional systems.”… pic.twitter.com/nNQ7pKrCaR — TBPN (@tbpn) June 30, 2025 BitMine’s mining DNA lets it spin up validators and “tap DeFi rails, turning a once-capital-intensive operation into a cash-flow engine secured by Ethereum,” said Conner. Meanwhile, ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin is taking a bigger gamble with his gaming firm SharpLink, which raised $425 million to stack and stake Ethereum. Conner concluded that this is just the beginning of the Ethereum treasury company phase, and more firms will follow. “Firms are waking up to ETH’s combo of reserve asset and native yield. Expect the ETH-per-share scoreboard to get crowded fast.” Ethereum Price Dips Regardless of the clear impact on Ether supply and demand this will have, spot ETH prices remain lackluster. ETH has lost 2.3% on the day, falling back below $2,400 during the Wednesday morning Asian trading session. However, it found support there, and downsides were limited. The asset has done very little since it cleared $2,200 in early May, with some investors describing it as a “stablecoin.” Even with the bullish fundamentals and institutional interest in the asset, many are clearly still selling at these prices.

2025-07-02T06:32:38,"Arizona Governor Vetoes Crypto Seizure Reserve Bill, Citing Law Enforcement Concerns","Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has vetoed House Bill 2324, a measure aimed at creating a reserve fund to manage crypto assets seized through criminal forfeiture. Key Takeaways: Arizona Governor vetoed a bill that would have created a reserve fund for seized crypto assets. The proposal aimed to give the State Treasurer authority to invest or trade seized crypto. Texas moved ahead with its own Bitcoin reserve fund. In a letter released Tuesday , Hobbs argued the bill would discourage local law enforcement from cooperating on digital asset seizures by shifting control of seized crypto assets away from local jurisdictions. The Arizona House narrowly passed HB 2324 last week in a 34-22 vote. Arizona Bill Sought State Control Over Seized Crypto Assets Reserve The proposal sought to give the State Treasurer authority over the Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund, allowing the state to invest or trade crypto assets obtained from criminal proceedings, including in exchange-traded funds containing digital assets. Earlier in May, Arizona approved HB 2749, becoming the second U.S. state to pass a crypto reserve law. That legislation focuses on handling unclaimed crypto presumed abandoned, whereas HB 2324 specifically targeted assets seized from criminal activity. Meanwhile, Arizona lawmakers continue to weigh other crypto-related proposals, such as SB 1062, which would recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender in the state. Arizona’s move comes as some US states abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In May, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation , joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. On a positive note, last month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law , establishing a state-funded Bitcoin reserve, the first of its kind in the country. Unlike similar initiatives in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas is creating a standalone reserve fund entirely separate from the state treasury. The fund will be overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar and aims to explore Bitcoin as a strategic asset class. “We can buy land, we can buy gold; I think the state of Texas should have the option of evaluating the best performing asset over the last 10 years,” said bill author Senator Charles Schwertner. Bitcoin Adoption as Treasury Asset Finds Momentum As reported, over the past week, at least nine UK firms, from web design startups to mining businesses, have announced plans to buy Bitcoin or revealed recent purchases to add the cryptocurrency to their corporate treasuries. Among the UK firms, AI services provider Tao Alpha disclosed plans to raise £100 million after revealing a bitcoin treasury plan that triggered investor interest. Smarter Web Company, a small website design firm, saw its market value rocket from £4 million to over £1 billion in just two months after announcing its Bitcoin purchases in April, although shares have since cooled. In the US, Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC acquired 3,724 Bitcoin for $386 million as part of plans to go public through an SPAC merger, while Japan’s Metaplanet raised $517.8 million on the first day of its ambitious “555 Million Plan,” which targets 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027.

Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $147 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $150 level. The next major resistance is near the $152 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $160 swing high to the $144 low. The main resistance could be $155. A successful close above the $155 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $160. Any more gains might send the price toward the $165 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $150 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $145 zone. The first major support is near the $142 level. A break below the $142 level might send the price toward the $136 zone.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index registered a score of 63 on Wednesday, down just one point from the previous day, indicating continued market confidence. Bitcoin had nearly reached $108,000 on Tuesday before sliding into a short-term correction. Analysts are closely watching to see if the cryptocurrency will retest its all-time high of $111,970 set on May 22. Historical Trends Cast Shadow Over Q3 Analysts have flagged the third quarter as historically slow for Bitcoin. “From the historical data, this quarter is generally the slowest out of all, for both $BTC and $ETH,” said trader Daan Crypto Trades. Since 2013, Bitcoin has averaged just a 5.47% gain during Q3. If the trend continues, Bitcoin could rise to about $111,000 by September 30. Daan attributes the slower performance to “slower summer months where there’s generally less action, volumes [and] liquidity.” Q2 Outperforms Averages Bitcoin delivered a solid second quarter with a 31% gain, ending at $108,383—about 4% above the historical Q2 average of 27% since 2014. June also saw the asset print its highest monthly candle. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market. Its dominance stands at 65.5%, up nearly 13% year-to-date, according to TradingView. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index stands at 20 out of 100, suggesting it is still Bitcoin’s market.

2025-07-02T06:19:47,"Bitcoin CME Futures Premium Slides, Suggests Waning Institutional Appetite","The premium in bitcoin (BTC) futures listed on the global derivatives giant Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has narrowed sharply, a sign of reduced institutional appetite. The annualized premium in rolling three-month futures has dropped to 4.3%, the lowest since October 2023, according to data tracked by 10x Research . That's down significantly from highs above 10% seen early this year. The decline in the so-called basis, despite BTC's price holding steady above $100,000, indicates fading optimism or uncertainty about future price prospects. The drop is consistent with the slide in the funding rates in perpetual futures listed on major offshore exchanges. According to 10x, funding rates recently flipped negative, suggesting a discount in perpetual futures relative to the spot price, which is also a sign of bias for bearish short positions. The dwindling price differential is a setback for those seeking to pursue the non-directional cash-and-carry arbitrage, which involves simultaneously purchasing spot ETFs (or actually BTC) and shorting the CME futures. ""When yield spreads fall below a 10% hurdle rate, Bitcoin ETF inflows are typically driven by directional investors rather than arbitrage-focused hedge funds. This dynamic often coincides with price consolidation. Currently, these spreads are down to 1.0% (perpetual futures funding rate) and 4.3% (CME basis rate), indicating a significant decline in hedge fund arbitrage activity,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, told CoinDesk. Thielen added that the drop-off coincides with muted retail participation, as indicated by depressed perpetual funding rates and low spot market volumes. Padalan Capital voiced a similar opinion in a weekly update , calling the decline in funding rates a sign of retrenchment in speculative interest. ""A more acute signal of risk-off positioning comes from regulated venues, where the CME-to-spot basis for both Bitcoin and Ethereum has inverted into deeply negative territory, indicating aggressive institutional hedging or a substantial unwind of cash-and-carry structures.,"" Padalan Capital noted.

2025-07-02T06:14:18,"OFAC sanctions crypto wallets tied to Russian bulletproof hosting provider Aeza Group","United States authorities have sanctioned a crypto wallet linked to Russia-based Aeza Group, accused of enabling ransomware operations and darknet markets. According to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the designation targets Aeza Group’s entire cyber infrastructure, including affiliated entities and four individuals in leadership roles. The group allegedly offered bulletproof hosting services that allowed ransomware operators, malware distributors, and darknet vendors to operate with impunity by evading detection and law enforcement. The sanctions extend to Aeza International Ltd., a UK-based front company used to lease IP addresses to cybercriminals, as well as two Russia-based subsidiaries, Aeza Logistic LLC and Cloud Solutions LLC. OFAC also designated four senior executives, including CEO Arsenii Penzev and general director Yurii Bozoyan, both of whom were arrested by Russian law enforcement for their involvement in the darknet drug marketplace Blacksprut. Aeza’s infrastructure reportedly supported groups like Meduza and Lumma infostealer operators, BianLian ransomware, RedLine infostealer panels, and the now-defunct Blacksprut marketplace. These services allowed threat actors to steal sensitive data and siphon funds from global victims, including crypto users. You might also like: Russian-British dual national charged for sending crypto to fund pro-Russian militias in Ukraine The designated crypto address, hosted on the Tron blockchain, was identified as an administrative wallet used to receive payments for Aeza’s services. According to Chainalysis, the wallet processed over $350,000 in crypto and funneled payments through a third-party processor to obscure the financial trail and make tracing difficult. Investigators reportedly found that the wallet received direct payments from customers, including infostealer vendors, and routed illicit funds to various cryptocurrency exchanges. A separate report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs corroborated these findings, noting that the designated address showed “regular cash-out points to global cryptocurrency exchanges” and payment service providers. Analysts observed that the payment patterns aligned with known pricing for Aeza’s hosting services, suggesting that infostealer vendors and other threat actors were likely among the group’s customers. TRM also identified links between the wallet and other cybercrime platforms through intermediary addresses, including connections to the sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Garantex. TRM said that websites linked to Aeza and its affiliates had gone offline shortly after the designation was announced. “Today’s designations underscore a continuing trend of growing focus by authorities on disrupting not just individual threat actors, but also the infrastructure that enables their operations,” TRM said. “Aeza Group’s role in facilitating global cybercrime illustrates how infrastructure providers can serve as critical enablers—and potential pressure points—for law enforcement and regulators alike.” Earlier this year, OFAC led a coordinated effort with the United Kingdom and Australia to sanction another Russia-based bulletproof hosting provider, Zservers, for offering infrastructure to the LockBit ransomware gang. OFAC targets crypto wallets Beyond infrastructure, OFAC has also been focused on dismantling crypto-based cybercrime financing. In April, the agency sanctioned eight crypto addresses used by Yemen’s Houthi movement to fund arms procurement and terrorist activities. On-chain data showed over $45 million moved through Garantex in connection with these operations. Similarly, in March, OFAC blacklisted 49 crypto wallets tied to Nemesis, a darknet marketplace operated by Iranian national Behrouz Parsarad. The site was involved in trafficking fentanyl and other synthetic drugs, processing nearly $30 million in sales using Bitcoin and Monero before its seizure in 2024.

In a veto letter to House Speaker Steve Montenegro, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has blocked House Bill 2324, which aimed to establish a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund funded by cryptocurrencies seized through criminal forfeiture. Initially rejected by the House on May 7, the bill was revived after a narrow 16-14 Senate vote on June 19 when Republican Senator Janae Shamp, who had previously opposed it, filed a motion to reconsider. The measure returned to the House and passed on June 24 with a 34-22 vote, proposing that seized digital assets be overseen by the State Treasurer and allocated partly to the Attorney General’s office, the state’s general fund, and the reserve fund itself. In the veto letter, Hobbs argued that diverting these assets into a state-managed reserve fund could undermine local agencies’ willingness to participate in investigations and seizures, ultimately weakening enforcement efforts against crimes involving digital assets. “Today, I vetoed House Bill 2324. This bill disincentives local law enforcement from working with the state on digital asset forfeiture by removing seized assets from local jurisdictions,” she wrote.

Previously, she vetoed SB 1025, which sought to permit the state to invest up to 10% of public funds in Bitcoin ( BTC ) or other digital assets, and SB 1373, which proposed funding a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve with seized cryptocurrencies and other appropriations. However, Hobbs signed HB 2749 into law on May 7, establishing a reserve for unclaimed digital assets such as abandoned cryptocurrencies, airdrops, and staking rewards, managed by the Department of Revenue, thereby integrating digital assets into state finance without direct investment or reliance on criminal forfeiture funds.

2025-07-02T06:10:17,"Robinhood unveils XRP micro futures — will Ripple hit $5 or this top crypto lead?","Robinhood is rolling out micro futures contracts for XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin, making crypto trading more accessible. This move targets retail investors seeking affordable entry points into the crypto market. By offering smaller contract sizes, like 2,500 XRP valued at roughly $5,200, Robinhood lowers the capital needed for futures trading. The platform’s recent $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp fuels this expansion, boosting its global reach. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its presale, raising $11,400,000 with over 575 million tokens sold to 12,600 holders. With Phase 5 underway, MUTM’s innovative DeFi model sparks curiosity about which crypto will lead. XRP futures gain traction Robinhood is introducing micro XRP futures, allowing traders to engage with 2,500 XRP per contract. This reduces the financial barrier for retail investors in the crypto market. The contracts, cash-settled to limit risk, align with rising interest in crypto investments. CME Group’s XRP futures, launched in May 2025, already hit $542 million in trading volume. Bloomberg predicts a 95% chance of XRP ETF approval in 2025, signaling strong market confidence. Robinhood’s trading ladder tool simplifies the process, appealing to newcomers. Yet, XRP’s price trajectory to $5 remains uncertain amidst competition. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling alternative in DeFi, drawing investor focus. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale surges Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing through Phase 5 of its presale, priced at $0.03 per token. Over 50% of this phase is filled, signaling a fast-closing window for early investors. The price has tripled from $0.01 in Phase 1, with $11,400,000 raised and 12,600 holders onboard. Phase 6 will see a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, while the token launches at $0.06, ensuring a 100% ROI. Analysts project MUTM could hit $3 post-launch in 2025, driven by its robust DeFi ecosystem. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, boosting engagement. Innovative DeFi lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending system. Its Peer-to-Contract model applies smart contacts to automatically adjust to the market conditions on the basis of interest rates. This guarantees a stabilization of lenders and borrowers. The Peer-to-Peer system provides a direct form of transactions, which is fitting in volatile assets. A collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on a sufficient Ethereum increases the level of reliability decreasing the risks of depegging. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a CertiK audit and has a score of 95.00 in the security rating and no vulnerabilities have been identified. Additionally, a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK rewards vulnerability reports across four severity tiers. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a secure, scalable DeFi platform in the crypto market. Solana and Bitcoin futures also in focus Robinhood’s micro Solana and Bitcoin Friday futures cater to diverse crypto investments. Solana futures leverage its high-speed blockchain, but price volatility tempers expectations for a $5 surge. Bitcoin futures, backed by CME’s infrastructure, benefit from renewed bullish momentum. However, both face stiff competition from innovative projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Robinhood’s Bitstamp acquisition strengthens its platform, yet Solana and Bitcoin lack the utility-driven focus of MUTM’s lending and stablecoin innovations. Investors eyeing crypto prices today may find MUTM’s presale more enticing, offering immediate ROI and long-term potential in the evolving crypto market. A bright horizon for investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing attention as Phase 5 nears completion, with over 575 million tokens sold. Unlike XRP, Solana, or Bitcoin, MUTM’s focus on lending, staking, and a native stablecoin positions it for growth. Its projected $3 price in 2025 offers a 100x return from the current $0.03. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy now should explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

The company filed its Form S-1 filing with the SEC today. According to the data in the filing, Figma has approximately $69.5 million in spot Bitcoin ETF assets as of March 31, 2025. While this move was considered an indicator of the company's strategic interest in digital assets, Figma's board of directors also approved a new $30 million BTC investment plan with the decision taken on May 8, 2025. Within this scope, an equivalent amount of USDC was purchased and it was planned to convert these assets into Bitcoin. Related News: Altcoin Listed on Major Exchanges Announces Collaboration with Donald Trump-Linked Project, Triggering a Price Surge As part of the IPO, Figma intends to list shares of its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “FIG” in its own name and in the name of existing shareholders participating in the sale. The Company currently has no public market history. In the statements made, Figma's shares were organized into three different classes: Class A: One vote per share, Class B: 15 voting rights per share (Convertible), Class C: Non-voting shares (with limited conversion rights). The majority of voting rights after the IPO will reportedly remain with the company’s CEO and co-founder Dylan Field, who will retain most of the voting power through proxy grants from co-founder Evan Wallace and the Wu-Wallace Family Foundation. *This is not investment advice.
