2025-07-02T16:40:15,"Bitcoin’s Astonishing Ascent: Standard Chartered Forecasts a $200K Triumph by Year-End","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astonishing Ascent: Standard Chartered Forecasts a $200K Triumph by Year-End Are you ready for a seismic shift in the crypto world? Standard Chartered, a renowned financial institution, has just dropped a bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that’s sending ripples across the entire market. They’re not just bullish; they’re projecting an astonishing climb for Bitcoin (BTC) to hit $135,000 by Q3 and a staggering $200,000 by year-end. This isn’t just a hopeful guess; it’s a meticulously crafted Standard Chartered forecast underpinned by significant market shifts. What’s Driving This Bold Standard Chartered Forecast? Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s astute head of digital asset research, is the man behind this groundbreaking projection. His analysis, widely reported by Cointelegraph, points to several powerful catalysts that are reshaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. Gone are the days when post-halving corrections were the primary concern; new demand dynamics are now firmly in the driver’s seat. The Power of Spot Bitcoin ETFs One of the most significant factors fueling this bullish outlook is the sustained inflow into Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Since their approval, these investment vehicles have revolutionized how institutional and retail investors access Bitcoin. Unlike previous cycles where direct crypto exchange purchases were the norm, ETFs provide a regulated, familiar pathway for traditional finance players to gain exposure to BTC. This has unlocked a torrent of new capital, creating unprecedented demand pressure. Institutional Access: ETFs simplify compliance and custody, making Bitcoin a viable asset for large funds and wealth managers. Retail Convenience: Everyday investors can now buy Bitcoin exposure through their brokerage accounts, often with lower fees and greater security. Liquidity Boost: The massive inflows enhance Bitcoin’s market liquidity, making it more attractive for larger trades. The Rise of Corporate Treasury Adoption Beyond ETFs, another pivotal driver is the growing trend of corporate treasury adoption . More and more companies are beginning to view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate reserve asset for their balance sheets. This strategic move is often driven by a desire to hedge against inflation, diversify holdings, or simply capitalize on Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. When a major corporation allocates a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin, it signals immense confidence and sets a precedent for others to follow. Think about companies like MicroStrategy, which pioneered this trend. Their continued accumulation of Bitcoin demonstrates a strong belief in its future value. As more corporate treasuries consider this strategy, the demand for BTC will only intensify, creating a robust floor for its price and propelling it upwards. Understanding Bitcoin’s Unique Market Dynamics Kendrick’s observation about Bitcoin diverging from typical post-halving corrections is crucial. Historically, Bitcoin has often experienced a price dip or consolidation period shortly after its halving events, as the market adjusts to the reduced supply of new BTC. However, this cycle appears different. The sheer volume of new demand generated by Spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing corporate treasury adoption seems to be overriding these historical patterns. The crypto market outlook is therefore shifting from one dominated by retail speculation and supply shocks to one increasingly influenced by institutional capital and strategic corporate allocations. This maturation of the market suggests a more stable, yet powerfully upward, trajectory for Bitcoin. Key Differences in This Cycle: To illustrate the divergence, consider these points: Feature Previous Cycles (Typical Post-Halving) Current Cycle (Post-Halving 2024) Primary Demand Driver Retail speculation, hype, FOMO Institutional inflows via ETFs, corporate treasury adoption Market Reaction to Halving Initial consolidation or correction Sustained demand overriding typical correction Market Maturity Nascent, highly volatile, less regulated Growing institutionalization, clearer regulatory pathways What Does This Mean for Investors and the Crypto Market Outlook? This bold Bitcoin price prediction from Standard Chartered underscores a significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape. It suggests that Bitcoin is no longer just a fringe asset but is rapidly integrating into mainstream finance. For investors, this could mean continued growth potential, but it also highlights the importance of staying informed about market dynamics. Benefits and Opportunities: Validation: A major bank’s bullish stance lends significant credibility to Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Growth Potential: The $200K target indicates substantial upside for current and prospective holders. Market Maturation: Increased institutional involvement can lead to greater stability and reduced volatility over time, though short-term swings are always possible. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Despite institutional adoption, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Price movements can be rapid and unpredictable. Regulatory Landscape: While improving, regulatory clarity remains an ongoing challenge in various jurisdictions. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rates, and geopolitical events can still influence Bitcoin’s price. Actionable Insights: Given this exciting forecast and the evolving crypto market outlook , what should you consider? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news regarding ETF inflows, corporate adoption announcements, and macroeconomic indicators. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin’s potential is high, a diversified portfolio remains a prudent strategy for managing risk. Long-Term View: Standard Chartered’s prediction is for year-end, suggesting a long-term perspective is beneficial for capitalizing on such growth. Understand Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose. While the outlook is positive, no investment is without risk. A Compelling Future for Bitcoin Standard Chartered’s audacious Bitcoin price prediction of $200,000 by year-end is more than just a number; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system. Fueled by the relentless demand from Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the strategic embrace of corporate treasury adoption , Bitcoin appears poised for an unprecedented ascent. This cycle is indeed different, with new, powerful demand drivers dictating the market’s rhythm. As the crypto market outlook continues to mature, Bitcoin’s journey promises to be one of the most fascinating financial stories of our time.

So, what is the reason behind Standard Chartered’s bullish price prediction for Q3, lets find it out. Why Is Standard Chartered So Bullish? According to Standard Chartered, analysts there are two main drivers behind this predicted surge, first a massive inflow into Bitcoin ETFs and second the growing demand from corporate treasuries. JUST IN: $1.1 trillion Standard Chartered predicts #Bitcoin to hit $200,000 this year pic.twitter.com/XplFnxahSP — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 2, 2025 In the second quarter of 2025 alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries snapped up around 245,000 BTC. Since January 2024, ETFs have attracted more than $48 billion in net buying. More Corporate firms and giant institutions are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, and even government-linked funds are increasing their exposure through indirect investments. Therefore, Standard Chartered believes this trend will only get stronger in the months ahead. Standard Chartered Past BTC Price Predictions Earlier this year, Standard Chartered predicted Bitcoin would reach $120,000 by mid-2025. Bitcoin has already surpassed $112,000 in Q2, just shy of that target but well above the $85,000 seen at the start of the year. The bank’s new targets are even more ambitious, with a long-term vision of $500,000 by 2028 if current trends continue. As of today, Bitcoin is trading around $ 109,000 reflecting a 3% rise seen in the last 24hours. Volatility Still in the Picture Of course, it won’t be a smooth ride. Standard Chartered does warn that there could be some bumps ahead, especially between late Q3 and early Q4. Sudden pullbacks or profit-taking could shake up the market for a while. But overall, if the ETF momentum and corporate interest keep growing, this could be the year Bitcoin breaks all its old records, and $200,000 might not sound so crazy after all.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-standard-chartered-predict-btc-to-hit-135k-in-q3/,"BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET","News",cryptocompare

The dispute between Celsius and Tether dates back to a 2022 agreement in which Tether provided USDT to Celsius, which sent Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. Tether argues that Celsius is attempting to shift the blame for his own financial mismanagement onto Tether by requesting the return of approximately $2.4 billion worth of BTC (as of the date of the lawsuit), despite the liquidation being carried out at his direction and with his consent.

2025-07-02T16:10:07,"Bitcoin Outlook: Unpacking the Perilous Impact of Record U.S. Money Supply","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Outlook: Unpacking the Perilous Impact of Record U.S. Money Supply The financial world is abuzz, and for good reason. The U.S. M2 money supply recently soared to an unprecedented $21.94 trillion in May, a figure that on the surface might signal robust economic growth. Yet, for the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, particularly the Bitcoin outlook , this record surge introduces a complex web of signals. Are we witnessing the fuel for a new bull run, or is this a precursor to economic headwinds that could challenge even the most resilient digital assets? Let’s unpack this critical development and understand its profound implications. What is the U.S. M2 Money Supply and Why Does its Record High Matter for Bitcoin? Before diving into Bitcoin’s fate, it’s essential to grasp what the M2 money supply actually represents. In simple terms, M2 is a broad measure of the total amount of money circulating in an economy. It includes: M1: All physical cash (currency), checking accounts, and traveler’s checks. Savings Deposits: Money held in savings accounts. Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs): Interest-bearing accounts offered by banks. Small-Denomination Time Deposits: Certificates of Deposit (CDs) under $100,000. Retail Money Market Mutual Funds: Funds that invest in short-term debt instruments. The recent jump to $21.94 trillion isn’t just a number; it’s a reflection of significant monetary expansion. This growth has largely been fueled by aggressive quantitative easing (QE) programs and massive government stimulus measures implemented during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. When the Federal Reserve buys bonds and injects liquidity into the banking system, and when governments send out stimulus checks, the M2 money supply naturally expands. For the Bitcoin outlook , a rising M2 money supply presents a fascinating dichotomy. On one hand, an abundance of liquidity in the financial system can lead to a ‘search for yield.’ With more money chasing investment opportunities, some of it inevitably flows into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This influx of capital can drive up demand and prices. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ has historically been seen by some as a hedge against the debasement of fiat currencies, a narrative that gains traction when the money supply expands rapidly. However, there’s another side to this coin, one that sparks considerable inflation concerns and complicates the macroeconomic landscape for digital assets. Bitcoin Outlook : The Dual-Edged Sword of Liquidity and Inflation Concerns The current macroeconomic environment for Bitcoin is a delicate balance between the potential benefits of increased liquidity and the looming threat of inflation. Let’s explore this push and pull: The Bullish Case: Liquidity and the Search for Yield When there’s a flood of money in the system, traditional safe havens like bonds might offer low returns. This can push investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, with their potential for outsized gains, often become attractive targets. This ‘risk-on’ sentiment is fueled by easy money policies, which reduce borrowing costs and encourage speculative investments. In this scenario, Bitcoin could theoretically benefit from the sheer volume of capital looking for a home, seeing its price ascend as more dollars chase a finite supply of digital assets. The Bearish Case: Inflation Concerns and Economic Headwinds Conversely, a rapid expansion of the money supply, if not met by a proportional increase in goods and services, can lead to inflation. Simply put, ‘too much money chasing too few goods’ drives up prices. This erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies and can create economic instability. While some proponents argue Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, its performance during recent inflationary periods has been mixed, often correlating more with technology stocks than traditional safe-havens like gold. This challenges the narrative that Bitcoin is a pure inflation hedge, especially in the short to medium term. The crucial question for the Bitcoin outlook then becomes: which force will dominate? Will the liquidity narrative prevail, pushing prices higher, or will escalating inflation concerns compel central banks to adopt policies that dampen speculative appetite? Navigating Inflation Concerns : How Does It Complicate the Fed Rate Cuts Narrative? The Federal Reserve, often referred to simply as ‘the Fed,’ has a dual mandate: to maintain maximum employment and ensure price stability (i.e., control inflation). When the M2 money supply grows at a record pace, it naturally raises alarms about potential inflation. If inflation becomes entrenched, the Fed is compelled to act. Historically, the Fed’s primary tool to combat inflation is to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which slows down economic activity, reduces demand, and ideally brings inflation back under control. However, this is where the plot thickens for the broader crypto market and the economy at large. For months, financial markets have been eagerly anticipating Fed rate cuts . The expectation was that as inflation cooled, the Fed would lower rates to stimulate economic growth, making borrowing cheaper and encouraging investment. This dovish stance is generally seen as positive for risk assets like Bitcoin, as lower rates reduce the appeal of ‘safer’ investments and make speculative ventures more attractive. However, continued robust growth in the M2 money supply throws a wrench into these expectations. Analysts warn that if this trend persists, it could put immense pressure on the Fed to reconsider its stance on easing. Instead of cutting rates, the Fed might be forced to: Maintain current high interest rates for longer: This ‘higher for longer’ scenario can starve risk assets of liquidity and make traditional investments more appealing. Even raise rates further: In a worst-case scenario, if inflation proves stickier than anticipated due to excess liquidity, the Fed might have no choice but to implement additional rate hikes, a move that would likely send shockwaves through the crypto market . Such a hawkish pivot by the Fed would significantly alter the investment landscape, making the cost of capital higher and reducing the speculative appetite that often fuels cryptocurrency booms. What Does Continued Money Supply Growth Mean for Future Fed Rate Cuts and the Crypto Market? The interplay between M2 money supply, inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions is crucial for understanding the immediate and long-term trajectory of the crypto market . Here’s a breakdown of the potential scenarios: Scenario 1: Inflationary Pressures Mount, Fed Stays Hawkish If the record M2 money supply indeed translates into persistent, high inflation, the Fed’s hands will be tied. They would prioritize price stability, meaning Fed rate cuts would be off the table, and even rate hikes could be on the horizon. In this environment, the crypto market would likely face significant headwinds. Higher interest rates increase the attractiveness of less risky assets (like U.S. Treasury bonds), making speculative assets less appealing. Borrowing costs for crypto businesses and investors also rise, potentially stifling innovation and investment within the sector. Scenario 2: M2 Growth Decouples from Inflation, Fed Eases It’s possible that the increased M2 supply doesn’t translate into runaway inflation due to other economic factors (e.g., increased productivity, supply chain normalization). In this more optimistic scenario, the Fed might find room to implement Fed rate cuts , stimulating economic growth and potentially fueling a ‘risk-on’ environment. This would be highly beneficial for the crypto market , as cheaper money tends to flow into higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Scenario 3: Stagflation Concerns A more challenging scenario involves ‘stagflation’ – a period of high inflation coupled with stagnant economic growth. This is particularly difficult for central banks to manage. If the record M2 money supply leads to persistent inflation but the economy struggles to grow, the Fed would be in a bind, with limited tools to address both issues simultaneously. Such an environment would likely create significant uncertainty and volatility across all markets, including the crypto market . The current consensus among many analysts is that the record M2 growth complicates the path to rate cuts. The Fed will be closely watching inflation data, employment figures, and, indeed, money supply metrics to inform its decisions. Any indication that the money supply is fueling unsustainable price increases will likely result in a more hawkish stance, putting a damper on the broader crypto market ‘s aspirations for a swift recovery fueled by monetary easing. Beyond Bitcoin: Broader Implications for the Crypto Market and Investor Sentiment While Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the entire digital asset space, the macroeconomic shifts driven by the U.S. M2 money supply and the Federal Reserve’s response have far-reaching implications for the entire crypto market . Altcoins, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other emerging sectors are often more sensitive to changes in liquidity and investor sentiment than Bitcoin itself. Impact on Altcoins and DeFi Altcoins, which typically exhibit higher volatility than Bitcoin, are particularly vulnerable during periods of economic uncertainty or tightening monetary policy. When capital becomes scarcer or more expensive, investors tend to retreat from riskier assets, and altcoins often see sharper declines than Bitcoin. Similarly, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which relies heavily on liquidity and accessible capital, could face headwinds if interest rates remain high or rise further, making borrowing more expensive and reducing the attractiveness of yield-generating strategies. Institutional Adoption and Retail Sentiment The macroeconomic environment also heavily influences institutional interest in crypto. Large institutional investors often have strict risk management frameworks and are more sensitive to traditional financial market indicators. A hawkish Fed or persistent inflation concerns might lead them to delay or reduce their crypto allocations, preferring more stable assets. Retail investor sentiment, while sometimes driven by hype, is also ultimately influenced by broader economic conditions. A tightening economy or a challenging job market can reduce discretionary income available for speculative investments, impacting overall demand in the crypto market . Key Challenges and Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Navigating the current landscape, with record money supply figures and uncertain central bank policy, presents both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions. Key Challenges: Macroeconomic Volatility: The crypto market is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance, making it susceptible to shifts in interest rates, inflation, and broader economic sentiment. Uncertainty in Fed Policy: The Fed’s reaction to persistent money supply growth and inflation is unpredictable, leading to potential sudden market movements. Correlation with Risk Assets: Bitcoin’s tendency to correlate with tech stocks means it may struggle in an environment where investors shun risk. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Economic Currents: Stay Informed: Regularly monitor key economic indicators such as the U.S. M2 money supply, Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), employment data, and Federal Reserve statements. Understanding these trends will help you anticipate potential market shifts. Practice Risk Management: Given the heightened uncertainty, employ robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio (both within crypto and across different asset classes), and only investing what you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of macroeconomic uncertainty, projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, robust technology, and active development communities tend to be more resilient. Researching the underlying value proposition of crypto assets becomes even more critical. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility can be unnerving, a long-term investment horizon can help weather market fluctuations. Bitcoin’s underlying technology and increasing adoption continue to evolve, regardless of short-term economic headwinds. A Compelling Summary: Navigating the New Economic Frontier The record surge in the U.S. M2 money supply to nearly $22 trillion is a significant economic event, sending ripples of both hope and concern across financial markets, especially for the Bitcoin outlook . While the sheer volume of liquidity could theoretically boost demand for risk assets like Bitcoin, it simultaneously fuels potent inflation concerns that could compel the Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish stance. The delicate balance between encouraging economic growth and combating inflation means that previously anticipated Fed rate cuts might be delayed or even reversed, creating a challenging environment for the entire crypto market . Investors must remain vigilant, understanding that Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space are no longer isolated from traditional macroeconomic forces. The interplay of money supply, inflation, and central bank policy will be critical determinants of market sentiment and price action in the coming months. By staying informed and adopting prudent investment strategies, participants can better navigate these perilous, yet potentially rewarding, economic currents.

They include Optimism and Arbitrum, which recently surpassed 2 million daily transactions, as well as zkSync and StarkNet. These solutions offer faster and cheaper transactions while taking advantage of Ethereum’s existing security infrastructure. Institutions are also increasingly adopting an Ethereum treasury, similar to that of Bitcoin. Some important examples include Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-listed company that raised $163 million to expand its Ethereum treasury , now holding 24,434.2 ETH. The firm is shifting from Bitcoin mining to Ethereum staking infrastructure. SharpLink Gaming has also become the world’s largest corporate Ethereum holder, with 188,478 ETH (worth $457 million) acquired through aggressive buying campaigns. SharpLink Gaming has emerged as the world’s largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum (ETH), after acquiring 176,271 ETH for $463 million. #ETH #Sharplink https://t.co/ynahjYt7Hd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 Other public companies, such as BitMine and BioNexus Gene Lab, have also adopted Ethereum as a reserve asset, indicating growing institutional confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum Forms Bearish Rounded Top: Breakdown Targets $2,300 The Ethereum ($ETH/$USDT) 30-minute chart presents a clear rounded top formation, typically interpreted as a bearish reversal pattern. The arc began forming on June 29, with Ethereum gradually losing upward momentum after peaking just below $2,530. This slow transition from bullish to bearish sentiment is often driven by fading buyer interest and profit-taking, leading to a progressively weaker price structure. Source: CoinGlass The rounded top was completed between June 30 and July 1, culminating in a breakdown below the neckline zone near $2,470, marked with a red arrow. This breakdown indicates a shift in market control from buyers to sellers, leading to a sharp price rejection and initiating a short-term downtrend. The decline pushes $ETH down to lows of approximately $2,390, a retracement of over 5% from the local high. Interestingly, following the breakdown, the chart shows signs of short-term recovery, with buyers stepping in around the $2,400 support zone. A green candle appears near July 2, indicating a potential relief bounce or dead cat bounce. However, unless Ethereum reclaims the $2,470–$2,600 zone convincingly, this move may be short-lived. In summary, Ethereum has exhibited a textbook rounded top breakdown, and caution is advised unless a strong recovery invalidates this bearish setup.

2025-07-02T16:00:04,"The ‘MicroStrategy’ Of Ethereum Emerges: Tom Lee And Joe Lubin Raise $675M To Stack ETH","The ‘MicroStrategy’ of Ethereum has emerged, with Fundstrat’s Tom Lee and Joe Lubin making moves to advance their respective ETH treasuries. Tom Lee has emerged as the Chairman of BitMine, which will hold ETH, while Lubin is already the Chairman of SharpLink Gaming. Lee and Lubin Raise $675 Million for Ethereum Treasury Strategy Tom Lee and Joe Lubin have already advanced their plans to create the ‘MicroStrategy’ of Ethereum. On Tom Lee’s end, BitMine announced a $250 million private placement to raise capital for its Ethereum strategy. The Bitcoin mining company stated that the net proceeds of the offering will be used to acquire ETH, which will become the firm’s primary reserve asset. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here’s Why BitMine plans to close this private placement on or about July 3, as it aims to become one of the largest publicly traded ETH holders with Tom Lee as the Chairman of the Board. On the other hand, SharpLink Gaming, with Joe Lubin’s help, is already the largest publicly traded Ethereum holder. The company earlier launched its Ethereum treasury with a $425 million ETH purchase. SharpLink Gaming recently announced that it has increased its total ETH holdings to 198,167 ($475 million), further establishing its position as the ‘MicroStrategy’ of Ethereum. Between June 23 and 30, it acquired 9,468 ETH for $22.8 million at an average price of $2,411 per ETH. During that same period, SharpLink Gaming also raised an additional $24.4 million through its At-The-Market (ATM) facility, selling $2.5 million shares. The company revealed that most of the proceeds will go toward further Ethereum acquisitions. As of June 30th, 100% of its ETH is staked, and the firm has earned 222 ETH in rewards since it began an ETH treasury company. Plans To Mirror Saylor’s Strategy In an X post, crypto commentator Eric Conner commented on how Ethereum is getting its own MicroStrategy era thanks to Lee and Lubin’s experiments. He highlighted BitMine’s proposed KPI of ‘ETH per share,’ which mirrors Saylor’s playbook, except that ETH earns yield in this instance through staking. Related Reading: These Companies Are Following Saylor’s Strategy Into The Bitcoin Battleground With Over $2 Billion Slated To Buy BTC Conner further remarked that BitMine’s mining DNA lets it spin up validators and tap DeFi rails, turning a once-capital-intensive operation into a cash-flow engine secured by Ethereum. On the other hand, he noted that Joe Lubin and SharpLink Gaming’s move is bigger. SharpLink is already staking its ETH holdings and plans to explore other DeFi strategies. With this move, the crypto commentator declared that ETH becomes the reserve while yielding bankroll growth. Lubin also recently raised the possibility of adding leverage to SharpLink Gaming’s Ethereum strategy, which will mirror Saylor’s strategy. He stated that they may do convertible equity and issue bonds at low rates, without putting the strategy at risk. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,444, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-02T15:54:24,"Outset PR Finds 82% of Crypto Media Lost Traffic as MiCA Took Hold in Western Europe, Italy and Spain Hit Hardest","Four fifths of crypto media outlets across Western Europe lost traffic in Q1 2025. This single statistic defines the quarter — and reshapes how crypto information reaches users across the continent. According to Outset PR’s newly released report — building on their earlier Q1 analysis of crypto media declines in LATAM — the same downward trend played out in Western Europe between January and March, revealing a sharp contradiction: growing public interest in crypto, but shrinking media visibility. The report tracked 133 Western European outlets, of which 87 were crypto-focused, using SimilarWeb and Ahrefs to measure traffic and search visibility. A clear majority of crypto-only sites saw audience declines — driven by the combined effects of MiCA-aligned regulatory pressure, Google’s March algorithm update, and shifting search behaviors tied to market volatility. As the EU’s first comprehensive crypto framework, MiCA began reshaping media visibility by forcing outlets to rethink compliance, language, and even tone — well before full enforcement kicked in. During the aforementioned timeframe, traffic across crypto-native media dropped from 26.57 million to 22.22 million visits, a decline of more than 16%. To understand the full weight of that 82%, it needs to be broken down by region, language, and outlet structure to see who survived, who collapsed, and why. Western Europe crypto media performance: data sourced from Outset PR Where the Declines Were Sharpest: Regional Breakdown Outset PR tracks MiCA’s varied impact on crypto media across Western European countries Based on Outset PR’s findings, the hardest-hit countries were Italy and Spain, with both seeing over 70% of tracked crypto outlets lose visibility in Q1. In Italy, this decline was especially striking given that it leads the region in crypto interest — 37% of the population expresses active engagement. The downturn was largely driven by regulatory scrutiny from CONSOB, which targeted influencer-led content and investment-style messaging. Top Italian outlets lost nearly half their traffic. Only Borsainside maintained consistent growth, ending the quarter up 15.96%. In Spain, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV) began enforcing strict advertising guidelines, which led to a significant reduction in ad-supported content and discoverability. Although Bit2Me News surged 149.4% in March — making it one of the top performers across the region — most other Spanish-language outlets ended the quarter with traffic in decline. Germany: Europe’s Largest Crypto Language Market Still Struggled German-speaking outlets made up nearly 40% of the crypto-native platforms reviewed in Outset PR’s dataset. Despite this dominant share, the German market faced significant visibility challenges in Q1. In February, the financial regulator BaFin issued new guidance that warned against any investment-like promotion from unlicensed parties — including media platforms. Amid these developments, outlets like Coin-Update, Krypto Magazin, and BitcoinBlog.de saw sharp traffic declines. Although a few sites posted gains in March, more than half of the region’s crypto-focused German-language publishers continued trending downward at quarter’s end. A key exception was CoinJournal DE, which grew 23.90% in Q1. Backed by Investoo Group, the outlet benefited from shared SEO expertise, multilingual publishing capabilities, and regulatory infrastructure. These elements allowed it to navigate algorithmic changes and new content standards more effectively than independent competitors. France: Transparent Labels Became the Differentiator In France, regulatory enforcement from the AMF focused on transparency rather than restrictions, prompting algorithmic suppression of outlets that failed to properly label promotions or disclose financial risks. By February, 72% of French-language crypto platforms had lost traffic. Some sites like The Blog saw their visibility collapse almost entirely. Others, such as Blockchain France and InvestX, rebounded by March, likely due to cleaner disclaimer practices, improved metadata, and expansion into multilingual publishing. The divide in outcomes highlights the start of a more polarized crypto media environment in France, where clarity and compliance are now essential for sustainable reach. Dutch-Language Media Faced Algorithmic Whiplash Outlets serving readers in the Netherlands and Belgium faced no direct media restrictions from regulators during Q1. However, their heavy reliance on SEO and Google visibility made them especially vulnerable to algorithmic shifts. Outset PR’s report also shows that in February, 76% of Dutch-speaking crypto outlets reported traffic losses. High-profile names like Bitcoin Magazine NL fell 36.78%, while Bitcoinspot.nl dropped 39.30%. A few properties — such as Beste Bank and Coinmarketcap.nl —bounced back in March, thanks to stronger content quality and diversified link-building strategies. Still, most Dutch-language outlets were unable to regain their January positions, demonstrating the inherent risk of traffic models built almost entirely around search visibility. UK Outlets Felt the Ripple Effects of Domestic Policy Although the United Kingdom is not bound by MiCA, local regulation had a comparable impact. In early January, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) expanded its financial promotions regime to include crypto. This contributed to widespread visibility losses for UK-facing outlets, especially those featuring unverified affiliate offers or poorly labeled advertorials. Most UK crypto-native platforms saw traffic decline across the quarter. Only The Market Periodical and MyCryptoSpaceUK posted quarterly gains, though both averaged well below 100K monthly visits. Meanwhile, Cryptouk.io and Bitcourier continued trending downward, underscoring that even outside of MiCA, enforcement and algorithm shifts are reshaping how crypto media operates in the UK. No UK-based outlet crossed the 500K monthly visit threshold, suggesting that while regulation played a role, overall readership remained modest compared to Germany, France, or the Netherlands. Tiered Media Analysis: Who Still Commands Reach? Outset PR’s analysis revealed that traffic is concentrated among a small group of top-tier publishers. Just seven outlets surpassed 1 million monthly visits, together accounting for 60.26% of the region’s total crypto-native traffic. A mid-tier of six outlets generated between 500K and 900K monthly visits, accounting for another 18% of total visibility. Beyond these two groups, 58 outlets attracted fewer than 100K monthly visits each, combining for only 6.24% of the total audience. While 16 outlets did post traffic increases during Q1, most of them grew by percentage, not by reach. Only Newsbit.de combined high growth with consistently strong reach above the 1 million mark. Mainstream Finance Media Outperformed Crypto-Native Outlets In contrast to crypto-specific sites, generalist finance, tech, and economic publications proved far more resilient. Outset PR tracked 46 such platforms in Western Europe, and 25 of them posted quarterly growth. Together, they generated over 106 million visits, dwarfing the 22 million visits recorded by crypto-only sites. These outlets benefited from strong domain authority, broader editorial scopes, and less reliance on price-based speculation content. Outset PR notes that finance-first platforms have become vital for crypto PR efforts — especially in a MiCA-enforced environment where credibility and compliance now define reach. Google Discover Favors Structured, Compliant Media As Outset PR notes, the battle for traffic in Q1 extended beyond search rankings — into Google Discover, where surfacing now reflects a site’s editorial structure and legal hygiene. Only 22.99% of crypto-native outlets maintained consistent presence in Google Discover in Q1 2025. By comparison, 32.61% of non-crypto-native outlets appeared consistently in Discover. Nine of these sites surpassed 1 million monthly visits, confirming the importance of technical compliance and editorial credibility in Google's evolving news ecosystem. Outset PR’s report makes one thing clear: the traffic drop experienced by crypto-covering media outlets in Western Europe during Q1 2025 was a structural reset. Regulation, platform policies, and evolving search engine standards have raised the bar for visibility, and many crypto publishers found themselves unprepared for the new terrain. In this cycle, survival hinges on multilingual reach, legal clarity, and editorial agility. SEO depth, risk disclaimers, and compliance-ready publishing aren’t just best practices — they’re the price of admission. As the standout data-driven agency with a boutique approach to crypto communications, Outset PR emphasizes the importance of tailoring media planning to business goals, market dynamics, and regional nuances.

2025-07-02T15:41:09,"Bitcoin Price Prediction Experts Now Tracking Bitcoin Solaris: The ‘Next Bitcoin’ Set to Outperform Original 100x","There was a time when buying Bitcoin felt like buying magic internet money. Fast forward to today, and it’s a full-blown global asset. Price predictions for Bitcoin are already climbing toward the $127,000 mark, with analysts forecasting an 18 percent climb. But something surprising is happening in parallel. Those same experts are now tracking a lesser-known token that is igniting early-buyer excitement all over again: Bitcoin Solaris. While Bitcoin moves like a freight train, Bitcoin Solaris is more like a rocket on standby. Bitcoin Still Leads, But It’s Slowing Down Bitcoin remains the king. No dispute there. Its scarcity and security make it the foundation of the crypto market. But innovation isn’t its strongest suit. Its TPS hovers under 10, smart contracts are clunky, and forget about mobile mining. It’s digital gold, yes. But it’s not designed for the mobile-first, app-powered economy we live in now. The Bitcoin Solaris Difference Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just another altcoin chasing Bitcoin’s shadow. It’s designed to go further and faster by solving the limitations that have long held back Bitcoin. From the ground up, Bitcoin Solaris reimagines what Bitcoin could look like if it launched in today’s world. Forget the Old Playbook BTC-S Wrote a New One Its core breakthroughs include: A dual-consensus model combining Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake Validator rotation for decentralization and security Smart contracts that support DeFi, enterprise, and real-world integrations A blazing fast dual-layer architecture that reaches over 10,000 transactions per second Energy efficiency at scale, using 99.95 percent less energy than traditional mining models These aren’t small upgrades. They’re seismic shifts. Mobile Mining: Power in Your Pocket At the heart of the Bitcoin Solaris experience is the upcoming Solaris Nova app. This isn’t some theoretical interface. It’s a real mobile-first infrastructure built to make mining accessible to anyone with a smartphone. The mining calculator available here shows just how powerful the rewards can be. Users don’t need bulky hardware or deep technical know-how. All it takes is a phone and a few taps, and suddenly they’re participating in a decentralized economy with real income potential. Analysts, Investors, and Influencers All Locked In Crypto influencers and market analysts aren’t sitting this one out. A growing number are zooming in on Bitcoin Solaris and its explosive upside. One of the most comprehensive reviews comes from Token Empire , who covered the unique features, performance, and the overall buzz around BTC-S. The takeaway? This isn’t a flash-in-the-pan token. It’s built to scale, adapt, and possibly surpass expectations, the way early Bitcoin once did. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini games for its holders for a chance to earn daily rewards, checkout all the details here. Real Rewards. Real Ecosystem. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t offering just theoretical benefits. Its reward distribution system is designed for long-term sustainability and fairness. Miners, validators, and contributors are all part of an ecosystem that respects both time and effort. Here’s how it works: Rewards are distributed across both consensus layers Time-weighted calculations ensure long-term participants earn more High-performing devices yield higher returns Contribution scores are factored in to prioritize active participation The design doesn’t just reward activity. It rewards loyalty. Presale Momentum: The Window is Closing The Bitcoin Solaris presale is heating up fast. Currently in Phase 10 at $10, it’s preparing to jump to $11 very soon. With a final launch price of $20, early participants stand to gain up to 150 percent just by entering before July 31. More than 13,650 users have already joined, raising over 6 million dollars. It’s being described by many as one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. Less than 5 weeks left to enter Over 11,000 users already on board Dubbed the shortest presale in crypto history To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask for seamless delivery. Security and Trust Already in Place Trust in the crypto world comes with proof. Bitcoin Solaris has already been audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , two of the most respected audit firms in the space. And community growth continues through its Telegram and X pages: Telegram X Investors are not just betting on hype. They’re betting on verified infrastructure. Final Verdict: The Next Bitcoin Might Already Be Here Bitcoin Solaris is not trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s extending its value with speed, utility, and accessibility that Bitcoin can no longer achieve. If you missed out on buying Bitcoin at $100, this might be your second chance. Analysts certainly think so, and judging by the presale momentum, thousands of early adopters agree. The door is open. The question is: Are you stepping through it?

This publicly listed Japanese firm, known for its bold pivot into BTC investments , reported a significant revenue increase, highlighting a growing trend of corporate embrace of digital assets. What does this remarkable performance mean for the future of institutional adoption and the broader crypto market? Metaplanet Bitcoin: A Strategic Pivot in Japan In an era where traditional finance grapples with inflation and economic uncertainties, companies are seeking innovative ways to preserve and grow capital. Metaplanet Bitcoin stands out as a prime example of this strategic evolution. Formerly a traditional financial services firm, Metaplanet made headlines when it announced a significant shift in its treasury strategy, opting to convert substantial portions of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. This move, echoing strategies employed by global pioneers like MicroStrategy, positioned Metaplanet as a leading Japanese Crypto Firm committed to leveraging Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. The decision was rooted in a deep understanding of macroeconomic pressures, particularly the weakening Japanese Yen and the global inflationary environment. By embracing Institutional BTC Adoption , Metaplanet aimed to protect its balance sheet from currency devaluation while capitalizing on Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation. Their initial significant acquisitions set the stage for what has now become a testament to their foresight. Decoding Metaplanet’s Impressive Bitcoin Revenue The latest official announcement from Metaplanet reveals a compelling success story. For the second quarter of the year, the company reported a staggering revenue of 1,097.25 million yen, equivalent to approximately $7.57 million in Bitcoin Revenue . This figure represents a robust 42.4% increase compared to their first-quarter performance, signaling accelerated growth and profitability stemming directly from their digital asset strategy. As of June 30, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings reached an impressive 13,350 BTC. This substantial accumulation underscores their unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The revenue reported is primarily attributed to the appreciation of their Bitcoin holdings during the second quarter, demonstrating the tangible financial benefits that can accrue from well-timed and strategic BTC investments . This growth trajectory highlights Bitcoin’s increasing viability as a corporate treasury solution, moving beyond speculative trading to become a recognized asset class for balance sheet management. The Growing Wave of Institutional BTC Adoption in Japan Metaplanet’s success is not an isolated incident but rather a significant indicator of a broader shift towards Institutional BTC Adoption within Japan and across Asia. For years, Japan has been a key player in the cryptocurrency space, with a progressive regulatory framework that has fostered innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Metaplanet’s public commitment and now demonstrated financial success could serve as a powerful catalyst for other Japanese Crypto Firm s and corporations to explore similar strategies. The benefits of such adoption are manifold: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin offers a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies, providing a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Asset Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term appreciation, offering potential capital gains for corporate treasuries. Strategic Diversification: Including Bitcoin diversifies a company’s asset portfolio, reducing reliance on traditional assets and market cycles. Technological Edge: Embracing digital assets positions companies at the forefront of financial innovation, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges, including market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and the need for robust security infrastructure to manage significant BTC investments . What Do Metaplanet’s Q2 Earnings Mean for the Future? The strong Q2 Earnings Crypto report from Metaplanet provides valuable insights into the potential trajectory of corporate Bitcoin strategies. This success story is likely to embolden Metaplanet to continue its accumulation strategy, potentially increasing its Bitcoin holdings further in anticipation of future market appreciation. It also sends a clear message to other corporations contemplating similar moves: Bitcoin can indeed be a powerful tool for financial growth and stability when managed strategically. Looking ahead, Metaplanet’s performance could ignite a ripple effect across the Japanese corporate landscape. As more companies witness the tangible benefits of Bitcoin Revenue generated through strategic digital asset holdings, the pace of institutional adoption is expected to accelerate. This will not only strengthen Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class but also foster a more robust and mature crypto ecosystem globally. Global Implications of Strong Crypto Earnings Japan The impressive Q2 Earnings Crypto from a prominent Japanese Crypto Firm like Metaplanet resonates far beyond Japan’s borders. It reinforces the global narrative that Bitcoin is maturing into a viable, long-term asset for corporate treasuries. While MicroStrategy has long been the poster child for corporate Bitcoin adoption in the West, Metaplanet’s emergence as a significant player in Asia adds a crucial dimension to this trend. This success could inspire more publicly traded companies worldwide to consider Bitcoin as part of their balance sheet strategy. It validates the premise that holding Bitcoin can be a significant driver of shareholder value, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. The consistent reporting of positive Bitcoin Revenue by such firms strengthens the case for Bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset, paving the way for broader acceptance and integration into traditional financial systems. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Vision Pays Off Metaplanet’s second-quarter financial results are more than just numbers; they represent a significant milestone in the journey of institutional Bitcoin adoption. With a remarkable 42.4% increase in revenue, primarily driven by their BTC investments , Metaplanet has showcased the immense potential of integrating digital assets into corporate treasury strategies. Their commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and growth asset positions them as a vanguard among Japanese Crypto Firm s and a model for global corporations considering a similar strategic pivot. This success story reinforces Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its pivotal role in shaping the future of finance, signaling a robust outlook for continued Institutional BTC Adoption worldwide.

2025-07-02T15:30:07,"Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Surge Past 3 Million BTC As Treasury Firms Multiply–Report","Bitcoin’s role on company balance sheets is growing fast. According to a report , 199 entities now hold 3 million BTC, worth about $315 billion. That total has more than doubled since the start of 2024. It marks a clear shift in how big firms view crypto, not just as a trading asset but as a long‑term treasury play. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Surge Among those 199 entities, 147 public and private companies account for 1.1 million BTC (around $115 billion). Strategy, the pioneer in this space, holds 580,250 BTC—about $60 billion—and trades at a market cap of $104 billion. That gives it a Multiple on Net Asset Value (MNAV) of 1.7× today. Investors once paid up to 2× NAV for Strategy’s shares, reflecting confidence in its ability to grow BTC‑per‑share faster than anyone else. Valuing Pure Play Treasury Firms When a firm’s main business is holding Bitcoin , its shares need to outperform Bitcoin itself. That premium, known as MNAV, depends on faith in management and clear execution plans. Strategy has used three main tools since 2020: issuing convertible debt, running an At‑the‑Market stock program, and plowing free cash flow into spot Bitcoin. New rivals are copying and tweaking this playbook—letting holders swap coins for stock, buying underpriced firms to turn cash into BTC, and even adding private deals to raise funds. Debt Risks Loom Large An extended bear market could test these models. If Bitcoin falls and shares trade at or below NAV, debt‑heavy firms might struggle to refinance when notes come due. That could force them to sell Bitcoin into a downtrend, pushing prices lower. Smaller companies without Strategy’s scale will face higher borrowing costs and tougher terms. During a recession, margin calls and forced sales may cascade throughout the market, although most of these companies use equity financing mainly. Wider Industry Influence From September 2021, as soon as El Salvador legitimized BTC as legal tender, corporate demand grew. BlackRock’s launch of IBIT ETF in January 2024 further fueled it, and US President Donald Trump has talked about the economic function of Bitcoin. Now, new players from Japan’s Metaplanet to US‑based GameStop are rolling out treasury plans. Purpose‑built firms like Twenty One Capital and reverse‑merger entrants such as Strive and Nakamoto have staked their futures on Bitcoin. More Companies To Enter The Market? Experts expect more crypto treasury companies to emerge—covering assets like Solana and Ethereum as well. Early names include DeFi Development Corp with 420,000 SOL and SharpLink Gaming, which raised $425 million for ETH holdings. Many will fail, and the strongest will buy up weaker rivals. Thankfully, most rely on stock‑based financing, so a few collapses won’t topple the whole market. But those loaded with debt could still pose a wider threat.

2025-07-02T15:26:34,"Scaramucci Says Bitcoin Treasury Trend Will Fade Despite Saylor’s Success","Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, says the wave of companies adopting a bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy is just a passing trend. In an interview with Bloomberg, Scaramucci said he expects the approach to lose momentum in the coming months. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea,” Scaramucci said. “So, you know, it will fade.” He implied that investors may start to wonder why they’re paying extra for a company to hold an asset they could simply buy themselves. The idea of using bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset gained traction in 2021, when Strategy (MSTR), a software developer led by Michael Saylor, became the first major public company to do so. Saylor’s aggressive bitcoin purchases turned Strategy into a de facto bitcoin investment vehicle, sending its stock price soaring nearly 3,000% since then. The massive gains drew attention across corporate America and elsewhere. A number of companies followed Strategy’s lead, including medical device maker Semler Scientific (SMLR), which announced its own bitcoin treasury strategy in May 2024, and Tokyo-based Metaplanet (3350), which started out as a hotel management company. The trend hasn’t been limited to high-profile firms. Smaller companies, often penny-stocks, also jumped in, trying to raise capital or attract investor interest by adding bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets. What began as a focus on bitcoin soon expanded to other digital assets. Some companies opted to purchase ether (ETH) or XRP (XRP) as part of their treasury strategy, pushing the concept beyond its original scope. Scaramucci acknowledged that Saylor’s success is unique, pointing to the company’s other business lines beyond bitcoin holdings. “Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now,” Scaramucci said in the interview with Bloomberg. “I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/02/scaramucci-says-bitcoin-treasury-trend-will-fade-despite-saylor-s-success,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP","Finance|Anthony Scaramucci|Digital Asset Treasury|News",cryptocompare

Over the past 18 months, IBIT has consistently attracted new capital and now makes up over half of all Bitcoin ETF assets .

2025-07-02T15:24:55,"MARA Holdings: Levered To Post-Halving Bitcoin Cycle","Summary We initiate coverage on MARA Holdings with a Strong Buy and $44 price target, citing unmatched operational leverage to Bitcoin’s next cycle and cost leadership. Our thesis is built on above-consensus revenue forecasts, driven by a 60 EH/s hash-rate ramp, low $0.04/kWh energy costs, and robust treasury BTC optionality. Valuation is compelling: MARA trades at a deep discount to historical and peer multiples, with 180% upside justified by macro tailwinds and post-halving expansion. Key risks include Bitcoin price volatility, regulatory headwinds, and potential dilution, but we see the risk/reward as highly favorable at current levels. Levered to the Next Crypto Cycle We initiate with a Strong Buy/$44 PT. MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA ) operates one of the world’s most advanced vertically integrated Bitcoin mining platforms, leveraging proprietary technology and low-cost energy infrastructure to deliver digital assets at scale via the US. Beneath the volatile exterior, MARA occupies a sweet spot of structural and cyclical drivers for a step-change in miner economics. More than 100k BTC cleared in the second quarter of 2025 began to reset base-case assumptions, yet consensus underwrites sub-80k BTC and underestimates the length and magnitude of post-halving multiple expansion. We see $1.36 billion in FY 2025E revenue (up 107% y/y, 43% above the Street) as energized Ohio/Texas wind assets, along with forthcoming flare-gas sites, deliver 60 EH/s of hash rate to keep network share elevated despite global difficulty hikes. Embedded in our base case is a self-inflicted above-consensus BTC price path of $105 k/$130 k FY 2025E/FY 2026E annual averages, already realized in spot markets and amplified by MARA’s ops edge: $0.04/kWh energy costs and superior fee per transaction capture, driving 12% outperformance in BTC-denominated revenue. Our valuation embeds a blended FY 2026E P/S of 10.5x, balancing against downside the visibility of its treasury assets and factoring in the concentrated potency of macro tailwinds: (i) a window to imminent Fed easing, (ii) record spot ETF inflows and (iii) the historic miner inflection 12–18 months post-halving. Regulatory overhang and bouts of network hash growth present headline risk to our thesis, but cost structures and balance sheet optionality leave more than enough margin for error. At 180% upside to our PT and trading up short of its historical median multiple, we see R/R as simply too skewed. Maximizing Miner Economics Marathon Digital Holdings exemplifies scale-driven cost leadership in BTC mining. Energized hash rate grew 95% y/y to 54.3 EH/s, capturing over 2x network share, driven by vertical integration and diversified energy inputs with 139 MW of self-generated wind, flare-gas, and data center power. Electric cost per BTC is now $35,728, and Marathon has delivered record 4 quarter-over-quarter hash-cost improvements. The blend of BtM wind and off-grid gas should lower all-in power costs to $10/MW for key ARPs, a breakpoint few peers can reach. This configuration supports an IRR of 30–40% under muted hash-price assumptions. As investors toggle between exahash headlines and transient efficiency gains, Marathon’s scale-plus-cost flywheel stands out as a sustainable platform—combining energized capacity, asset flexibility, power origination optionality, and proprietary ASIC integration—to preserve sector-leading share through mining-cycle volatility. Q1 Earnings Presentation Treasury Arbitrage Strategy embedded optionality. Fundamentally, we think the market has mispriced the strategic merit of MARA’s BTC on balance sheet, both in current balance sheet positioning and in embedded optionality. The 49,375 BTC on treasury ($5.42bn equivalent) offers investors direct participation in digital asset appreciation while buying an operating platform that can generate $852mn of annualized BTC back into the treasury at current network economics. Such a magnitude of treasury represents a uniquely powerful downside hedge versus global mining peers, allowing valuation capital preservation through deep crypto drawdowns and giving management optionality to monetize at cycle highs or deploy collateral opportunistically. Trading at $16.52, implied per-share BTC value stands at $15.41/share, providing the operating business just above $1/share after adjusting for net cash and PP&E. The disconnect continues to widen as MARA’s proven BTC accumulation cadence (950 BTC in a single month, or $104.5mn at $110,000 spot) captures robust upside and offers a meaningful premium to direct mining costs on the books. We believe consensus underappreciates the downside compounding and the asymmetry of MARA’s treasury, which ultimately provides shareholders a volatility buffer and an asymmetric payoff should direct adoption and institutional allocation run further. Case scenarios illustrate that the BTC is over-collateralizing the equity to such a degree that it meaningfully caps downside. We view MARA trading as a rare hybrid asset in which meaningful core value effectively underwrites investor participation in the next mining-led BTC upcycle. Q1 Earnings Presentation Materially Above-Consensus Revenue Outlook We model MARA’s FY 2025E and FY 2026E crypto revenues at $1.36bn (107% y/y) and $1.44bn, respectively, vs. the Street consensus of $948mn, placing us 43% and 32% above the Street based on structural tailwinds we believe the Street underappreciates: 1) Ambitious hash rate ramp to 60 EH/s as Ohio, TX wind and other flare-gas sites fully energize, positioning MARA for sustained 5% network share as difficulty resumes a persistent upward trend; 2) Explicit BTC pricing assumptions of $105k in FY 2025E and $130k in FY 2026E vs. consensus sub-$80k, already clearing $100k in the second quarter of 2025; 3) Proportional transaction-fee capture via MARA pool’s >10% outperformance vs. network average and 100% fee retention, translating to 12% higher BTC-denominated revenues. Source: FMP FY 2025 FY 2026 Estimate # Analysts Estimate # Analysts Revenue $948.02M 9 $1.09B 13 EBITDA $13.85M 9 $15.87M 13 Net Income $-656.60M 9 $-358.66M 13 EPS $-2.11 2 $-0.96 6 SG&A Expenses $535.42M 9 $613.52M 13 Most importantly, we annualize a first quarter 2025 run rate already partially baked in by the Street and layer on unfolding AI/2PIC monetization missing from the Street models. We acknowledge risk of sharp network hash rate acceleration beyond guidance or, less likely, regulatory change, but with visibility into energized capacity, a unique cost profile via $10/MWh ARP sites, and institutional BTC demand, we see the Street as significantly too conservative. Valuation Our $44 PT for MARA is based on a FY 2026E P/S multiple of 10.5x applied to our above-consensus revenue forecast of $1.44bn, yielding an implied 180% upside. The premium multiple is fully justified by outsized revenue growth acceleration powered by a ramped-up 60 EH/s hash-rate and a low $0.04/kWh power edge, plus Bitcoin treasury visibility that effectively limits downside. Company Data, FMP, Moretus Research Our 10.5x multiple aligns with the company’s historical median and stands to benefit from macro tailwinds of Federal Reserve easing and surging institutional ETF flows, which could prime post-halving multiple expansion. MARA trades at 7.7x P/S, below its historical norm (27th percentile) and below peer multiples (5.8x P/S; 17th percentile), despite margin resiliency and a market-leading +5.9% year-over-year revenue growth into FY 2026E. We believe Street assumptions on Bitcoin price and network share are overly conservative, and MARA warrants re-rating for its operational leverage. Risks to Our Strong Buy Thesis Our bullish thesis on Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) is supported by favorable capacity growth, low-cost operations, and a structurally higher post-halving Bitcoin price deck. Key risks include MARA’s operational and valuation leverage to Bitcoin’s price: a sustained pullback below $90,000 or an acceleration in network-wide difficulty could compress margins and force operational retrenchment, given energy costs could rise to $70K per Bitcoin if difficulty increases or electricity prices exceed model assumptions. Regulatory uncertainty poses another risk: state and federal energy restrictions, new environmental mandates, or regional off-grid mining clampdowns could raise compliance costs or force site curtailments, threatening hash-rate growth and undermining our above-consensus FY 2025E–FY 2026E estimates. Finally, MARA’s strategic use of ATM equity issuance could result in dilution and dampen our anticipated multiple re-rating if the Bitcoin market softens or policy risks intensify. Investors should monitor Bitcoin network hash-rate, MARA’s realized electricity costs, and state and federal regulatory developments as potential downside triggers. Conclusion We reiterate our Strong Buy on Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. based on MARA's peer-best operational leverage to BTC's next cycle and differentiated cost structure leading to best-in-class risk-adjusted return in the public minter space. Consensus fundamentally underestimates the scale of MARA's hash-rate ramp and true macro tailwinds (institution ETF flows and post-halving multiple expansion) offering a clear path for outsized revenue / multiple re-rating, in our view. Investors should look through the short-term FOMO cycle and simply focus on execution against energized capacity, accumulating now as multiples are structurally depressed despite structural catalysts remaining fully intact.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798897-marathon-digital-levered-to-post-halving-bitcoin-cycle?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|MINING","MARA",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T15:13:40,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Showing Signs Of Exhaustion After Failing To Clear Key Resistance Zone","Bitcoin (BTC) buyers are showing signs of exhaustion after failing to cross the resistance zone between $108,000 and $108,350. The flagship cryptocurrency risks dropping below $105,000 due to a developing bearish divergence, declining volumes, and repeated failures to push past resistance levels. BTC is up nearly 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $107,455. Senate Passes Big Beautiful Bill With No Exemption For Bitcoin The United States Senate passed President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill by a razor-thin margin after hours of heated negotiations. However, the bill brought little cheer to the crypto industry as it failed to include key crypto-related tax amendments that would have benefited the industry. Pro-crypto senators raced to include an amendment containing numerous tax benefits for crypto stakers and miners, retail digital asset users, and businesses holding crypto stockpiles. The over 1,000-page bill did not mention “digital assets,” “Bitcoin,” “Ethereum,” “crypto,” “web3,” or “blockchain” anywhere, despite efforts by pro-crypto senators to include tax breaks for the industry. Cynthia Lummis, vocal pro-crypto advocate, argued for changing the tax code for crypto mining and staking. Lummis argued that miners and stakers were being taxed twice, once when they received block rewards and again when selling their assets. “For years, miners and stakers have been taxed TWICE. Once when they receive block rewards, and again when they sell it. It’s time to stop this unfair tax treatment and ensure America is the world’s Bitcoin and Crypto Superpower.” Crypto Steady As Bitcoin (BTC) Drops To $105,000 The crypto market remained steady, registering only a marginal decline despite Bitcoin (BTC) dropping to a low of $105,328 on Tuesday. The crypto Fear & Greed Index registered a “Greed” score of 63 out of 100 on Wednesday, one point lower than Tuesday. Analysts speculate Bitcoin could retest its all-time high of $111,970, with optimism high on Monday when the price soared to an intraday high of $108,794 before losing momentum. The analysts also noted that Bitcoin is heading into its third quarter, typically a weak phase for the flagship cryptocurrency. Crypto trader Dann Crypto stated, “From the historical data, this quarter is generally the slowest out of all, for both $BTC and $ETH.” Bitcoin has averaged a gain of 5.47% during the third quarter each year since 2013. If the trend holds, it places BTC around $110,000 on Sept 30, just shy of its all-time high. According to Dann, weaker performances during the third quarter are likely due to slower summer months when volume and liquidity are generally lower. More Institutions Add Bitcoin (BTC) To Holdings Deutsche Bank is venturing deeper into the crypto space. The bank has partnered with Bitpanda and Taurus and plans to launch a full crypto custody service by 2026. The partnership will also focus on tokenized payments and a stablecoin. “NOW: Deutsche Bank to launch its #crypto custody service in 2026, marking a major leap into digital assets by one of Europe’s biggest banks.” Meanwhile, the Smarter Web Company, a UK-based web design and marketing firm, is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy. The firm announced the acquisition of 230.05 BTC , valued at $24.7 million. The company made the purchase at an average price of $107,126 per coin. The latest acquisition takes the company’s total Bitcoin stash to 773.58 BTC , disclosed in a Tuesday filing by the company. The firm has invested over $82 million in Bitcoin and possesses one of the biggest Bitcoin treasuries of a listed firm in the UK. Meanwhile, Belgravia Hartford Capital Inc. also completed its latest Bitcoin purchase as part of its long-term Bitcoin Treasury Reserve strategy. The firm acquired 9.35 BTC for $1 million, at an average price of $106,918 per coin. The latest purchase increases tits total holdings to 15.746 BTC . Genius Group Limited, a leading AI-powered, Bitcoin-first education group, also announced a Bitcoin purchase, increasing its holdings by 20% to 120 BTC . Genius Group is accelerating its Bitcoin acquisition strategy with more frequent purchases. The most recent purchase has doubled the size of its Bitcoin treasury since May 22, when a Preliminary Injunction preventing it from buying Bitcoin was stayed by the US Court of Appeals. Genius Group has reiterated its target of increasing its treasury to 1,000 BTC in the next six months. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a strong recovery during the ongoing session, bouncing from Tuesday’s low of $105,328. The flagship cryptocurrency ended the weekend positively, rising almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,360. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,167. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC slipped below $106,000 before rebounding to current levels. Price action remains sluggish, and analysts have pointed out that Bitcoin realized profits for long-term holders remain significantly lower. According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, BTC must reach $140,000 to give long-term holders profits comparable to 2024. The flagship cryptocurrency has registered a jump in profit-taking as it struggles to maintain its positive price action. According to CryptoQuant, long-term holders have contributed to a substantial chunk of the ongoing selling pressure. The platform compared current realized profits with earlier bull market peaks, finding out that long-term holders are not “as deep in the black” as before. According to CryptoQuant contributor Darkfrost, the average realized profit based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio currently sits at 220%. According to Darkfrost, the price at which long-term holders' unrealized profits will match 2024 levels acts as a market magnet. “Although these profits may seem substantial, we’re still far from the levels observed during the tops of this cycle. To return to those profit levels, BTC would need to reach $140,000. A price level that many are calling for.” The flagship cryptocurrency showed signs of exhaustion after crossing $108,000 on Monday and was rejected from the resistance zone. The resistance sits between $108,000 and $108,300, aligning with the upper level of the current trading range. BTC attempted to push higher, but remained pinned below this level. Analysts suggest the rally is losing momentum, with a bearish divergence forming. If sellers retain control, it could trigger a drop to $100,000.

2025-07-02T15:12:49,"Defi Dev Hikes Convertible Note Offering to $112M for Buyback, More SOL Purchase","Defi Development Corp (DFDV), a Nasdaq-listed firm with a crypto treasury strategy focused on Solana SOL, said on Wednesday it is issuing $112.5 million in convertible notes to raise capital for a stock buyback program and more SOL purchases. The notes offering, which was upsized from $100 million, will mature in 2030 with a 5.5% annual rate and offer investors the right to convert debt into equity at $23.11 per share, roughly a 10% premium on Monday’s closing price. Investors also have an option to buy $25 million more of the notes in this round, expected to close on July 7. DFDV shares traded 12% down in the early Wednesday session. That's more than 60% lower than the May peak, but the firm's crypto pivot has pushed it around 3,500%. The firm aims to use $75 million of the proceeds for a prepaid forward stock purchase transaction that's being negotiated with one of the initial investors in convertible notes, according to the press release. This facility would allow the investor to hedge the convertible note position through derivative trades and short sales, the firm said. The remainder of the capital would go to general corporate use, including the acquisition of more SOL tokens. Defi Dev, formerly known as real estate tech platform Janover, is part of a growing roster of publicly-traded firms raising funds by selling shares and debt to add cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet, following Strategy's playbook with bitcoin BTC. The company focuses on the Solana blockchain, operating validators and accumulating the network's native token. The latest fundraising round follows last month's $5 billion equity line of credit with RK Capital Management.

2025-07-02T15:10:34,"Euro Forecast: Urgent Warning as UBS Predicts Significant Decline Against European Peers","BitcoinWorld Euro Forecast: Urgent Warning as UBS Predicts Significant Decline Against European Peers For those deeply entrenched in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, understanding broader macroeconomic shifts is paramount. Just as Bitcoin’s trajectory is often influenced by global liquidity and interest rate decisions, traditional forex markets offer crucial insights into the health of major economies. A recent declaration from financial giant UBS has sent ripples through the currency landscape, particularly concerning the Euro forecast . After a period of unexpected strength, the common currency is now poised to lose significant ground against its European counterparts. What does this mean for global financial stability, and how might these shifts indirectly impact the crypto ecosystem? What’s Driving the Euro Forecast Downward After Its Recent Ascent? The recent rally of the Euro caught many by surprise, fueled by a combination of factors including a hawkish tilt from the European Central Bank (ECB) and a mild winter that eased energy crisis fears. However, financial analysts at UBS are now sounding a cautionary note, suggesting that this strength is likely fleeting. The core of their Euro forecast hinges on fundamental economic divergences that persist within Europe. While the Eurozone might have dodged a deep recession, its recovery path remains significantly more challenging compared to some of its neighbors. Inflation, though cooling, is still stubbornly high, and the path to sustainable growth is fraught with obstacles. Which European Currencies Are Poised to Gain? A Look at the Landscape When UBS talks about the Euro losing ground against ‘European peers,’ it’s not just speculative talk; it points to specific European currencies that are demonstrating more robust economic fundamentals or more aggressive monetary policy stances. Currencies like the Swiss Franc (CHF), the British Pound (GBP), and potentially even some Nordic currencies such as the Swedish Krona (SEK) or Norwegian Krone (NOK) are on their radar. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been proactive in tackling inflation, maintaining a strong Franc. The UK, despite its own economic challenges, has seen the Bank of England (BoE) adopt a more consistently hawkish tone than the ECB, providing support for the Pound. These relative strengths create a compelling case for capital reallocation away from the Euro. Decoding Current Forex Market Trends and Investor Sentiment The broader forex market trends are often a reflection of global risk appetite and interest rate differentials. Currently, there’s a nuanced interplay of factors at play. On one hand, receding fears of a global recession have encouraged a ‘risk-on’ sentiment, benefiting some growth-sensitive currencies. On the other hand, central bank policy divergence remains a dominant theme. Investors are closely scrutinizing inflation data and employment figures from various regions, seeking clues about future rate hikes. When a major institution like UBS issues a negative outlook on a currency as significant as the Euro, it can trigger a shift in sentiment, leading to repositioning by large institutional players and hedge funds. This creates momentum for the predicted depreciation. Diving Deeper into the UBS Currency Outlook The detailed UBS currency outlook goes beyond simple predictions; it’s rooted in a comprehensive analysis of economic indicators, monetary policy expectations, and geopolitical risks. UBS highlights several key areas of concern for the Euro: Monetary Policy Divergence: While the ECB has tightened, other central banks, particularly the SNB and BoE, may continue with more aggressive or sustained tightening cycles, making their currencies more attractive for yield-seeking investors. Growth Disparities: The Eurozone’s structural challenges, including an aging population and dependence on energy imports, could limit its long-term growth potential compared to more agile economies. Geopolitical Risks: The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and its ripple effects on energy markets continue to pose a disproportionate risk to the Eurozone’s stability and economic recovery. Relative Valuations: After its recent rally, the Euro might be considered overvalued against some of its peers, making it ripe for a correction. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the Eurozone Economy? The health of the Eurozone economy is intrinsically linked to the Euro’s strength. Despite avoiding a technical recession, the region faces formidable headwinds. High energy prices, even if they’ve stabilized, continue to weigh on industrial output and consumer purchasing power. Core inflation remains sticky, indicating that price pressures are broad-based and not just due to energy. Furthermore, the fragmented nature of the Eurozone, with varying fiscal capacities and debt levels among member states, presents a persistent challenge. Any renewed sovereign debt concerns or political instability within a key member state could quickly erode confidence in the common currency. The ECB’s delicate balancing act between taming inflation and avoiding a severe economic downturn adds another layer of complexity to the Euro’s prospects. Challenges and Risks to the UBS Forecast: Can the Euro Defy Expectations? While UBS’s analysis is robust, no forecast is without its risks. Several factors could potentially alter the trajectory of the Euro: Stronger-than-Expected Eurozone Growth: A significant uptick in economic activity, perhaps driven by a faster-than-anticipated recovery in global trade or a breakthrough in energy independence. More Aggressive ECB Tightening: If the ECB surprises markets with more substantial or prolonged interest rate hikes than currently anticipated. Global Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of extreme global uncertainty, the Euro, alongside the US Dollar and Japanese Yen, can sometimes act as a safe-haven, attracting flows. Easing Geopolitical Tensions: A significant de-escalation in the Ukraine conflict could boost confidence in the Eurozone and its currency. Actionable Insights for Investors and Market Participants: Navigating Currency Shifts For investors, particularly those with exposure to global assets, understanding these currency dynamics is crucial. Diversification: Consider diversifying portfolios across various strong European currencies beyond just the Euro, such as CHF and GBP. Hedging Strategies: Businesses with significant Eurozone exposure or those trading across European borders might explore currency hedging strategies to mitigate potential losses from Euro depreciation. Monitor Central Bank Commentary: Keep a close eye on statements from the ECB, SNB, and BoE for shifts in monetary policy outlooks. Economic Data Releases: Pay attention to key economic indicators from the Eurozone and its peers, including inflation, GDP, and employment figures, as these will directly influence currency movements. For crypto investors, while direct correlation is limited, a weaker Euro could signify broader economic weakness in a major bloc, potentially impacting global liquidity or risk appetite, which can, in turn, influence the crypto market. Conclusion: The Shifting Sands of European Currency Dynamics UBS’s recent Euro forecast serves as a stark reminder that even after a period of apparent strength, underlying economic fundamentals and policy divergences ultimately dictate currency trajectories. The anticipated decline of the Euro against its European currencies peers reflects a nuanced view of the global financial landscape, shaped by evolving forex market trends , the specific UBS currency outlook , and the inherent challenges facing the Eurozone economy . While the future is never certain, the insights provided by major financial institutions like UBS offer a valuable compass for navigating the complex currents of international finance. Staying informed about these macro shifts is not just for traditional investors; it’s a critical component for anyone looking to understand the broader forces influencing asset classes, including the dynamic world of digital currencies.

2025-07-02T14:55:42,"XRP Dominance Surges: Can Ripple Outshine Ethereum?","For over a decade, Bitcoin has reigned supreme as the cryptocurrency king, its dominance the benchmark of the entire industry. But as the year 2025 unfolds, there is now a new entrant in the scene: XRP. The digital currency, previously associated with Ripple's cross-border payment schemes, is now observing its share of the entire crypto market capitalization—its ”dominance”—growing at a pace not seen since its peak year of 2017. This is fueling a new wave of discussion: Is XRP's dominance temporary, or does it signal a fundamental change in the crypto landscape? What Is XRP Dominance and Why Does It Matter? XRP dominance refers to the proportion of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization owned by XRP. Though this sounds like just another data point, it's actually a very telling metric of investor attitude, capital shifting, and even the health of the broader altcoin universe. As XRP dominance rises, more capital is flowing into XRP than into other assets—typically at the expense of Ethereum. This can mean anything from growing faith in the technology of Ripple to a wholesale appetite for altcoins. The recent surge in XRP dominance has not gone unnoticed. Cointelegraph and other publications have stated that abrupt changes in XRP's market dominance have happened simultaneously with high-level liquidations of Bitcoin and other altcoins, suggesting that capital is indeed rotating into XRP as investors seek new frontiers. The Drivers Behind XRP's Dominance Surge What's fueling this new energy, then? The answer lies in the convergence of regulatory clarity, real-world adoption, and shifting trader psychology. Ripple's partial victories in its prolonged court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have removed a cloud of uncertainty hanging over XRP for years. With the danger of being ruled a security receding, institutional and retail investors alike are once again flocking to the asset, encouraged by the potential for further regulatory wins. Meanwhile, Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) offering is taking hold. Remittance companies and banks in Asia, Europe, and the Americas are discovering increasingly sophisticated applications for XRP to move money across borders in seconds, rather than days. Each new partnership or corridor opening is a vote of confidence in XRP use—and a potential catalyst for further price appreciation and market share gain. Meanwhile, as volatility fades and Bitcoin price consolidates, yield-hungry investors are moving into altcoins, with XRP often leading the charge. This kind of ”altcoin season” has been a standard characteristic of crypto cycles, but the extent of XRP's present dominance wave is generating particular attention. How XRP Dominance Affects the Market As XRP's dominance increases, the shockwaves permeate the entire crypto landscape. Bitcoin, crypocurrency safe haven, is seeing its leveraged positions de-levered as speculators take the momentum pursuit in XRP. This has triggered a cascade of liquidations with some analysts noting that for every percentage point XRP rises, it moves billions of dollars around the market. Altcoins are not immune either. A rising tide of XRP has the tendency to buoy other large-cap tokens, leading speculation that an even greater altcoin season exists. But it can also mean that capital is moving toward fewer assets and making smaller tokens compete for attention. Crypto market sentiment is unreliable, and the narrative on XRP is shifting. What was once a ”dead coin” to some investors is now in fashion as a come-back story—proof that regulatory clarity and use case continue to be important in a market that at times is hype-driven. Analyst Views Cryptocurrency analysts are still divided regarding what the increased dominance of XRP means: Bullish View : Others believe that Ripple's increasing partnerships and regulatory clarity could cement XRP as an institutional core holding, driving sustained supremacy. Skeptical View : Others take the view that dominance spikes tend to be fleeting, driven by trend following sentiment and news cycles, and that Bitcoin's first-mover remains unchallenged. What Investors Need to Monitor Next? For those watching the charts, the next few months will be telling. Will XRP's supremacy continue its upward march, or will the market revert to normal? Investors must keep a close eye on trading volume and on-chain activity, hoping to catch a glimpse of proof that fresh capital is entering XRP for the long haul—not just getting a speculative jump. Regulatory progress is also a wild card. A grand slam by Ripple in the courts, or some surprise partnership with an overseas bank, could shoot dominance higher still. But any setback or negative headline can trigger a sudden reversal as investors rush to take profits. It's not hard to remember that cycles of crypto dominance are ludicrously unpredictable. What climbs can crash equally as quickly. Dominance highs, especially those driven by speculative demand, usually lead to sudden corrections. And even though there has been regulatory clarity for XRP, circumstances could shift in a single night with one announcement or enforcement action. A New Chapter or a Familiar Cycle? XRP's growing dominance in 2025 is more than a technical metric—it's a gauge of shifting market mood, shifting regulation, and the ever-present battle for crypto supremacy. Whether this marks the beginning of something new or just another installment in crypto's rollercoaster saga remains to be witnessed. For now, XRP is basking in the spotlight, and the globe waits to see whether Ripple's wave is indeed powerful enough to overshadow Bitcoin in the next few months.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9782/xrp-dominance-surges-can-ripple-outshine-etherreum,"XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|BTC","News|Ripple",cryptocompare

Unlike existing spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs, which fall under different regulatory frameworks, SSK is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. That means a qualified custodian — not the fund issuer — is required to hold the underlying assets. Anchorage Digital, currently the only federally regulated bank authorized to both custody and stake digital assets, will fill that role. “Staking is the next chapter in the crypto ETF story,"" said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital, in a release. ""The launch of crypto staking ETFs marks a win for consumers and a significant step forward in full access to the crypto ecosystem."" The ETF gives investors indirect exposure to Solana while also participating in the blockchain’s staking mechanism, which provides additional yield by helping to secure the network. Staking allows holders of certain cryptocurrencies to earn rewards by locking their tokens into the network, a process that previously required technical know-how and direct interaction with crypto protocols. By packaging staking into an ETF structure, REX Shares and Osprey aim to make that process accessible to a wider range of investors through traditional brokerage accounts. SOL is higher by 2% over the past 24 hours to $150. The SSK launch comes as the crypto ETF market continues to evolve beyond bitcoin and ether, with issuers exploring new ways to bring blockchain-based products to regulated exchanges. The introduction of staking ETFs marks a new phase for the industry, combining income-generating features with exposure to digital assets, all within an SEC-regulated investment vehicle.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/02/first-u-s-crypto-staking-etf-begins-trading-with-anchorage-as-staking-partner,"SOL|BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC|TRADING","Markets|Anchorage Digital|Solana|News",cryptocompare
