The agreement uses an at-the-market (ATM) share issuance structure, allowing Green Minerals to raise funds flexibly over a 12-month period. Flexible Capital Structure to Minimize Dilution The deal includes a put option that lets Green Minerals issue new shares based on market conditions. This provides capital access when needed while helping maintain shareholder value and minimizing unnecessary stock dilution. Meanwhile, LDA Capital receives a call option, enabling it to subscribe for up to 1% of the company’s shares at NOK 6.95 each at any point over the next year. A Strategic Push Toward Bitcoin Accumulation At current market rates, if Green Minerals raises the full $25 million, it could acquire around 232.34 BTC. As of now, the company holds approximately four Bitcoins but aims to significantly expand this figure through targeted funding strategies. BTC is currently recovering, approaching the $107,000 mark with a recent high of $107,724. This aligns with Green Minerals’ bullish stance on Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Leadership Sees Bitcoin as Core to Growth Executive Chairman Ståle Rodahl called the LDA deal a “strategic mechanism to fund growth,” emphasizing the importance of flexibility and resilience in a volatile market. Earlier in June, the firm revealed its ambitious goal to raise $1.2 billion to invest in Bitcoin, a move it describes as part of its broader financial strategy to leverage digital assets for sustainable growth.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/green-minerals-secures-25m-deal-to-expand-bitcoin/,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|Blockchain",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T17:40:49,"Did Elon Musk Really Invest $104B in XRP? The Truth Unveiled","In the world of crypto, few names generate as much interest—or confusion—as Elon Musk. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Musk's Twitter posts have notoriously sent cryptocurrencies soaring or crashing, and his public musings about Bitcoin and Dogecoin are the stuff of legend. But in June of 2025, a new wave of speculation washed over the crypto space: that Musk would be investing a whopping $104 billion into Ripple's XRP. The news spread like wildfire, causing people to discuss it, causing prices to fluctuate, and creating a flurry of social media posts. But is this rumor genuine, or is this yet another example of crypto's rumor mill gone wild? The Beginning of the Musk-XRP Rumor The latest craziness began when certain crypto news aggregators and social handles started sharing headlines asserting Elon Musk wasn't just interested in XRP, but was going to invest a mind-boggling $104 billion in the token. Others even cited ”insider sources” or stated leaked documents suggested Musk's intention to use XRP as the basis for his payment strategies on X (formerly Twitter) or Tesla. Musk rumors are discredited fact-checked by reputable crypto news outlets shortly after. There is no such valid information, Crypto Times says, that Musk plans or has invested in XRP. The $104 billion, in particular, appears to be a hoax, most likely stemming from previous speculations or misinterpreted tweets. “There is no official confirmation, filing, or credible report that Elon Musk is investing $104 billion—or any sum remotely close—into Ripple’s XRP.” — Crypto Times, June 2025 Why Do Musk Rumors Move Markets? Elon Musk's influence on crypto markets is the stuff of legend. His tweets about Bitcoin's energy usage, to mention just one example, have wiped out billions in market cap overnight. His fondness for Dogecoin turned a meme coin mainstream. So when rumor associates Musk with a new token or initiative, traders and bots react instinctively, sometimes before verifying the information. The XRP rumour was not unique. Within hours, #ElonMuskXRP was trending on Twitter, and leveraged trading volume exploded. Some XRP traders were celebrating, while others insisted on a normal ”buy the rumor, sell the news.” Fact Check: What's Actually True? No Official Investment : No SEC filing, company press release, or credible source confirms any Musk investment in XRP. No Public Endorsement : Elon Musk has never tweeted about XRP, nor has he publicly endorsed Ripple or its token anywhere in recent history. Viral Rumor Misinformation : The $104B figure also appears to be recycled rumor fuel, promoted by social media algorithms and clickbait headlines. Crypto Times and other mainstream publications enhance the importance of skepticism and research, especially when rumors involve celebrity figures like Musk. Why XRP Still Matters—With or Without Musk Despite the false rumor, XRP remains one of the most widely traded cryptocurrencies on the planet. Ripple's aggressive expansion to grow its On-Demand Liquidity network, achieve regulatory clarity, and work with banks maintains real-world adoption momentum. The Musk rumor, as false as it may be, did serve to highlight just how quickly sentiment can shift—and just how much attention XRP continues to attract. Conclusion The Elon Musk-XRP saga is the ultimate text book demonstration of what happens when rumors, hype, and Twitter converge in crypto. While the idea of a $104 billion investment was great copy, reality—the way it so often does in crypto—was much less dramatic. For investors and hobbyists alike, the lesson is straightforward: make sure to check your facts before you FOMO, and let's face it here, the world of digital assets is one where not everything that's trending is real.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9783/did-elon-musk-really-invest-104-b-in-xrp-the-truth-unveiled,"XRP|MARKET|SPONSORED|BTC|DOGE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T17:30:00,"Top Cryptos That Could Outperform Bitcoin (BTC) This Summer","While Bitcoin holds the spotlight, a quiet reshuffling is happening beneath the surface. A new wave of altcoins is drawing investor focus, not with headlines, but with traction. Leading that charge is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a $0.03 DeFi upstart gaining speed fast enough to put legacy tokens on notice. Buyers who invest at this moment will see 100% returns on investment as soon as the token gets listed. Over $11.4 million has been raised so far, and there are over 12,600 early investors. By the time the presale reaches Phase 6, the token price will be at $0.035, a 16.67% immediate return on any stage 5 investment. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, continues its recovery path, stable, scalable, and favored by builders, making it a solid if more measured play. But as summer liquidity builds and market sentiment shifts, the real upside appears to be with Mutuum Finance. Solana’s Edge Over Bitcoin This Summer Solana (SOL) is currently trading $150, and its DeFi and the app ecosystem is growing ambitious fast. It is also making an impact in the institutions: U.S. banks have been collaborating with Solana, and a potential launch of Solana-focused ETFs presupposes further penetration of the mainstream. Bitcoin (BTC), at about $107,385, still has a tight range, with the wind of the ETF now following it, yet developments in the Solana environment and developer activity continue to lead indicators that the asset is yet set to perform better than Bitcoin this summer. Comparisons to legacy assets notwithstanding, when positioned against BTC, Solana is more of an apples to oranges task in proving valuable enough to trade in, this as all eyes remain on other emerging coins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Disrupts DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing DeFi lending with a platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. There are also the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the users to agree on terms among themselves. This direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users climb the ranks they will be rewarded in bonus tokens token holding fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. Long-Term Built, Audited, and Now Backed by $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into measurable credibility. A rigorous smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry’s most trusted security firms, has confirmed that the codebase meets high standards for transparency and safety, offering assurance to both investors and users. To further shore up its ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on an Ethereum-based fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to USD. In contrast to the algorithmic models, which are susceptible to depegging, the current stablecoin is programmed to launch long-lasting liquidity, stability, and dependability to the retail and institutional users. Bitcoin grabs attention, but real gains may lie elsewhere. Solana shows steady growth, yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight, $11.4M raised, 100% ROI locked in for Phase 5 buyers, and major traction in DeFi.

Court rejects Tether’s jurisdiction challenge; breach of contract claims proceed. Tether boosts Bitcoin holdings, denies plans for IPO amid ongoing legal battle. A federal court has allowed Celsius Network to continue its $4 billion lawsuit against the stablecoin issuer Tether, a major development in one of the crypto industry’s most high-stakes legal battles. The judge rejected Tether’s attempts to dismiss key parts of the lawsuit , which means Celsius can now pursue allegations that Tether improperly liquidated and seized over 57,000 of its Bitcoins during the market chaos of 2022. What Is at the Heart of the Lawsuit? The core of the dispute is Tether’s sale of 39,542 Bitcoin in June 2022, which Celsius claims was a breach of their contractual agreement. Celsius alleges this sale violated a 10-hour waiting period and was executed at prices well below market value, causing losses that now exceed $100 million. Beyond that, Celsius claims that another 15,600 Bitcoin, posted as extra collateral, were never returned.

2025-07-02T17:27:09,"Analysis Company Shares July Expectations for Bitcoin and Altcoins – Will They Continue to Sleep, or Will the Giant Awaken?","July may continue to be a historically low-volume month for cryptocurrency markets, despite the intense political and economic agenda. According to a new report by Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33 Research, this summer could be as quiet as previous years. Recalling that July is a volatile period in the US, referred to as the “Trump trade,” Lunde drew attention to important agenda items such as the budget bill, resumption of tariff decisions, and crypto-related executive order calendars. However, despite all these potential price movements, past Julys were also notable for low-volume trading periods. “In July 2022, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius went bankrupt. Last year, there were events such as the assassination attempt on Trump and Biden's resignation. During the same period, BTC distributions from Mt. Gox and sales by the German government put pressure on the market. Despite all this, the second lowest monthly trading volume in the last four years was seen in July,” Lunde said, adding that the market went into a kind of “sleep” in the summer months. Related News: BREAKING: Critical Banking License Application Submitted by Ripple - Exciting Developments for XRP So what's on the agenda in July? July 4: The “One Big Beautiful Bill” budget bill, which President Trump is expected to sign and could increase the U.S. budget deficit to $3.3 trillion, could come into effect. This could have a short-term positive impact on digital assets such as Bitcoin, which are limited in supply. July 9: 90-day tariff moratorium ends. Trump is expected to take new trade measures against certain countries. This could put pressure on markets. July 22: Final assessment and proposal submission date for the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), which was signed in March and planned to be created with approximately 200,000 BTC (approximately $21 billion) of US seized crypto assets. The fact that details about this reserve have not been shared with the public since March increases uncertainty. Lunde warned investors that an announcement could be made on this issue at any time. Although Bitcoin is only 3% off its all-time high, funding rates, leveraged ETF exposures, trading volumes and options data reflect a cautious market stance, a factor that reduces the risk of sudden liquidations in potential uptrends, according to Lunde. “It may seem lazy to assume that this summer will be as quiet as previous years. But my current base case is that nothing new is happening. So the best strategy is to remain patient and hold onto existing positions,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts Give Key Insights","Long-term Bitcoin holders are seeing their unrealized profits decline even as BTC trades a little over 4% from its all-time highs. According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant, the average unrealized profit for long-term holders, based on the MVRV ratio, is around 220%. The figure is notable but lower than the 300% and 350% levels seen during the March and December 2024 market peaks. LTH Profits Slide The realized price for long-term holders now stands at $39,000, which means that significant gains are still present despite the decline in unrealized profits. Moreover, the current profit levels are similar to those last seen during the October 2024 correction, which further indicates that while BTC remains strong, the market has yet to reach peak profit extremes. To match previous cycle tops, CryptoQuant said that Bitcoin would need to climb toward $140,000, a level many are anticipating. As Bitcoin trades near $107,000, market participants are preparing for a period that has historically brought slower activity and new narratives. According to crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades, the cryptocurrency has entered the third quarter of 2025, a period historically known for slow price action and lower volumes. Summer months typically bring reduced liquidity for both BTC and ETH, which makes Q3 the quietest quarter of the year. However, Daan noted that this slower period often sets the stage for new narratives to emerge, which could present new opportunities ahead for traders. This aligns with Bitfinex experts, who said that the bull run is intact, but expect Q3 to be slower Weaker Momentum? While seasonal patterns are in play, one concerning factor is Bitcoin’s Bull Score, which has moved into neutral territory at 50. The metric gauges market conditions needed to continue a rally, and requires a reading of 60 or higher for upward momentum to continue. As such, a reading of 40 would indicate a bearish environment. The current neutral level suggests that the leading crypto asset lacks sufficient bullish strength to support a sustained price rally at this stage.

2025-07-02T17:00:15,"Bitcoin Bounces Off Key Demand Level – Price Discovery On The Menu?","Bitcoin has experienced heightened volatility over the past few days, moving between critical levels as market participants await a clear breakout or breakdown. After testing $105,000 as support, BTC rebounded strongly and pushed back toward the $109,000 resistance zone—an area that has capped upward momentum for several weeks. While bulls remain in control of the broader structure, price action continues to show hesitation just below the all-time high, leaving the market in a state of uncertainty. Related Reading: Solana Hits New Milestone: Wallets Holding 0.1+ SOL Reach Record High To confirm the next leg of the long-term trend, Bitcoin needs to break into price discovery territory above $112,000 with strong volume and follow-through. Until that happens, the current range-bound conditions could persist, especially as traders weigh macro factors and profit-taking activity increases. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis pointing to another strong bounce from the 50-day moving average and exponential moving average (MA/EMA) cluster, key dynamic support levels that have repeatedly triggered bullish reactions. This bounce reinforces the underlying strength in the current trend, suggesting that buyers continue to step in at crucial levels. As long as BTC holds above this support zone, the path toward a breakout remains intact—but confirmation is still needed. Bitcoin Prepares For Expansion Phase Bitcoin appears poised to enter a new expansive phase, with a breakout above its all-time high potentially triggering a fresh wave of bullish momentum, not just for BTC, but for the broader crypto market. After weeks of grinding just below the $112,000 resistance level, Bitcoin has struggled to push decisively higher. However, the structure remains bullish, and buyers have consistently defended key demand zones around $105,000. This ability to maintain higher lows during a period of consolidation signals strong market control by the bulls. According to Jelle, Bitcoin has just seen another powerful bounce from the 50-day moving average and exponential moving average (MA/EMA) cluster—an area that has historically acted as a dynamic support zone. Each time BTC has touched this cluster in recent months, it has rebounded with renewed strength, and the latest bounce is no exception. Jelle believes this reaction confirms the uptrend remains intact, with conditions aligning for a breakout. “The trend is up—new all-time highs are very much on the menu this week,” Jelle noted, emphasizing the importance of sustained momentum above current resistance. If Bitcoin can close decisively above $112K, it would likely ignite a surge in altcoins, many of which have lagged during BTC’s dominance-driven phase. With bulls maintaining control and technical support holding firm, the market is now watching for confirmation that Bitcoin is ready to enter price discovery once again. A successful breakout could mark the beginning of the next major leg in the crypto cycle.

The 12-hour chart shows a series of failed breakouts above the $109K level in recent weeks, highlighting the strength of this resistance zone. However, bulls have continued to defend higher lows, maintaining overall market structure and preventing deeper corrections. The latest candle shows a 1.93% surge, reclaiming the 50- and 100-period moving averages around $106,000, a key short-term cluster that previously acted as support. Volume also picked up during this bounce, suggesting renewed buying interest as Bitcoin tries to establish bullish momentum.

This move directly affects offerings linked to XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other digital assets. The announcement, made by the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance on July 1, 2025, aims to strengthen investor protections and provide clarity around the application of existing securities laws to spot crypto ETFs. The development was highlighted by XRP Chancellor on X, and it signals a major step toward integrating crypto more securely into traditional financial markets. As interest in spot crypto ETFs continues to surge, this guidance provides a clearer framework for how issuers must present information about these investment products to the public. BREAKING: SEC RELEASES NEW GUIDANCE FOR CRYPTO SPOT ETFs. DISCLOSURE RULES CLARIFIED FOR ISSUERS OF $XRP , $BTC , $ETH & MORE! pic.twitter.com/hAjeKdwqX3 — XRP Chancellor (@xrpchancellor) July 2, 2025 New Standards for Crypto ETF Disclosures According to the SEC, crypto ETPs, often structured as trusts holding digital assets directly, must comply with disclosure obligations under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although these products are not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, they are still subject to anti-fraud provisions and the same core disclosure principles that apply to traditional securities. Issuers must now provide detailed and asset-specific information on the front page of their prospectuses. This includes a summary of the investment objective, the type of crypto asset held, how it’s managed, and how its value may change over time. The SEC emphasizes that each crypto asset is unique, and disclosures must reflect the particular characteristics and risks of the underlying asset. For example, issuers offering XRP-backed ETFs must identify any relevant legal risks, such as the historic SEC v. Ripple Labs litigation , and clearly explain XRP’s underlying blockchain technology, use case, and potential vulnerabilities. This level of specificity is also expected for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and any other digital asset included in a spot ETF. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Protection and Market Confidence The SEC’s guidance also requires a discussion of risk factors that may impact the trust and the value of its crypto holdings. These include price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, cybersecurity risks, and possible weaknesses in the underlying blockchain network. Issuers must also disclose whether the trust anticipates selling crypto assets over time to cover operating expenses, which could reduce the value of the ETF shares. This renewed focus on transparency aims to foster investor confidence and protect market integrity as crypto products become increasingly mainstream. The SEC reiterated that generic or boilerplate disclosures are not sufficient. Each ETF must offer tailored, fact-based information that reflects the realities of the specific crypto asset it tracks. Implications for XRP and the Broader Market This regulatory update is especially meaningful for XRP, which recently gained access to SEC-regulated investment vehicles after years of legal uncertainty . As XRP Chancellor noted, the new rules not only provide a path for wider adoption of XRP-based ETFs but also set a precedent for how the SEC may approach future crypto-linked investment products. With this guidance, the SEC has laid the groundwork for safer, more transparent crypto investing, marking another key milestone in the evolving relationship between digital assets and Wall Street.

2025-07-02T16:40:15,"Bitcoin’s Astonishing Ascent: Standard Chartered Forecasts a $200K Triumph by Year-End","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astonishing Ascent: Standard Chartered Forecasts a $200K Triumph by Year-End Are you ready for a seismic shift in the crypto world? Standard Chartered, a renowned financial institution, has just dropped a bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that’s sending ripples across the entire market. They’re not just bullish; they’re projecting an astonishing climb for Bitcoin (BTC) to hit $135,000 by Q3 and a staggering $200,000 by year-end. This isn’t just a hopeful guess; it’s a meticulously crafted Standard Chartered forecast underpinned by significant market shifts. What’s Driving This Bold Standard Chartered Forecast? Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s astute head of digital asset research, is the man behind this groundbreaking projection. His analysis, widely reported by Cointelegraph, points to several powerful catalysts that are reshaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. Gone are the days when post-halving corrections were the primary concern; new demand dynamics are now firmly in the driver’s seat. The Power of Spot Bitcoin ETFs One of the most significant factors fueling this bullish outlook is the sustained inflow into Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Since their approval, these investment vehicles have revolutionized how institutional and retail investors access Bitcoin. Unlike previous cycles where direct crypto exchange purchases were the norm, ETFs provide a regulated, familiar pathway for traditional finance players to gain exposure to BTC. This has unlocked a torrent of new capital, creating unprecedented demand pressure. Institutional Access: ETFs simplify compliance and custody, making Bitcoin a viable asset for large funds and wealth managers. Retail Convenience: Everyday investors can now buy Bitcoin exposure through their brokerage accounts, often with lower fees and greater security. Liquidity Boost: The massive inflows enhance Bitcoin’s market liquidity, making it more attractive for larger trades. The Rise of Corporate Treasury Adoption Beyond ETFs, another pivotal driver is the growing trend of corporate treasury adoption . More and more companies are beginning to view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate reserve asset for their balance sheets. This strategic move is often driven by a desire to hedge against inflation, diversify holdings, or simply capitalize on Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. When a major corporation allocates a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin, it signals immense confidence and sets a precedent for others to follow. Think about companies like MicroStrategy, which pioneered this trend. Their continued accumulation of Bitcoin demonstrates a strong belief in its future value. As more corporate treasuries consider this strategy, the demand for BTC will only intensify, creating a robust floor for its price and propelling it upwards. Understanding Bitcoin’s Unique Market Dynamics Kendrick’s observation about Bitcoin diverging from typical post-halving corrections is crucial. Historically, Bitcoin has often experienced a price dip or consolidation period shortly after its halving events, as the market adjusts to the reduced supply of new BTC. However, this cycle appears different. The sheer volume of new demand generated by Spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing corporate treasury adoption seems to be overriding these historical patterns. The crypto market outlook is therefore shifting from one dominated by retail speculation and supply shocks to one increasingly influenced by institutional capital and strategic corporate allocations. This maturation of the market suggests a more stable, yet powerfully upward, trajectory for Bitcoin. Key Differences in This Cycle: To illustrate the divergence, consider these points: Feature Previous Cycles (Typical Post-Halving) Current Cycle (Post-Halving 2024) Primary Demand Driver Retail speculation, hype, FOMO Institutional inflows via ETFs, corporate treasury adoption Market Reaction to Halving Initial consolidation or correction Sustained demand overriding typical correction Market Maturity Nascent, highly volatile, less regulated Growing institutionalization, clearer regulatory pathways What Does This Mean for Investors and the Crypto Market Outlook? This bold Bitcoin price prediction from Standard Chartered underscores a significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape. It suggests that Bitcoin is no longer just a fringe asset but is rapidly integrating into mainstream finance. For investors, this could mean continued growth potential, but it also highlights the importance of staying informed about market dynamics. Benefits and Opportunities: Validation: A major bank’s bullish stance lends significant credibility to Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Growth Potential: The $200K target indicates substantial upside for current and prospective holders. Market Maturation: Increased institutional involvement can lead to greater stability and reduced volatility over time, though short-term swings are always possible. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Despite institutional adoption, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Price movements can be rapid and unpredictable. Regulatory Landscape: While improving, regulatory clarity remains an ongoing challenge in various jurisdictions. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rates, and geopolitical events can still influence Bitcoin’s price. Actionable Insights: Given this exciting forecast and the evolving crypto market outlook , what should you consider? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news regarding ETF inflows, corporate adoption announcements, and macroeconomic indicators. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin’s potential is high, a diversified portfolio remains a prudent strategy for managing risk. Long-Term View: Standard Chartered’s prediction is for year-end, suggesting a long-term perspective is beneficial for capitalizing on such growth. Understand Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose. While the outlook is positive, no investment is without risk. A Compelling Future for Bitcoin Standard Chartered’s audacious Bitcoin price prediction of $200,000 by year-end is more than just a number; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system. Fueled by the relentless demand from Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the strategic embrace of corporate treasury adoption , Bitcoin appears poised for an unprecedented ascent. This cycle is indeed different, with new, powerful demand drivers dictating the market’s rhythm.

2025-07-02T16:40:12,"Bitcoin Rebounds Toward $110K, Presaging What Could Be a Volatile July","Bitcoin BTC is bouncing hard towards $110,000 on Wednesday, shrugging off Tuesday's brief risk-off wave that dragged the price below $106,000. Recently, the largest crypto traded at its strongest price since June 11, around $109,500, up 3.5% over the past 24 hours. The action came as Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam, helping risk assets across the board. The Nasdaq at midday is ahead 0.8%. Under the deal, the U.S. will impose a 20% tariff on goods from Vietnam and a 40% levy on transshipped goods—products routed through Vietnam on their way to the U.S. U.S. exports, in turn, will face no tariffs when entering the Vietnamese market. Boosting crypto sentiment specifically could be the debut of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK), the first such crypto staking product available in the U.S. ""Volume in $SSK now at $20M, which is really strong, top 1% for a new launch,"" wrote Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas a short while ago . Balchunas noted that SOLZ — a futures-based SOL ETF that opened for business in March — did just $1 million of volume on its first day of trade. July could be big (in either direction) July is shaping up to be a potentially volatile month for bitcoin, driven by Trump administration's policies, according to Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33. Trump is expected to sign a controversial expansionary budget bill dubbed the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" by Friday. The bill, which could widen the U.S. deficit by $3.3 trillion, is seen by some as bullish for scarce assets like BTC, Lunde said. Another key date looming is the July 9 tariff deadline, which could see more aggressive trade posturing from Trump. Thirdly, July 22 is the final deadline for action on long-awaited crypto executive order, with potential updates on the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. ""July is crowded with latent Trump volatility,"" Lunde said. Still, crypto markets are relatively calm without excessive froth, he noted. ""There are few reasons to expect a massive broad deleveraging of the crypto market, as crypto-leverage remains contained,"" he said. ""This favors maintaining spot exposure and staying patient as we progress into a period well known for its seasonal apathy.""",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/02/bitcoin-rebounds-toward-110k-presaging-what-could-be-a-volatile-july,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|SOL|BUSINESS","Markets|Market Wrap|Bitcoin|Trump|Breaking News|News",cryptocompare

So, what is the reason behind Standard Chartered’s bullish price prediction for Q3, lets find it out. Why Is Standard Chartered So Bullish? According to Standard Chartered, analysts there are two main drivers behind this predicted surge, first a massive inflow into Bitcoin ETFs and second the growing demand from corporate treasuries. JUST IN: $1.1 trillion Standard Chartered predicts #Bitcoin to hit $200,000 this year pic.twitter.com/XplFnxahSP — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 2, 2025 In the second quarter of 2025 alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries snapped up around 245,000 BTC. Since January 2024, ETFs have attracted more than $48 billion in net buying. More Corporate firms and giant institutions are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, and even government-linked funds are increasing their exposure through indirect investments. Therefore, Standard Chartered believes this trend will only get stronger in the months ahead. Standard Chartered Past BTC Price Predictions Earlier this year, Standard Chartered predicted Bitcoin would reach $120,000 by mid-2025. Bitcoin has already surpassed $112,000 in Q2, just shy of that target but well above the $85,000 seen at the start of the year. The bank’s new targets are even more ambitious, with a long-term vision of $500,000 by 2028 if current trends continue. As of today, Bitcoin is trading around $ 109,000 reflecting a 3% rise seen in the last 24hours. Volatility Still in the Picture Of course, it won’t be a smooth ride. Standard Chartered does warn that there could be some bumps ahead, especially between late Q3 and early Q4. Sudden pullbacks or profit-taking could shake up the market for a while. But overall, if the ETF momentum and corporate interest keep growing, this could be the year Bitcoin breaks all its old records, and $200,000 might not sound so crazy after all.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-standard-chartered-predict-btc-to-hit-135k-in-q3/,"BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET","News",cryptocompare

The dispute between Celsius and Tether dates back to a 2022 agreement in which Tether provided USDT to Celsius, which sent Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. Tether argues that Celsius is attempting to shift the blame for his own financial mismanagement onto Tether by requesting the return of approximately $2.4 billion worth of BTC (as of the date of the lawsuit), despite the liquidation being carried out at his direction and with his consent.

2025-07-02T16:10:07,"Bitcoin Outlook: Unpacking the Perilous Impact of Record U.S. Money Supply","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Outlook: Unpacking the Perilous Impact of Record U.S. Money Supply The financial world is abuzz, and for good reason. The U.S. M2 money supply recently soared to an unprecedented $21.94 trillion in May, a figure that on the surface might signal robust economic growth. Yet, for the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, particularly the Bitcoin outlook , this record surge introduces a complex web of signals. Are we witnessing the fuel for a new bull run, or is this a precursor to economic headwinds that could challenge even the most resilient digital assets? Let’s unpack this critical development and understand its profound implications. What is the U.S. M2 Money Supply and Why Does its Record High Matter for Bitcoin? Before diving into Bitcoin’s fate, it’s essential to grasp what the M2 money supply actually represents. In simple terms, M2 is a broad measure of the total amount of money circulating in an economy. It includes: M1: All physical cash (currency), checking accounts, and traveler’s checks. Savings Deposits: Money held in savings accounts. Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs): Interest-bearing accounts offered by banks. Small-Denomination Time Deposits: Certificates of Deposit (CDs) under $100,000. Retail Money Market Mutual Funds: Funds that invest in short-term debt instruments. The recent jump to $21.94 trillion isn’t just a number; it’s a reflection of significant monetary expansion. This growth has largely been fueled by aggressive quantitative easing (QE) programs and massive government stimulus measures implemented during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. When the Federal Reserve buys bonds and injects liquidity into the banking system, and when governments send out stimulus checks, the M2 money supply naturally expands. For the Bitcoin outlook , a rising M2 money supply presents a fascinating dichotomy. On one hand, an abundance of liquidity in the financial system can lead to a ‘search for yield.’ With more money chasing investment opportunities, some of it inevitably flows into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This influx of capital can drive up demand and prices. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ has historically been seen by some as a hedge against the debasement of fiat currencies, a narrative that gains traction when the money supply expands rapidly. However, there’s another side to this coin, one that sparks considerable inflation concerns and complicates the macroeconomic landscape for digital assets. Bitcoin Outlook : The Dual-Edged Sword of Liquidity and Inflation Concerns The current macroeconomic environment for Bitcoin is a delicate balance between the potential benefits of increased liquidity and the looming threat of inflation. Let’s explore this push and pull: The Bullish Case: Liquidity and the Search for Yield When there’s a flood of money in the system, traditional safe havens like bonds might offer low returns. This can push investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, with their potential for outsized gains, often become attractive targets. This ‘risk-on’ sentiment is fueled by easy money policies, which reduce borrowing costs and encourage speculative investments. In this scenario, Bitcoin could theoretically benefit from the sheer volume of capital looking for a home, seeing its price ascend as more dollars chase a finite supply of digital assets. The Bearish Case: Inflation Concerns and Economic Headwinds Conversely, a rapid expansion of the money supply, if not met by a proportional increase in goods and services, can lead to inflation. Simply put, ‘too much money chasing too few goods’ drives up prices. This erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies and can create economic instability. While some proponents argue Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, its performance during recent inflationary periods has been mixed, often correlating more with technology stocks than traditional safe-havens like gold. This challenges the narrative that Bitcoin is a pure inflation hedge, especially in the short to medium term. The crucial question for the Bitcoin outlook then becomes: which force will dominate? Will the liquidity narrative prevail, pushing prices higher, or will escalating inflation concerns compel central banks to adopt policies that dampen speculative appetite? Navigating Inflation Concerns : How Does It Complicate the Fed Rate Cuts Narrative? The Federal Reserve, often referred to simply as ‘the Fed,’ has a dual mandate: to maintain maximum employment and ensure price stability (i.e., control inflation). When the M2 money supply grows at a record pace, it naturally raises alarms about potential inflation. If inflation becomes entrenched, the Fed is compelled to act. Historically, the Fed’s primary tool to combat inflation is to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which slows down economic activity, reduces demand, and ideally brings inflation back under control. However, this is where the plot thickens for the broader crypto market and the economy at large. For months, financial markets have been eagerly anticipating Fed rate cuts . The expectation was that as inflation cooled, the Fed would lower rates to stimulate economic growth, making borrowing cheaper and encouraging investment. This dovish stance is generally seen as positive for risk assets like Bitcoin, as lower rates reduce the appeal of ‘safer’ investments and make speculative ventures more attractive. However, continued robust growth in the M2 money supply throws a wrench into these expectations. Analysts warn that if this trend persists, it could put immense pressure on the Fed to reconsider its stance on easing. Instead of cutting rates, the Fed might be forced to: Maintain current high interest rates for longer: This ‘higher for longer’ scenario can starve risk assets of liquidity and make traditional investments more appealing. Even raise rates further: In a worst-case scenario, if inflation proves stickier than anticipated due to excess liquidity, the Fed might have no choice but to implement additional rate hikes, a move that would likely send shockwaves through the crypto market . Such a hawkish pivot by the Fed would significantly alter the investment landscape, making the cost of capital higher and reducing the speculative appetite that often fuels cryptocurrency booms. What Does Continued Money Supply Growth Mean for Future Fed Rate Cuts and the Crypto Market? The interplay between M2 money supply, inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions is crucial for understanding the immediate and long-term trajectory of the crypto market . Here’s a breakdown of the potential scenarios: Scenario 1: Inflationary Pressures Mount, Fed Stays Hawkish If the record M2 money supply indeed translates into persistent, high inflation, the Fed’s hands will be tied. They would prioritize price stability, meaning Fed rate cuts would be off the table, and even rate hikes could be on the horizon. In this environment, the crypto market would likely face significant headwinds. Higher interest rates increase the attractiveness of less risky assets (like U.S. Treasury bonds), making speculative assets less appealing. Borrowing costs for crypto businesses and investors also rise, potentially stifling innovation and investment within the sector. Scenario 2: M2 Growth Decouples from Inflation, Fed Eases It’s possible that the increased M2 supply doesn’t translate into runaway inflation due to other economic factors (e.g., increased productivity, supply chain normalization). In this more optimistic scenario, the Fed might find room to implement Fed rate cuts , stimulating economic growth and potentially fueling a ‘risk-on’ environment. This would be highly beneficial for the crypto market , as cheaper money tends to flow into higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Scenario 3: Stagflation Concerns A more challenging scenario involves ‘stagflation’ – a period of high inflation coupled with stagnant economic growth. This is particularly difficult for central banks to manage. If the record M2 money supply leads to persistent inflation but the economy struggles to grow, the Fed would be in a bind, with limited tools to address both issues simultaneously. Such an environment would likely create significant uncertainty and volatility across all markets, including the crypto market . The current consensus among many analysts is that the record M2 growth complicates the path to rate cuts. The Fed will be closely watching inflation data, employment figures, and, indeed, money supply metrics to inform its decisions. Any indication that the money supply is fueling unsustainable price increases will likely result in a more hawkish stance, putting a damper on the broader crypto market ‘s aspirations for a swift recovery fueled by monetary easing. Beyond Bitcoin: Broader Implications for the Crypto Market and Investor Sentiment While Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the entire digital asset space, the macroeconomic shifts driven by the U.S. M2 money supply and the Federal Reserve’s response have far-reaching implications for the entire crypto market . Altcoins, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other emerging sectors are often more sensitive to changes in liquidity and investor sentiment than Bitcoin itself. Impact on Altcoins and DeFi Altcoins, which typically exhibit higher volatility than Bitcoin, are particularly vulnerable during periods of economic uncertainty or tightening monetary policy. When capital becomes scarcer or more expensive, investors tend to retreat from riskier assets, and altcoins often see sharper declines than Bitcoin. Similarly, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which relies heavily on liquidity and accessible capital, could face headwinds if interest rates remain high or rise further, making borrowing more expensive and reducing the attractiveness of yield-generating strategies. Institutional Adoption and Retail Sentiment The macroeconomic environment also heavily influences institutional interest in crypto. Large institutional investors often have strict risk management frameworks and are more sensitive to traditional financial market indicators. A hawkish Fed or persistent inflation concerns might lead them to delay or reduce their crypto allocations, preferring more stable assets. Retail investor sentiment, while sometimes driven by hype, is also ultimately influenced by broader economic conditions. A tightening economy or a challenging job market can reduce discretionary income available for speculative investments, impacting overall demand in the crypto market . Key Challenges and Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Navigating the current landscape, with record money supply figures and uncertain central bank policy, presents both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions. Key Challenges: Macroeconomic Volatility: The crypto market is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance, making it susceptible to shifts in interest rates, inflation, and broader economic sentiment. Uncertainty in Fed Policy: The Fed’s reaction to persistent money supply growth and inflation is unpredictable, leading to potential sudden market movements. Correlation with Risk Assets: Bitcoin’s tendency to correlate with tech stocks means it may struggle in an environment where investors shun risk. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Economic Currents: Stay Informed: Regularly monitor key economic indicators such as the U.S. M2 money supply, Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), employment data, and Federal Reserve statements. Understanding these trends will help you anticipate potential market shifts. Practice Risk Management: Given the heightened uncertainty, employ robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio (both within crypto and across different asset classes), and only investing what you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of macroeconomic uncertainty, projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, robust technology, and active development communities tend to be more resilient. Researching the underlying value proposition of crypto assets becomes even more critical. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility can be unnerving, a long-term investment horizon can help weather market fluctuations. Bitcoin’s underlying technology and increasing adoption continue to evolve, regardless of short-term economic headwinds. A Compelling Summary: Navigating the New Economic Frontier The record surge in the U.S. M2 money supply to nearly $22 trillion is a significant economic event, sending ripples of both hope and concern across financial markets, especially for the Bitcoin outlook . While the sheer volume of liquidity could theoretically boost demand for risk assets like Bitcoin, it simultaneously fuels potent inflation concerns that could compel the Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish stance. The delicate balance between encouraging economic growth and combating inflation means that previously anticipated Fed rate cuts might be delayed or even reversed, creating a challenging environment for the entire crypto market . Investors must remain vigilant, understanding that Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space are no longer isolated from traditional macroeconomic forces. The interplay of money supply, inflation, and central bank policy will be critical determinants of market sentiment and price action in the coming months. By staying informed and adopting prudent investment strategies, participants can better navigate these perilous, yet potentially rewarding, economic currents.

The recovery comes after $ETH weathered a brief rounded top pattern last week, with institutional inflows and Layer-2 adoption providing fundamental support. All eyes now turn to whether bulls can reclaim the $2,600 resistance zone.

They include Optimism and Arbitrum, which recently surpassed 2 million daily transactions, as well as zkSync and StarkNet. These solutions offer faster and cheaper transactions while taking advantage of Ethereum’s existing security infrastructure. Institutions are also increasingly adopting an Ethereum treasury, similar to that of Bitcoin. Some important examples include Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-listed company that raised $163 million to expand its Ethereum treasury , now holding 24,434.2 ETH. The firm is shifting from Bitcoin mining to Ethereum staking infrastructure. SharpLink Gaming has also become the world’s largest corporate Ethereum holder, with 188,478 ETH (worth $457 million) acquired through aggressive buying campaigns. SharpLink Gaming has emerged as the world’s largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum (ETH), after acquiring 176,271 ETH for $463 million. #ETH #Sharplink https://t.co/ynahjYt7Hd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 Other public companies, such as BitMine and BioNexus Gene Lab, have also adopted Ethereum as a reserve asset, indicating growing institutional confidence in its long-term value. Ethereum Forms Bearish Rounded Top: Breakdown Targets $2,300 The Ethereum ($ETH/$USDT) 30-minute chart presents a clear rounded top formation, typically interpreted as a bearish reversal pattern. The arc began forming on June 29, with Ethereum gradually losing upward momentum after peaking just below $2,530. This slow transition from bullish to bearish sentiment is often driven by fading buyer interest and profit-taking, leading to a progressively weaker price structure. Source: CoinGlass The rounded top was completed between June 30 and July 1, culminating in a breakdown below the neckline zone near $2,470, marked with a red arrow. This breakdown indicates a shift in market control from buyers to sellers, leading to a sharp price rejection and initiating a short-term downtrend. The decline pushes $ETH down to lows of approximately $2,390, a retracement of over 5% from the local high. Interestingly, following the breakdown, the chart shows signs of short-term recovery, with buyers stepping in around the $2,400 support zone. A green candle appears near July 2, indicating a potential relief bounce or dead cat bounce. However, unless Ethereum reclaims the $2,470–$2,600 zone convincingly, this move may be short-lived. In summary, Ethereum has exhibited a textbook rounded top breakdown, and caution is advised unless a strong recovery invalidates this bearish setup.

2025-07-02T16:00:04,"The ‘MicroStrategy’ Of Ethereum Emerges: Tom Lee And Joe Lubin Raise $675M To Stack ETH","The ‘MicroStrategy’ of Ethereum has emerged, with Fundstrat’s Tom Lee and Joe Lubin making moves to advance their respective ETH treasuries. Tom Lee has emerged as the Chairman of BitMine, which will hold ETH, while Lubin is already the Chairman of SharpLink Gaming. Lee and Lubin Raise $675 Million for Ethereum Treasury Strategy Tom Lee and Joe Lubin have already advanced their plans to create the ‘MicroStrategy’ of Ethereum. On Tom Lee’s end, BitMine announced a $250 million private placement to raise capital for its Ethereum strategy. The Bitcoin mining company stated that the net proceeds of the offering will be used to acquire ETH, which will become the firm’s primary reserve asset. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here’s Why BitMine plans to close this private placement on or about July 3, as it aims to become one of the largest publicly traded ETH holders with Tom Lee as the Chairman of the Board. On the other hand, SharpLink Gaming, with Joe Lubin’s help, is already the largest publicly traded Ethereum holder. The company earlier launched its Ethereum treasury with a $425 million ETH purchase. SharpLink Gaming recently announced that it has increased its total ETH holdings to 198,167 ($475 million), further establishing its position as the ‘MicroStrategy’ of Ethereum. Between June 23 and 30, it acquired 9,468 ETH for $22.8 million at an average price of $2,411 per ETH. During that same period, SharpLink Gaming also raised an additional $24.4 million through its At-The-Market (ATM) facility, selling $2.5 million shares. The company revealed that most of the proceeds will go toward further Ethereum acquisitions. As of June 30th, 100% of its ETH is staked, and the firm has earned 222 ETH in rewards since it began an ETH treasury company. Plans To Mirror Saylor’s Strategy In an X post, crypto commentator Eric Conner commented on how Ethereum is getting its own MicroStrategy era thanks to Lee and Lubin’s experiments. He highlighted BitMine’s proposed KPI of ‘ETH per share,’ which mirrors Saylor’s playbook, except that ETH earns yield in this instance through staking. Related Reading: These Companies Are Following Saylor’s Strategy Into The Bitcoin Battleground With Over $2 Billion Slated To Buy BTC Conner further remarked that BitMine’s mining DNA lets it spin up validators and tap DeFi rails, turning a once-capital-intensive operation into a cash-flow engine secured by Ethereum. On the other hand, he noted that Joe Lubin and SharpLink Gaming’s move is bigger. SharpLink is already staking its ETH holdings and plans to explore other DeFi strategies. With this move, the crypto commentator declared that ETH becomes the reserve while yielding bankroll growth. Lubin also recently raised the possibility of adding leverage to SharpLink Gaming’s Ethereum strategy, which will mirror Saylor’s strategy. He stated that they may do convertible equity and issue bonds at low rates, without putting the strategy at risk. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,444, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-02T15:54:24,"Outset PR Finds 82% of Crypto Media Lost Traffic as MiCA Took Hold in Western Europe, Italy and Spain Hit Hardest","Four fifths of crypto media outlets across Western Europe lost traffic in Q1 2025. This single statistic defines the quarter — and reshapes how crypto information reaches users across the continent. According to Outset PR’s newly released report — building on their earlier Q1 analysis of crypto media declines in LATAM — the same downward trend played out in Western Europe between January and March, revealing a sharp contradiction: growing public interest in crypto, but shrinking media visibility. The report tracked 133 Western European outlets, of which 87 were crypto-focused, using SimilarWeb and Ahrefs to measure traffic and search visibility. A clear majority of crypto-only sites saw audience declines — driven by the combined effects of MiCA-aligned regulatory pressure, Google’s March algorithm update, and shifting search behaviors tied to market volatility. As the EU’s first comprehensive crypto framework, MiCA began reshaping media visibility by forcing outlets to rethink compliance, language, and even tone — well before full enforcement kicked in. During the aforementioned timeframe, traffic across crypto-native media dropped from 26.57 million to 22.22 million visits, a decline of more than 16%. To understand the full weight of that 82%, it needs to be broken down by region, language, and outlet structure to see who survived, who collapsed, and why. Western Europe crypto media performance: data sourced from Outset PR Where the Declines Were Sharpest: Regional Breakdown Outset PR tracks MiCA’s varied impact on crypto media across Western European countries Based on Outset PR’s findings, the hardest-hit countries were Italy and Spain, with both seeing over 70% of tracked crypto outlets lose visibility in Q1. In Italy, this decline was especially striking given that it leads the region in crypto interest — 37% of the population expresses active engagement. The downturn was largely driven by regulatory scrutiny from CONSOB, which targeted influencer-led content and investment-style messaging. Top Italian outlets lost nearly half their traffic. Only Borsainside maintained consistent growth, ending the quarter up 15.96%. In Spain, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV) began enforcing strict advertising guidelines, which led to a significant reduction in ad-supported content and discoverability. Although Bit2Me News surged 149.4% in March — making it one of the top performers across the region — most other Spanish-language outlets ended the quarter with traffic in decline. Germany: Europe’s Largest Crypto Language Market Still Struggled German-speaking outlets made up nearly 40% of the crypto-native platforms reviewed in Outset PR’s dataset. Despite this dominant share, the German market faced significant visibility challenges in Q1. In February, the financial regulator BaFin issued new guidance that warned against any investment-like promotion from unlicensed parties — including media platforms. Amid these developments, outlets like Coin-Update, Krypto Magazin, and BitcoinBlog.de saw sharp traffic declines. Although a few sites posted gains in March, more than half of the region’s crypto-focused German-language publishers continued trending downward at quarter’s end. A key exception was CoinJournal DE, which grew 23.90% in Q1. Backed by Investoo Group, the outlet benefited from shared SEO expertise, multilingual publishing capabilities, and regulatory infrastructure. These elements allowed it to navigate algorithmic changes and new content standards more effectively than independent competitors. France: Transparent Labels Became the Differentiator In France, regulatory enforcement from the AMF focused on transparency rather than restrictions, prompting algorithmic suppression of outlets that failed to properly label promotions or disclose financial risks. By February, 72% of French-language crypto platforms had lost traffic. Some sites like The Blog saw their visibility collapse almost entirely. Others, such as Blockchain France and InvestX, rebounded by March, likely due to cleaner disclaimer practices, improved metadata, and expansion into multilingual publishing. The divide in outcomes highlights the start of a more polarized crypto media environment in France, where clarity and compliance are now essential for sustainable reach. Dutch-Language Media Faced Algorithmic Whiplash Outlets serving readers in the Netherlands and Belgium faced no direct media restrictions from regulators during Q1. However, their heavy reliance on SEO and Google visibility made them especially vulnerable to algorithmic shifts. Outset PR’s report also shows that in February, 76% of Dutch-speaking crypto outlets reported traffic losses. High-profile names like Bitcoin Magazine NL fell 36.78%, while Bitcoinspot.nl dropped 39.30%. A few properties — such as Beste Bank and Coinmarketcap.nl —bounced back in March, thanks to stronger content quality and diversified link-building strategies. Still, most Dutch-language outlets were unable to regain their January positions, demonstrating the inherent risk of traffic models built almost entirely around search visibility. UK Outlets Felt the Ripple Effects of Domestic Policy Although the United Kingdom is not bound by MiCA, local regulation had a comparable impact. In early January, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) expanded its financial promotions regime to include crypto. This contributed to widespread visibility losses for UK-facing outlets, especially those featuring unverified affiliate offers or poorly labeled advertorials. Most UK crypto-native platforms saw traffic decline across the quarter. Only The Market Periodical and MyCryptoSpaceUK posted quarterly gains, though both averaged well below 100K monthly visits. Meanwhile, Cryptouk.io and Bitcourier continued trending downward, underscoring that even outside of MiCA, enforcement and algorithm shifts are reshaping how crypto media operates in the UK. No UK-based outlet crossed the 500K monthly visit threshold, suggesting that while regulation played a role, overall readership remained modest compared to Germany, France, or the Netherlands. Tiered Media Analysis: Who Still Commands Reach? Outset PR’s analysis revealed that traffic is concentrated among a small group of top-tier publishers. Just seven outlets surpassed 1 million monthly visits, together accounting for 60.26% of the region’s total crypto-native traffic. A mid-tier of six outlets generated between 500K and 900K monthly visits, accounting for another 18% of total visibility. Beyond these two groups, 58 outlets attracted fewer than 100K monthly visits each, combining for only 6.24% of the total audience. While 16 outlets did post traffic increases during Q1, most of them grew by percentage, not by reach. Only Newsbit.de combined high growth with consistently strong reach above the 1 million mark. Mainstream Finance Media Outperformed Crypto-Native Outlets In contrast to crypto-specific sites, generalist finance, tech, and economic publications proved far more resilient. Outset PR tracked 46 such platforms in Western Europe, and 25 of them posted quarterly growth. Together, they generated over 106 million visits, dwarfing the 22 million visits recorded by crypto-only sites. These outlets benefited from strong domain authority, broader editorial scopes, and less reliance on price-based speculation content. Outset PR notes that finance-first platforms have become vital for crypto PR efforts — especially in a MiCA-enforced environment where credibility and compliance now define reach. Google Discover Favors Structured, Compliant Media As Outset PR notes, the battle for traffic in Q1 extended beyond search rankings — into Google Discover, where surfacing now reflects a site’s editorial structure and legal hygiene. Only 22.99% of crypto-native outlets maintained consistent presence in Google Discover in Q1 2025. By comparison, 32.61% of non-crypto-native outlets appeared consistently in Discover. Nine of these sites surpassed 1 million monthly visits, confirming the importance of technical compliance and editorial credibility in Google's evolving news ecosystem. Outset PR’s report makes one thing clear: the traffic drop experienced by crypto-covering media outlets in Western Europe during Q1 2025 was a structural reset. Regulation, platform policies, and evolving search engine standards have raised the bar for visibility, and many crypto publishers found themselves unprepared for the new terrain. In this cycle, survival hinges on multilingual reach, legal clarity, and editorial agility. SEO depth, risk disclaimers, and compliance-ready publishing aren’t just best practices — they’re the price of admission. As the standout data-driven agency with a boutique approach to crypto communications, Outset PR emphasizes the importance of tailoring media planning to business goals, market dynamics, and regional nuances.

Fast forward to today, and it’s a full-blown global asset. Price predictions for Bitcoin are already climbing toward the $127,000 mark, with analysts forecasting an 18 percent climb. But something surprising is happening in parallel. Those same experts are now tracking a lesser-known token that is igniting early-buyer excitement all over again: Bitcoin Solaris. While Bitcoin moves like a freight train, Bitcoin Solaris is more like a rocket on standby. Bitcoin Still Leads, But It’s Slowing Down Bitcoin remains the king. No dispute there. Its scarcity and security make it the foundation of the crypto market. But innovation isn’t its strongest suit. Its TPS hovers under 10, smart contracts are clunky, and forget about mobile mining. It’s digital gold, yes. But it’s not designed for the mobile-first, app-powered economy we live in now. The Bitcoin Solaris Difference Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just another altcoin chasing Bitcoin’s shadow. It’s designed to go further and faster by solving the limitations that have long held back Bitcoin. From the ground up, Bitcoin Solaris reimagines what Bitcoin could look like if it launched in today’s world. Forget the Old Playbook BTC-S Wrote a New One Its core breakthroughs include: A dual-consensus model combining Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake Validator rotation for decentralization and security Smart contracts that support DeFi, enterprise, and real-world integrations A blazing fast dual-layer architecture that reaches over 10,000 transactions per second Energy efficiency at scale, using 99.95 percent less energy than traditional mining models These aren’t small upgrades. They’re seismic shifts. Mobile Mining: Power in Your Pocket At the heart of the Bitcoin Solaris experience is the upcoming Solaris Nova app. This isn’t some theoretical interface. It’s a real mobile-first infrastructure built to make mining accessible to anyone with a smartphone. The mining calculator available here shows just how powerful the rewards can be. Users don’t need bulky hardware or deep technical know-how. All it takes is a phone and a few taps, and suddenly they’re participating in a decentralized economy with real income potential. Analysts, Investors, and Influencers All Locked In Crypto influencers and market analysts aren’t sitting this one out. A growing number are zooming in on Bitcoin Solaris and its explosive upside. One of the most comprehensive reviews comes from Token Empire , who covered the unique features, performance, and the overall buzz around BTC-S. The takeaway? This isn’t a flash-in-the-pan token. It’s built to scale, adapt, and possibly surpass expectations, the way early Bitcoin once did. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini games for its holders for a chance to earn daily rewards, checkout all the details here. Real Rewards. Real Ecosystem. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t offering just theoretical benefits. Its reward distribution system is designed for long-term sustainability and fairness. Miners, validators, and contributors are all part of an ecosystem that respects both time and effort. Here’s how it works: Rewards are distributed across both consensus layers Time-weighted calculations ensure long-term participants earn more High-performing devices yield higher returns Contribution scores are factored in to prioritize active participation The design doesn’t just reward activity. It rewards loyalty. Presale Momentum: The Window is Closing The Bitcoin Solaris presale is heating up fast. Currently in Phase 10 at $10, it’s preparing to jump to $11 very soon. With a final launch price of $20, early participants stand to gain up to 150 percent just by entering before July 31. More than 13,650 users have already joined, raising over 6 million dollars. It’s being described by many as one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. Less than 5 weeks left to enter Over 11,000 users already on board Dubbed the shortest presale in crypto history To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask for seamless delivery. Security and Trust Already in Place Trust in the crypto world comes with proof. Bitcoin Solaris has already been audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , two of the most respected audit firms in the space. And community growth continues through its Telegram and X pages: Telegram X Investors are not just betting on hype. They’re betting on verified infrastructure. Final Verdict: The Next Bitcoin Might Already Be Here Bitcoin Solaris is not trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s extending its value with speed, utility, and accessibility that Bitcoin can no longer achieve. If you missed out on buying Bitcoin at $100, this might be your second chance. Analysts certainly think so, and judging by the presale momentum, thousands of early adopters agree. The door is open. The question is: Are you stepping through it?

This publicly listed Japanese firm, known for its bold pivot into BTC investments , reported a significant revenue increase, highlighting a growing trend of corporate embrace of digital assets. What does this remarkable performance mean for the future of institutional adoption and the broader crypto market? Metaplanet Bitcoin: A Strategic Pivot in Japan In an era where traditional finance grapples with inflation and economic uncertainties, companies are seeking innovative ways to preserve and grow capital. Metaplanet Bitcoin stands out as a prime example of this strategic evolution. Formerly a traditional financial services firm, Metaplanet made headlines when it announced a significant shift in its treasury strategy, opting to convert substantial portions of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. This move, echoing strategies employed by global pioneers like MicroStrategy, positioned Metaplanet as a leading Japanese Crypto Firm committed to leveraging Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. The decision was rooted in a deep understanding of macroeconomic pressures, particularly the weakening Japanese Yen and the global inflationary environment. By embracing Institutional BTC Adoption , Metaplanet aimed to protect its balance sheet from currency devaluation while capitalizing on Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation. Their initial significant acquisitions set the stage for what has now become a testament to their foresight. Decoding Metaplanet’s Impressive Bitcoin Revenue The latest official announcement from Metaplanet reveals a compelling success story. For the second quarter of the year, the company reported a staggering revenue of 1,097.25 million yen, equivalent to approximately $7.57 million in Bitcoin Revenue . This figure represents a robust 42.4% increase compared to their first-quarter performance, signaling accelerated growth and profitability stemming directly from their digital asset strategy. As of June 30, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings reached an impressive 13,350 BTC. This substantial accumulation underscores their unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The revenue reported is primarily attributed to the appreciation of their Bitcoin holdings during the second quarter, demonstrating the tangible financial benefits that can accrue from well-timed and strategic BTC investments . This growth trajectory highlights Bitcoin’s increasing viability as a corporate treasury solution, moving beyond speculative trading to become a recognized asset class for balance sheet management. The Growing Wave of Institutional BTC Adoption in Japan Metaplanet’s success is not an isolated incident but rather a significant indicator of a broader shift towards Institutional BTC Adoption within Japan and across Asia. For years, Japan has been a key player in the cryptocurrency space, with a progressive regulatory framework that has fostered innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Metaplanet’s public commitment and now demonstrated financial success could serve as a powerful catalyst for other Japanese Crypto Firm s and corporations to explore similar strategies. The benefits of such adoption are manifold: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin offers a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies, providing a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Asset Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term appreciation, offering potential capital gains for corporate treasuries. Strategic Diversification: Including Bitcoin diversifies a company’s asset portfolio, reducing reliance on traditional assets and market cycles. Technological Edge: Embracing digital assets positions companies at the forefront of financial innovation, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges, including market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and the need for robust security infrastructure to manage significant BTC investments . What Do Metaplanet’s Q2 Earnings Mean for the Future? The strong Q2 Earnings Crypto report from Metaplanet provides valuable insights into the potential trajectory of corporate Bitcoin strategies. This success story is likely to embolden Metaplanet to continue its accumulation strategy, potentially increasing its Bitcoin holdings further in anticipation of future market appreciation. It also sends a clear message to other corporations contemplating similar moves: Bitcoin can indeed be a powerful tool for financial growth and stability when managed strategically. Looking ahead, Metaplanet’s performance could ignite a ripple effect across the Japanese corporate landscape. As more companies witness the tangible benefits of Bitcoin Revenue generated through strategic digital asset holdings, the pace of institutional adoption is expected to accelerate. This will not only strengthen Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class but also foster a more robust and mature crypto ecosystem globally. Global Implications of Strong Crypto Earnings Japan The impressive Q2 Earnings Crypto from a prominent Japanese Crypto Firm like Metaplanet resonates far beyond Japan’s borders. It reinforces the global narrative that Bitcoin is maturing into a viable, long-term asset for corporate treasuries. While MicroStrategy has long been the poster child for corporate Bitcoin adoption in the West, Metaplanet’s emergence as a significant player in Asia adds a crucial dimension to this trend. This success could inspire more publicly traded companies worldwide to consider Bitcoin as part of their balance sheet strategy. It validates the premise that holding Bitcoin can be a significant driver of shareholder value, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. The consistent reporting of positive Bitcoin Revenue by such firms strengthens the case for Bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset, paving the way for broader acceptance and integration into traditional financial systems. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Vision Pays Off Metaplanet’s second-quarter financial results are more than just numbers; they represent a significant milestone in the journey of institutional Bitcoin adoption. With a remarkable 42.4% increase in revenue, primarily driven by their BTC investments , Metaplanet has showcased the immense potential of integrating digital assets into corporate treasury strategies. Their commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and growth asset positions them as a vanguard among Japanese Crypto Firm s and a model for global corporations considering a similar strategic pivot. This success story reinforces Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its pivotal role in shaping the future of finance, signaling a robust outlook for continued Institutional BTC Adoption worldwide.

2025-07-02T15:30:07,"Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Surge Past 3 Million BTC As Treasury Firms Multiply–Report","Bitcoin’s role on company balance sheets is growing fast. According to a report , 199 entities now hold 3 million BTC, worth about $315 billion. That total has more than doubled since the start of 2024. It marks a clear shift in how big firms view crypto, not just as a trading asset but as a long‑term treasury play. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Surge Among those 199 entities, 147 public and private companies account for 1.1 million BTC (around $115 billion). Strategy, the pioneer in this space, holds 580,250 BTC—about $60 billion—and trades at a market cap of $104 billion. That gives it a Multiple on Net Asset Value (MNAV) of 1.7× today. Investors once paid up to 2× NAV for Strategy’s shares, reflecting confidence in its ability to grow BTC‑per‑share faster than anyone else. Valuing Pure Play Treasury Firms When a firm’s main business is holding Bitcoin , its shares need to outperform Bitcoin itself. That premium, known as MNAV, depends on faith in management and clear execution plans. Strategy has used three main tools since 2020: issuing convertible debt, running an At‑the‑Market stock program, and plowing free cash flow into spot Bitcoin. New rivals are copying and tweaking this playbook—letting holders swap coins for stock, buying underpriced firms to turn cash into BTC, and even adding private deals to raise funds. Debt Risks Loom Large An extended bear market could test these models. If Bitcoin falls and shares trade at or below NAV, debt‑heavy firms might struggle to refinance when notes come due. That could force them to sell Bitcoin into a downtrend, pushing prices lower. Smaller companies without Strategy’s scale will face higher borrowing costs and tougher terms. During a recession, margin calls and forced sales may cascade throughout the market, although most of these companies use equity financing mainly. Wider Industry Influence From September 2021, as soon as El Salvador legitimized BTC as legal tender, corporate demand grew. BlackRock’s launch of IBIT ETF in January 2024 further fueled it, and US President Donald Trump has talked about the economic function of Bitcoin. Now, new players from Japan’s Metaplanet to US‑based GameStop are rolling out treasury plans. Purpose‑built firms like Twenty One Capital and reverse‑merger entrants such as Strive and Nakamoto have staked their futures on Bitcoin. More Companies To Enter The Market? Experts expect more crypto treasury companies to emerge—covering assets like Solana and Ethereum as well. Early names include DeFi Development Corp with 420,000 SOL and SharpLink Gaming, which raised $425 million for ETH holdings. Many will fail, and the strongest will buy up weaker rivals. Thankfully, most rely on stock‑based financing, so a few collapses won’t topple the whole market. But those loaded with debt could still pose a wider threat.
