2025-07-02T10:58:08,"Matrixport Explained the Reason for the Recent Interest of Institutions in Bitcoin in Its Latest Analysis! Here Are the Details","In the latest analysis published by crypto financial services company Matrixport, it was stated that Bitcoin is in the process of transforming from a high-risk investment vehicle to a structurally safe asset class more suitable for institutional investors. Matrixport: Bitcoin Is Evolving into a New Asset Class for Institutional Investors According to Matrixport, Bitcoin’s ideal role for Wall Street is to use it as a “standalone” investment vehicle with low correlation to traditional assets, in order to diversify portfolios, thus providing protection against market volatility and allowing it to be included in institutional portfolios with peace of mind. However, the report emphasized that the correlation between Bitcoin and US stocks is still at a high level of 72%, indicating that Bitcoin is still not completely independent of classical markets. Although this correlation has weakened somewhat recently, this is attributed to Bitcoin lagging behind the S&P 500 while US stock markets have reached record levels. In contrast, the decline in Bitcoin's volatility is attracting the attention of institutional investors, especially those who are sensitive to risk management. Matrixport drew attention to Bitcoin's risk profile by saying, “Another criterion that is as important as return for institutional investors is the predictability and stability of the investment.” As a result, the Matrixport analysis included the following assessment: “The decrease in volatility and the decrease in correlation with the US stock markets make Bitcoin an asset that can be included in institutional investment portfolios. This transformation shows that Bitcoin has evolved from a high-risk speculative instrument to a new generation asset class that is more suitable for institutional balance criteria.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-02T10:55:42,"US Treasury OFAC Sanctions Russian Firms Associated With Cybercrimes","The post US Treasury OFAC Sanctions Russian Firms Associated With Cybercrimes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a US Department of the Treasury, recently targeted a Russian firm, Aeza Group, along with three associated entities, for its involvement in ransomware, infostealers, and dark markets related to crypto. OFAC sanctioned the four entities for their bulletproof hosting (BPH) on Tuesday. US Sanctioned Russian Aeza Group The Russian BPH provider, Aeza Group , was sanctioned by the US agency for facilitating cyber criminal activities that targeted victims worldwide, including in the US. “Cybercriminals continue to rely heavily on BPH service providers like Aeza Group to facilitate disruptive ransomware attacks, steal U.S. technology, and sell black-market drugs,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. Other Entities Involved in Crypto Crimes Sanctioned by OFAC OFAC also sanctioned three affiliated entities: UK-based Aeza International Ltd and its Russian Subsidiaries Aeza Logistics LLC Cloud Solutions LLC As noted by the Treasury, these accused infostealers often used to harvest personal identity information, passwords, and other sensitive credentials from compromised victims. Before selling them on darknet markets for profit, marking a widespread cybercrime. Additionally, OFAC also listed four key individuals connected to Aeza: Arsenii Aleksandrovich Penzev- CEO and 33% shareholder of Aeza Group Yurii Meruzhanovich Bozoyan- General director and 33% owner of Aeza Group Vladimir Vyacheslavovich Gast- Technical director of Aeza Group Igor Anatolyevich Knyazev- 33% owner of Aeza Group. OFAC’s Action Against the Crimes The TRM Labs reported that OFAC designated a TRON crypto address (TU4tDFRvcKhAZ1jdihojmBWZqvJhQCnJ4F) tied to Aeza Group payments and their illicit activities, which has received over $350,000 in funds. The Treasury reported that it continued to work on combating cybercrimes and targeting malicious actors in undermining the United States’ security systems. Additional Crime Connections of Aeza OFAC also accused Aeza of providing infrastructure services to BlackSprut, a centralized darknet market with more than $900 million in incoming funds. These dark markets have been linked to fentanyl trafficking through the sale of fentanyl precursor chemicals. Aeza Group also hosted infrastructure for ransomware groups such as BianLian (which received more than $2 million in ransoms) and infostealer operations, including Meduza and Luma. With emerging cybercrimes, crypto hacks, and asset thefts, it is crucial for crypto investors to thoroughly follow the universal guidelines and not get thrilled by “too good to be true” offers. As the federal agencies are actively working to secure the crypto platforms, it is also necessary for the users to double-check the guidelines.

2025-07-02T10:50:10,"Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs’ Bold Vetoes Challenge Bitcoin State Reserves","BitcoinWorld Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs’ Bold Vetoes Challenge Bitcoin State Reserves The world of cryptocurrency is dynamic, and legislative efforts to integrate digital assets into state finances are becoming increasingly common. However, not all proposals sail smoothly through the political waters. In a significant move that has caught the attention of the crypto community, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has once again demonstrated her cautious approach towards incorporating Bitcoin into the state’s financial strategy. Her recent veto of HB 2324 marks the third such rejection of a “Bitcoin Reserve” bill during the current legislative session, signaling a clear stance on the perceived risks of state-held digital assets. Why is Arizona a Battleground for Bitcoin Legislation? Arizona has emerged as a fascinating case study in the ongoing debate surrounding state adoption of cryptocurrencies. For several legislative sessions, proponents have pushed for bills that would allow the state to hold digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, as part of its treasury reserves. The rationale often centers on the potential for hedging against inflation, diversifying state investments, and positioning Arizona as a forward-thinking hub for financial innovation. However, these ambitious proposals have consistently met resistance from the Governor’s office, highlighting a fundamental disagreement on the prudence of such moves. Proponents’ View: Advocates argue that holding Bitcoin could offer a hedge against fiat currency devaluation, provide a high-growth investment opportunity, and attract tech-savvy businesses and individuals to the state. Opponents’ View: Critics, including Governor Hobbs, typically cite concerns about Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, the lack of a clear regulatory framework, and the potential for significant taxpayer risk should the market experience a downturn. Understanding the Vetoed Bills and Crypto Legislation Governor Hobbs’ recent veto of HB 2324 is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a pattern observed throughout the current legislative period. This particular bill aimed to establish a reserve of digital assets specifically sourced from criminal asset forfeitures. While seemingly a logical way to utilize seized funds, the Governor’s office appears to view any direct state ownership of volatile cryptocurrencies as too risky. This veto follows two earlier rejections: SB 1373: This bill sought to create a broader state reserve of digital assets intended for general state investment purposes. SB 1025: Similar to SB 1373, this proposal also aimed to establish a digital asset reserve for state investment. The consistent rejection of these bills underscores a cautious approach to state-level crypto integration. The core concern revolves around the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential for public funds to be exposed to significant market fluctuations. This legislative dance in Arizona reflects a broader national conversation about how states should engage with the rapidly evolving digital economy. The Significance of Digital Assets in State Policy The debate in Arizona isn’t just about Bitcoin; it’s about the broader role of digital assets in public finance. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance, states are increasingly exploring ways to interact with them, whether through taxation, regulatory frameworks, or direct ownership. The idea of a “Bitcoin reserve” or “digital asset reserve” is not unique to Arizona, with other states also considering similar measures. Proponents often highlight: Potential Benefit Description Inflation Hedge Bitcoin’s fixed supply is often cited as a protection against inflationary pressures on traditional fiat currencies. Investment Diversification Adding a non-correlated asset class to a state’s portfolio could theoretically reduce overall risk and enhance returns. Technological Leadership Embracing digital assets could position a state as innovative and attractive to blockchain businesses. However, the challenges are equally significant. Volatility remains a primary concern, as do regulatory uncertainties, security risks associated with digital asset custody, and the need for specialized expertise within state treasuries. The ongoing legislative battles in Arizona serve as a crucial barometer for how these benefits and risks are weighed by policymakers. What’s Next for Arizona and State Reserves ? Despite the series of vetoes, it’s not a complete shutdown for crypto-related legislation in Arizona. Governor Hobbs did sign one related measure into law: HB 2749. This bill establishes a crypto reserve, but notably, it is tied to unclaimed property rather than general state investments or criminal forfeitures. This distinction is crucial: HB 2749 (Signed): Focuses on unclaimed property, which typically involves assets that are already digital or have a clear digital equivalent. This might be seen as less speculative than directly investing state funds from taxes or general revenue into highly volatile assets like Bitcoin. Vetoed Bills (HB2324, SB1373, SB1025): Aimed for broader investment or utilization of forfeited assets, implying direct exposure to market volatility for state funds. This nuanced approach suggests that while the Governor is wary of speculative investments with taxpayer money, she is open to measures that integrate digital assets in a more controlled or administratively necessary manner. The future of Bitcoin and other digital assets in Arizona’s state reserves will likely depend on continued legislative efforts, evolving market stability, and perhaps a clearer federal regulatory framework. As the digital economy continues to grow, states like Arizona will remain at the forefront of these complex and often contentious debates. The legislative journey for Bitcoin and digital asset reserves in Arizona is far from over. Governor Hobbs’ consistent vetoes highlight the deep-seated caution many policymakers hold regarding the integration of volatile cryptocurrencies into state finances. While the dream of a robust state-held Bitcoin reserve remains on hold, the signing of HB 2749 indicates a pragmatic willingness to engage with digital assets in specific, less speculative contexts. This ongoing dialogue in Arizona offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities states face as they navigate the burgeoning world of decentralized finance, underscoring the delicate balance between innovation and fiscal responsibility.

2025-07-02T10:41:56,"Connecticut Bans Crypto Payments and Reserves in State Government","Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont has signed a bill into law that will restrict the use of digital assets within state government operations, signaling a cautious stance toward cryptocurrencies. On Monday, Lamont approved Connecticut House Bill 7082, which had earlier passed through the state’s House of Representatives and Senate with considerable debate. The legislation prohibits the state government from accepting payments in the form of virtual currency or establishing a crypto reserve for any operational or investment purposes. These provisions will officially take effect on October 1, underscoring a clear policy direction away from direct state-level crypto engagement while other U.S. states explore building crypto reserves to diversify their treasuries. Connecticut Chooses a Different Path The bill, introduced by state Representative Jason Doucette in February, also outlines additional requirements for crypto money transmission licensees operating in Connecticut, adding layers of consumer protection while restricting government crypto transactions. This move sharply contrasts with initiatives in states like New Hampshire, which have recently moved to establish state-run cryptocurrency reserves as part of their financial infrastructure strategies. Brogan Law founder Aaron Brogan described Connecticut’s move as largely symbolic amid growing national debates on cryptocurrency use, particularly under former President Donald Trump’s administration, which has expressed support for expanding federal crypto holdings. Brogan noted, “This is signaling that Connecticut is symbolically opposed to cryptocurrency, and to all the states that have established Bitcoin reserves,” while emphasizing that the bill would “do nothing of substance” to affect broader market dynamics. Crypto Reserves Across States While Connecticut moves to restrict state crypto involvement, other states remain open to the potential of digital assets. Texas Governor Greg Abbott approved legislation in June to establish a crypto reserve, while New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte signed a similar bill in May. At the federal level, Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to create a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile,” signaling a contrasting approach to crypto in government reserves. Meanwhile, efforts to pass Bitcoin reserve bills failed in states such as South Dakota, Montana, and Pennsylvania, showing how divided the policy landscape remains across the country. As Connecticut enacts its restrictions, it highlights the ongoing debate within the United States over how digital assets should interact with public finances and state governance.

2025-07-02T10:30:45,"Altcoin Season Index Plummets: Is Bitcoin Season Dominating the Crypto Market?","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Plummets: Is Bitcoin Season Dominating the Crypto Market? The pulse of the cryptocurrency world is constantly shifting, and understanding its rhythm is crucial for any investor. Currently, a significant signal from the Altcoin Season Index is grabbing attention: it sits at a mere 20. This low number isn’t just a statistic; it’s a powerful indicator that the market has decisively entered a ‘Bitcoin Season’. What does this mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate these evolving crypto market trends ? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 20 Really Mean? For those closely watching the ebb and flow of digital assets, the Altcoin Season Index is a critical metric. Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index provides a snapshot of the broader market’s sentiment and direction. On July 2, at 00:56 UTC, the index registered 20, a slight dip from the previous day’s figure. This seemingly small number carries substantial weight, confirming a period of Bitcoin Season . So, how is this index calculated, and what do its scores signify? Let’s break it down: Exclusions: The index specifically excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to focus purely on the performance of volatile, independent assets. Scope: It compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. This broad scope gives a comprehensive view of the market’s health beyond just the major players. Altcoin Season Threshold: For the market to be declared in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority – at least 75% – of these top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. This indicates a broad-based rally in alternative cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Season Threshold: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when 25% or fewer of these top 100 coins manage to outperform Bitcoin. An index score of 20, as we see now, clearly falls into this category, indicating Bitcoin’s strong dominance. Index Range: The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a stronger Altcoin Season and lower scores pointing towards Bitcoin dominance. A score of 20 unequivocally tells us that Bitcoin is currently leading the charge, with most altcoins struggling to keep pace or even losing ground against the flagship cryptocurrency. Why Are We in Bitcoin Season? Analyzing Current Crypto Market Trends The shift into a dominant Bitcoin Season isn’t arbitrary; it’s a reflection of underlying market dynamics and investor behavior. Several factors often contribute to Bitcoin’s outperformance: Flight to Safety: In times of uncertainty or market volatility, investors often de-risk by moving capital from more speculative altcoins into Bitcoin, which is perceived as a safer, more established store of value within the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin’s larger market cap and longer track record make it a less volatile option compared to many altcoins. Pre-Halving Rallies: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, historically precede significant price appreciation. As a halving approaches, anticipation builds, drawing capital into Bitcoin in expectation of future gains. Institutional Interest: When institutional investors enter the crypto space, they often start with Bitcoin due to its liquidity, regulatory clarity (in some regions), and established infrastructure (like Bitcoin ETFs). This influx of large capital can significantly boost Bitcoin’s price. Dominance Cycle: The crypto market often moves in cycles. Periods of Bitcoin dominance are frequently followed by altcoin surges once Bitcoin consolidates its gains, and vice versa. We are currently in a phase where Bitcoin is reclaiming its market share. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation, and global geopolitical events can also influence capital flows. When traditional markets are uncertain, some investors might turn to Bitcoin as a hedge, further solidifying its position. The current score of 20 on the Altcoin Season Index strongly suggests that one or more of these factors are at play, pushing Bitcoin to the forefront of investor interest and capital allocation. Navigating Altcoin Performance: What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? When the Altcoin Season Index signals a strong Bitcoin Season, it has direct implications for altcoin performance . For many investors, this period can be challenging, especially if their portfolios are heavily weighted towards altcoins. Challenges for Altcoin Holders: Underperformance: Most altcoins will likely underperform Bitcoin, meaning their value in Bitcoin terms (e.g., ETH/BTC, ADA/BTC) will decline. Increased Volatility: While Bitcoin can be volatile, many altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, experience even greater price swings during Bitcoin Season. Reduced Liquidity: Capital often flows out of altcoins, leading to lower trading volumes and potentially wider bid-ask spreads, making it harder to enter or exit positions. Potential Opportunities: Accumulation: For long-term investors, a Bitcoin Season can present an opportunity to accumulate quality altcoins at lower prices against Bitcoin. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: This period often shakes out weaker projects, allowing fundamentally strong altcoins to distinguish themselves. Bitcoin Gains: If you hold Bitcoin, this is a period where your primary asset is likely appreciating, potentially setting the stage for future altcoin rotations. It’s crucial not to panic sell during such times. Instead, a thoughtful analysis of your holdings and the market landscape is warranted. Smart Cryptocurrency Investment: Strategies for Bitcoin Season Given the current state of the Altcoin Season Index , adapting your cryptocurrency investment strategies is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio Allocation: Consider increasing your Bitcoin allocation, especially if you believe Bitcoin’s dominance will continue. A higher Bitcoin weighting can help preserve capital and potentially generate gains that can be rotated into altcoins later. Focus on Bitcoin Accumulation: If you’re looking to grow your crypto holdings, consider directing new capital towards Bitcoin. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin during this period can be an effective strategy. Identify Strong Altcoin Candidates: Not all altcoins will perform poorly. Look for projects with strong fundamentals, active development, clear use cases, and solid communities. These might be the first to rebound when the market shifts. Consider Staking and Yield Farming: While price action might be slow for altcoins, you can still earn passive income through staking or yield farming on stable, reputable platforms. This allows you to accumulate more assets without actively trading. Risk Management is Key: Set stop-losses, avoid over-leveraging, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The market can always go lower, and protecting your capital is always the top priority. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index, Bitcoin dominance charts, and broader market news. Changes in macroeconomics, regulatory environments, or significant project developments can signal shifts in market sentiment. Remember, market cycles are natural. A Bitcoin Season often precedes an Altcoin Season, creating a dynamic interplay that seasoned investors learn to leverage. When Will Altcoin Season Return? The Future of Altcoin Performance While the current Altcoin Season Index reading points firmly to Bitcoin’s dominance, the crypto market is famously cyclical. The question on many investors’ minds is: what will trigger the next Altcoin Season? Historically, Altcoin Seasons tend to follow periods of strong Bitcoin performance. Once Bitcoin has made significant gains and perhaps consolidated, capital often begins to flow down the risk curve into altcoins. This ‘trickle-down’ effect can be fueled by: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: After a strong rally, if Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or enters a period of sideways trading, investors might seek higher returns in altcoins. Major Altcoin Innovations: Breakthroughs in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 scaling solutions, or new blockchain paradigms can attract significant capital and spark individual altcoin rallies that eventually spread across the market. Narrative Shifts: New compelling narratives (e.g., AI integration, GameFi, Real World Assets) can drive interest and investment into specific altcoin categories. Reduced Bitcoin Dominance: As Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance percentage begins to decline, it often signals that altcoins are starting to gain ground. Monitoring these factors, alongside the Altcoin Season Index itself, will be key to identifying the early signs of a shift back towards widespread altcoin outperformance. Patience and strategic positioning during Bitcoin Season can pay dividends when the market eventually rotates. Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of Crypto Investment The Altcoin Season Index currently at 20 is a clear indicator that we are firmly entrenched in a Bitcoin Season. This means Bitcoin is leading the charge, and most altcoins are struggling to keep pace. For investors, this period calls for a strategic approach focused on understanding the current crypto market trends and adapting their cryptocurrency investment strategies. While altcoin performance might be subdued now, this cycle is a natural part of the crypto market’s evolution. By focusing on Bitcoin accumulation, identifying strong altcoin fundamentals, and practicing robust risk management, investors can not only navigate this period but also position themselves for future opportunities when the tides inevitably turn back towards altcoins. Staying informed and patient will be your most valuable assets in these dynamic times.

2025-07-02T10:30:32,"BTC may be due a new liquidity boost as US M2 money supply hits new record","The wider M2 money supply in the USA moved up to a new record at $21.94 trillion. The money supply has climbed rapidly in 2025, a metric that is closely watched for its effect on the crypto market. The M2 money supply for the USA expanded to a new record, with $21.94 trillion in circulation. The M2 metric closely correlates with the performance of assets, including BTC, potentially signaling ongoing gains for crypto. The US money supply hit a new record, also boosting the global M2 money. | Source: Federal Reserve The metric started climbing from a low of $20.7 trillion in 2023, coinciding with the reawakening of crypto after the years-long bear market. The expansion of the M2 coincides with another debt ceiling crisis looming. The Fed may have to continue with the monetary easing, further growing the available M2 and boosting market confidence. BTC still follows the M2 trend closely Over time, BTC has shown a correlation to both the global and US-based M2 supply. BTC lagged the indicator by a few months, being especially reactive to an M2 supply squeeze. A similar lag is seen in BTC expansion, which lags M2 growth by 3-6 months. On a shorter time scale, the M2 global money supply predicted the April BTC rally, when the price broke out and revisited levels above $100,000. On some occasions, the BTC price rally lags by only 1-2 weeks after shifts in the money supply. BTC has sometimes surged ahead during periods of low M2 growth, but those rallies are now seen as signs of a bubble. If the BTC price moves more closely to the M2 supply, the effects may be a more sustainable trend, when the market has not yet peaked with a short-term bubble. Global M2 money supply expands more gradually The global M2 money supply has been expanding more gradually in the past five years, based on data from the four leading central banks. As of July 2025, the M2 supply is at $93.69 trillion, growing by 7.45% in the past year. The recent BTC growth far outpaces the money supply, based on additional directed liquidity from stablecoins. However, the general sense of growing inflation and stock market exuberance is also translating into crypto expansion. While crypto activity is highly concentrated in the USA, China may also be a source of growing liquidity. The M2 money supply of China has been expanding for the past decade, with no slowdowns even during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, China’s M2 supply is over $44 trillion, more than double the liquidity of the USA. Global liquidity is even more closely watched in relation to BTC and its potential performance in the second half of 2025. BTC is now seen as lagging , while the M2 trends may boost the price to new price peaks up to $150,000 per BTC. The recent performance of BTC is raising questions about the effect of demand. The M2 chart is seen as a potential trigger, where corporate and ETF buying are too small to drive up valuations. The global M2 growth, however, coincides with a period of uncertainty, though still potentially affecting the nominal prices of all assets.

2025-07-02T10:30:29,"Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard","A growing number of Bitcoin and crypto market participants have fallen victim to a dangerous assumption: that summer in the crypto markets is synonymous with stagnation. However, crypto analyst Cristian Chifoi warns that this summer may follow a drastically different script. In a video analysis released on July 1, Chifoi lays out a compelling case that 2025 fits a historical pattern that has previously delivered some of Bitcoin’s strongest summer performances. Summer 2025 Could Flip Bitcoin’s Script Chifoi’s thesis is based on a concept he has long explored: Bitcoin seasonality—a recurring, cyclical behavior in Bitcoin’s price action across the calendar year, especially in relation to the four-year halving cycles. According to Chifoi, there is an identifiable seasonal window from mid-January to mid-March where Bitcoin historically shows explosive movement in one direction, only to reverse course in the subsequent months. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm—Bitcoin Could Explode Soon This pattern has held across multiple years and cycles. In 2021, for example, Bitcoin rallied from $28,000 to $60,000 between January and March before collapsing back to $28,000 by summer. The opposite occurred in 2023, when Bitcoin dumped in Q1 and reversed upwards during summer. “From January 22nd to March 11th [2024], we had a 2x on Bitcoin,” Chifoi noted. “And if the price moves in one direction in this window, it tends to do the exact opposite after that. That’s the seasonality reversal.” Chifoi highlighted this tendency across previous cycles as well, identifying the same trend flip in 2022, 2023, and most notably in 2021. Critically, Chifoi warns that while most traders are anchored to the recent past—recalling three consecutive “boring” summers—this year is historically aligned with a different kind of setup. “Nobody is prepared for this summer,” he said. “Because people only look at the past three years. But those were not the years to look at.” Instead, Chifoi compares 2025 to three historical analogues: 2013, 2017, and 2021—all years that followed a halving and saw significant summer rallies. In each of those years, after early-year volatility or corrections, Bitcoin posted dramatic gains from mid-July into early September. In 2017, Bitcoin rallied 160% in that timeframe. In 2021, the move was 77%. “The common factor in those years? They were one year after a halving, with a post-March reversal in trend,” Chifoi explained. “Now we are in the same window again. And people are not looking at it.” First Crash, Then Surge? The analyst also emphasized that current price action fits his broader fractal thesis. After Bitcoin’s local top at $109K earlier this year and the rejection that followed, the market appears to be chopping sideways—something he predicted back in late 2024. He expects this phase to continue into July 20, potentially ending with a sudden flush to the downside. But this, he argues, would be the setup for the next leg higher. “Don’t be surprised if the drop comes with a lot of bad news,” he said. “Every time there’s a dump before a rally, the media has a narrative ready. That doesn’t mean it’s real. It just means the market is doing what it always does—shake out the majority.” Related Reading: Analyst Calls For Bitcoin Crash As Price Pulls Above $108,000 — Details Chifoi also addressed broader market confluences, notably pointing out similar behavior in the S&P 500, where a corrective move in early July appears to align with his crypto timing model. He expects a pullback in both markets to precede the next upward thrust, targeting a Fibonacci resistance zone that historically acts as a pause point during price discovery. Despite his bullishness, Chifoi made it clear he’s not buying Bitcoin right now. “I already bought below $20K,” he said. “At this point, I’m watching altcoin charts, looking for pullbacks to accumulate.” He expressed frustration at the prevailing narratives circulating among large X accounts, particularly those pushing for rotating altcoins into Bitcoin under the assumption that dominance will rise indefinitely. “This is very stupid,” he said bluntly. “The market is behaving exactly as it should—for the fewest number of people to make money.” In closing, Chifoi cautioned that those who insist on saying this time is different will likely find themselves on the wrong side of the trade. “Only if this time is different will this not play out. But if you base your strategy on those words, I can guarantee you 99% of the time, you won’t make money.” As the July 20 pivot approaches, Chifoi’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s next move may catch a complacent market off guard. Whether or not history rhymes once more, the veteran analyst has made his stance clear: this is not a summer to sleep through. At press time, BTC traded at $106,880.

2025-07-02T10:27:11,"Who is Selling Their BTC at These Prices? Glassnode Reveals Bitcoin Profit Takers","About a month ago, market analysts noted that profit-taking on the Bitcoin network was modest. However, that has changed. The on-chain insights provider Glassnode has revealed that profit-taking on the leading digital network is ramping up again. This comes as Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a consolidation phase following weeks of upward movement. BTC Holders Take Profits According to Glassnode’s tweet, bitcoin’s realized profits hit $2.46 billion on June 30, while the network’s seven-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) spiked to $1.52 billion. The SMA, which identifies trends by averaging prices over a specific period, is currently above its year-to-date (YTD) average of $1.14 billion. However, the metric is still below its November-December 2024 peak of approximately $4.5 billion. The spike in Bitcoin’s seven-day SMA indicates that coin distribution on the network is on the rise. Mid-to-long-term BTC holders have been leading this profit-taking spree; Glassnode said investors aged three to five years have realized at least $849 million in profits. This cohort of market participants is followed by those aged seven to ten years, with $485 million in profits, and investors aged one to two years with $445 million. Short-term BTC holders, those holding for under one year, have been cashing out the least gains, at less than $6 million. Interestingly, older BTC holders have been leading the profit-taking for this cycle. CryptoPotato reported a rise in spending by this cohort in late May, which drove the aggregate volume for the one- to five-year cohorts to $4 billion, its highest level since February. While older investors take the lead, the bulk of the volume is coming from this particular group of Bitcoin holders. Whales Are Redistributing Too Glassnode’s latest report is further substantiated by an analysis from the institutional decentralized finance (DeFi) analytics platform, Sentora (previously known as IntoTheBlock). The firm disclosed that wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC have been steadily reducing their balances. This indicates that although institutional money is flowing into Bitcoin, whales are still offloading their holdings. It is worth mentioning that Sentora sees the redistribution by whales as a sign of a maturing market rather than weakness. Older whale coins being dispersed could become a dynamic that would strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Meanwhile, BTC was still consolidating at the time of writing, hovering under $110,000 – a level, which it has remained confined to in the last few weeks.

The bill proposed directing the first $300,000 of confiscated digital assets to the Attorney General’s office, with the remainder split: 50% to the AG, 25% to the state’s general fund, and 25% to the reserve fund. Governor Hobbs rejected the proposal, arguing it would “disincentivize local enforcement” from participating in digital asset forfeiture, as it removed seized assets from local jurisdictions. Although HB 2324 passed the House with a 34-22 vote, a veto override now appears unlikely. Hobbs’ Ongoing Crypto Caution This is not the first time Governor Hobbs has blocked crypto-related legislation. In May, she vetoed Senate Bill 1025, which would have allowed the state to invest up to 10% of its funds in Bitcoin, calling crypto “untested investments.” She also rejected Senate Bill 1373, which proposed a similar reserve of seized digital assets. However, not all crypto measures were blocked. In May, Hobbs signed House Bill 2749, which amends Arizona’s financial and unclaimed property laws, enabling the state treasurer to manage crypto assets under specific regulatory frameworks — but without using seized funds. Arizona vs Other Pro-Crypto States Arizona’s conservative stance contrasts with pro-crypto efforts in other states. Texas recently passed a bill to create its own Bitcoin reserve , while New Hampshire approved legislation permitting investment in crypto and precious metals. Six more U.S. states are advancing similar initiatives. [post_titles_links postid=”477619″] Mixed Reaction From the Crypto Community The veto drew mixed reactions. While some supported the cautious regulatory stance, others criticized it as a missed opportunity. Crypto commentator Frank Corva voiced skepticism over the governor’s reasoning, questioning whether police departments should benefit from asset seizures. Another user pointed out that law enforcement motivation may drop if local agencies don’t receive a share of seized crypto — a logic Corva found troubling. What’s Next for Crypto in Arizona? With SB 1062 and other proposals still active, Arizona remains a battleground for how digital assets are integrated into government frameworks. Governor Hobbs’ decision has further ignited the national debate over crypto’s role in public finance and criminal asset management. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs What does Arizona’s House Bill 2749 do, and how is it different from the vetoed bills? House Bill 2749, signed by Governor Hobbs, amends Arizona’s financial and unclaimed property laws. It allows the state treasurer to manage unclaimed crypto assets and deposit staking rewards or airdrops into a reserve fund. This differs from vetoed bills like HB 2324, which focused on seized crypto assets, and SB 1025/SB 1373, which proposed direct state investment of public funds into crypto. How do other states’ crypto reserve initiatives compare to Arizona’s rejected proposals? Arizona’s approach, particularly with Governor Hobbs’ vetoes, is more cautious than other states. While Arizona rejected direct investment of public funds or full redirection of seized assets, states like Texas and New Hampshire have approved initiatives for state Bitcoin reserves, sometimes allowing direct investment or retaining seized assets rather than immediately liquidating them, showcasing varied approaches to integrating crypto into public finance. How does the allocation of seized crypto assets currently work in Arizona, given the veto? With the veto of HB 2324, the article implies that seized crypto assets in Arizona are not currently being directed to a new state-managed “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” in the manner proposed. While the specific current allocation isn’t detailed, Governor Hobbs’ concern was that the bill would remove assets from local jurisdictions, suggesting local law enforcement previously retained a share.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/arizona-wont-build-bitcoin-fund-with-seized-assets-says-governor-katie-hobbs/,"BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|ALTCOIN|MARKET","News|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare

Bitcoin managed to come on top, but the majority of altcoins are feeling the pressure. Total liquidaitons across the entire sector also increased considerably, approaching the $260 million mark. Bitcoin Price Plunges to $105K but Recovers Starting with Bitcoin, the past 24 hours saw it tumble toward a local daily low at around $105,145, but as you can see on the chart below, the cryptocurrency managed to pull off a V-shaped recover. As a result, it is currently trading at $107,720 and is up by almost 1% on the day. This comes amid important economic developments in the US where Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” passed Senate and moves on to the next step of the approval process. If accepted, many speculate that it could have a positive effect on the cryptocurrency markets because it would alleviate tax pressure on retail investors, potentially freeing up capital for riskier investments.

The situation is mixed, but many altcoins dropped by more than 3% during the day, which is indicative of the current dynamices where Bitcoin is clearly dominant. The best performer for today is PENGU – the native cryptocurrency of the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem, up by 6.3%. On the other side of the coin, we have Algorand’s ALGO, which is down 6.5%.

2025-07-02T10:13:23,"Wormhole price forms a risky pattern ahead of Coinbase listing","Wormhole appears poised for a bearish reversal, with technical indicators continuing to signal weakness ahead of a Coinbase listing. In a Tuesday announcement, Coinbase confirmed it would list Wormhole ( W ) on July 2 as an SPL token on the Solana network. Listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase often generate short-term bullish sentiment; however, in this case, the token has failed to attract meaningful investor interest ahead of the event. This listing comes shortly after Wormhole entered into a strategic partnership with Ripple Labs to integrate multi-chain interoperability with the XRP Ledger and its EVM-compatible sidechain. By enabling cross-chain messaging, asset transfers, and multi-chain token issuance, the partnership aims to strengthen the XRP Ledger’s capabilities. Yet these developments have failed to improve investor sentiment, as evident by Wormhole’s price action, which remains subdued. The token is currently down 77.6% year-to-date. After falling to an all-time low of $0.051 on June 22, it has only managed a modest recovery to $0.071 at the time of writing. You might also like: Senate passes Trump’s massive budget bill, with no mentions of crypto or Bitcoin Adding to the caution, most investors are currently underwater, and a small group of whales control the majority of the token supply. According to data from IntoTheBlock, 92% of Wormhole addresses are currently in losses, with 88% of the circulating supply concentrated in the hands of whales. This distribution raises the risk of large-scale sell-offs as these holders may seek to mitigate further losses, which could exacerbate price volatility. Source: IntoTheBlock Additional data from Nansen highlights further weakness in investor confidence. Influencers and publicly known accounts have reportedly been offloading their Wormhole holdings over the past week. Such actions by high-visibility figures often trigger negative sentiment among retail investors, adding to the selling pressure and undermining broader market support. W price analysis Wormhole’s market structure is also showing signs of stress, with a bearish pattern forming. On the 4-hour W/USDT chart, the token has broken below the lower boundary of an ascending broadening wedge, a volatile and typically bearish structure that had been forming since the token’s recent local bottom. W 4-hour price chart — July 1 | Source: crypto.news An ascending broadening wedge is characterized by expanding price swings and rising trendlines, which often means markets are becoming unstable and losing directional conviction. A breakdown below the lower trendline generally signals that bearish pressure is mounting and that a further drop may follow. Momentum indicators support this bearish outlook. The MACD lines have crossed to the downside, while the Relative Strength Index has retreated to neutral levels at 50. This suggests that bullish momentum has dissipated, and sellers are taking over. A negative Chaikin Money Flow reading further confirms this trend. W MACD and RSI chart — July 1 | Source: crypto.news Given these conditions, W may be poised to retest the $0.066 level, which corresponds with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement zone. A decisive break below this support could expose the token to further losses, potentially leading to a retest of its all-time low at $0.051. This level may serve as a temporary support zone, provided selling pressure eases. However, failure to hold above it could result in a deeper price correction.

2025-07-02T10:10:38,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unlocking Crucial Insights into Market Sentiment","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unlocking Crucial Insights into Market Sentiment The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic landscape, constantly influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from technological advancements to macroeconomic shifts. Yet, beneath the charts and headlines, lies a powerful, often overlooked force: human emotion. This is where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index steps in, offering a fascinating glimpse into the collective psyche of crypto investors. As of July 2, this crucial barometer, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a reading of 63. While this marks a slight dip of one point from the previous day, it importantly keeps the index firmly planted in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this really mean for your investments, and how can you leverage this insight for more informed decisions? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does 63 Mean for You? At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is designed to distill the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market into a single, digestible number. Ranging from 0 to 100, it provides a spectrum where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’. Think of it as a market thermometer for sentiment, gauging whether participants are feeling overly cautious or excessively exuberant. A reading of 63, as we see currently, places the market squarely in the ‘Greed’ territory. This suggests that investors are generally optimistic, confident, and perhaps even a little overzealous. While greed can fuel price rallies, pushing assets higher as more people pile in, it also carries inherent risks. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections, as the market becomes overbought and vulnerable to profit-taking or unexpected negative news. Conversely, extreme fear (readings closer to 0) often signals market bottoms, presenting potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to go against the prevailing sentiment. The index serves as a valuable counter-indicator for many experienced traders. When the market is in ‘Extreme Greed’, they might consider taking profits or reducing exposure, anticipating a potential downturn. When it’s in ‘Extreme Fear’, they might see it as a chance to accumulate assets at a discount, knowing that fear often leads to irrational selling. It’s a reminder that emotions, while powerful, can often lead to suboptimal investment decisions if not properly understood and managed. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: How is it Measured? The index isn’t just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key factors, each contributing to the overall crypto market sentiment . By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state. Here’s a breakdown of the six factors considered: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on the downside, can indicate fear, while stable or upward volatility might suggest confidence. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum of Bitcoin and compares it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume and strong upward momentum often correlate with greed, whereas low volume and downward momentum can signal fear. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for specific keywords related to cryptocurrency. It assesses the number of posts, their engagement, and the sentiment behind them. A surge in positive, hyped discussions can indicate greed, while negative, panic-driven conversations suggest fear. Surveys (15%): Historically, this component involved weekly polls to gather direct sentiment from investors. However, it’s important to note that the index currently states that surveys are paused. When active, these surveys offered a direct insight into investor expectations and confidence levels. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market. A rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear, as investors tend to flee riskier altcoins and consolidate into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven. Conversely, a falling dominance might suggest greed, as investors move into higher-risk, higher-reward altcoins. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes search query data for Bitcoin-related terms on Google. A sudden increase in search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin crash’ indicates fear, while a rise in general interest searches might suggest growing optimism or curiosity. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, moving beyond just price action to capture the underlying mood. The Pivotal Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Market Dynamics While the index considers the broader crypto market, Bitcoin dominance plays a uniquely significant role, accounting for 10% of the overall score. But what exactly is Bitcoin dominance, and why does it matter so much to the Fear & Greed Index? Bitcoin dominance refers to the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. For example, if Bitcoin’s market cap is $500 billion and the total crypto market cap is $1 trillion, then Bitcoin dominance is 50%. This metric is often seen as a bellwether for market sentiment and the overall health of the altcoin market. Historically, a rising Bitcoin dominance often occurs during periods of market uncertainty or downturns. When investors become fearful, they tend to sell off their more volatile altcoins and consolidate their holdings into Bitcoin, which is perceived as the less risky, more established digital asset. This flight to ‘safety’ within the crypto ecosystem drives Bitcoin’s market share higher, signaling fear or caution. Conversely, during bull markets, especially in the later stages, Bitcoin dominance often falls as investors become more confident and speculate on higher returns from altcoins, leading to an ‘altcoin season’. A falling dominance, therefore, can sometimes be associated with increasing greed and risk appetite. The index incorporates Bitcoin dominance because it offers a unique perspective on investor risk appetite. If Bitcoin’s share is growing, it suggests a defensive posture, a sign of fear. If it’s shrinking, it indicates a willingness to take on more risk, a sign of greed. This dynamic interplay highlights how even within the crypto market, different assets serve different psychological roles for investors, influencing the collective sentiment that the index captures. Navigating Investor Psychology: Are We Too Greedy? The core of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is rooted in investor psychology . Human emotions are powerful drivers, and in financial markets, they often lead to irrational decisions. When fear takes hold, people panic sell, often at the worst possible time. When greed reigns supreme, they buy impulsively, often at market tops, chasing quick profits. Consider the classic market cycle: accumulation, uptrend, distribution, downtrend. Each phase is heavily influenced by the prevailing emotions of market participants. During accumulation, fear is high, and few dare to buy. As the uptrend begins, optimism grows, eventually leading to euphoria and extreme greed at the peak. This is when everyone wants in, often fueled by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). However, it’s precisely at this point of maximum enthusiasm that smart money often begins to distribute, or sell, their holdings. Conversely, as prices fall, optimism turns to denial, then fear, and eventually capitulation, or extreme fear. This is when many retail investors give up, selling their assets at a loss, often at the very bottom, just before a new accumulation phase begins. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index attempts to quantify these emotional extremes, providing a tool to help investors recognize where the market might be in its emotional cycle. Being in the ‘Greed’ zone at 63 means that while the market isn’t at ‘Extreme Greed’ (which would be 75-100), there’s a strong underlying positive sentiment. This could mean continued upward momentum, but it also warrants caution. It’s a psychological trigger for investors to ask themselves: Am I making decisions based on sound analysis, or am I being swayed by the prevailing optimism? Understanding this psychological dynamic is crucial for long-term success in volatile markets like crypto. Actionable Insights for Your Market Analysis So, how can you effectively use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for your own market analysis and investment strategy? It’s not a crystal ball, but it’s a powerful tool when used correctly: 1. The Contrarian Approach: Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy, and Greedy When Others Are Fearful This timeless investing adage, often attributed to Warren Buffett, is perhaps the most direct application of the Fear & Greed Index. When the index is showing ‘Extreme Greed’ (75+), it might be a good time to consider taking some profits or reducing your exposure. The market could be overheated and due for a correction. Conversely, when the index plummets into ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-25), it could signal a generational buying opportunity, as assets are likely oversold due to panic. This requires courage and a strong conviction in your long-term investment thesis, as it means going against the crowd. 2. Complement, Don’t Rely Solely The index is a sentiment indicator, not a definitive buy or sell signal. It should always be used in conjunction with other forms of market analysis. Combine it with technical analysis (chart patterns, support/resistance levels, moving averages), fundamental analysis (project developments, adoption rates, regulatory news), and macroeconomic factors (inflation, interest rates, global events). If the index shows ‘Greed’ but your technical indicators are signaling overbought conditions and there’s negative news on the horizon, your caution should intensify. 3. Risk Management and Portfolio Adjustments Use the index to guide your risk management. During periods of ‘Greed’, consider reducing your position sizes or setting tighter stop-losses. During ‘Fear’, you might allocate a larger portion of your capital to new entries, assuming your research supports the underlying assets. It can help you determine whether to be more aggressive or more conservative with your portfolio allocation. 4. Understanding Market Cycles The index provides a visual representation of market cycles driven by emotion. By observing its fluctuations over time, you can gain a better understanding of how sentiment shifts and how these shifts often precede price movements. This long-term perspective can help you avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market noise. Challenges and Limitations: Not a Predictor: The index indicates current sentiment, not future price action with certainty. A market can remain ‘Greedy’ for extended periods, or ‘Fearful’ for longer than anticipated. Bitcoin-Centric: While it uses various factors, its heavy reliance on Bitcoin data means it might not perfectly reflect the sentiment of the entire altcoin market, especially smaller cap coins. Lagging vs. Leading: Some components of the index can be lagging indicators, meaning they reflect what has already happened rather than what will happen next. Surveys Paused: The absence of the survey component means one direct measure of investor opinion is currently missing, which could slightly alter its overall accuracy. Despite these limitations, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains an invaluable tool for any serious crypto investor looking to gain an edge by understanding the powerful role of human emotion in the markets. What’s Next for Crypto Market Sentiment? With the Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding steady in the ‘Greed’ zone at 63, the immediate outlook suggests continued optimism, albeit with a slight cooling off. The one-point dip could be a minor correction, profit-taking, or a brief moment of hesitation before the market decides its next major move. It’s a healthy sign that the market isn’t yet in ‘Extreme Greed’, which often precedes significant pullbacks. This slight moderation indicates that while confidence is high, it’s not yet at a frothy, unsustainable level. Going forward, keep an eye on the factors that influence the index. A sustained increase in volatility, particularly to the downside, or a sharp rise in Bitcoin dominance could push the index back towards ‘Fear’. Conversely, strong buying volume, positive social media sentiment, and sustained upward price momentum could propel it further into ‘Extreme Greed’. Macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and major project updates will also play a significant role in swaying collective sentiment. As always, staying informed and adapting your strategy to changing market conditions will be key. Concluding Thoughts: Mastering Emotional Investing The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a mirror reflecting the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Its current reading of 63, comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone, reminds us that optimism prevails, yet a slight pullback indicates a healthy dose of caution. By understanding the components of this index – from volatility and market momentum to Bitcoin dominance and investor psychology – you gain a powerful lens through which to view the market. It empowers you to move beyond impulsive decisions driven by emotion and instead, adopt a more strategic approach to your market analysis . While it should never be your sole guide, integrating this index into your broader investment framework can significantly enhance your ability to navigate the volatile yet rewarding world of cryptocurrencies, helping you to ‘be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.’ To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

2025-07-02T10:07:44,"Big Beautiful Bill Passes Without Crypto Tax Relief – Snorter Bot Offers a Path Forward","In a tight 51–50 vote, the US Senate has passed the highly anticipated ‘One Big Beautiful Act,’ a major budget reconciliation bill championed by President Donald Trump. Despite intense lobbying from crypto leaders, the final version of the bill passed by the Senate comes without any crypto tax reforms. The bill is to go back to the House of Representatives next for a second voting round before potentially heading to President Trump’s desk. As of right now, crypto-friendly policies are off the table. Still, frequent crypto trader can soon enjoy the lowest fees (just 0.85%) and the fastest executions on Solana thanks to Snorter Token ($SNORT) . Senate Refuses to Lower Tax for Small Crypto Transactions Among the most closely watched crypto proposals was an amendment from Senator Cynthia Lummis. She advocated for a de minimis capital gains exemption on crypto transactions under $300 (capped at $5K annually). BTC Inc.’s David Bailey and Gemini’s Tyler Winklevoss also expressed strong crypto support. Nevertheless, Lummis still believes that the bill is a ‘major step in the right direction’ and that it ‘delivers significant wins for working families across Wyoming.’ But there’s no denying that the lack of progress on crypto tax reforms adds uncertainty about how the US treats digital assets. This is especially true if you want to use them for everyday transactions without having to face cumbersome tax reporting. With unclear tax treatment on small crypto transactions, many investors might avoid centralized trading platforms altogether. This makes decentralized trading tools like Snorter Bot all the more valuable. While regulatory clarity remains elusive, Snorter could soon give you an edge in the crypto market, delivering automated swaps, sub-second speeds, and low fees when they’re most needed. Snorter Bot to Become Solana’s Sharpest Trading Bot Once launched on Telegram in Q3 2025, the Snorter Bot will help you auto-snipe the next crypto to explode . It will also flag scams and potential rug pulls before they strike, keeping you safe in a still unregulated meme coin market. Better yet, this bot executes trades faster and cheaper than any other bot on Solana. With trading fees as low as 0.85%, it undercuts big-name rivals like Maestro, Bonk Bot, and Banana Gun. Its built-in security measures, like smart contract scans and honeypot alerts, ensure you can move quickly without getting burned. Though it’s currently focused on Solana, Snorter Bot is already preparing to expand across major EVM-compatible chains , positioning itself as a future-proof, multi-chain trading platform. At the heart of it all is Snorter Token ($SNORT) . Holding the platform’s native token unlocks reduced fees, premium bot access, and juicy staking rewards (currently at a whopping 236% APY). And soon, by holding $SNORT, you’ll also be able to help shape the Snorter ecosystem’s future through its upcoming Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) . Your token bag will enable you to vote on key feature upgrades and the platform’s general direction to boost its sustainability. It’s not surprising that $SNORT has raised over $1.4M since launching on presale on May 28, 2025. $SNORT to Power the Future of Crypto Trading While the Senate’s decision to exclude crypto tax reforms from the One Big Beautiful Act may feel like a setback, it’s also a stark reminder that innovation moves faster than regulation. The dream of seamless, everyday cryptocurrency transactions remains alive; they just require more advocacy and sharper tools. This is where Snorter Bot shines bright. As policymakers stall, Snorter could soon empower you to make decentralized trades with unbeatable fees and genuine on-chain utility. You can get involved by purchasing $SNORT for as little as $0.0971. After being listed on top exchanges, the Snorter token could hit $0.94 . So, act fast for a potential 868% upside. But remember: once being listed, cryptos can fall as quickly as they jump.

2025-07-02T10:01:48,"XRP Adoption Surges As Bitcoin Demand Crashes","Edoardo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, in a recent discussion with Versan Aljarrah, addressed major concerns surrounding the cryptocurrency market, particularly focusing on the growing regulatory pressure on stablecoins like USDT (Tether) and the broader implications for the crypto ecosystem. The conversation was framed around a new article published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on June 24, which warns about the systemic risks posed by stablecoins. According to the BIS report cited in the discussion, stablecoins threaten monetary sovereignty and can undermine capital markets. Farina and Aljarrah specifically highlighted the long-standing concerns over Tether’s operational model, its lack of transparency, and historical regulatory issues. The BIS article aligns with tightening regulations in Europe that have effectively excluded Tether from operating within the region. Both speakers pointed out that the increasing scrutiny of Tether signals the beginning of a significant market shift. BTC Demand CRASHES as XRP Adoption Surges https://t.co/9x2yl91jvK — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 30, 2025 Stablecoin Risks and Regulatory Crackdown Farina and Aljarrah stated that although XRP and other utility-based assets might experience short-term market turbulence, they are likely to benefit from the reallocation of liquidity away from speculative assets. They cited XRP, XLM, HBAR, and Algorand as examples of blockchains that are technically efficient, fully auditable, and better prepared to comply with evolving regulatory standards. This preparedness makes these networks attractive for future institutional use cases as the tokenization of real-world assets becomes mainstream. A major part of their conversation focused on Tether’s position in the market. Aljarrah described Tether as functioning like an unregulated shadow bank, suggesting that it produces synthetic dollars without proper oversight. He warned that Tether’s eventual collapse is probable and could become a justification for governments to introduce sweeping regulations alongside government-backed stablecoins. According to them, this scenario would fundamentally change the structure of the crypto market. Bitcoin’s Demand Collapse Raises Concerns Farina also raised concerns about Bitcoin’s recent price movement. Despite being near its all-time highs, Bitcoin’s demand metrics suggest weakening interest. He pointed out that Google search trends and trading volumes for Bitcoin are at historically low levels relative to its price, indicating that the rally may not be sustainable. Farina believes the current surge is driven largely by retail speculation rather than institutional demand, making it vulnerable to an abrupt correction. They further referenced Tether’s past regulatory issues, including a $42.5 million fine imposed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2021 for misleading statements regarding its reserves. Farina and Aljarrah described Tether as the linchpin of a speculative market structure that is at significant risk of collapsing once governments finalize and deploy tokenized financial infrastructures. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Positioned for the Utility-Driven Future A core emphasis of their discussion was the shift towards real-world utility. They suggested that the forthcoming regulatory overhaul will result in the elimination of non-compliant crypto projects. This process, in their view, will favor networks like the XRP Ledger, which offers consistent transaction costs, real-time auditability, and scalability for institutional use . The conversation included a video clip featuring Ripple CTO David Schwartz, who explained how XRP’s design aligns with institutional requirements, particularly highlighting features like predictable fees and auditability. Additionally, Schwartz’s remarks, shared during the discussion, projected that hundreds of billions of dollars in tokenized real-world assets are likely to move onto the XRP Ledger . Schwartz argued that XRP offers capabilities that many other blockchains cannot provide, specifically the ability for institutions to verify transactions in real time without relying on external intermediaries. This function reduces operational costs and minimizes counterparty risks. Farina and Aljarrah stressed that the cryptocurrency market is entering a transitional phase. They argued that XRP and similar utility-driven blockchains are well-positioned to thrive in a regulated environment focused on compliance, interoperability, and tangible utility. Meanwhile, assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether face increasing pressure from both regulatory bodies and the inherent limitations of their technical frameworks. Farina’s assessment ultimately pointed to a significant decline in Bitcoin demand, coinciding with rising adoption of XRP as institutional participants begin prioritizing compliance and real-world use cases over speculative trading models.

Economist Peter Schiff has challenged the Coin Edition’s assertion that Bitcoin serves as an effective hedge against dollar weakness. The Dollar Index has fallen below 96.5, prompting Schiff to warn about potential consumer price increases in 2026 without immediate Federal Reserve intervention. Schiff argues that gold, not Bitcoin, will benefit from continued dollar weakness based on historical correlations and market behavior. He contends that Bitcoin maintains a negative correlation with gold, undermining its effectiveness as a traditional safe-haven asset during currency debasement periods.

The company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, outlining its financial position as part of its plans to go public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “FIG.” As Bitcoin adoption increases, projects like Bitcoin Pepe get more traction. The meme coin is already attracting attention during its presale. Figma’s investments According to the filing, Figma invested $55 million in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) on March 3, 2024. By the end of the quarter on March 31, 2025, the investment had grown to $69.5 million, reflecting an unrealized gain of 26%. Figma also reported holding $30 million in the stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), which it plans to convert into Bitcoin. The filing stated: “On May 8, 2025, the Board of Directors approved an investment of $30.0 million in Bitcoin. Subsequently, the Company purchased 30.0 million USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin, for $1 per USDC, totaling $30.0 million. The Company intends to reinvest its stablecoin holdings into Bitcoin at a later date.” Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley commended the move, noting that Figma’s Bitcoin holdings represent 5% of its balance sheet. He added that more companies are beginning to include Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. Corporate interest in cryptocurrencies continues to grow. On Monday, Strategy—formerly known as MicroStrategy—announced a $531 million Bitcoin purchase, bringing its total holdings to 597,000 BTC. Japanese firm Metaplanet also increased its Bitcoin reserves, acquiring 1,005 BTC for $108 million and surpassing Cleanspark to become the fifth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. In addition to Bitcoin, some companies are expanding their treasuries to include Ethereum. BitMine Immersion Technologies recently raised $250 million through a private placement to initiate its Ether treasury strategy. Bitcoin Pepe merges viral appeal with Bitcoin Infrastructure Bitcoin Pepe is carving out a distinct niche in the cryptocurrency landscape by combining widespread viral appeal with robust infrastructure development. The project functions as a Layer 2 solution, capitalizing on Bitcoin’s inherent security while striving for scalability akin to networks such as Solana. This approach sets it apart from many other meme-inspired cryptocurrencies. A meme-centric Layer 2 solution built on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe is broadening its influence through strategic partnerships. These collaborations extend across diverse sectors, including gaming, content creation, decentralized finance (DeFi), and fair launch infrastructure. The goal of these alliances is to foster an ecosystem where the BPEP token provides both cross-chain utility and cultural significance. These partnerships are expected to enhance visibility and adoption, signaling increasing support for the PEP-20 token standard from institutional entities and the broader community alike. The project’s focus on infrastructure appears to be drawing investor attention, with its ongoing presale already raising more than $16.24 million. Further contributing to its momentum are confirmed listings on the MEXC and BitMart exchanges. The project team is slated to announce the final exchange listing on July 31.

The rebound has put majority of investors in the green, but recent data suggests little appetite for selling According to a July 1 Glassnode report , Bitcoin ( BTC ) investors are sitting on $1.2 trillion in unrealized profits. This figure comes from the gap between Bitcoin’s $2.1 trillion market cap and its $955 billion realized cap, a metric that values each coin at the last time it moved. The trend is largely driven by long-term holders, who now control a record 14.7 million BTC, reinforcing the idea that most investors are simply not interested in selling at current prices. Daily profit-taking among investors has also cooled to under $900 million, significantly below the $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion levels seen during previous peaks. Bitcoin’s unrealized profit/loss chart |Source: Glassnode Despite last weekend’s drop from $106K to $99K during the Israel-Iran tensions, positive sentiment did not shake. Bitcoin bounced off the short-term holder cost basis of $98.3K, a key support level that often signals broader market direction. The quick recovery held up the positive momentum, keeping most investors in profit. You might also like: Bitcoin breaks through $107,000, is the stagnant period over? On-chain records also support the HODLing narrative. The Liveliness metric, which compares spending to holding activity, has continued to decline, a sign that more assets are being held than moved. Similarly, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio has dropped off, showing that realized profit and loss-taking is minimal despite the high prices. Meanwhile, stablecoin data paints a picture of a balanced market. Buying power looks steady, with no major inflows or signs of panic. Glassnode’s analysis shows that traders view the current price range as fair value, with little urgency to chase higher or dump holdings. Institutional interest also remains strong. U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to attract consistent inflows , with a recent seven-day average of $298 million. The increasing demand adds buying pressure and acts as a tailwind for BTC’s growing $2 trillion market cap.

A U.S. bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of New York has ruled that Celsius Network’s lawsuit against Tether ( USDT ) can proceed, granting in part and denying in part Tether’s motion to dismiss, according to a memorandum opinion and order filed in the Celsius bankruptcy case on June 30. Celsius Network accused Tether of improperly liquidating over 39,500 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in June 2022 as crypto prices crashed. The 39,500 BTC was put up as collateral for loans Celsius took from Tether, but the crypto lender claims Tether executed a rushed “fire sale” at an average price of $20,656 per BTC — well below market value — and failed to honor a contractual 10-hour waiting period before selling collateral. Celsius claims the liquidation cost it over $4 billion at current Bitcoin prices and constituted breach of contract, bad faith dealing, and fraudulent and preferential transfers avoidable under U.S. bankruptcy law. You might also like: What happened to Celsius Network: a year in review In a blog post , Tether described the lawsuit as “baseless,” stating: “Under the agreement, Celsius posted bitcoin (BTC) to Tether as collateral. As the price of BTC began to fall in June 2022, the agreement required Celsius to post additional collateral to avoid the liquidation of its BTC. When Celsius chose not to post additional BTC it directed Tether to liquidate the BTC collateral Tether held in order to close out its roughly 815 million USD₮ position with Tether.” Celsius, however, contends that Tether sold the BTC at a price that nearly matched the outstanding debt — without giving Celsius a chance to post more collateral, as the agreement allegedly required. In August last year, Tether sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that its operations in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong placed the case outside U.S. jurisdiction, calling the claims an impermissible extraterritorial application of U.S. law. However, the judge found Celsius presented a plausible case that the alleged misconduct involved U.S.-based communications, personnel, and financial accounts, making the claims sufficiently domestic. While some counts were dismissed, Celsius’s core claims — including breach of contract and fraudulent transfer —will move forward in court.

That decline included 12,687 fewer addresses holding $1 million and 1,255 fewer addresses holding over $10 million. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); However, Q2 delivered a sharp rebound. By June 30, the number of wallets holding at least $1 million had jumped to 161,839, an increase of 21,589 addresses in just three months. The number of $10 million+ addresses also saw a significant rise, up 5,169 over the same period, resulting in a net gain of 26,758 new millionaire wallets over H1. Bitcoin accumulation trend returns The resurgence in high-value wallet addresses reflects strong buying activity during market dips earlier in the year, as well as renewed institutional demand following the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs . The April 2025 halving event, which cut block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, also created bullish sentiment by reinforcing Bitcoin’s long-term scarcity narrative and saw the digital asset hit $111,970 on May 22, 2025. While each wallet does not represent a unique individual since some entities may control multiple addresses, the metric is widely used as a proxy for accumulation by wealthy investors, funds, and crypto-native firms. The addition of more than 26,000 new Bitcoin millionaires in just six months marks one of the strongest accumulation cycles since the 2021 bull run, potentially signaling broader market strength heading into the second half of the year.

2025-07-02T09:39:35,"US Senate Passes Contentious Budget Bill Amid Crypto and AI Disputes","The United States Senate has narrowly passed a budget reconciliation bill strongly backed by President Donald Trump, following a tense 50-50 vote on Tuesday that required Vice President JD Vance to break the tie. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” faced criticism across party lines, with concerns centered around potential healthcare cuts, artificial intelligence regulation gaps, and redistribution of wealth through tax adjustments favoring large corporations. All Senate Democrats and three Republicans opposed the bill, pushing for amendments to address rural hospital funding and clearer guidelines for regulating artificial intelligence systems. Despite the debate, the bill moved forward without substantial changes, setting the stage for further discussions in the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Crypto Taxation Left Out During the debate, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis suggested adding provisions to correct what she described as the “unfair tax treatment” of cryptocurrency miners and stakers in the United States. However, these proposed changes did not make it to the floor in the final amendments, leaving the crypto community waiting for clarity on taxation issues. “I would have liked to have seen that [provision] in the final product,” Alaska Representative Nicholas Begich said, expressing disappointment but optimism that crypto tax provisions could be included in future critical legislation. Lummis, reflecting on the outcome, stated the bill “isn’t perfect” but is still “a major step in the right direction.” Meanwhile, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the bill for prioritizing corporate tax cuts over healthcare, accusing Trump and congressional Republicans of writing a “$15 billion check to Meta” while cutting healthcare for millions of Americans. Senate Banking Committee’s Steps Ahead The budget bill’s passage will delay other significant crypto and digital asset legislation, including the GENIUS Act and the BITCOIN Act of 2025. Although the Senate approved the GENIUS Act on June 17, which will now move to the House, Begich noted that these bills will take a backseat until budget reconciliation processes are completed. Begich indicated that discussions around creating a national Bitcoin reserve could resume later this year or early next year, while the House has already moved the CLARITY Act, focused on digital asset market structure, out of committee. However, the Senate Banking Committee is expected to draft its own version of the bill before October, hinting at further debates in Congress around the future of digital asset regulations in the United States.

2025-07-02T09:39:10,"Judge Greenlights Celsius’s $4B Showdown With Tether","A US bankruptcy judge has ruled that Celsius Network’s lawsuit against stablecoin giant Tether can move forward. Key Takeaways: A US judge ruled that Celsius’s lawsuit against Tether over a $4 billion Bitcoin liquidation can move forward. Celsius accuses Tether of breaching their agreement by selling BTC early and violating good faith. The judge found Celsius’s claims sufficiently tied to US activities. According to court documents filed Monday in New York, the judge denied Tether’s effort to dismiss allegations that it improperly liquidated Celsius’s Bitcoin collateral during the lender’s collapse. In the lawsuit, Celsius alleged that Tether sold over 39,500 Bitcoin in June 2022, using the proceeds to cover Celsius’s $812 million debt without following agreed-upon procedures. Celsius Alleges Tether Breached Deal, Committed Fraudulent Transfers Celsius argued that Tether’s actions breached their lending agreement, violated principles of good faith under British Virgin Islands law, and amounted to fraudulent and preferential transfers avoidable under US bankruptcy rules. The dispute centers on a margin call Tether issued as Bitcoin prices fell sharply. Celsius claimed that Tether sold its collateral before a required 10-hour waiting period, offloading the BTC at an average price of $20,656, before transferring the assets to its own Bitfinex accounts. Celsius said the rushed liquidation deprived it of BTC now worth more than $4 billion. The lender also argued Tether’s actions involved US-based communications, personnel, and bank accounts, giving American courts jurisdiction despite Tether being incorporated offshore. The judge sided with Celsius, finding the alleged misconduct sufficiently “domestic” in nature to keep key claims alive, including breach of contract, fraudulent transfer, and preference allegations. Tether loses bid to dismiss Celsius suit seeking to reclaim what is now over $4B of BTC that Tether took from Celsius as it fell into bankruptcy Being offshore doesn’t allow you to evade US courts – especially when virtually all Tether’s assets are sitting in the US #Tether pic.twitter.com/rdshox2n0c — Novacula Occami (@OccamiCrypto) July 1, 2025 Last year, Tether sought to dismiss the case outright, arguing the US court had no jurisdiction and that Celsius’s claims were invalid. While the judge dismissed some counts, the core allegations were allowed to proceed. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 , leaving around $4.7 billion in user assets locked on the platform. In April, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) sought a 20-year prison sentence for Alex Mashinsky , the former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius, for orchestrating a “years-long campaign of lies and self-dealing” that defrauded thousands of investors. Federal prosecutors urged the court to impose a two-decade sentence, citing Mashinsky’s central role in a scheme that left customers unable to access nearly $4.7 billion in cryptocurrency when Celsius froze withdrawals in June 2022. Judge Bars Mashinsky From Celsius Payouts Last month, a US bankruptcy judge blocked Mashinsky from claiming any share of the failed crypto lender’s bankruptcy proceeds. The ruling, entered June 16, 2025, disallows claims from Mashinsky and his entities, freeing up funds for creditor payouts under Celsius’s Chapter 11 plan. Celsius creditors, who have already received over $2.5 billion in distributions, will benefit as reserved cash, crypto, and MiningCo shares are released. The decision follows a May 2025 agreement between Mashinsky and the Celsius litigation team.

2025-07-02T09:36:28,"Crypto Startups Raise $1.15B Last Month: Will Crypto ICOs like $BTCBULL Take Off Next?","June was a strong month for the crypto and Web3 sectors, with related startups successfully raising a collective $1.15B across 140 deals. This represents a 3% increase in raised capital and a 9% increase in the number of deals compared to May, according to crypto market intelligence firm, Messari. The upward trend highlights growing confidence among angel investors in the potential of decentralized technologies. Big winners this round include Kalshi, a predictions market, which secured an $185M round , and Digital Asset , which raised $135M to develop its Canton blockchain. Private token sales also saw a resurgence, with World Liberty Finance bringing in $100M and Eigen Labs securing $70M . These figures paint a vibrant and expanding picture of growth and innovation within the crypto industry. Key Innovations Driving Investor Confidence Diving beyond the figures, the nature of the startups points to a focus on innovative and foundational technologies. Crypto startup, Zama FHE, for example, successfully closed a $57M Series B round , achieving a $1B valuation for its fully homomorphic encryption ( FHE ) technology. Investments in privacy solutions show a growing recognition of the importance of secure and scalable infrastructure for the future of Web3.

2025-07-02T09:36:09,"Bitcoin Broke Record After Record, But Why There Is Still No Movement in Ethereum and Altcoins! Analyst Explains!","According to the latest updated data, CEX spot trading volume reached a 9-month low in June. Why Is CEX Volume Declining? Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX) recorded $1.07 trillion in spot trading volume in June, the lowest in nine months, according to data. While CEX monthly spot trading volume fell to its lowest level since September 2024, decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes continued to increase. One analyst suggested that the reason for this decline is that the current crypto cycle is driven by institutional Bitcoin (BTC) investors rather than retail investments, which is affecting CEX volume. Speaking to The Block, Presto_Research analyst Min Jung said that unlike previous cycles, the last cycle was focused on institutional investors and retail investors, who still generally prefer altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), were not in the market. At this point, Jung stated that previous bull cycles were mostly retail-focused, and that retail investors still did not come to the market and did not trade due to the weak performance of altcoins, and that this situation negatively affected the CEX volume. “Bitcoin, which has shaped the last cycle, remains stable and not far from all-time highs. Despite BTC’s success, the altcoin market is struggling to rally, with most altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), still around 40% off their highs. This points to a market largely driven by institutional Bitcoin purchases, while retail participation—which generally favors altcoins—remains relatively subdued.” “There has been an increase in DEX activity due to the success of platforms like Hyperliquid and the emergence of more DEXs that offer better user experiences,” Jung said regarding the recent increase in DEX volume. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-02T09:30:10,"Expert Explains Why Bitcoin Remains Stuck Below $120,000 Despite Wall Street’s Billions","As Bitcoin (BTC) experiences another dip, falling 5% below its record high of $111,800 reached during May’s crypto rally, analysts are probing the reasons behind its stagnation in the $100,000 to $110,000 range. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst DanteX outlined the factors contributing to this price resistance and what it could mean for the remainder of 2025. What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Despite the substantial influx of nearly $5 billion in Bitcoin acquired through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in just a few weeks, the price of Bitcoin has failed to surpass the $120,000 target identified by analysts. Public companies, Strategy and GameStop, have joined the ranks of institutional buyers, marking a significant shift in corporate interest toward Bitcoin. This growing demand indicates that there are substantial buyers ready to purchase at prices above $100,000. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury However, DanteX asserts that the market has been characterized by an unusual phenomenon: the analyst alleges that someone appears to be “strategically offloading” Bitcoin in the $100,000 to $110,000 range, effectively absorbing the demand and preventing upward movement. This selling pressure seems to come from a major player—reportedly hedge funds or early investors—actively liquidating positions to offset the inflow of institutional capital. Market Exhaustion Or Distribution? As the market enters the latter half of summer, a historically weak period for cryptocurrencies, concerns arise about liquidity and retail interest. DanteX noted that if the Bitcoin price cannot rally now, amid significant buying and market enthusiasm, the outlook may dim as trading volumes decline. The analyst further shared that the current price stagnation at near-record highs often indicates either market exhaustion or a distribution phase, suggesting that while demand exists, it is being countered by strategic selling. Despite the overall positive macroeconomic environment—where stock markets are soaring, real yields are declining, and liquidity is increasing—DanteX highlights that the Bitcoin price remains unresponsive. The analyst stated that it could imply that current holders may not be ready for a breakout or are intentionally limiting potential gains. Interestingly, when Bitcoin price movements stall, capital tends to flow into altcoins, which are often viewed as higher-risk, higher-reward investments. DanteX believes that the current skepticism surrounding the likelihood of an altcoin season amid the current market condition, could actually set the stage for one, as many investors remain “under-positioned.” Record ETF Inflows Fail To Translate Into Price Gains The role of ETFs cannot be overlooked, DanteX further said. He said that while record inflows into ETFs signal strong institutional interest, they do not always correlate with immediate price increases, especially when met with significant selling pressure. DanteX notes that much of the exchange-traded fund exposure may be hedged or arbitraged, resulting in a complex market dynamic where asset growth does not immediately reflect in Bitcoin’s spot price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shopping Spree: Strategy Continues Accumulation With $530M Purchase Looking ahead, the analyst suggests monitoring the activity of large wallets, especially those exhibiting selling patterns that align with recent price suppression. Watching macroeconomic indicators, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts or shifts in the value of the dollar, is also said to be crucial as these factors could influence market sentiment.

2025-07-02T09:30:00,"Katie Hobbs Vetoes Plan to Hold Seized Crypto in State Fund","The bill aimed to create a state-managed reserve fund using seized digital assets. Despite the bill passing the House in a 34-22 vote, Hobbs argued that it would disincentivize local law enforcement by reallocating funds away from their jurisdictions. This continues her trend of opposing digital asset legislation after she previously blocked bills proposing state-level Bitcoin investment strategies and reserves. However, she did approve House Bill 2749, which incorporates crypto into Arizona’s financial statutes and unclaimed property laws. Meanwhile, in New York, Attorney General Letitia James criticized two federal stablecoin bills, and warned that they lack sufficient investor protections and may enable fraud. She called for stricter regulation of stablecoin issuers, FDIC protection, and digital identity requirements. In Virginia, crypto-friendly political action committees are making waves, especially after the Protect Progress PAC spent over $1 million to help elect Democrat James Walkinshaw in a special election. The PAC is part of a larger pro-crypto lobbying movement that plans to influence upcoming elections and legislation nationwide. Another Crypto Bill Vetoed by Arizona Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have created a state-managed fund for holding seized cryptocurrencies, continuing her track record of opposing digital asset legislation. House Bill 2324 proposed the establishment of a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund,” and was passed by the state House in a 34-22 vote on June 24 after being revived by the Senate. Letter from Katie Hobbs The bill outlined how seized crypto would be allocated: the first $300,000 would go to the attorney general’s office, with any remaining funds split between the AG’s office, the state’s general fund, and the proposed reserve. Hobbs, however, rejected the bill on the grounds that it would discourage local law enforcement from cooperating with state authorities by diverting seized assets away from local jurisdictions. Although the veto could technically be overridden with a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers, this outcome is very unlikely without changes in legislative support. This is not the first time Hobbs blocked cryptocurrency-related proposals. In May, she vetoed Senate Bill 1025, which would have created an Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve allowing up to 10% of state funds to be invested in Bitcoin. She called cryptocurrencies “untested investments.” She also vetoed Senate Bill 1373, which aimed to form a Strategic Digital Assets Reserve using seized crypto assets. Despite these rejections, one crypto-related measure has made it into law. House Bill 2749, which was enacted in May, modifies Arizona’s statutes to incorporate crypto assets into the state’s financial systems and unclaimed property laws, while also establishing a separate Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund managed by the state treasurer. Arizona’s efforts are part of the trend among US states exploring the integration of cryptocurrencies into public finance. In June, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill to create the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and in May, New Hampshire passed legislation allowing the state to invest in both cryptocurrencies and precious metals. According to data from Bitcoin Laws, at least six other state legislatures are currently considering similar initiatives. NY Attorney General Slams Stablecoin Bills In New York, Attorney General Letitia James called on Congress to revise two pending stablecoin bills. She argued that they fail to provide sufficient protections for investors and the broader financial system. In a letter sent Tuesday, James criticized the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, stating they lack the necessary regulatory guardrails. Although both bills have advanced in Congress, James urged lawmakers to take more time to craft legislation that encourages innovation while also safeguarding the integrity of the US banking system. The first page of James’ letter She warned that the bills do not adequately address the dangers of anonymous transactions, which can facilitate fraud and criminal activity. James recommended that stablecoin issuers be regulated in the same manner as banks, given their similar functions, and called for mandatory Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation protection for stablecoin deposits. She also pushed for digital identity requirements for all transactions to eliminate anonymity that could be exploited by bad actors. Additionally, she raised concerns that stablecoins could unfairly disadvantage local community banks already facing economic pressures. Supporters of the proposed legislation, like Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Bill Hagerty, defended the bills as efforts to protect consumers and uphold the global role of the US dollar However, James maintained her skepticism, and even extended her criticism to the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act in a separate letter last month. She argued that the bill’s provisions risk enabling fraud by shielding anonymous actors and undermining decades of investor protection laws. Letitia James has a track record of opposing aspects of the cryptocurrency industry. In April, she urged Congress to ban crypto and crypto ETFs from retirement funds after claiming they lack intrinsic value. Her office also took legal action against several digital asset firms and exchanges during her tenure. Pro-Crypto PAC Spends Big in Virginia Race Crypto met politics yet again with James Walkinshaw. He is a Democratic candidate aiming to fill the congressional seat left vacant by the late Representative Gerry Connolly in Virginia’s 11th District, and secured the party nomination after a firehouse primary that was held on Saturday. His victory came after impressive support from a cryptocurrency-backed political action committee, Protect Progress, which reportedly spent more than $1 million in June to back his campaign. The group is affiliated with the larger Fairshake PAC, which is primarily funded by industry players like Coinbase and Ripple Labs. This support is part of a plan by Fairshake to influence elections by backing candidates who are favorable to crypto innovation and regulation. (Source: Federal Election Commission ) In a statement after Walkinshaw’s win, a Fairshake spokesperson talked about the candidate’s resilience against political attacks and praised his commitment to innovation and economic opportunity. They pointed out that voters recognized the value of pro-crypto stances, and suggested that such support is resonating across party lines. The PAC’s activity in Virginia follows similar efforts in April during special elections for two Florida House seats, where its affiliate, Defend American Jobs, spent more than $1.5 million. While crypto-backed PACs were less visible in New Jersey’s June gubernatorial primaries, Fairshake has suggested that it has broader ambitions. As of January, the group reported holding more than $116 million in cash reserves to support crypto-friendly candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. Their aim is to strengthen the representation of crypto advocates in Congress, where 270 “pro-crypto” lawmakers already hold seats after the 2024 elections . Legislative efforts on crypto are also advancing in the current session, with the Senate passing stablecoin regulations and drafting a comprehensive digital asset market structure bill.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9777/katie-hobbs-vetoes-plan-to-hold-seized-crypto-in-state-fund,"REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

The M2 money supply , which includes hard currency and bank and money market mutual fund deposits that are relatively liquid, rose to a record $21.94 trillion at the end of May, topping the previous peak of $21.72 trillion in March 2022, according to data source barchart.com. Year-on-year growth rate matched April's 4.5%, which is also the highest in nearly three years, according to data source Yahoo Finance . For cryptocurrencies, the message is muddled. Typically, a growing money supply is taken as a signal of looser financial conditions and a growing economy that promotes greater investor exposure to riskier assets. On the other hand, money supply growth can lead to inflation if it outpaces the economy, according to Cyprus-based TIOmarkets . Inflation concerns could reduce investor risk-taking and pressure the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. In recent years, a rising M2 has had a lagged impact on the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation. The PCE began rising in February 2021, a year after M2 growth began soaring in February 2020 and followed the M2 growth lower in 2023, St. Louis Federal Reserve noted in a blog post . If history is a guide, the ongoing uptick in the M2 growth rate could contribute to inflation in the coming months, making it more challenging for the Federal Reserve to cut rates to as low as 1%, as recently called for by President Donald Trump.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/02/u-s-m2-money-supply-hits-record-high-of-nearly-usd22t,"MARKET|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION","Markets|Money supply|United States|Bitcoin|Markets|News",cryptocompare

The final SEC decision deadline for XRP’s spot ETF is set for October 10, 2025. The Commission currently classifies XRP as a commodity, a crucial regulatory status that significantly boosts its approval odds. Impact of SEC case However, some observers suggest the SEC may be waiting for the conclusion of its long-standing legal battle with Ripple before moving forward with an approval. Both parties have shown interest in settling the case through a settlement. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also expressed a strong desire to bring the matter to a close. For now, investors seeking exposure to a spot XRP ETF can look to Brazil and Canada, the only countries that have approved trading of such products . However, these ETFs have had little impact on XRP’s price so far, mainly due to the relatively small size of their financial markets. Meanwhile, other top crypto assets, such as Litecoin ( LTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), also have strong approval odds, each at 95%.
