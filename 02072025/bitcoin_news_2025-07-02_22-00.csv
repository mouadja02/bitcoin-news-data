2025-07-02T19:55:44,"SkyBridge Capital Founder Anthony Scaramucci Predicts Bitcoin Treasury Trend ‘Fades Away’: Report","Hedge fund veteran Anthony Scaramucci reportedly says that the recent adoption of Bitcoin ( BTC ) in corporate treasuries is likely a temporary trend. In an interview with Bloomberg , the SkyBridge Capital founder says he thinks the BTC treasury business model will fade away. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea… So, you know, it will fade.” The investor says that eventually, investors will begin to question why they’re paying a premium for a “middleman” to hold an asset when they could simply hold BTC on their own. Over the last year, there has been a trend among corporations of accumulating Bitcoin, both as a savings mechanism and a strategy to convert their shares into proxies for investing in the flagship cryptocurrency. Some of the recently launched BTC treasuries include Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC , Grant Cardone’s Cardone Capital , Gamestop and Japanese hotel company MetaPlanet . Other companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy have been employing the same tactics for years. However, Scaramucci says he feels different about Strategy. “Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now… I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on Bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies… “The question is, if you’re giving somebody $10 and they’re putting $8 into Bitcoin, are they going to do well? Yes. But you might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin. I think that’s an issue.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-02T19:45:48,"Binance Dominates Bitcoin Futures with 87% Taker Volume: CQ","Fresh data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows Binance now commands 87% of global taker buy volume in Bitcoin (BTC) futures. This figure dwarfs the combined activity of major competitors like OKX, Deribit, BitMEX, and Bybit, which together account for only about 10%. Taker Volume Signals Market Supremacy Takers are traders who accept existing offers or bids on a platform’s order book rather than placing their own. Since they want their request filled immediately, they tend to “take” a value that’s already listed so that they can react swiftly to a cryptocurrency’s price movements. This is done through the so-called market orders. This metric is crucial: it indicates where positions fill fastest and where capital flows are most concentrated. Experts usually consider the taker volume important for gauging real-time market activity, and according to CryptoQuant, Binance is the overwhelming leader, capturing 87% of such deals. That it holds the lion’s share of this activity indicates that Binance is the go-to platform for traders looking to act quickly on price trends, especially those using leverage-heavy BTC futures contracts. As noted by analyst J.A. Maartun, the exchange’s dominance means traders’ orders will be filled rapidly, while market watchers like him get to “monitor order books, liquidity levels, and capital flows more effectively.” Binance’s grip on the space is not new, but it solidified following the 2022 collapse of FTX, which at one point was one of its main rivals. The gap it left behind saw the then Changpeng Zhao-led firm steadily grow its daily trading volume to cement its place as the largest crypto exchange in the world based on this metric. Beyond Futures However, its dominance isn’t just in the futures space. As recently reported by CryptoPotato , the BTC.com mining pool exclusively directs almost 98% of its identifiable Bitcoin exchange flows to Binance, making it the primary gateway for new BTC entering the market. The crypto exchange also dominates USDT liquidity on Tron, with on-chain data showing it routinely processes more than 65% of the stablecoin’s transfers on the network. This amounts to anywhere between $2 billion and $3 billion worth of TRC-20 Tether processed each day. Nonetheless, this extreme centralization is a double-edged sword. While it offers unmatched liquidity and efficiency, it also concentrates systemic risk. Any significant operational, regulatory, or technical issue impacting Binance could send shockwaves across the entire crypto ecosystem, disrupting derivatives pricing, spot liquidity, and even stablecoin flows.

2025-07-02T19:40:12,"What If Bitcoin Hits $200K? AI Projects Dominance Spikes and Altcoin Frenzy","What would happen if Bitcoin reached $200,000? Nearly doubling its previous all-time high, a $200K price would move Bitcoin into a new tier of market capitalization, roughly matching the valuation of global blue-chip equities and sovereign debt holdings. It would likely attract new classes of capital and global media attention. This article uses AI to analyze and explore that possibility through a structured framework. Instead of speculating on a date or treating the figure as inevitable, it investigates what could unfold if Bitcoin does reach this benchmark. Drawing from prior market cycles and behavior patterns, it outlines key indicators investors might observe across dominance, altcoin behavior, sector reactions, macro drivers, and psychological sentiment. Bitcoin Price 2017-Present (Source: CoinMarketCap) Rather than offering predictions, the goal is to map potential outcomes. The AI analysis considers how markets have responded to previous rallies and what those patterns might imply for a future where Bitcoin touches $200K. Research Approach and Analytical Framework To ground the analysis, we analyzed data from two previous bull cycles with ChatGPT’s o3 model—2017 and 2020 to 2021—using CoinMarketCap and TradingView . Both periods saw Bitcoin leading the initial price movements, followed by capital rotation into altcoins. BTC dominance rose early, then declined as other tokens gained traction. This historical lens helps to frame a plausible path forward. AI analysis added structure by projecting how different segments might react under specific conditions. These include shifts in BTC dominance, ETH /BTC ratio trends, and short-term altcoin volatility following a price spike. We assume Bitcoin reaches $200K in an environment that supports a higher risk appetite, such as post-ETF-approval inflows, macroeconomic easing, or a weakening dollar. No single catalyst is implied, but conditions would likely include strong institutional demand and favorable regulation. Initial Shock: Bitcoin Dominance Spikes If Bitcoin breaks through $200K, dominance is likely to climb in the early stages. In past cycles, this has indicated capital concentration in Bitcoin as investors seek security in the most liquid asset. In 2017, dominance fell from 64 percent to under 40 percent as the rally matured. In the 2021 cycle, it peaked around 73 percent before dropping below 50 percent once altcoins gathered momentum. Bitcoin Dominance 2017-Present (Source: TradingView) At the $200K level, Bitcoin would almost certainly attract institutional flows and dominate trading volumes. Search interest and media coverage would spike, even among retail investors who have stayed on the sidelines. Historically, these moments have been associated with a rapid inflow of attention and capital, setting the stage for short-lived overextension. However, the rise in dominance might be temporary. Once BTC appears to stabilize at new highs, capital could begin rotating into ETH and eventually into smaller assets. This transition has occurred before, often within weeks of a Bitcoin top. Altcoin Rotation: ETH Rebounds, Altseason Looms Ethereum has historically underperformed during Bitcoin-led surges but tends to recover strongly once BTC momentum cools. During the late 2020 rally, ETH/BTC declined even as BTC rallied. But by mid-2021, Ethereum regained ground and outperformed Bitcoin in percentage terms for several months. The ETH/BTC ratio climbed steadily, indicating renewed confidence in broader crypto exposure. Ethereum to Bitcoin Ratio 2017-Present (Source: TradingView) Blockchaincenter’s Altcoin Season Index supports this. In both 2017 and 2021, altcoin rallies intensified once Bitcoin had already established a local high. In 2021, large-cap alts rose by over 170 percent compared to a relatively flat BTC. Smaller tokens often lag further, but their moves are sharper once they catch up. If BTC reaches $200K and then stabilizes, the conditions for a classic altcoin season may emerge. Capital typically flows first to ETH, then to mid-cap tokens, and finally to microcaps as risk appetite increases. Altcoin Season Index 2020-Present (Source: Blockchaincenter) These transitions are fast and often unpredictable. Investors watching dominance metrics, ETH/BTC ratios, and liquidity conditions may spot the early signs of such a rotation. Sector Reactions: DeFi, Memecoins, Metaverse Beyond general altcoins, specific token sectors have often been the primary beneficiaries of late-cycle capital. In 2021, DeFi protocols, meme tokens, and metaverse-related assets surged once Bitcoin began to flatten out. These moves were amplified by social sentiment and community engagement rather than core utility. Should Bitcoin reach $200K, speculative capital may again flow into these and other new, trending segments (AI, RWA , etc). Traders who missed the early BTC gains may chase higher beta assets, especially if short-term sentiment supports them. These rallies tend to be brief and steep, with heightened volatility on both the upside and downside. Timing also matters. These sectors often peak just after Bitcoin tops. Watch for rising social engagement and increasing trading volume as early indicators. Macro Tailwinds and Regulatory Catalysts No major price level exists in a vacuum. A $200K Bitcoin would likely follow a set of favorable macro and regulatory developments. Additional ETF approvals could trigger new flows from wealth managers and pension funds. A weakening dollar or easing Fed stance might drive investors to reevaluate long-term stores of value, and persistent inflation could push more institutional interest into hard digital assets. What drives the price also shapes what follows. An ETF-driven rally would likely keep most capital in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, if broader macro recovery leads the charge—like a tech-stock rebound or real yield compression—then altcoins might benefit as well. The nature of the catalyst would determine the breadth of participation. A narrow rally driven by institutions tends to favor high-liquidity assets. A wider rally, driven by retail and macro optimism, tends to pull in speculative names. The outcome is not just price-based but structural. Understanding this would help investors anticipate where capital may flow next. Mapping Reversal Risks and Volatility Ahead In past cycles, dominance tends to peak around the time Bitcoin hits its top. When BTC hit $20K in December 2017, dominance fell shortly after. In 2021, BTC reached $69K while dominance was already declining, setting the stage for broad market retracements. The scenario might look like this: Bitcoin touches $200K, dominance climbs to 60 percent, then retreats over several days as capital disperses. If this process unfolds too quickly, altcoin prices may rise and fall just as fast. Tokens with low liquidity or inflated valuations may see abrupt corrections. The risk isn’t only that prices fall, but that the correction hits different sectors at different speeds. Bitcoin may remain steady while smaller tokens experience outsized drawdowns. Investors unfamiliar with this dynamic may misread the timing, entering too late or exiting too early. Volatility often follows rapid rotations. Watching dominance trends and ETH/BTC shifts can help assess when momentum begins to fade. Investor Sentiment Shifts—Retail vs Institutional Retail behavior often mirrors price action. In 2017 and 2021, Google Trends data shows search interest for “Bitcoin” peaked near the market top. These periods were marked by media saturation and public curiosity. Bitcoin Google Trend Index (Source: Google) Recent rallies haven’t generated the same level of attention. Even with new highs, search volume remains well below prior peaks. If Bitcoin hits $200K under similar conditions, the move may be driven more by institutions than retail. This could delay broader participation, especially in altcoins. A subdued retail environment might mute initial volatility, but it could also dampen follow-through in later phases. Altcoin seasons tend to rely on retail-driven liquidity. If that component is missing or delayed, smaller tokens may struggle to replicate past performance. Still, attention can return quickly. If media focus intensifies, search trends could reverse rapidly. Retail engagement tends to follow headlines. Preparing for a Potential $200K Bitcoin Market As we’ve explored what might happen if Bitcoin reaches $200K, we’ve drawn from real-world data and historical behavior to outline potential developments across market structure, investor behavior, and asset rotation. Key indicators to monitor include Bitcoin dominance, ETH/BTC ratio trends, and search activity. These offer insight into whether a rally is broadening, narrowing, or beginning to reverse. Rather than make a prediction, this scenario helps map expectations. Understanding previous cycles doesn’t guarantee foresight, but it does offer useful context. If Bitcoin does approach $200K, preparation will matter more than precision. The post What If Bitcoin Hits $200K?

But now, in just a few months, Trump and his family have made more than $620 million by diving into the world of crypto . Is Trump using his power as president to make this money? Let’s look at how he’s turning digital coins into millions. Fast Money: From Real Estate to Crypto For years, the Trump family made their money the traditional way, buying land, building towers, and putting their name on fancy buildings all over the world. But since Donald Trump returned to the White House, things have changed. The same man who once criticized crypto has now done a complete turnaround and jumped right into it. With their new projects like World Liberty Financial and the Trump memecoin , the Trumps are making money much faster than they ever did by selling condos. One of their biggest money-makers right now is World Liberty Financial, which sells its tokens and runs a stablecoin called USD1, linked to the US dollar. By March, this project had sold about $550 million worth of tokens, and nearly $400 million of that went directly to the Trump family. Earlier, Trump even offered a private dinner to the trump memecoin’s biggest holders. Crypto Beats Real Estate To see how big this is, compare it to Trump’s old business. Last year, his company made about $34 million from licensing buildings. That’s small compared to the hundreds of millions flowing in from crypto projects in just months. And it’s not stopping there. Trump’s family also has a stake in American Bitcoin, a company that wants to go public as a big Bitcoin miner. If that works, it could add even more to their crypto fortune. New Money, Same Name No matter what, the Trump name keeps pulling in money. Now, instead of waiting years to finish towers and resorts, the Trumps can earn millions quickly by putting their name on digital coins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/trumps-620-crypto-jackpot-how-digital-coins-are-boosting-his-fortune/,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T19:29:53,"Lending & Borrowing Tokens to Watch Under $1M Market Cap","Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms continue to grow, and several small-cap tokens ( These tokens power emerging protocols that let users lend crypto assets for interest or borrow against collateral. Below we highlight five such projects, summarizing their core features and CoinMarketCap statistics. Trava Finance (TRAVA) Trava Finance is a cross-chain lending marketplace on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that allows projects and individuals to launch their own lending pools. Launched in 2021, Trava lets users create and manage “User-owned pools” for lending and borrowing. It also incorporates AI-powered analytics to reduce risk – for example, it offers tools like the BRicher token-price aggregator, Token Health indicators, and a Credit Score system to inform investment decisions. Trava Governance is fully decentralized, letting TRAVA token holders vote on upgrades. The team is even experimenting with NFT collateral: they launched “Trava Knight” NFTs and an auction platform as steps toward NFT-backed loans. Key features: Cross-chain lending pools; AI-driven analytics (credit scoring, token health); decentralized governance; NFT-collateral experimentation. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.00008485 (24h volume ≈$74 K); Market Cap ≈$343.8 K; Circulating Supply ≈4.05 B TRAVA. Trading: TRAVA trades on exchanges such as MEXC (TRAVA/USDT), BitMart, and PancakeSwap v2. UniLend Finance (UFT) UniLend is a permissionless DeFi protocol that uniquely combines spot trading and lending/borrowing for any ERC-20 token. Unlike other platforms that limit which tokens can be used, UniLend lets any community member list an ERC-20 token for lending, borrowing, and trading. Its upcoming UniLend V2 (launched Feb 2024 on Ethereum) promises expanded features and performance. UniLend also bridges into AI: it offers an AI Agent Hub where users can co-create on-chain AI agents using modular smart-contract “lego” components. The native UFT token is used for platform governance; holders can vote on proposals and earn rewards from liquidity mining and protocol fees. Key features: Permissionless trading & lending for all ERC-20 tokens; unified spot and lending markets; community governance (UFT) and a separate UFTG community token; modular AI Agent Hub for on-chain AI agents. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.00605 (24h volume ≈$54.7 K); Market Cap ≈$554.3 K; Circulating Supply ≈91.67 M UFT. Trading: UFT is listed on exchanges like AscendEX, Uniswap V2, and SushiSwap. ForTube (FOR) – The Force Protocol ForTube (formerly The Force Protocol ) is an open-source DeFi lending platform, deployed on Binance Smart Chain in 2020. It describes itself as a suite of crypto-finance service protocols aimed at developers. The platform supports crypto-backed lending and borrowing , yield farming, and issuance of on-chain stablecoins. Its services include cross-chain asset transfers, crypto-asset-backed stablecoin insurance, token insurance, and on-chain payments. ForTube’s smart contracts allow users to deposit, borrow, and repay assets at any time, with interest rates automatically adjusted by the protocol. Notably, the ForTube network has been audited by SlowMist for security. Key features: BSC-based DeFi lending/yield-farming; crypto-collateralized stablecoin issuance; permissionless platform with SDK/APIs for developers; algorithmic interest rates; audited smart contracts. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.000738 (24h volume ≈$128 K); Market Cap ≈$586.7 K; Circulating Supply ≈795 M FOR. Trading: FOR is tradable on major CEXs (Binance, Huobi, etc.) and decentralized exchanges. Interlay (INTR) Interlay is a Bitcoin-centric cross-chain DeFi protocol . Its goal is to bring Bitcoin into the wider DeFi ecosystem. As its website states, “Interlay is a modular, programmable layer between Bitcoin and the multi-chain ecosystem that unlocks decentralized (financial) use cases for BTC”. The main feature is the interBTC bridge, a 1:1 BTC-pegged asset secured by a decentralized network of vaults. Interlay also provides a DeFi hub for BTC – enabling Bitcoin swaps, lending, and staking with low fees (payable in any asset). The INTR token underpins the protocol: holders can lock INTR to vote on governance (“stake-to-vote”) and pay transaction or cross-chain fees, and INTR can even serve as collateral for interBTC or other assets. Key features: Trustless BTC bridge (interBTC) for using BTC across multiple chains; Bitcoin DeFi hub (swaps, lending, staking); modular architecture supporting EVM and Rust contracts. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.002310 (24h volume ≈$59.7 K); Market Cap ≈$154.8 K; Circulating Supply ≈67.0 M INTR. Trading: INTR is listed on exchanges like Kraken and Gate.io. Kintsugi (KINT) Kintsugi is Interlay’s canary network deployed on Kusama. It runs the same codebase as Interlay but serves as an innovation hub, getting new features first. Kintsugi’s flagship product is kBTC , a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset on Kusama backed by multi-collateral insurance (like a decentralized BTC-pegged stablecoin). The KINT token is primarily for governance (deciding protocol upgrades) and paying network fees. In practice, Kintsugi aims to stress-test and refine Interlay’s designs; as the Interlay docs say, “Kintsugi focuses strictly on innovation and will always be ahead in terms of features”. Key features: Kusama-based experimental layer for Bitcoin DeFi; 1:1 BTC-backed kBTC asset with MakerDAO-inspired multi-collateral insurance; token governance and fees (KINT). Coin stats: Price ≈$0.17 (24h volume ≈$65.5 K); Market Cap ≈$583.6 K; Circulating Supply ≈3.43 M KINT. Trading: KINT is traded on platforms like Kraken and Gate.io. Summary: Each of these projects has a unique niche in DeFi lending/borrowing, often involving cross-chain or Bitcoin-focused features. Their market caps are currently under $1 M, which implies both potential upside and higher risk. Before investing, do your own research: check current prices, liquidity, and developments. CoinMarketCap provides up-to-date stats (as cited above) to help track these tokens. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-07-02T19:05:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price Rebound or Collapse in 2025?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction toward $0.50. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.495 Price Change 24h 2.27% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.495 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis Pi price bounced from $0.4778 to $0.4953, signalling a small recovery after testing critical support levels. MACD shows a narrowing bearish gap, hinting at possible reversal momentum if buying volume sustains above current levels. RSI remains below 40, indicating weak buying strength and continued bearish sentiment. As of July 2, 2025, Pi Network (PI) is trading at $0.4953, up 3.32% in the past 24 hours. The price bounced from a support level near $0.478, showing signs of short-term strength. The Immediate resistance lies around $0.505, and a breakout above this zone could open a path toward $0.52. Pi 1-day chart shows a weak momentum despite a short-term price rally The Pi Network 1-day chart shows a rebound as Pi coin price rose to $0.4953 after testing key support. Despite this rise, MACD remains in bearish territory, signalling weak momentum across the Pi Network market. The RSI stands at 38.13, reflecting low buying strength and a cautious current Pi Network sentiment. This aligns with uncertainty caused by ongoing token unlocks and increased selling pressure. Without bullish confirmation, the network price prediction remains bearish for the short term, though long-term recovery depends on ecosystem traction and demand. Pi/USDT Price Chart Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart The Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart shows consolidation as Pi coin price trades between $0.48 and $0.50 with low volatility. MACD is showing signs of flattening, but no bullish crossover has formed, indicating weak momentum in the Pi Network market. The RSI has climbed to 40.84, hinting at small buying interest but still reflecting a bearish current Pi Network sentiment. Key resistance levels remain near $0.505, while support is holding around $0.478. Unless stronger demand emerges, the short-term price prediction points to sideways movement under pressure from high circulating supply and ongoing token unlocks. Pi/USDT Price Chart Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? Pi price may stay in a range between $0.48 and $0.52 with weak momentum and ongoing token unlock pressure. A breakout above $0.52 could signal short-term recovery, but selling risks remain high. Market sentiment and volume will guide the next move. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033.

Investors are keenly watching the Pi Network market to discern potential movements in its future price trends and analyse shifts in Pi Network’s price. In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.48–$0.52 range.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T18:50:08,"Design Giant Figma Goes Public, Reveals $70M Bitcoin ETF Holdings and $30M Ready to Buy More","Design software giant Figma has filed for its initial public offering with the SEC, revealing substantial Bitcoin exposure, including $69.5 million in Bitcoin ETF holdings and an additional $30 million earmarked for future cryptocurrency investments. The company’s S-1 filing mentions Bitcoin 21 times, while strongly highlighting crypto as a core component of its treasury strategy alongside traditional marketable securities. BULLISH: @figma just disclosed $69.5M in spot #Bitcoin ETFs in its SEC IPO filing – with board approval to buy $30M more. This isn’t a crypto company. This is a mainstream tech brand holding $BTC on its balance sheet. Adoption is happening quietly, but at the highest levels. pic.twitter.com/zmTrRyuyqj — ︎ Teo Mercer (@TeoMercer) July 2, 2025 Initially, Figma’s Board of Directors approved a $55 million investment in Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF on March 3, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, the position was valued at $69.5 million. The company subsequently authorized another $30 million Bitcoin investment on May 8, 2025, purchasing USDC as an intermediate step to stabilize the investment before converting to Bitcoin at an optimal time. Figma will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker “FIG” with Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen & Company, and J.P. Morgan serving as joint lead book-running managers. The offering size and pricing remain undetermined pending market conditions and SEC approval processes. Corporate Bitcoin Strategies Evolve Through ETF Adoption Figma’s approach involves a hybrid strategy that combines direct Bitcoin ownership and ETF exposure. As mentioned above, the company has invested $55 million in the Bitwise ETF. The subsequent purchase will be made with $30 million in Bitcoin, with the USDC stablecoin serving as a strategic positioning tool for optimal Bitcoin entry timing. This methodology enables treasuries to avoid Bitcoin’s volatility while maintaining readiness for favorable purchasing opportunities. Figma’s risk disclosures acknowledge the impact of Bitcoin ETF volatility, noting that a 10% decline in Bitcoin prices would result in a $7 million reduction in the fair value of its investment. “ A hypothetical 10% decrease in the price of the Bitcoin exchange traded fund would decrease the fair value of this investment as of March 31, 2025 by $7.0 million ,” the filing said. The company emphasizes that unrealized losses are related to Bitcoin price movements rather than credit-specific factors, thereby avoiding the recognition of expected credit losses. Corporate Bitcoin adoption has accelerated dramatically, with 141 companies now holding 849,245 BTC, worth $91 billion at current prices of $107,144. Source: BitcoinTreasuries However, most corporations opt for direct Bitcoin ownership through treasury management rather than ETF exposure, as seen in Figma’s approach. The design software company’s filing coincides with broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, including UniCredit’s structured Bitcoin ETF product for Italian professional clients , which offers capital protection features. With no local spot Bitcoin ETFs approved, UniCredit’s certificate offers a controlled entry point into digital assets. #btcetf #italy https://t.co/c5uT0P0oMS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 These developments, particularly the strategic corporate accumulation of Bitcoin, indicate growing institutional interest in regulated Bitcoin exposure. In fact, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts spot Bitcoin ETFs could collectively hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated 1.1 million BTC within one year. If the trend persists for a year, the current ETF inflows suggest institutional accumulation may exceed individual holdings exponentially. Regulatory Clarity Drives ETF Innovation and Adoption The filing arrives as the SEC streamlines crypto ETF regulations through new guidance issued July 1 . The new SEC’s guideline for token-based ETFs establishes structured disclosure frameworks that benefit companies like Figma, which seek regulated exposure to cryptocurrency. The SEC has issued new guidance to clarify crypto ETF filings, aiming to streamline approvals for token-based exchange-traded products. #CryptoETFs #SEC https://t.co/gshzi1Qa55 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 2, 2025 New requirements cover net asset value calculations, custody practices, service provider selection, and potential conflicts of interest for crypto ETF issuers. The regulatory framework enables generic listing processes that could allow qualifying crypto ETPs to bypass traditional 19b-4 rule changes. Exchanges may list crypto ETFs after 75-day reviews, significantly reducing time-to-market for new products and expanding investment options. Notably, Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund conversion to spot ETF status demonstrates regulatory progress toward multi-asset cryptocurrency funds. The fund, which has been approved, holds Bitcoin (79.9%), Ethereum (11.3%), as well as XRP, Solana, and Cardano. This provides diversified crypto exposure through a single, regulated vehicle. This development is not isolated to Bitcoin. Similarly, Bloomberg analysts assign 95% approval odds for Solana, Litecoin, and XRP spot ETFs to arrive in the second half of 2025, with approval for a crypto index ETF possible this week. Bloomberg ETF analysts have sharply raised expectations for US approval of spot funds tracking Solana, Litecoin, and XRP. #ETFs #XRP https://t.co/dKK2ZIbW8c — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Over 70 cryptocurrency ETFs currently await SEC review, spanning various digital assets beyond Bitcoin.

2025-07-02T18:45:16,"Bitfinex Warns Momentum Fading for Bitcoin, Hints at Local Top Rather Than Vertical Acceleration for BTC","The research arm of a top crypto exchange thinks Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be losing momentum. In a new research report , Bitfinex notes that BTC’s broader market structure remains healthy, with longer-term support levels still standing. Current data, however, suggests the top crypto asset is heading into a transition phase, according to the exchange. “Both order flow data and on-chain metrics are now aligning to suggest consolidation or a local top, rather than continued vertical acceleration. Spot volume has cooled, taker buy pressure has weakened, and profit-taking has intensified – especially among short-term holders who rode the move from sub-$80,000 levels.” BTC is trading at $105,864 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 1% in the past 24 hours. Bitfinex’s researchers argue that Bitcoin could witness short-term price upticks but will likely remain range-bound until it sees a significant surge in new demand. “For now, Bitcoin is in a waiting game. Structural positioning remains intact, and there’s no major breakdown risk as long as $94-99,000 holds. But for new all-time highs to be reclaimed, a catalyst, either in the form of macro relief, strong ETF flow momentum, or a breakout in global liquidity, will be necessary.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-02T18:42:29,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF now earns more annual fees than its S&P 500 ETF","BlackRock is making more money from Bitcoin than from the S&P 500. No one expected it to happen this fast, but now it has. The $75 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is generating more annual fee revenue than the $624 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). The numbers are clear: IBIT brings in $187.2 million a year, just above the $187.1 million IVV earns. This comes from Bloomberg data calculated as of July 1. The reason this is happening? Fees. IBIT charges a 0.25% expense ratio, while IVV only charges 0.03%. And despite being almost nine times smaller, IBIT has drawn steady inflows in 17 out of the last 18 months, mostly from a mix of regular investors and huge institutions. BlackRock didn’t say anything when asked to comment, but the revenue shift speaks for itself. Bitcoin fund takes control of ETF cash Since spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, IBIT has pulled in $52 billion out of the $54 billion in total inflows across all Bitcoin ETFs. That gives it control of more than 55% of the total market, based on Bloomberg’s figures. It’s already one of the top 20 ETFs by trading volume. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said this showed how much investors wanted easy Bitcoin access without dealing with new platforms. “It’s an indication of how much pent-up demand there was for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin as part of their overall portfolio without having to open a separate account somewhere else,” he said. Hickey also pointed out how Bitcoin has completely outpaced smaller altcoins in how it’s seen by investors, as the clear store of value. Nate Geraci, president at NovaDius Wealth Management, said IBIT passing IVV in revenue shows two things: people want Bitcoin, and stock ETF fees are shrinking. “Although spot Bitcoin ETFs are priced very competitively, IBIT is proof that investors are willing to pay up for exposures they view as truly additive to their portfolios,” Nate said. The IBIT and IVV combo could help BlackRock pass State Street in overall ETF trading. Right now, BlackRock handles 25% of ETF trading by dollar volume, with State Street ahead at 31%, based on Bloomberg Intelligence numbers shared by Athanasios Psarofagis. Bitcoin’s rise has also been backed by Wall Street, especially Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has spent billions buying the coin outright. Hedge funds are also going after convertible debt linked to Strategy, using trades that involve shorting the stock while holding the bonds. Bitcoin stays stable while traders adjust But while the money keeps flooding in, Bitcoin’s price hasn’t been moving much lately. In the last two months, it’s been stuck in a range between $93,000 and $111,000, one of the tightest stretches in years. It was trading at around $108,480 on Wednesday, up about 2.4%. The low volatility is a major change from the wild swings of past years, when the price could move 5% or more in a single day. This quiet period is backed by the Deribit BTC Volatility Index, which tracks expected 30-day price swings. It’s now at the lowest level in two years. Source: Deribit Michael Longoria, a research analyst at GSR, said this signals a change in how Bitcoin is viewed. “Bitcoin is becoming less speculative and more akin to a volatile macro asset,” he said. With volatility down, traders looking to profit from big moves are seeing fewer chances. Some investors have shifted to writing call options on Bitcoin they already own, which gives them some income while limiting how far the price can move. David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, said this kind of trading is now common. “These are kind of covered call overwriting strategies, and they basically have the effect of lowering volatility,” David said. He added that in the past, most options investors were looking for leverage and quick upside. But now, more are focused on controlling risk and earning steady returns. This calmer market fits with who’s in control now. A report from Glassnode shows that while transaction volume is going down, settlement value is going up. That means fewer trades, but each one carries more value. More high-net-worth players are holding large positions, while individual traders are stepping back.

According to a new report from Financial Times, Thiel and other investors – such as the CEO of military contracting company Anduril – to create a bank called Erebor, which references to popular fantasy series The Lord of the Rings. FT says the billionaires intend for the bank to serve crypto startups and take the place of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a crypto-friendly bank that ended up going bankrupt in 2023. However, the Erebor plans to lend traditionally as well. As stated by the bank in its public application to acquire the necessary licenses to operate in the US, according to FT, “The bank will be a national bank… providing traditional banking products, as well as virtual currency-related products and services, for businesses and individuals.” FT says the bank will focus on key industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), defense, manufacturing, digital assets as well as non-US companies looking to access the US banking system. People close to the matter say that Thiel and others have been mulling over launching Erebor since the collapse of SVB, which was the go-to bank for crypto firms for many years. According to the report, Erebor also said in its application filing that it would be looking to “differentiate itself” by serving those who “are not well served by traditional or disruptive financial institutions, in particular with respect to insufficient access to credit.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-02T18:32:38,"Top Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Predictions as of Late","TL;DR Despite being on a downtrend, SHIB has caught the attention of crypto analysts and even NBA legend Scottie Pippen, with predictions of a 40% rally and signs of a classic trend reversal forming. The lead developer Shytoshi Kusama teased multiple upcoming announcements, fueling speculation that July could be successful period for the meme coin. The Next Potential Targets Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a substantial resurgence on a couple of occasions last year, but it currently trades far below those peaks. As of this writing, the self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer is worth roughly $0.00001136, meaning a 33% decline on a yearly scale. Still, it remains the subject of bullish price predictions. Earlier today (July 2), the X user Dami-Defi argued that SHIB “bounced off key daily support and broke its local downtrend.” The analyst described this as a “classic reversal setup,” envisioning a 40% spike to as high as $0.00001600. For their part, the X user PumpSwap Alpha expects a price explosion in the short term: I’m anticipating a major move on $SHIB soon. The pump feels overdue. Like this if you believe Shiba Inu is about to explode in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/tw8lhQmwR7 — PumpSwap Alpha (@PumpswapAlpha) June 30, 2025 It is worth noting that the NBA legend Scottie Pippen also put his name among the optimists. He recently asked his more than 700,000 followers on X which cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin (BTC) they are bullish on, saying his picks include SHIB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, and other well-known altcoins. This isn’t the first time Pippen has shown interest in assets different than BTC. In May, he claimed that the altcoin season “is here,” shifting his attention toward SHIB, XRP, ETH, SOL, ADA, and more. The Calm Before the Storm? Important elements that could trigger a price ascent for SHIB are potential partnerships that the project may ink in the near future or groundbreaking disclosures involving its ecosystem. Earlier this week, Shytoshi Kusama said on X that the community should be prepared for “many announcements, releases, and discussions around everything we’ve built thus far and where we see the future going.” Some of the people commenting on the post took this as a positive sign that the ongoing month could be highly successful for the meme coin. However, only time will tell whether this will be the case.

2025-07-02T18:25:45,"Trump’s One Big Beautifl Bill TLDR: Good or Bad for Bitcoin?","There has been a notable uptick in crypto crowd chatter following the Senate’s passage of US President Donald Trump’s sweeping “One Big Beautiful Bill,” with Vice President JD Vance breaking a 50-50 tie. Santiment reported a measurable increase in the social volume of the words “big,” “beautiful,” and “bill.” This means that crypto traders are actively linking market outlooks to the bill’s potential policy shifts. While the legislation itself offers no direct crypto provisions, the on-chain analytics platform noted that the traders appear to be positioning for possible ripple effects. These include broad tax cuts and consumer spending incentives that could fuel a “risk-on” sentiment favorable for Bitcoin and altcoins. Bill’s Depreciation Incentives Attract Miners The bill’s return of 100% bonus depreciation is another underreported aspect Santiment flagged as potentially bullish for Bitcoin mining. This is because it allows firms to immediately write off mining equipment purchases. Such a move is expected to incentivize rapid ASIC deployment and potentially increase Bitcoin’s hash rate. Historically, higher hash rates align with bullish cycles, particularly during monetary expansion. As such, the report noted that if looser fiscal policy intersects with rising M2 supply, crypto assets may see upward momentum. Despite market optimism, Santiment highlighted disappointment following the failure to include Senator Cynthia Lummis’ proposed amendment. The amendment aimed to address staking, mining, and microtransaction tax complications, an omission many in the industry had pushed for over the weekend. Overall, the social sentiment is still skewed bullish. Traders are mostly anticipating potential indirect benefits to crypto investments as tax cuts on overtime and tips put more disposable income into circulation. Certain others, however, remained cautious as the bill’s deep spending cuts to healthcare and green energy have triggered market anxieties, which even led to tensions between Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The latter had publicly criticized the bill and hinted at political realignment. When tracking the social reactions to this conflict, Santiment found a slight dip in Bitcoin prices mirroring Tesla’s decline. This reflected the continued correlation between Tesla stock movements and crypto market reactions during significant political events. Additionally, Dogecoin entered the narrative as traders referenced Musk’s previous humorous support through the so-called DOGE department. His current remarks warned that the bill could damage future-focused companies, further adding to volatility in sentiment. “Sell the Rumor, Buy the News” Patterns Emerge The social metric analysis suggests that while the Senate’s passage of the bill has not yet translated into significant price rallies for Bitcoin or major altcoins, the crowd mood has shifted toward cautious optimism, which is consistent with “sell the rumor, buy the news” behavior often seen in crypto markets. The ongoing legislative process is expected to influence crypto market sentiment depending on how political negotiations evolve, particularly around the potential impact on fiscal spending, Treasury markets, and Federal Reserve liquidity actions. While direct crypto wins were absent in the Senate version, the broader implications of consumer liquidity, policy volatility, and fiscal-monetary interactions will remain critical watchpoints for traders seeking to position around the “Big Beautiful Bill” narrative in the coming weeks.

Experts point to the potential risk of share dilution and volatility. The company’s past crypto ventures have also attracted attention. In May, it announced that it had held an acquisition talks worth around $800 million with “influential” crypto representatives, including memecoin investors named TRUMP, but stated that no binding agreement had been made at the time. Addentax, a textile company, is one of the latest to join the ranks of companies planning to create cryptocurrency reserves. However, some observers argue that such statements can sometimes be used to boost company stocks. The 2017 Long Island Iced Tea company’s name change to Long Blockchain Corp. and the explosion of its stock price remains one of the most remembered examples of this. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-02T18:05:45,"Trader Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says Only ‘Small Sliver’ of Time Left in Bull Market – Here’s His Timeline","An analyst who nailed Bitcoin’s pre-halving correction last year is warning that BTC ‘s current bull market cycle may be nearing an end soon. The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 108,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical precedence, Bitcoin may reach a cycle peak within just a few months. “If we’re talking about September, October, with it just being July now – July, August, September, and then October – that’s already two to three months, potentially, that we have left in this bull market.” The analyst says that based on other market cycles, Bitcoin is probably about 88% of the way through its current bull run , meaning that risk is asymmetrically skewed to the downside for BTC. “If we’re thinking about this being the entire cycle that we’ve already seen in terms of upside, from bear market bottom to bull market top, and potentially this additional upside, potentially over a period of two to three months extra, then it just showcases to us that maybe we have a very small sliver of time and price expansion left versus the price expansion and time that we’ve already seen elapse over the course of this cycle, which comes down to that 88% figure.” Source: Rekt Capital Looking at his chart, the trader suggests Bitcoin may soar somewhere near $140,000 before reaching the cycle’s high. Rekt Capital notes that some analysts are suggesting this cycle may be different from prior ones and run for longer, but such theories will have to be tested when the time is right. Bitcoin is trading for $109,463 at time of writing, up 3.1% in the last 24 hours.

I'm Margaux Nijkerk, CoinDesk’s Tech & Protocols reporter. In this issue: Vitalik Buterin: Ethereum at Risk If Decentralization Is Just a Catchphrase Bitcoin Layer-2 Botanix Mainnet Debuts, Cuts Block Times to 5 Seconds XRPL EVM Sidechain Goes Live, Unlocking Ethereum Dapps in XRP Ecosystem Securitize, RedStone Pilot ‘Trusted Single Source Oracle’ to Secure Tokenized Fund NAVs Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Network News BUTERIN: CRYPTO MUST MATURE: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wants the crypto industry to grow up fast — stressing that the industry is at an “inflection point.” Speaking in front of a packed room at the Ethereum Community Conference, in Cannes, France, Buterin used his keynote to deliver a clear-eyed reality check: decentralization, he argued, must evolve from a catchphrase to a concrete set of user guarantees — or risk becoming another hollow promise. As the industry has gone mainstream with endorsements from major corporations and political figures, builders need to return to the ecosystem’s key ideals surrounding decentralization and building for users' needs, Buterin said. In his typical jeans and relaxed dark t-shirt uniform, Buterin laid out practical “tests” that he said every crypto project should pass. These include 1) the walk-away test. If the company behind an application disappears, do users keep their assets? And 2) the insider attack test: How much damage can rogue insiders or compromised front-ends cause? And 3) whether it has a trusted computing base: How many lines of code must be trusted to protect users’ funds or data? He warned that too many layer-2 networks, DeFi projects and “decentralized” front-ends rely on hidden backdoors, instant upgrade buttons or insecure interfaces that can be tampered with and hacked. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . BITCOIN LAYER-2 BOTANIX GOES LIVE: The mainnet of Botanix, a network designed to bring Ethereum-equivalent utility to the Bitcoin ecosystem, has gone live, slashing the time it takes to add new blocks to five seconds from 10 minutes. The network is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the software that powers the Ethereum blockchain, allowing Ethereum-based applications and smart contracts to be copied and pasted onto Bitcoin, developer Botanix Labs said in an email. Botanix is one of several projects attempting to scale the Bitcoin blockchain and make it a more conducive venue for decentralized finance (DeFi) by enhancing its utility and programmability. Others include Rootstock, Stacks and BOB (""Build on Bitcoin""), which have all adopted the BitVM computing paradigm that can make complex computations verifiable on Bitcoin, paving the way for smart-contract provision, similar to Ethereum's. The expansion of Bitcoin's utility would allow developers to take advantage of the value held in BTC, which dwarfs that of all other digital assets . — Jamie Crawley Read more . XRP LEDGER EVM-SIDECHAIN MAINNET LAUNCHES : Ripple officially introduced the XRP Ledger's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain to the mainnet in an bid to improve the ecosystem's interoperability and allow developers to deploy their Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dapps) with the XRPL. The development adds EVM-compatible smart contracts while maintaining a connection to the XRPL , giving developers access to the ecosystem at a low cost, Ripple said in a blog post. It is designed to eliminate the trade-off between EVM compatibility and XRPL’s own advantages, opening the door for dapps to lean into XRP’s payments infrastructure. The sidechain operates as a separate blockchain that is parallel and connected to the XRP Ledger over the Axelar bridge, an interoperability protocol. XRPL’s native token, XRP, will serve as the native gas token for the sidechain. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . SECURITIZE, REDSTONE RELEASE NEW ORACLE MODEL WHITEPAPER: Securitize, one of the largest tokenized asset issuers, and oracle provider RedStone have released a whitepaper they say introduces a new model for securely verifying Net Asset Value (NAV) data on-chain, tailored specifically for tokenized private funds. The model, dubbed the Trusted Single Source Oracle (TSSO), is designed to address a key gap in decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure: how to reliably prove that each NAV update really comes from the trusted source — and hasn’t been tampered with once it’s on-chain. In traditional crypto markets, oracles pull data from multiple price feeds to guard against manipulation or errors. But for private funds, the NAV is calculated by a single fund administrator. That creates a unique problem: there’s no way to double-check the number through market aggregation. For DeFi protocols that rely on accurate collateral values, this single point of trust has been a sticking point. The TSSO framework solves this by creating a cryptographically linked chain of NAV updates, according to the whitepaper. Each update includes a secure digital signature, a timestamp, a reference to the previous record, and a hash that locks the sequence together. The system uses two keys: a cold-stored “root key” for major updates and a “chain key” for small, routine changes that stay within tight thresholds. This design aims to balance high security with the practical need to refresh NAV data without constant manual work. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more .

2025-07-02T18:00:34,"Bitcoin Finds Support Above 50-Day SMA, But Next Direction Remains Uncertain","Bitcoin is holding steady above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), showing signs of underlying strength despite a lack of clear directional momentum. With rising trading volume and mixed technical indicators, the next move could swing either way, keeping the market on edge. RSI Holds Neutral As Bitcoin Awaits A Clearer Signal According to Shaco AI, in a recent update on X, Bitcoin is currently hovering around $107,264.17, positioning itself just above two key moving averages. It’s nudging the 25-day SMA at $107,229.82 and holding slightly above the 50-day SMA, which sits at $107,040.81. This positioning reflects a mild bullish bias in recent sessions, keeping both bulls and bears on alert. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Market Crash After Closing Below Final Weekly Resistance Looking at momentum indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is resting at 53.36—firmly in neutral territory. This suggests that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold at the moment, offering no strong directional clues as it keeps the market guessing. Furthermore, the Average Directional Index (ADX) adds to this indecisive mood, coming in at a soft 20.44. This low reading signals a weak trend, meaning there’s not enough force from bulls or bears to drive a clear breakout just yet. In other words, the market isn’t leaning heavily in either direction. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains in negative territory at -137.33. Although it isn’t signaling any strong downward momentum, traders may want to stay cautious and alert for any sudden shift in the current tone. Despite the technical indecision, market activity is picking up. Bitcoin’s recent trading volume has surged to 1903.51, well above the average of 1522.43. This uptick signals a rise in interest and participation, indicating that traders are actively positioning themselves in anticipation of Bitcoin’s next move. Critical Zones At Play As Market Prepares For A Directional Push Looking at key levels, Shaco AI highlighted that resistance is at $108,789.99, which seems to be a strong level to overcome. The level marks a significant ceiling for Bitcoin, and any attempt to push higher will need solid momentum to break through. On the other hand, support lies at $104,622.02. This support level will be critical in case the price begins to retreat, as a breakdown here could open the door for further downside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $110,000: Why BTC Must Break Out Of This Wedge Based on current indicators, the analyst suggests it’s wise to keep an eye out for potential movement in either direction.

2025-07-02T17:59:43,"Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin Could Hit $200K by Year-End","Analysts at Standard Chartered believe Bitcoin may be gearing up for its biggest dollar rally yet . According to the bank’s H2 2025 market outlook, Bitcoin could climb to $135,000 by September 30 and reach $200,000 by the end of December. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s global head of digital assets research, highlighted rising demand from crypto funds and corporate treasuries as major factors. He also cited favorable government policies as a key driver of Bitcoin’s expected growth. Strong Inflows from ETFs and Treasuries Drive Optimism Kendrick pointed out that strong inflows into Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and growing interest from companies are now driving Bitcoin’s price. In the second quarter of 2025, spot ETFs and corporate treasuries bought 245,000 BTC. Large companies, excluding those in the Strategy Sector, purchased around 56,000 BTC. Meanwhile, the Virginia-based firm added nearly 69,000 BTC during the same period. Kendrick noted that while Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, has slowed its pace, other firms are stepping in to fill the gap. He expects even more crypto assets to be bought in the third quarter than in the second. If his forecast is correct, Bitcoin would gain over $92,000 in just six months, rising from its current price of $107,644. This would mark a record-breaking second-half performance in the cryptocurrency’s 15-year history. Investors Turning to Bitcoin as a Macro Asset Standard Chartered analysts explained that in Q2, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $12.4 billion in assets. This is more than gold ETFs, despite global tensions, especially in the Middle East. Kendrick sees this as a sign that investors are seeing the top coin more seriously as a store of value . He also noted that hedge funds have not significantly increased their short positions. This shows that investors are confident in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Traditionally, Bitcoin peaked around 500 days after its “halving” event and then declined. Kendrick believes that the cycle no longer applies, saying that ETFs and corporate buyers, which did not exist in earlier years, are now driving prices. He noted that long-term holders are likely to sell less in 2025, and continued buying will overpower any selling pressure. Policy Changes That Could Boost Bitcoin Kendrick pointed out possible policy changes that could give Bitcoin an extra push. He said that if President DonaldTrump announces a new Federal Reserve Chair early, it might lead to faster interest rate cuts. This move could raise Bitcoin’s price. Furthermore, if the GENIUS stablecoin bill, which now has bipartisan support , is passed into law soon. This would make dollar-backed tokens more popular and attract more retail investors, which would also help Bitcoin. Kendrick said Bitcoin’s price has followed long-term U.S. bond yields since early 2024 and expects this to continue. Additionally, new 13F filings suggest that big investors, including sovereign wealth funds, are buying Bitcoin. Kendrick expects this buying to increase in the next filings in August, which could push the price higher.

The agreement uses an at-the-market (ATM) share issuance structure, allowing Green Minerals to raise funds flexibly over a 12-month period. Flexible Capital Structure to Minimize Dilution The deal includes a put option that lets Green Minerals issue new shares based on market conditions. This provides capital access when needed while helping maintain shareholder value and minimizing unnecessary stock dilution. Meanwhile, LDA Capital receives a call option, enabling it to subscribe for up to 1% of the company’s shares at NOK 6.95 each at any point over the next year. A Strategic Push Toward Bitcoin Accumulation At current market rates, if Green Minerals raises the full $25 million, it could acquire around 232.34 BTC. As of now, the company holds approximately four Bitcoins but aims to significantly expand this figure through targeted funding strategies. BTC is currently recovering, approaching the $107,000 mark with a recent high of $107,724. This aligns with Green Minerals’ bullish stance on Bitcoin as a long-term store of value.

2025-07-02T17:40:49,"Did Elon Musk Really Invest $104B in XRP? The Truth Unveiled","In the world of crypto, few names generate as much interest—or confusion—as Elon Musk. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Musk's Twitter posts have notoriously sent cryptocurrencies soaring or crashing, and his public musings about Bitcoin and Dogecoin are the stuff of legend. But in June of 2025, a new wave of speculation washed over the crypto space: that Musk would be investing a whopping $104 billion into Ripple's XRP. The news spread like wildfire, causing people to discuss it, causing prices to fluctuate, and creating a flurry of social media posts. But is this rumor genuine, or is this yet another example of crypto's rumor mill gone wild? The Beginning of the Musk-XRP Rumor The latest craziness began when certain crypto news aggregators and social handles started sharing headlines asserting Elon Musk wasn't just interested in XRP, but was going to invest a mind-boggling $104 billion in the token. Others even cited ”insider sources” or stated leaked documents suggested Musk's intention to use XRP as the basis for his payment strategies on X (formerly Twitter) or Tesla. Musk rumors are discredited fact-checked by reputable crypto news outlets shortly after. There is no such valid information, Crypto Times says, that Musk plans or has invested in XRP. The $104 billion, in particular, appears to be a hoax, most likely stemming from previous speculations or misinterpreted tweets. “There is no official confirmation, filing, or credible report that Elon Musk is investing $104 billion—or any sum remotely close—into Ripple’s XRP.” — Crypto Times, June 2025 Why Do Musk Rumors Move Markets? Elon Musk's influence on crypto markets is the stuff of legend. His tweets about Bitcoin's energy usage, to mention just one example, have wiped out billions in market cap overnight. His fondness for Dogecoin turned a meme coin mainstream. So when rumor associates Musk with a new token or initiative, traders and bots react instinctively, sometimes before verifying the information. The XRP rumour was not unique. Within hours, #ElonMuskXRP was trending on Twitter, and leveraged trading volume exploded. Some XRP traders were celebrating, while others insisted on a normal ”buy the rumor, sell the news.” Fact Check: What's Actually True? No Official Investment : No SEC filing, company press release, or credible source confirms any Musk investment in XRP. No Public Endorsement : Elon Musk has never tweeted about XRP, nor has he publicly endorsed Ripple or its token anywhere in recent history. Viral Rumor Misinformation : The $104B figure also appears to be recycled rumor fuel, promoted by social media algorithms and clickbait headlines. Crypto Times and other mainstream publications enhance the importance of skepticism and research, especially when rumors involve celebrity figures like Musk. Why XRP Still Matters—With or Without Musk Despite the false rumor, XRP remains one of the most widely traded cryptocurrencies on the planet. Ripple's aggressive expansion to grow its On-Demand Liquidity network, achieve regulatory clarity, and work with banks maintains real-world adoption momentum. The Musk rumor, as false as it may be, did serve to highlight just how quickly sentiment can shift—and just how much attention XRP continues to attract. Conclusion The Elon Musk-XRP saga is the ultimate text book demonstration of what happens when rumors, hype, and Twitter converge in crypto. While the idea of a $104 billion investment was great copy, reality—the way it so often does in crypto—was much less dramatic. For investors and hobbyists alike, the lesson is straightforward: make sure to check your facts before you FOMO, and let's face it here, the world of digital assets is one where not everything that's trending is real.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9783/did-elon-musk-really-invest-104-b-in-xrp-the-truth-unveiled,"XRP|MARKET|SPONSORED|BTC|DOGE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T17:30:00,"Top Cryptos That Could Outperform Bitcoin (BTC) This Summer","While Bitcoin holds the spotlight, a quiet reshuffling is happening beneath the surface. A new wave of altcoins is drawing investor focus, not with headlines, but with traction. Leading that charge is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a $0.03 DeFi upstart gaining speed fast enough to put legacy tokens on notice. Buyers who invest at this moment will see 100% returns on investment as soon as the token gets listed. Over $11.4 million has been raised so far, and there are over 12,600 early investors. By the time the presale reaches Phase 6, the token price will be at $0.035, a 16.67% immediate return on any stage 5 investment. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, continues its recovery path, stable, scalable, and favored by builders, making it a solid if more measured play. But as summer liquidity builds and market sentiment shifts, the real upside appears to be with Mutuum Finance. Solana’s Edge Over Bitcoin This Summer Solana (SOL) is currently trading $150, and its DeFi and the app ecosystem is growing ambitious fast. It is also making an impact in the institutions: U.S. banks have been collaborating with Solana, and a potential launch of Solana-focused ETFs presupposes further penetration of the mainstream. Bitcoin (BTC), at about $107,385, still has a tight range, with the wind of the ETF now following it, yet developments in the Solana environment and developer activity continue to lead indicators that the asset is yet set to perform better than Bitcoin this summer. Comparisons to legacy assets notwithstanding, when positioned against BTC, Solana is more of an apples to oranges task in proving valuable enough to trade in, this as all eyes remain on other emerging coins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Disrupts DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing DeFi lending with a platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. There are also the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the users to agree on terms among themselves. This direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users climb the ranks they will be rewarded in bonus tokens token holding fun and competitive one.

A rigorous smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry’s most trusted security firms, has confirmed that the codebase meets high standards for transparency and safety, offering assurance to both investors and users. To further shore up its ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on an Ethereum-based fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to USD. In contrast to the algorithmic models, which are susceptible to depegging, the current stablecoin is programmed to launch long-lasting liquidity, stability, and dependability to the retail and institutional users. Bitcoin grabs attention, but real gains may lie elsewhere. Solana shows steady growth, yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight, $11.4M raised, 100% ROI locked in for Phase 5 buyers, and major traction in DeFi.

2025-07-02T17:29:49,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Generating More Revenue Than its Flagship S&P 500 Fund","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is now generating more revenue than one of the asset manager’s most iconic products, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to Bloomberg dat a. Despite having just $52 billion in AUM — a fraction of IVV’s $624 billion in total assets — IBIT’s higher fee structure has turned it into a bigger moneymaker for the world’s largest asset manager. Bloomberg estimates that IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. That means it generates around $187.1 million in annual fees, despite managing roughly nine times more in assets than IBIT. IBIT launched in January 2024 as part of a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs approved by U.S. regulators. Since then, the fund has seen inflows every month except one, amassing $52 billion in assets to date. That makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market by a wide margin. The rapid growth of IBIT highlights the ongoing demand for regulated bitcoin investment products, particularly those offered by established financial firms like BlackRock. For investors, the appeal lies in gaining exposure to bitcoin without the technical hurdles or security risks of holding the asset directly. While IBIT’s management fee is higher than more traditional ETFs, it reflects the added complexity, custody and regulatory requirements involved in offering exposure to a digital asset like bitcoin.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/02/blackrock-s-bitcoin-etf-now-generates-more-revenue-than-its-flagship-s-and-p-500-fund,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin ETF|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T17:29:18,"Bitcoin nears $110K after breaking previous resistance, TIA leads altcoin gains","Bitcoin showed strength after struggling early on Wednesday, as it neared the $110,000 level after trading above $109,000 as market participants adopted a cautious stance, resulting in subdued trading activity. The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation hovered around $3.4 trillion, showing little directional bias. Bitcoin briefly retreated to $105,560 during early Asian hours after failing to clear resistance the previous day, while the Crypto Fear & Greed Index edged down to 63, still in the “Greed” zone but reflecting a slight dip in sentiment. Altcoins fared no better, with most managing to pull off modest single-digit gains as of late Asian trading hours on July 2. Why is Bitcoin stuck? Bitcoin powered past the previous resistance zone of $108,000 as the general market sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam. The deal includes a 20% tariff on all imports from Vietnam to the US. Over the past seven days, Bitcoin has been stuck between a narrow trading range of $105,430 – $108,706 as traders awaited a potential catalyst to break the deadlock. Some of the caution was warranted, as a series of high-impact US economic data releases are scheduled this week, keeping risk appetite in check. The tone was set by the ADP private payrolls report released on Wednesday, which showed a surprise decline of 33,000 jobs in June, which marked the first monthly contraction in two years and sharply missed market expectations for a 90,000–100,000 gain. The weakness, particularly in services and professional sectors, raised concerns over the strength of the US labour market and added to fears of a broader economic slowdown. Bitcoin briefly spiked following the ADP print, pushing toward the upper end of its range near $108,000 as traders speculated on a more dovish Fed response. Investors are now bracing for the official non-farm payrolls data due on Thursday, which is expected to confirm the cooling trend in employment. Forecasts suggest around 110,000–120,000 new jobs added in June, with the unemployment rate seen ticking up to 4.3%. The market will also be watching the ISM services PMI and the release of the FOMC meeting minutes for further clues on the Fed’s policy direction. There’s also the looming July 9 deadline for the White House’s tariff decision, which could reintroduce volatility across risk assets if trade tensions escalate. Until there’s more clarity on the macro front, traders are likely to remain sidelined. Further weighing on sentiment, US spot Bitcoin ETFs ended a 15-day inflow streak on Tuesday with $342.2 million in net outflows. This marked the first sign of institutional pullback after over $4.7 billion poured in since June 9, and retail traders often view this as a bearish sign. Signs of fading risk appetite were also noticeable across derivatives markets, with the BTC Binance futures premiums falling to a 21-month low of 3.9% today. Will Bitcoin go up? Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at just 3.5% below its all-time high, which means the broader bullish structure remains intact. When looking at the Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap, a significant cluster of liquidation interest remains concentrated just above the $105,000 level. Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. To the upside, the heatmap shows a dense buildup of short liquidation levels between $107,800 and $109,000. As such, Bitcoin must decisively break and hold above $109,000 to unlock further upside and trigger a liquidation cascade that could fuel a breakout rally. In the meantime, on X, most market commentators were expecting a retest of all-time highs soon. See below.

According to pseudonymous analyst StefanB, if Bitcoin fails to maintain strength above $108,900, a level he marks as a key short-term pivot, the current rally could turn into a deviation. 4-hour BTC/USDT perpetual contract chart. Source: StefanB In that case, a rejection from this zone may set the stage for a deeper pullback, with downside targets extending toward $102,000 as liquidity below recent lows gets exposed. Altcoin market The total market cap of all altcoins rose 3.2% to $1.29 trillion over the past day. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index at 22 means much of the action is limited to Bitcoin, which remains the dominant market force at the time. Large-cap altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) saw gains ranging between 1 and 5%. Meanwhile, Celestia, Sonic, and SPX6900 led gains, rising 6.6%, 6.1% and 5.5% respectively. See below: Source: CoinMarketCap Celestia: TIA printed modest gains late in the day after Celestia’s latest mainnet upgrade, Lotus, was successfully deployed on the Mocha testnet. The Lotus upgrade has reportedly improved the network’s interoperability and reduced inflation, both of which bode well when it comes to investor sentiment. Sonic: While no major catalysts could be identified at press time, gains for S seem to be supported by the launch of new merchandise in partnership with Formula 1 star Pierre Gasly.

2025-07-02T17:27:09,"Analysis Company Shares July Expectations for Bitcoin and Altcoins – Will They Continue to Sleep, or Will the Giant Awaken?","July may continue to be a historically low-volume month for cryptocurrency markets, despite the intense political and economic agenda. According to a new report by Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33 Research, this summer could be as quiet as previous years. Recalling that July is a volatile period in the US, referred to as the “Trump trade,” Lunde drew attention to important agenda items such as the budget bill, resumption of tariff decisions, and crypto-related executive order calendars. However, despite all these potential price movements, past Julys were also notable for low-volume trading periods. “In July 2022, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius went bankrupt. Last year, there were events such as the assassination attempt on Trump and Biden's resignation. During the same period, BTC distributions from Mt. Gox and sales by the German government put pressure on the market. Despite all this, the second lowest monthly trading volume in the last four years was seen in July,” Lunde said, adding that the market went into a kind of “sleep” in the summer months. Related News: BREAKING: Critical Banking License Application Submitted by Ripple - Exciting Developments for XRP So what's on the agenda in July? July 4: The “One Big Beautiful Bill” budget bill, which President Trump is expected to sign and could increase the U.S. budget deficit to $3.3 trillion, could come into effect. This could have a short-term positive impact on digital assets such as Bitcoin, which are limited in supply. July 9: 90-day tariff moratorium ends. Trump is expected to take new trade measures against certain countries. This could put pressure on markets. July 22: Final assessment and proposal submission date for the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), which was signed in March and planned to be created with approximately 200,000 BTC (approximately $21 billion) of US seized crypto assets. The fact that details about this reserve have not been shared with the public since March increases uncertainty. Lunde warned investors that an announcement could be made on this issue at any time. Although Bitcoin is only 3% off its all-time high, funding rates, leveraged ETF exposures, trading volumes and options data reflect a cautious market stance, a factor that reduces the risk of sudden liquidations in potential uptrends, according to Lunde. “It may seem lazy to assume that this summer will be as quiet as previous years. But my current base case is that nothing new is happening. So the best strategy is to remain patient and hold onto existing positions,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-02T17:15:51,"When Will Bitcoin’s Price Reach its Top This Cycle? Analysts Give Key Insights","Long-term Bitcoin holders are seeing their unrealized profits decline even as BTC trades a little over 4% from its all-time highs. According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant, the average unrealized profit for long-term holders, based on the MVRV ratio, is around 220%. The figure is notable but lower than the 300% and 350% levels seen during the March and December 2024 market peaks. LTH Profits Slide The realized price for long-term holders now stands at $39,000, which means that significant gains are still present despite the decline in unrealized profits. Moreover, the current profit levels are similar to those last seen during the October 2024 correction, which further indicates that while BTC remains strong, the market has yet to reach peak profit extremes. To match previous cycle tops, CryptoQuant said that Bitcoin would need to climb toward $140,000, a level many are anticipating. As Bitcoin trades near $107,000, market participants are preparing for a period that has historically brought slower activity and new narratives. According to crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades, the cryptocurrency has entered the third quarter of 2025, a period historically known for slow price action and lower volumes. Summer months typically bring reduced liquidity for both BTC and ETH, which makes Q3 the quietest quarter of the year. However, Daan noted that this slower period often sets the stage for new narratives to emerge, which could present new opportunities ahead for traders. This aligns with Bitfinex experts, who said that the bull run is intact, but expect Q3 to be slower Weaker Momentum? While seasonal patterns are in play, one concerning factor is Bitcoin’s Bull Score, which has moved into neutral territory at 50. The metric gauges market conditions needed to continue a rally, and requires a reading of 60 or higher for upward momentum to continue. As such, a reading of 40 would indicate a bearish environment. The current neutral level suggests that the leading crypto asset lacks sufficient bullish strength to support a sustained price rally at this stage.

Open interest in perpetual futures listed on offshore exchanges rose by nearly 10% to $26.91 billion, the highest single-day increase since March 2, according to data source Velo. The data tracking website included activity in USD and USDT-denominated perpetuals listed on Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, and Hyperliquid. Open interest refers to the number of active or open contracts, often expressed in terms of their cumulative dollar-denominated value. An uptick in open interest alongside a price rise is said to confirm the uptrend. BTC's price surged over 3.5% to $109,600 due to a host of factors, including the disappointing U.S. ADP jobs report, which strengthened calls for Fed rate cuts, Trump's trade deal with Vietnam, and the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK). Furthermore, the perpetual funding rates of BTC and ETH rose slightly from an annualized 5% to over 7%, suggesting renewed demand for leveraged bullish plays.

2025-07-02T17:00:38,"Bitcoin Network Sees Rising Profit-taking As BTC’s Price Shows Signs Of Weakness","After holding above the $107,000 price mark for several days, Bitcoin has finally lost this key range, triggering a bearish movement to the $105,000 threshold as Tuesday drew to a close. A recent report indicates that BTC’s sudden pullback is being met with a significant increase in profit-taking among investors. As Bitcoin Falters, Network Profit-Taking Surges Bitcoin’s recent upward momentum has slowed down a little due to waning market sentiment. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin network is seeing a significant resurgence in profit-taking, which appears as the price of BTC starts to sway following a remarkable surge. The heightened profit-taking from investors was reported by Glassnode, a leading on-chain data analytics firm, after examining the BTC Realized Profit metric. A growing profit-taking coinciding with falling prices implies that BTC investors are looking to lock in gains in order to avoid further losses. Data from the on-chain platform shows that the amount of BTC realized profits rose to $2.4 billion on Monday. In addition, Glassnode noted that the 7-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) has climbed to a value of $1.52 billion. According to the platform, the 7-day SMA realized profits of $1.52 billion are above the Year-To-Date (YTD) average, which is about $1.4 billion. However, it remains much below the $4 billion to $5 billion peaks (7D SMA) observed from November to December last year. Such high figures of realized profits may underscore a cautious sentiment among BTC investors. Many traders no longer feel encouraged to hold on to their coins in light of waning price performances. Should profit-taking continue, it is likely to hinder bullish attempts, triggering a correction to key support levels such as the $100,000 mark. BTC Short-Term Holders Solely Responsible For The Profit-Taking Alva, a market intelligence platform, has shared more insights on the worrying development. It is important to note that the ongoing wave of profit-taking on the Bitcoin network is being dominated by short-term or retail holders . These investors appear to be capitalizing on local highs, whereas selling from long-term holders is fluctuating at historical levels. This echoes previous bull cycle pauses where powerful hands accumulate in silence, rather than panic-driven capitulation. The platform also highlighted that ETF inflows are still strong and whale wallets are contributing to declines despite spikes in realized profits, indicating that the market’s structural demand is present . As volatility persists just near resistance levels, the volume spike and active trading hint at a temporary shakeout phase. However, this is not a full reversal phase. If demand at lower price bands persists and ETF allocation continues, these periods could be resolved with fresh upward trends as seen in the past. With BTC hovering close to key resistance levels, the platform stressed the importance of monitoring macro triggers and the actions of short-term holders. This is due to the fact that reaccumulation among these investors might form the next price base.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rising-profit-taking/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|ETFs|Glassnode|Profit-taking|Realized Profits|Simple Moving Average|SMA",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T17:00:15,"Bitcoin Bounces Off Key Demand Level – Price Discovery On The Menu?","Bitcoin has experienced heightened volatility over the past few days, moving between critical levels as market participants await a clear breakout or breakdown. After testing $105,000 as support, BTC rebounded strongly and pushed back toward the $109,000 resistance zone—an area that has capped upward momentum for several weeks. While bulls remain in control of the broader structure, price action continues to show hesitation just below the all-time high, leaving the market in a state of uncertainty. Related Reading: Solana Hits New Milestone: Wallets Holding 0.1+ SOL Reach Record High To confirm the next leg of the long-term trend, Bitcoin needs to break into price discovery territory above $112,000 with strong volume and follow-through. Until that happens, the current range-bound conditions could persist, especially as traders weigh macro factors and profit-taking activity increases. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis pointing to another strong bounce from the 50-day moving average and exponential moving average (MA/EMA) cluster, key dynamic support levels that have repeatedly triggered bullish reactions. This bounce reinforces the underlying strength in the current trend, suggesting that buyers continue to step in at crucial levels. As long as BTC holds above this support zone, the path toward a breakout remains intact—but confirmation is still needed. Bitcoin Prepares For Expansion Phase Bitcoin appears poised to enter a new expansive phase, with a breakout above its all-time high potentially triggering a fresh wave of bullish momentum, not just for BTC, but for the broader crypto market. After weeks of grinding just below the $112,000 resistance level, Bitcoin has struggled to push decisively higher. However, the structure remains bullish, and buyers have consistently defended key demand zones around $105,000. This ability to maintain higher lows during a period of consolidation signals strong market control by the bulls. According to Jelle, Bitcoin has just seen another powerful bounce from the 50-day moving average and exponential moving average (MA/EMA) cluster—an area that has historically acted as a dynamic support zone. Each time BTC has touched this cluster in recent months, it has rebounded with renewed strength, and the latest bounce is no exception. Jelle believes this reaction confirms the uptrend remains intact, with conditions aligning for a breakout. “The trend is up—new all-time highs are very much on the menu this week,” Jelle noted, emphasizing the importance of sustained momentum above current resistance. If Bitcoin can close decisively above $112K, it would likely ignite a surge in altcoins, many of which have lagged during BTC’s dominance-driven phase. With bulls maintaining control and technical support holding firm, the market is now watching for confirmation that Bitcoin is ready to enter price discovery once again. A successful breakout could mark the beginning of the next major leg in the crypto cycle.

The 12-hour chart shows a series of failed breakouts above the $109K level in recent weeks, highlighting the strength of this resistance zone. However, bulls have continued to defend higher lows, maintaining overall market structure and preventing deeper corrections. The latest candle shows a 1.93% surge, reclaiming the 50- and 100-period moving averages around $106,000, a key short-term cluster that previously acted as support. Volume also picked up during this bounce, suggesting renewed buying interest as Bitcoin tries to establish bullish momentum.

This move directly affects offerings linked to XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other digital assets. The announcement, made by the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance on July 1, 2025, aims to strengthen investor protections and provide clarity around the application of existing securities laws to spot crypto ETFs. The development was highlighted by XRP Chancellor on X, and it signals a major step toward integrating crypto more securely into traditional financial markets. As interest in spot crypto ETFs continues to surge, this guidance provides a clearer framework for how issuers must present information about these investment products to the public. BREAKING: SEC RELEASES NEW GUIDANCE FOR CRYPTO SPOT ETFs. DISCLOSURE RULES CLARIFIED FOR ISSUERS OF $XRP , $BTC , $ETH & MORE! pic.twitter.com/hAjeKdwqX3 — XRP Chancellor (@xrpchancellor) July 2, 2025 New Standards for Crypto ETF Disclosures According to the SEC, crypto ETPs, often structured as trusts holding digital assets directly, must comply with disclosure obligations under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although these products are not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, they are still subject to anti-fraud provisions and the same core disclosure principles that apply to traditional securities. Issuers must now provide detailed and asset-specific information on the front page of their prospectuses. This includes a summary of the investment objective, the type of crypto asset held, how it’s managed, and how its value may change over time. The SEC emphasizes that each crypto asset is unique, and disclosures must reflect the particular characteristics and risks of the underlying asset. For example, issuers offering XRP-backed ETFs must identify any relevant legal risks, such as the historic SEC v. Ripple Labs litigation , and clearly explain XRP’s underlying blockchain technology, use case, and potential vulnerabilities. This level of specificity is also expected for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and any other digital asset included in a spot ETF. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Protection and Market Confidence The SEC’s guidance also requires a discussion of risk factors that may impact the trust and the value of its crypto holdings. These include price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, cybersecurity risks, and possible weaknesses in the underlying blockchain network. Issuers must also disclose whether the trust anticipates selling crypto assets over time to cover operating expenses, which could reduce the value of the ETF shares. This renewed focus on transparency aims to foster investor confidence and protect market integrity as crypto products become increasingly mainstream. The SEC reiterated that generic or boilerplate disclosures are not sufficient. Each ETF must offer tailored, fact-based information that reflects the realities of the specific crypto asset it tracks. Implications for XRP and the Broader Market This regulatory update is especially meaningful for XRP, which recently gained access to SEC-regulated investment vehicles after years of legal uncertainty . As XRP Chancellor noted, the new rules not only provide a path for wider adoption of XRP-based ETFs but also set a precedent for how the SEC may approach future crypto-linked investment products. With this guidance, the SEC has laid the groundwork for safer, more transparent crypto investing, marking another key milestone in the evolving relationship between digital assets and Wall Street.
