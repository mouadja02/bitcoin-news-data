2025-07-02T09:56:07,"Bitcoin investors sit on $1.2 trillion in profits as HODLing dominates: Glassnode","Bitcoin recently climbed back above $107,000, after a brief pullback triggered by geopolitical tensions. The rebound has put majority of investors in the green, but recent data suggests little appetite for selling According to a July 1 Glassnode report , Bitcoin ( BTC ) investors are sitting on $1.2 trillion in unrealized profits. This figure comes from the gap between Bitcoin’s $2.1 trillion market cap and its $955 billion realized cap, a metric that values each coin at the last time it moved. The trend is largely driven by long-term holders, who now control a record 14.7 million BTC, reinforcing the idea that most investors are simply not interested in selling at current prices. Daily profit-taking among investors has also cooled to under $900 million, significantly below the $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion levels seen during previous peaks. Bitcoin’s unrealized profit/loss chart |Source: Glassnode Despite last weekend’s drop from $106K to $99K during the Israel-Iran tensions, positive sentiment did not shake. Bitcoin bounced off the short-term holder cost basis of $98.3K, a key support level that often signals broader market direction. The quick recovery held up the positive momentum, keeping most investors in profit. You might also like: Bitcoin breaks through $107,000, is the stagnant period over? On-chain records also support the HODLing narrative. The Liveliness metric, which compares spending to holding activity, has continued to decline, a sign that more assets are being held than moved. Similarly, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio has dropped off, showing that realized profit and loss-taking is minimal despite the high prices. Meanwhile, stablecoin data paints a picture of a balanced market. Buying power looks steady, with no major inflows or signs of panic. Glassnode’s analysis shows that traders view the current price range as fair value, with little urgency to chase higher or dump holdings. Institutional interest also remains strong. U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to attract consistent inflows , with a recent seven-day average of $298 million. The increasing demand adds buying pressure and acts as a tailwind for BTC’s growing $2 trillion market cap. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $107,600, showing a modest uptick over the past 24 hours.

2025-07-02T09:54:23,"Tether-Celsius lawsuit proceeds as judge rejects parts of Tether’s dismissal bid","A U.S. bankruptcy judge has ruled that Celsius Network’s lawsuit against Tether can proceed, rejecting key arguments Tether raised to dismiss the case. A U.S. bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of New York has ruled that Celsius Network’s lawsuit against Tether ( USDT ) can proceed, granting in part and denying in part Tether’s motion to dismiss, according to a memorandum opinion and order filed in the Celsius bankruptcy case on June 30. Celsius Network accused Tether of improperly liquidating over 39,500 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in June 2022 as crypto prices crashed. The 39,500 BTC was put up as collateral for loans Celsius took from Tether, but the crypto lender claims Tether executed a rushed “fire sale” at an average price of $20,656 per BTC — well below market value — and failed to honor a contractual 10-hour waiting period before selling collateral. Celsius claims the liquidation cost it over $4 billion at current Bitcoin prices and constituted breach of contract, bad faith dealing, and fraudulent and preferential transfers avoidable under U.S. bankruptcy law. You might also like: What happened to Celsius Network: a year in review In a blog post , Tether described the lawsuit as “baseless,” stating: “Under the agreement, Celsius posted bitcoin (BTC) to Tether as collateral. As the price of BTC began to fall in June 2022, the agreement required Celsius to post additional collateral to avoid the liquidation of its BTC. When Celsius chose not to post additional BTC it directed Tether to liquidate the BTC collateral Tether held in order to close out its roughly 815 million USD₮ position with Tether.” Celsius, however, contends that Tether sold the BTC at a price that nearly matched the outstanding debt — without giving Celsius a chance to post more collateral, as the agreement allegedly required. In August last year, Tether sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that its operations in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong placed the case outside U.S. jurisdiction, calling the claims an impermissible extraterritorial application of U.S. law. However, the judge found Celsius presented a plausible case that the alleged misconduct involved U.S.-based communications, personnel, and financial accounts, making the claims sufficiently domestic. While some counts were dismissed, Celsius’s core claims — including breach of contract and fraudulent transfer —will move forward in court.

Between January 1 and June 30, 2025, the total number of millionaire Bitcoin wallets increased by 26,758, rising from 155,569 at the beginning of the year to 182,327 by the end of June. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); From Q1 decline to Q2 BTC recovery Interestingly, the majority of that growth occurred in the second quarter. In Q1, the number of millionaire addresses actually declined by 13,942, dropping from 155,569 on January 1 to 141,627 on March 31. That decline included 12,687 fewer addresses holding $1 million and 1,255 fewer addresses holding over $10 million. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); However, Q2 delivered a sharp rebound. By June 30, the number of wallets holding at least $1 million had jumped to 161,839, an increase of 21,589 addresses in just three months. The number of $10 million+ addresses also saw a significant rise, up 5,169 over the same period, resulting in a net gain of 26,758 new millionaire wallets over H1. Bitcoin accumulation trend returns The resurgence in high-value wallet addresses reflects strong buying activity during market dips earlier in the year, as well as renewed institutional demand following the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs . The April 2025 halving event, which cut block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, also created bullish sentiment by reinforcing Bitcoin’s long-term scarcity narrative and saw the digital asset hit $111,970 on May 22, 2025. While each wallet does not represent a unique individual since some entities may control multiple addresses, the metric is widely used as a proxy for accumulation by wealthy investors, funds, and crypto-native firms. The addition of more than 26,000 new Bitcoin millionaires in just six months marks one of the strongest accumulation cycles since the 2021 bull run, potentially signaling broader market strength heading into the second half of the year.

2025-07-02T09:39:35,"US Senate Passes Contentious Budget Bill Amid Crypto and AI Disputes","The United States Senate has narrowly passed a budget reconciliation bill strongly backed by President Donald Trump, following a tense 50-50 vote on Tuesday that required Vice President JD Vance to break the tie. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” faced criticism across party lines, with concerns centered around potential healthcare cuts, artificial intelligence regulation gaps, and redistribution of wealth through tax adjustments favoring large corporations. All Senate Democrats and three Republicans opposed the bill, pushing for amendments to address rural hospital funding and clearer guidelines for regulating artificial intelligence systems. Despite the debate, the bill moved forward without substantial changes, setting the stage for further discussions in the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Crypto Taxation Left Out During the debate, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis suggested adding provisions to correct what she described as the “unfair tax treatment” of cryptocurrency miners and stakers in the United States. However, these proposed changes did not make it to the floor in the final amendments, leaving the crypto community waiting for clarity on taxation issues. “I would have liked to have seen that [provision] in the final product,” Alaska Representative Nicholas Begich said, expressing disappointment but optimism that crypto tax provisions could be included in future critical legislation. Lummis, reflecting on the outcome, stated the bill “isn’t perfect” but is still “a major step in the right direction.” Meanwhile, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the bill for prioritizing corporate tax cuts over healthcare, accusing Trump and congressional Republicans of writing a “$15 billion check to Meta” while cutting healthcare for millions of Americans. Senate Banking Committee’s Steps Ahead The budget bill’s passage will delay other significant crypto and digital asset legislation, including the GENIUS Act and the BITCOIN Act of 2025. Although the Senate approved the GENIUS Act on June 17, which will now move to the House, Begich noted that these bills will take a backseat until budget reconciliation processes are completed. Begich indicated that discussions around creating a national Bitcoin reserve could resume later this year or early next year, while the House has already moved the CLARITY Act, focused on digital asset market structure, out of committee. However, the Senate Banking Committee is expected to draft its own version of the bill before October, hinting at further debates in Congress around the future of digital asset regulations in the United States.

2025-07-02T09:39:10,"Judge Greenlights Celsius’s $4B Showdown With Tether","A US bankruptcy judge has ruled that Celsius Network’s lawsuit against stablecoin giant Tether can move forward. Key Takeaways: A US judge ruled that Celsius’s lawsuit against Tether over a $4 billion Bitcoin liquidation can move forward. Celsius accuses Tether of breaching their agreement by selling BTC early and violating good faith. The judge found Celsius’s claims sufficiently tied to US activities. According to court documents filed Monday in New York, the judge denied Tether’s effort to dismiss allegations that it improperly liquidated Celsius’s Bitcoin collateral during the lender’s collapse. In the lawsuit, Celsius alleged that Tether sold over 39,500 Bitcoin in June 2022, using the proceeds to cover Celsius’s $812 million debt without following agreed-upon procedures. Celsius Alleges Tether Breached Deal, Committed Fraudulent Transfers Celsius argued that Tether’s actions breached their lending agreement, violated principles of good faith under British Virgin Islands law, and amounted to fraudulent and preferential transfers avoidable under US bankruptcy rules. The dispute centers on a margin call Tether issued as Bitcoin prices fell sharply. Celsius claimed that Tether sold its collateral before a required 10-hour waiting period, offloading the BTC at an average price of $20,656, before transferring the assets to its own Bitfinex accounts. Celsius said the rushed liquidation deprived it of BTC now worth more than $4 billion. The lender also argued Tether’s actions involved US-based communications, personnel, and bank accounts, giving American courts jurisdiction despite Tether being incorporated offshore. The judge sided with Celsius, finding the alleged misconduct sufficiently “domestic” in nature to keep key claims alive, including breach of contract, fraudulent transfer, and preference allegations. Tether loses bid to dismiss Celsius suit seeking to reclaim what is now over $4B of BTC that Tether took from Celsius as it fell into bankruptcy Being offshore doesn’t allow you to evade US courts – especially when virtually all Tether’s assets are sitting in the US #Tether pic.twitter.com/rdshox2n0c — Novacula Occami (@OccamiCrypto) July 1, 2025 Last year, Tether sought to dismiss the case outright, arguing the US court had no jurisdiction and that Celsius’s claims were invalid. While the judge dismissed some counts, the core allegations were allowed to proceed. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 , leaving around $4.7 billion in user assets locked on the platform. In April, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) sought a 20-year prison sentence for Alex Mashinsky , the former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius, for orchestrating a “years-long campaign of lies and self-dealing” that defrauded thousands of investors. Federal prosecutors urged the court to impose a two-decade sentence, citing Mashinsky’s central role in a scheme that left customers unable to access nearly $4.7 billion in cryptocurrency when Celsius froze withdrawals in June 2022. Judge Bars Mashinsky From Celsius Payouts Last month, a US bankruptcy judge blocked Mashinsky from claiming any share of the failed crypto lender’s bankruptcy proceeds. The ruling, entered June 16, 2025, disallows claims from Mashinsky and his entities, freeing up funds for creditor payouts under Celsius’s Chapter 11 plan. Celsius creditors, who have already received over $2.5 billion in distributions, will benefit as reserved cash, crypto, and MiningCo shares are released. The decision follows a May 2025 agreement between Mashinsky and the Celsius litigation team.

2025-07-02T09:36:28,"Crypto Startups Raise $1.15B Last Month: Will Crypto ICOs like $BTCBULL Take Off Next?","June was a strong month for the crypto and Web3 sectors, with related startups successfully raising a collective $1.15B across 140 deals. This represents a 3% increase in raised capital and a 9% increase in the number of deals compared to May, according to crypto market intelligence firm, Messari. The upward trend highlights growing confidence among angel investors in the potential of decentralized technologies. Big winners this round include Kalshi, a predictions market, which secured an $185M round , and Digital Asset , which raised $135M to develop its Canton blockchain. Private token sales also saw a resurgence, with World Liberty Finance bringing in $100M and Eigen Labs securing $70M . These figures paint a vibrant and expanding picture of growth and innovation within the crypto industry. Key Innovations Driving Investor Confidence Diving beyond the figures, the nature of the startups points to a focus on innovative and foundational technologies. Crypto startup, Zama FHE, for example, successfully closed a $57M Series B round , achieving a $1B valuation for its fully homomorphic encryption ( FHE ) technology. Investments in privacy solutions show a growing recognition of the importance of secure and scalable infrastructure for the future of Web3.

2025-07-02T09:36:09,"Bitcoin Broke Record After Record, But Why There Is Still No Movement in Ethereum and Altcoins! Analyst Explains!","According to the latest updated data, CEX spot trading volume reached a 9-month low in June. Why Is CEX Volume Declining? Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX) recorded $1.07 trillion in spot trading volume in June, the lowest in nine months, according to data. While CEX monthly spot trading volume fell to its lowest level since September 2024, decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes continued to increase. One analyst suggested that the reason for this decline is that the current crypto cycle is driven by institutional Bitcoin (BTC) investors rather than retail investments, which is affecting CEX volume. Speaking to The Block, Presto_Research analyst Min Jung said that unlike previous cycles, the last cycle was focused on institutional investors and retail investors, who still generally prefer altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), were not in the market. At this point, Jung stated that previous bull cycles were mostly retail-focused, and that retail investors still did not come to the market and did not trade due to the weak performance of altcoins, and that this situation negatively affected the CEX volume. “Bitcoin, which has shaped the last cycle, remains stable and not far from all-time highs. Despite BTC’s success, the altcoin market is struggling to rally, with most altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), still around 40% off their highs. This points to a market largely driven by institutional Bitcoin purchases, while retail participation—which generally favors altcoins—remains relatively subdued.” “There has been an increase in DEX activity due to the success of platforms like Hyperliquid and the emergence of more DEXs that offer better user experiences,” Jung said regarding the recent increase in DEX volume. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-02T09:30:53,"Dogecoin Closes June In The Red With 14% Losses, Will July Be Any Better?","With the close of June, the Dogecoin price has once again confirmed the bearish trend of the month . Following previous months, it crashed and led to double-digit losses for the meme coin. This red close for June 2025 has now marked the ninth consecutive year in which the month of June has closed in the red, bringing the average return for the month up to -7.94%. As July moves into view, we take a look at historical performance to map out how the altcoin could play out this month. Historical Performance Says More Losses For Dogecoin Since the month of June played out as expected following the historical performance, it is likely that Dogecoin will also follow the same trend for the month of July. If this does play out, then investors in the meme coin could be looking at another month of losses, going by how poorly it has performed previously. According to data from the CryptoRank website, the Dogecoin price in July has come out in the negative on average. With an average return of -3.48% and a median return of -7.31%, it means that the losses may not be as bad as what was witnessed in the month of June. But it will be in the negative nonetheless. In the last 11 years, there have only been a total of four years where the Dogecoin price ended the month of July in the green. Seven years in total have seen differing levels of losses , suggesting that there is a higher possibility that July 2025 defers toward the bears than the bulls. Going by the established average return, it could mean that the Dogecoin price could fall below the $0.15 level once again before the month is over. In this case, there could be double-digit losses ahead for the meme coin. Q3 Is A Bearish Quarter The entrance into July is not the only worrying development for the Dogecoin price, given how the meme coin has performed in the third quarter of the year so far. With July marking the first of the three months in this quarter, an adherence to historical performance would mean that the next three months would be quite bearish for the meme coin’s price. The third quarter of the year is actually the most bearish of all the quarters, with only three third quarters in the last 11 years closing in the green. The rest have seen an average of 10% losses during this quarter, with 2024 notching losses of 8.26%. When it comes to bullishness, the first and fourth quarters of the year have always been the best times for Dogecoin investors to make a profit. The fourth quarter, in particular, is the most bullish, with Dogecoin rallying 176.6% back in 2024 and 44.2% in the prior year. Given this, it could mean that Dogecoin investors still have some hardships to endure before the worst is over.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-closes-june-in-red/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Dogecoin|crypto|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T09:30:10,"Expert Explains Why Bitcoin Remains Stuck Below $120,000 Despite Wall Street’s Billions","As Bitcoin (BTC) experiences another dip, falling 5% below its record high of $111,800 reached during May’s crypto rally, analysts are probing the reasons behind its stagnation in the $100,000 to $110,000 range. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst DanteX outlined the factors contributing to this price resistance and what it could mean for the remainder of 2025. What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Despite the substantial influx of nearly $5 billion in Bitcoin acquired through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in just a few weeks, the price of Bitcoin has failed to surpass the $120,000 target identified by analysts. Public companies, Strategy and GameStop, have joined the ranks of institutional buyers, marking a significant shift in corporate interest toward Bitcoin. This growing demand indicates that there are substantial buyers ready to purchase at prices above $100,000. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury However, DanteX asserts that the market has been characterized by an unusual phenomenon: the analyst alleges that someone appears to be “strategically offloading” Bitcoin in the $100,000 to $110,000 range, effectively absorbing the demand and preventing upward movement. This selling pressure seems to come from a major player—reportedly hedge funds or early investors—actively liquidating positions to offset the inflow of institutional capital. Market Exhaustion Or Distribution? As the market enters the latter half of summer, a historically weak period for cryptocurrencies, concerns arise about liquidity and retail interest. DanteX noted that if the Bitcoin price cannot rally now, amid significant buying and market enthusiasm, the outlook may dim as trading volumes decline. The analyst further shared that the current price stagnation at near-record highs often indicates either market exhaustion or a distribution phase, suggesting that while demand exists, it is being countered by strategic selling. Despite the overall positive macroeconomic environment—where stock markets are soaring, real yields are declining, and liquidity is increasing—DanteX highlights that the Bitcoin price remains unresponsive. The analyst stated that it could imply that current holders may not be ready for a breakout or are intentionally limiting potential gains. Interestingly, when Bitcoin price movements stall, capital tends to flow into altcoins, which are often viewed as higher-risk, higher-reward investments. DanteX believes that the current skepticism surrounding the likelihood of an altcoin season amid the current market condition, could actually set the stage for one, as many investors remain “under-positioned.” Record ETF Inflows Fail To Translate Into Price Gains The role of ETFs cannot be overlooked, DanteX further said. He said that while record inflows into ETFs signal strong institutional interest, they do not always correlate with immediate price increases, especially when met with significant selling pressure. DanteX notes that much of the exchange-traded fund exposure may be hedged or arbitraged, resulting in a complex market dynamic where asset growth does not immediately reflect in Bitcoin’s spot price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shopping Spree: Strategy Continues Accumulation With $530M Purchase Looking ahead, the analyst suggests monitoring the activity of large wallets, especially those exhibiting selling patterns that align with recent price suppression. Watching macroeconomic indicators, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts or shifts in the value of the dollar, is also said to be crucial as these factors could influence market sentiment.

However, she did approve House Bill 2749, which incorporates crypto into Arizona’s financial statutes and unclaimed property laws. Meanwhile, in New York, Attorney General Letitia James criticized two federal stablecoin bills, and warned that they lack sufficient investor protections and may enable fraud. She called for stricter regulation of stablecoin issuers, FDIC protection, and digital identity requirements. In Virginia, crypto-friendly political action committees are making waves, especially after the Protect Progress PAC spent over $1 million to help elect Democrat James Walkinshaw in a special election. The PAC is part of a larger pro-crypto lobbying movement that plans to influence upcoming elections and legislation nationwide. Another Crypto Bill Vetoed by Arizona Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have created a state-managed fund for holding seized cryptocurrencies, continuing her track record of opposing digital asset legislation. House Bill 2324 proposed the establishment of a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund,” and was passed by the state House in a 34-22 vote on June 24 after being revived by the Senate. Letter from Katie Hobbs The bill outlined how seized crypto would be allocated: the first $300,000 would go to the attorney general’s office, with any remaining funds split between the AG’s office, the state’s general fund, and the proposed reserve. Hobbs, however, rejected the bill on the grounds that it would discourage local law enforcement from cooperating with state authorities by diverting seized assets away from local jurisdictions. Although the veto could technically be overridden with a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers, this outcome is very unlikely without changes in legislative support. This is not the first time Hobbs blocked cryptocurrency-related proposals. In May, she vetoed Senate Bill 1025, which would have created an Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve allowing up to 10% of state funds to be invested in Bitcoin. She called cryptocurrencies “untested investments.” She also vetoed Senate Bill 1373, which aimed to form a Strategic Digital Assets Reserve using seized crypto assets. Despite these rejections, one crypto-related measure has made it into law. House Bill 2749, which was enacted in May, modifies Arizona’s statutes to incorporate crypto assets into the state’s financial systems and unclaimed property laws, while also establishing a separate Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund managed by the state treasurer. Arizona’s efforts are part of the trend among US states exploring the integration of cryptocurrencies into public finance. In June, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill to create the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and in May, New Hampshire passed legislation allowing the state to invest in both cryptocurrencies and precious metals. According to data from Bitcoin Laws, at least six other state legislatures are currently considering similar initiatives. NY Attorney General Slams Stablecoin Bills In New York, Attorney General Letitia James called on Congress to revise two pending stablecoin bills. She argued that they fail to provide sufficient protections for investors and the broader financial system. In a letter sent Tuesday, James criticized the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, stating they lack the necessary regulatory guardrails. Although both bills have advanced in Congress, James urged lawmakers to take more time to craft legislation that encourages innovation while also safeguarding the integrity of the US banking system. The first page of James’ letter She warned that the bills do not adequately address the dangers of anonymous transactions, which can facilitate fraud and criminal activity. James recommended that stablecoin issuers be regulated in the same manner as banks, given their similar functions, and called for mandatory Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation protection for stablecoin deposits. She also pushed for digital identity requirements for all transactions to eliminate anonymity that could be exploited by bad actors. Additionally, she raised concerns that stablecoins could unfairly disadvantage local community banks already facing economic pressures. Supporters of the proposed legislation, like Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Bill Hagerty, defended the bills as efforts to protect consumers and uphold the global role of the US dollar However, James maintained her skepticism, and even extended her criticism to the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act in a separate letter last month. She argued that the bill’s provisions risk enabling fraud by shielding anonymous actors and undermining decades of investor protection laws. Letitia James has a track record of opposing aspects of the cryptocurrency industry. In April, she urged Congress to ban crypto and crypto ETFs from retirement funds after claiming they lack intrinsic value. Her office also took legal action against several digital asset firms and exchanges during her tenure. Pro-Crypto PAC Spends Big in Virginia Race Crypto met politics yet again with James Walkinshaw. He is a Democratic candidate aiming to fill the congressional seat left vacant by the late Representative Gerry Connolly in Virginia’s 11th District, and secured the party nomination after a firehouse primary that was held on Saturday. His victory came after impressive support from a cryptocurrency-backed political action committee, Protect Progress, which reportedly spent more than $1 million in June to back his campaign. The group is affiliated with the larger Fairshake PAC, which is primarily funded by industry players like Coinbase and Ripple Labs. This support is part of a plan by Fairshake to influence elections by backing candidates who are favorable to crypto innovation and regulation. (Source: Federal Election Commission ) In a statement after Walkinshaw’s win, a Fairshake spokesperson talked about the candidate’s resilience against political attacks and praised his commitment to innovation and economic opportunity. They pointed out that voters recognized the value of pro-crypto stances, and suggested that such support is resonating across party lines. The PAC’s activity in Virginia follows similar efforts in April during special elections for two Florida House seats, where its affiliate, Defend American Jobs, spent more than $1.5 million. While crypto-backed PACs were less visible in New Jersey’s June gubernatorial primaries, Fairshake has suggested that it has broader ambitions. As of January, the group reported holding more than $116 million in cash reserves to support crypto-friendly candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. Their aim is to strengthen the representation of crypto advocates in Congress, where 270 “pro-crypto” lawmakers already hold seats after the 2024 elections . Legislative efforts on crypto are also advancing in the current session, with the Senate passing stablecoin regulations and drafting a comprehensive digital asset market structure bill.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9777/katie-hobbs-vetoes-plan-to-hold-seized-crypto-in-state-fund,"REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

According to Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, the XRP spot ETF currently has a 95% chance of being approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In an X post on July 1, the analysts highlighted that XRP now ranks among the top digital assets most likely to secure spot ETF approval this year, joining Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ).

The final SEC decision deadline for XRP’s spot ETF is set for October 10, 2025. The Commission currently classifies XRP as a commodity, a crucial regulatory status that significantly boosts its approval odds. Impact of SEC case However, some observers suggest the SEC may be waiting for the conclusion of its long-standing legal battle with Ripple before moving forward with an approval. Both parties have shown interest in settling the case through a settlement. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also expressed a strong desire to bring the matter to a close. For now, investors seeking exposure to a spot XRP ETF can look to Brazil and Canada, the only countries that have approved trading of such products . However, these ETFs have had little impact on XRP’s price so far, mainly due to the relatively small size of their financial markets. Meanwhile, other top crypto assets, such as Litecoin ( LTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), also have strong approval odds, each at 95%. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.20, down 0.54% over the past 24 hours but up 0.75% on the weekly chart, consolidating within a familiar range. XRP seven-day price chart.

2025-07-02T09:15:31,"‘Elevated Inflation Era’ Underway As Treasury Secretary Bessent Rejects Idea of Issuing Long-Term Bonds: Macro Guru Jim Bianco","Macro strategist Jim Bianco thinks the US is in an “elevated inflation era.” In a new interview with Bloomberg, Bianco, the president of Bianco Research, pointed to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said in an interview this week that he wouldn’t issue long-term bonds with the Federal Reserve’s current interest rates. “Why would we do it at these rates? We are more than one standard deviation above the long-term rate, so why would we do that? The time to have done that would’ve been in 2021, 2022.” Bianco says Bessent’s comment implies that there’s something wrong with the bond market, but the macro strategist argues that the reality is the rates are just reflective of the new economic environment. “I’m an inflationista at heart, I think that the cycle of inflation ended in 2020, and we’re in an elevated inflation era. Now that I’ve said that, I always like to quip, ‘I don’t mean 8-10% or Zimbabwe inflation, but I mean like 3-4% inflation.’ And I’m talking about core, and we’re at about 2.8% right now. I think that’s the biggest risk, is that we settle in at a 3ish percent or low 3% on the inflation rate, and then the realization is normal interest rates are around 5% and that is the world we live in.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-02T09:08:28,"Arizona Governor vetoes Bitcoin reserve fund bill built on seized assets","Arizona’s governor Katie Hobbs has vetoed a bill that would have created a state-managed Bitcoin reserve fund using seized digital assets. House Bill 2324, which cleared the Arizona Legislature last month, proposed the establishment of a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund.” The fund was designed to hold digital assets confiscated through criminal forfeiture, including Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrencies. The legislation passed the House in a 34-22 vote on June 24 after narrowly clearing the Senate 16-14 on June 20. Lawmakers had revived the bill through procedural motions after the House initially rejected it on May 7. The bill sought to update Arizona’s forfeiture laws to cover digital assets explicitly and outlined procedures for seizing, storing, and liquidating cryptocurrencies and other virtual property obtained in criminal investigations. Under the proposed structure, the first $300,000 in forfeited assets would be directed to the Attorney General’s office. Any remaining funds would be split 50% to the Attorney General, 25% to the state general fund, and 25% to the new reserve fund. In her veto letter , Governor Katie Hobbs raised concerns that the bill would “disincentivize local enforcement from working with the state on digital asset forfeiture by removing seized assets from local jurisdictions.” The veto effectively blocks the creation of the reserve fund unless lawmakers can secure a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override the decision, an outcome considered unlikely given the vote margins. Hobbs maintains caution around crypto HB 2324 is the third cryptocurrency-related measure Hobbs has vetoed this year. In May, she rejected Senate Bill 1025, which proposed creating an Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that would allow the state treasurer to invest up to 10% of public funds in Bitcoin. Hobbs cited concerns over exposing taxpayer resources to what she called “untested investments.” She also vetoed Senate Bill 1373, which aimed to form a Strategic Digital Assets Reserve funded by seized assets and appropriations. Like SB 1025, this bill would have granted the state authority to actively manage and deploy digital assets, a move the governor viewed as fiscally risky. The only cryptocurrency reserve-related legislation signed into law by Governor Hobbs this year is House Bill 2749. It was signed into law in May and amends Arizona’s unclaimed property laws to include digital assets that have been abandoned for at least three years. Arizona’s Department of Revenue has been authorised to take custody of these assets in their original digital form and establish a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund managed by the state treasurer. Unlike HB 2324, HB 2749 does not involve criminal forfeiture of assets or direct state investment. Instead, it deals with assets already under the state’s control due to dormancy. The state is also permitted to stake these assets or accept cryptocurrency airdrops through qualified custodians, with all proceeds directed to the reserve fund. Across the US, some states have moved ahead with similar crypto reserve initiatives. Texas Governor Greg Abbott recently signed legislation to create the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , a state-run fund that will hold Bitcoin as part of the state’s long-term assets. Likewise, New Hampshire passed a bill in May allowing the state to invest public funds in cryptocurrencies and precious metals.

2025-07-02T09:02:18,"Celsius Wins Key Round in $4 Billion Lawsuit Against Tether","The post Celsius Wins Key Round in $4 Billion Lawsuit Against Tether appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Celsius Network just got the green light to take Tether to court over one of the biggest disputes in recent crypto history – a $4 billion lawsuit centered around the liquidation of Bitcoin during Celsius’s collapse in 2022. A U.S. bankruptcy judge has allowed the case to move forward, rejecting major parts of Tether’s attempt to shut it down. The ruling could have lasting consequences for how global crypto firms are held accountable in U.S. courts, especially when billions are on the line. Here are the deets. Tether’s “Fire Sale” of Bitcoin Under Scrutiny The case goes back to June 2022, when Celsius was already under pressure as crypto markets crashed. Tether, which had lent money to Celsius, allegedly sold over 39,500 BTC at an average price of $20,656, well below market value at the time. Celsius says this was done without proper notice AND in violation of a 10-hour waiting period that was part of their agreement. Celsius claims this move not only broke their contract, but also amounted to fraudulent and preferential transfers under U.S. bankruptcy law. At today’s prices, Celsius says the early liquidation cost them over $4 billion worth of Bitcoin. The BTC, according to court documents, was later moved to Bitfinex, Tether’s sister company. Tether’s Jurisdiction Argument Fails Tether tried to get the case dismissed, arguing that a U.S. court has no authority since the company is based in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong. But the judge disagreed. The court found that Tether used U.S.-based personnel, bank accounts, and communications in its dealings with Celsius enough to consider the activity “domestic.” That ruling now opens the door for Celsius’s lawsuit to proceed in the U.S., even though Tether operates offshore. Some lesser claims were dismissed, but the judge is allowing Celsius to pursue key charges – including breach of contract, fraudulent transfer, and preferential transfer. Big Implications for Crypto Lending and Stablecoins This isn’t just a courtroom fight between two crypto companies. The ruling could influence how similar cases are handled in the future especially when it comes to stablecoin issuers, asset custody, and cross-border lending practices. If Celsius proves its claims, it could raise serious questions about how major players like Tether manage client assets during times of market stress. Tether Keeps Expanding Despite Legal Pressure While the legal battle continues, Tether isn’t slowing down. The company recently bought a majority stake in Twenty One Capital, a firm linked to Strike CEO Jack Mallers. With that move, Tether is now connected to the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. Tether also transferred nearly 37,230 BTC, worth about $3.9 billion, to addresses tied to the platform further strengthening its position in the Bitcoin market. In the middle of all this, CEO Paolo Ardoino has dismissed talk of a Tether IPO. Even as speculation swirls over a possible $500 billion valuation, Ardoino said the company has “no plans” to go public. What’s Next? The case now heads to the next phase, with Celsius aiming to hold Tether accountable for what it sees as a massive breach of trust.

According to data from crypto.news, BTC ( BTC ) is standing just above the $107,000 threshold. On July 2 at 7:30 UTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading hands at $107,111. In the past 24 hours, the token has gone up slightly by 0.2% So far, it has stayed well above the $107,000 threshold, with only brief corrections bringing it down to $106,982 before bouncing back above $107k. When traced back, the token has begun to show signs of a gradual rally. So far, BTC has gone up by 0.44% in the past week and by 2% in the past two weeks. The surge in Bitcoin price has also served to boost its trading volume. Compared to the previous trading day, BTC’s daily trading volume has gone up by 22.8%, raising the number to $26.8 billion in the past 24 hours. This increase in trading volume marks a rise in recent market activity. Bitcoin has broken through the $107,000 threshold recently, July 2, 2025 | Source: crypto.news You might also like: Here’s why the crypto market is at a standstill as tech stocks take flight The last time Bitcoin was able to reach above $107,000 and even surge beyond $110,000 was back in early June, specifically on June 10. But that was before the crypto market got dragged down by geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel as well as the cautious stance towards interest rate cuts from the Fed. Bitcoin’s upward momentum is mostly driven by accumulation by institutional holders, like Michael Saylor’s Strategy as well as other “copy-cat” firms which have warmed up to BTC treasury operations. The strengthening of Bitcoin and other alternative assets like gold could be attributed to the weakening U.S. dollar, which has reportedly been losing its grip as it falls by record levels in 2025 alone. According to a report by Al Jazeera, the dollar index has fallen by 10.8% within the first half of this year. Could July boost Bitcoin even higher? Matrixport analysts predicted that BTC could hit a new all-time high this month, even going as high as $116,000. Based on analysis of historical Bitcoin patterns, analysts have found a consistent period of strong gains whenever July rolls around. For instance, BTC once hit its highest July peak in 2020, rising by as much as 23.9%. The next two years that followed also generated strong gains. Analysts have concluded that the month of July turns up an average return of more than 9.1%. “This creates a clear risk or reward skew to the upside as we head into July,” said Matrixport analysts. Just a day prior, crypto.news reported that BTC was stuck in a resistance zone and showing signs of a bearish divergence. However, it has rebounded back to the $107,000 level and is increasing steadily today. As traders enter the month of July, it remains to be seen whether the prediction will come to pass and whether BTC will finally be able to break free from its stagnation period.

2025-07-02T08:48:53,"Bitcoin Investors Hold Tight as BTC Finds Strong Support at $98K, Glassnode Says","Bitcoin holders are tightening their grip on their coins, with Glassnode reporting Tuesday that the majority of investors now sit on unrealized profits after BTC’s rebound to $107,000. Key Takeaways: Most Bitcoin investors are sitting on unrealized gains averaging 125%, with few rushing to sell. Bitcoin’s support around $98,300 signals strong confidence among short-term holders. Analysts warn long-term holder selling could cap BTC’s momentum despite bullish sentiment. The blockchain analytics firm noted that Bitcoin has found solid support around $98,300, the average price paid by short-term holders, those who bought within the past 155 days, a level proving key in the current consolidation phase. According to Glassnode, total unrealized profits among Bitcoin holders have climbed to $1.2 trillion, closing in on the all-time high of $1.3 trillion set late last year. Bitcoin Investors Up 125% on Average The average investor is sitting on a paper gain of 125%. Yet despite these significant profits, selling activity has slowed dramatically, with investors preferring to HODL rather than cash out at current price levels. “Despite this surge in profitability, investor behavior signals a strong preference for HODLing, as the current price range appears insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking,” Glassnode said in its report. Metrics such as realized profits and new highs in long-term holder supply further indicate that holders are content to wait for higher prices. The analytics firm highlighted that after a burst of selling around Bitcoin’s May all-time high, short-term holders have backed off, signaling they believe the market has room to move higher. Glassnode concluded that a price shift, either above current highs or significantly lower, may be necessary to unlock more supply. The Futures tab adds derivatives context.

Helps you understand positioning and market expectations. pic.twitter.com/jakRiTfi2G — glassnode (@glassnode) July 1, 2025 At press time, Bitcoin is trading around $106,170, just 5.5% below its record of $111,970 reached on May 22. The strong monthly close in June above $107,000 has fueled expectations for another leg up. Still, some analysts caution that selling by long-term holders could be capping Bitcoin’s momentum. Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments said persistent unloading by these investors since January’s spot ETF launches has weighed on the price, keeping BTC stuck near the $100,000 level despite strong institutional interest. Bitcoin Rally Stalls as Profit-Taking Rises As reported, Bitfinex strategists have said that Bitcoin’s surge from $73,000 to over $107,000 since April appears to be stalling amid fading momentum and increased profit-taking by investors who bought under $80,000. The analysts noted a slowdown in spot volumes and weaker buy pressure, signaling a potential consolidation phase or local top. Bitfinex experts said Bitcoin’s next significant move will depend on macro factors, especially the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, and ongoing institutional demand driven by US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Those ETFs have pulled in $4.63 billion since June 9, with expectations for positive flows to continue. Despite near-term caution, analysts stressed that Bitcoin’s higher time frame structure remains intact, with key support levels holding firm. For one, economist Donald Dean suggested Bitcoin is primed for a breakout following tight consolidation near recent highs. $BTCUSD $BTC Bitcoin – Getting Ready to Move Price Target: $130,981 Bitcoin is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf.

2025-07-02T08:48:29,"Public Companies Buy More Bitcoin Than ETFs for Third Consecutive Quarter","Publicly traded companies are rapidly building bitcoin (BTC) reserves, buying more of the largest cryptocurrency than U.S. exchange-traded-funds (ETF) for the third straight quarter, according to CNBC . Corporations increased their bitcoin holdings by about 18% in the three months ended June 30, adding roughly 131,000 BTC. The ETF holdings grew 8%, or around 111,000 BTC, based on figures from Bitcoin Treasuries.net . ETFs still hold the largest stash of bitcoin among single entities, with over 1.4 million BTC, which makes up about 6.8% of bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million, according to CNBC. The last time ETFs surpassed public companies in bitcoin buying was back in third-quarter 2024, before U.S. President Donald Trump secured reelection. In April 2025, despite market volatility from Trump’s tariff announcements, public companies expanded their bitcoin holdings by 4% outpacing the 2% growth seen among ETFs, according to CNBC.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/02/public-companies-buy-more-bitcoin-than-etfs-for-third-consecutive-quarter,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION","Markets|MicroStrategy|Bitcoin|Digital Asset Treasury|Bitcoin ETF|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T08:46:40,"US Degens Drive $500k Stampede Into Bitcoin Pepe","US degens have just poured $500,000 into Bitcoin Pepe as MEXC just confirmed it will list Bitcoin Pepe after the presale ends, joining BitMart, which announced support back on June 17, triggering another $300k surge. In total, over $16.2m has been raised. At a current price of only $0.0437 and just days left until the final announcement on July 31, early backers might be sitting on the next generational 100x rocket, and new investors are piling in fast. Bitcoin Pepe is building the first-ever meme layer on Bitcoin, with its own token standard, L2, and a vision to become Solana on Bitcoin. At this pace, presale prices won't last long. Visit the official Bitcoin Pepe website to stay ahead. Bitcoin Pepe: DeFi and Bitcoin converge on this layer 2 Bitcoin’s strength has always been its stability, but that same strength has made it hard to build anything new on it. While other chains became home to tokens, games, apps, and memes, Bitcoin mostly stayed untouched, useful for holding, but not much else. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is transforming this situation by providing a platform for activities that have traditionally been off the OG chain. PEP-20, its token standard, enables the direct issuance of assets on Bitcoin, thereby enabling projects that were previously unable to launch there. Not just tokens for speculation, but memes, community coins, and tools that make Bitcoin feel connected to the broader crypto world. Alongside this, a dedicated layer 2 is in the works, something that brings faster transactions and lower fees without giving up Bitcoin’s security. Early looks at the bridge interface suggest a focus on simplicity: wallet support is clear, flows are intuitive, and there’s none of the awkwardness that’s made BTC feel inaccessible. What makes Bitcoin Pepe stand out isn’t just what it adds, but where it does it. Memes, once scattered across faster but riskier chains, can finally find a home on the most established network in crypto—with tools that make everything simple. Bitcoin Pepe is about to go live: What could happen to the price? What started as a niche experiment is now drawing sustained capital, with US traders pouring in $500k. Two exchange listings have already been confirmed. BitMart was first, followed by MEXC, which brings significantly more liquidity and global exposure. Tier 1 listings aren’t typical for projects still in presale, and the timing matters. Interest has also spilled into staking, which stabilizes the project. The initial pool filled in minutes, and a second was launched with 1.5 million BPEP and a 15,000% APY, proving that there is enormous demand for long-term holding of BPEP tokens, a major bullish signal. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Pepe is forming partnerships around its perimeter. Recent integrations with Me3, Plena Finance, and GETE Network point to a strategy that goes beyond memes and into infrastructure: AI, gaming, DeFi, and creator tools. With Bitcoin pushing upward again and liquidity returning to the market, lower-cap projects that sit close to core narratives, like BPEP’s infrastructure on BTC, will move first and fastest. Bitcoin Pepe may still be under the radar, but it’s unlikely to stay there once trading opens and listings go live. $500K inflows, Tier 1 listing confirmed: Is this Bitcoin’s first 100x trade? Bitcoin Pepe has already done more in presale than most projects manage post-launch. It’s raised over $16.2m, secured a Tier 1 listing on MEXC—rare for anything at this stage—and leaked early builds of its bridge, DEX, and explorer interface. At only $0.0437, the presale momentum is accelerating day by day as US degens and influencers are backing the project across crypto X and other social media platforms. And now, the final reveal is one last reveal before the project crosses from buildup to breakout. If recent momentum is any indication, the remaining allocation may not last that long. This is the last stretch before the July 31 announcement could trigger a 100x moonshot. To learn more and purchase BPEP, visit the official Bitcoin Pepe website .

They include Circle’s (CRCL) EURC and Société Générale’s (GLE) EURCV alongside MiCA-compliant dollar coins such as SocGen's USDCV and the Robinhood (HOOD)-backed Global Dollar USDG . Speaking about securing an EMI license from BaFin, Alexander Höptner, CEO of AllUnity said in a statement: ""This license is not just a regulatory hurdle cleared, it’s a foundational step towards building a truly secure, transparent and compliant digital cross-border payment ecosystem for Europe and global markets.""

2025-07-02T08:11:32,"$2.4B in Crypto Stolen This Year: FATF Demands Tougher Global Crypto Rules","The post $2.4B in Crypto Stolen This Year: FATF Demands Tougher Global Crypto Rules appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On June 26, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released updated guidelines that call for stronger global action to address illegal finance risks in virtual assets. The Paris-based watchdog called on countries to ensure the global implementation of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CFT) in virtual assets. FATF Report for Stricter Crypto Regulation FATF stated that while some progress has been made since 2024 in regulating virtual assets, many jurisdictions still have to combat risks as crypto scams surge. As part of its sixth targeted update, the agency highlights the need for licensing and registration since many jurisdictions have reported challenges in mitigating the risks of offshore virtual asset service providers (VASPs). As 99 jurisdictions have either passed or are in the process of implementing travel rules, FATF released a report on Travel Rule Supervision to ensure transparency around cross-border payments. “To assist global implementation of the Travel Rule, the FATF has also published Best Practices on Travel Rule Supervision today. This report provides examples of good practices that jurisdictions may consider when developing their supervisory frameworks,” FATF said . [post_titles_links postid=”477206″] What triggered it? As of 2025, only 40 out of 138 jurisdictions assessed were largely compliant with FATF crypto standards, as countries continue to find difficulty in identifying the entity behind crypto transactions. FATF states, “With virtual assets inherently borderless, regulatory failures in one jurisdiction can have global consequences.” This FATF report is a response to the rising concerns about illicit risk in the financial domain related to crypto. As the crypto hacks have surged in 2025, reaching over $2.47 billion, FATF appears to be laying the groundwork for safety and transparency measures in crypto transactions. Crypto Thefts in 2025 As the crypto thefts have skyrocketed from 2024— A North Korean criminal gang stole $1.46 billion from VASP Bybit (in 2025), without much recovery. Another $51 billion was stolen in illicit on-chain activity in 2024 These thefts prompted the regulator to urge stricter regulations and action for crypto transactions and norms for VASPs.

2025-07-02T08:05:03,"Connecticut passes law blocking the state from creating a Bitcoin reserve","Connecticut has officially passed a law that restricts the state government from accepting, holding, or investing in virtual currency, effectively banning the creation of a cryptocurrency reserve. On June 30, Governor Ned Lamont signed House Bill 7082 into law, following unanimous approval by both chambers of the state legislature. The legislation, now enacted as Public Act 25-66, is scheduled to take effect on October 1, 2025. The bill, introduced in February by Representative Jason Doucette, advanced swiftly through the legislative process. It passed the House and Senate without a single opposing vote, which confirms a strong bipartisan consensus on limiting state involvement with digital assets such as Bitcoin. The new law prohibits Connecticut and its political subdivisions from accepting virtual currencies for payments or from purchasing, holding, or establishing any form of digital asset reserve. The statute adopts a broad definition of “virtual currency” under section 36a-596 of the state’s general statutes, encompassing most cryptocurrencies in circulation today. Further, it implements extensive regulatory updates to the state’s money transmission framework and mandates that crypto businesses operating under the state’s jurisdiction maintain a 1:1 reserve backing for all customer-held digital assets. The law also introduces mandatory risk disclosures, fraud protection measures, and strict transaction limits for virtual currency kiosks commonly known as crypto ATMs. You might also like: Arizona governor vetoes bill to create Bitcoin Reserve from seized assets The legislation effectively removes Connecticut from ongoing state-level efforts to integrate Bitcoin into public treasury strategies. While some states have moved to adopt strategic reserves as part of broader digital asset initiatives, Connecticut’s blanket prohibition makes it one of the most restrictive jurisdictions in the country regarding cryptocurrency adoption by state institutions. By contrast, at least 17 U.S. states are currently reviewing legislation focused on creating state-managed Bitcoin or digital asset reserves, according to data from crypto legislation tracker Bitcoin Laws. Among them, New Hampshire and Arizona have fully enacted such frameworks, while Texas has cleared similar legislation through both chambers. However, not all efforts have succeeded. On July 1, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed House Bill 2324, which sought to establish a Bitcoin reserve fund using cryptocurrencies seized by the government. Hobbs argued that the proposal could discourage local law enforcement from engaging in digital asset investigations by redirecting forfeited assets away from local agencies.

2025-07-02T08:01:13,"US Bitcoin ETFs end 15-day inflow streak as BTC price faces bearish momentum","Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. saw net outflows for the first time in nearly three weeks as investors positioned cautiously ahead of what has historically been a slower quarter for Bitcoin. According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined $342.25 million in net outflows on July 1. This marked the end of a robust 15-day inflow streak that had brought in a cumulative $4.73 billion into the funds since mid-June. Fidelity’s FBTC led the withdrawals with $172.73 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw $119.51 million redeemed. ARK 21Shares’ ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB also contributed to the net redemptions, recording outflows of $27.03 million and $22.98 million, respectively. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT, the top-performing ETF during the recent inflow streak, saw zero net movement on the day, while the remaining ETFs also recorded no activity. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a third consecutive day of net inflows. On Tuesday, ETH-focused funds collectively attracted $40.68 million. The majority of these inflows came from BlackRock’s ETHA, which posted $54.84 million in net additions, and Grayscale’s ETHE, which added $9.96 million. These gains were partially offset by $24.11 million in outflows from Fidelity’s FETH. You might also like: Dow Jones up 300 points as Senate passes Trump’s budget, Tesla drops 8% The sharp reversal in Bitcoin ETF flows coincided with the U.S. Senate’s passage of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” on July 1, a sweeping $3.3 trillion spending package passed with a narrow 51–50 vote, with Vice President J.D. Vance breaking the tie. Despite lobbying from pro-crypto lawmakers, the 1,000-page legislation did not include any specific provisions related to Bitcoin, crypto mining, or staking, disappointing portions of the digital asset industry. The bill will now return to the House for final reconciliation ahead of the July 4 deadline set by the president for signature. The absence of crypto-related language in the legislation, despite initial optimism, may have contributed to the profit-taking seen across Bitcoin-related funds. The broader cryptocurrency market reacted by dropping nearly 2.3% to an intraday low of $3.36 trillion as of press time. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped close to 2% to a session low near $105,000 on Wednesday morning. According to CoinGlass data , total crypto market liquidations reached $242.6 million on July 1, with the majority stemming from long position liquidations. This indicates that bullish traders either closed or were forced out of their positions, likely securing profits or limiting downside exposure, while bearish positioning remained intact. Historically, the third quarter has underperformed relative to other periods, as noted by analysts. Since 2013, Bitcoin has averaged just a 5.47% gain in Q3, making it the weakest of the four quarters in terms of historical returns, according to CoinGlass data. This trend may be contributing to the cautious repositioning among investors. When writing, Bitcoin had shed some of its intraday losses and was back above $107k, up nearly 40% from its year-to-date low of $76,300 seen in early April.

2025-07-02T08:00:48,"Altcoin Season Starting Soon? Analyst Predicts 37% Crash In Bitcoin Dominance","The Bitcoin dominance remaining on the high side has been one of the major hindrances for the altcoin season. Going by past performances, the Bitcoin dominance would have to crash for altcoins to have a chance to rally, but with the dominance still climbing, the chances of an altcoin season remain slim. As this trend continues, a crypto analyst has predicted a possible turn in the tide for the Bitcoin dominance, predicting a crash that could give altcoins a chance. Bitcoin Dominance Rejection From Trendline Is Key Over the years, the Bitcoin dominance has been following a trendline that has often marked the point of resistance. This trendline rises from 2017 and has sloped down past 2021 and now into the year 2025. The significance behind this is the breakdown from the trendline and the Bitcoin dominance receding sharply from here. Related Reading: Pundit Warns Bitcoin Is Setting Up Liquidity Traps As It Campaigns For New ATHs Presently, the Bitcoin dominance is still sitting high above 65% at the time of this writing, but this recent rise has seen it touch the resistance trendline. According to crypto analyst CoreCrypto, this is a critical inflection point, especially on the weekly chart. More importantly, this is usually the point where dominance recedes, giving rise to altcoin dominance. Some major developments that the analyst tells investors to watch on the dominance chart include a rejection from the resistance trendline, where the dominance currently lies above 65%. There is also support for the dominance, as shown by the yellow line in the chart below. A break below this support is critical for the fall in the dominance. Another development to watch out for is for rising Ethereum strength. In the past, the Ethereum price starting to outperform the Bitcoin price has often signaled the start of the altcoin season. So, as the ETHBTC chart begins to strengthen and Bitcoin succumbs to sideways movement, it opens the door for altcoins to rally into the next altcoin season. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move In the event of a break from the resistance trendline, the analyst sees the possibility of a sharp decline. CoreCrypto predicts a 36.91% drop to the 42%-45% levels. This is lower compared to previous altcoin seasons, but follows the declining trend of a 50.79% drop in 2017 compared to a 45.10% drop in 2021. “If BTC.D gets rejected from this resistance again, it could mark the start of the long-awaited Altseason 2025,” the crypto analyst explained. “A breakdown from this wedge would likely result in capital rotation from BTC into altcoins — just like in previous cycles.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-bitcoin/,"ETH|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING","Altcoin|altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin Season|Altcoin season news|bitcoin|bitcoin dominance|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc dominance|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T07:47:49,"Bitcoin Slips to $106K Amid Market Caution, Powell Offers No Timeline on Rate Cut","Bitcoin has witnessed a dip below the support area on Wednesday, resulting in the expected quick decline. The descending triangle comes amid Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell having a long-term hold on his “wait and see” approach to Fed interest rate cuts. Similar to the stock market, Bitcoin’s price have become increasingly tied to interest rates and other macroeconomic indicators recently. As a result, escalating tensions between Powell and President Trump have caused BTC and other tokens to slump. The world’s largest crypto dropped below $106,000 on Wednesday, extending its decline by 2.47% over the last two days. Last week, Bitcoin rose sharply by 7.32%, closing above $108,000. However, since Monday, Bitcoin has continued its decline after facing a correction, closing below $106,000. At the time of writing, the token hovered around $106,998. “Rate cut expectations, political tensions, and a declining apparent demand signal some short-term caution,” James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet, told Cryptonews. However, he is optimistic that despite the scenario, markets would experience momentum into Q3. Crypto Markets Dip Following Powell Comments Fed Chair Powell on Tuesday commented on the President’s aggressive lobbying to cut interest rates. Trump has been putting pressure to follow central banks worldwide that have acted faster. During the European Central Bank’s annual conference in Portugal, Powell said that the decision depends on “how the data evolves.” However, he did not hint at the timing of rate cuts. Trump and Powell have been playing a blame game recently over the Fed rate cuts. The President had sent a handwritten note to Powell on Monday, accusing the Fed Chair “for allowing this to happen to the United States.” “If they were doing their job properly, our Country would be saving Trillions of Dollars in Interest Cost,” Trump’s note read. Besides, the President has encouraged Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May. “No inflation, our country’s strong, our interest rates should be 3 points lower…you’ve got a moron at the head of the Fed.

Further, interest rates would have lowered by now if not for the president’s tariff agenda, Powell added. Following Powell’s comment, Bitcoin saw a 1.3% slump, trading at $105,859 on Tuesday. “President Trump is yet again voicing his intent to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and this, more than any other macroeconomic factor, has the ability to cause more short-term financial havoc,” Toledano told Cryptonews. However, he added that these provoke short‑term moves, while long‑term direction is driven by fundamentals. “Bitcoin is only going one way as far as the arc of history is concerned.” The post Bitcoin Slips to $106K Amid Market Caution, Powell Offers No Timeline on Rate Cut appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-dips-to-106k-after-fed-powell-remain-mute-on-rate-cuts/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|FIAT","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Donald Trump|fed rate cut",cryptocompare

Additionally, income from mining, staking, or receiving crypto as payment is taxed as ordinary income.

Crypto ownership in the US has nearly doubled since 2021, rising from 15% to 28%. 14% of non-owners plan to buy crypto in 2025, and 67% of current owners plan to buy more this year. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are the top three cryptocurrencies Americans plan to purchase in 2025. Crypto mining in the USA In 2025, the US leads the world in Bitcoin mining , accounting for over one-third of global mining power. On March 20, 2025, the SEC clarified that proof-of-work crypto mining is not subject to federal securities laws, removing registration requirements for miners. There is no federal ban on crypto mining; regulation is handled at the state level, with some states offering incentives and others imposing environmental restrictions. The Trump administration’s deregulatory approach in 2025 has encouraged domestic mining growth, but all miners must still comply with federal AML and CFT rules. Environmental concerns and energy usage debates continue, especially in states considering stricter oversight or moratoriums on mining operations. US Government’s Crypto Holdings As of April 2025, the US government holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoins, valued at about $18.3 billion. The US is the world’s largest state holder of Bitcoin, with these assets primarily acquired through law enforcement seizures and forfeitures. In March 2025, President Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile, consolidating all federally held Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies (including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP) as permanent reserve assets. Conclusion US crypto regulation in 2025 marks a major turning point. The old approach of punishing innovation is being replaced with clear rules, legal support, and a national strategy for digital assets. While financial crimes are still a concern, the overall direction is bold, business-friendly, and built for long-term crypto adoption.

Analysts predict a gradual price increase, with potential highs reaching $175 by 2030. Bitcoin SV price (BSV) has been on muted growth trajectory compared to other altcoins. Since the beginning of the year, signaling prolonged bearish sentiment, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has consistently traded below its 200-day EMA band. Despite attempts to gain traction, the asset has failed to show any long-term bullish reversal, raising doubts among investors and traders about its recovery potential.

Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 Bitcoin SV Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Bitcoin SV (BSV) faced challenges as it fell back to April’s lows. Despite previous attempts to rise, the price action remained muted due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and market conditions. But, at the current level, odds are higher that if BSV bulls regain strength, there is potential for a rally; in the short term, it might retest the $35 mark. Conversely, if the downward trend continues, BSV’s price may drop to new lows like $20 round level. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) BSV Coin Price Prediction July 2025 20 27.5 35 Bitcoin SV Price Prediction 2025 In the second half of 2024, Bitcoin SV (BSV) formed an ascending broadening wedge pattern. This led to a strong buying movement in Q4 2024, pushing prices from the wedge’s lower to upper border. Many experts believed this bullish momentum could continue, but the upper border coincided with a strong resistance zone. Consequently, BSV’s price trajectory fell in the first half of 2025, erasing over 60% of its gains. Despite seen attempts to rise in Q2 2025, BSV struggled to gain bullish strength. It ended up forming another declining wedge. Investors had hoped BSV would reach $50 but it fell short, dampening morale. The last significant momentum was in Q4 2024, which is now missed by BSV holders. In April, BSV peaked at $47 but faced rejection at resistance and began forming lower lows. A recent bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMA indicates increasing short-term bearish pressure. Several optimistic factors emerged in Q2 2025, yet price action remained muted. The worsening conflict between Iran and Israel, along with U.S. intervention in June, created further pessimism. Even a ceasefire announced in late June failed to boost BSV’s price. As July began, BSV fell back to April’s lows. However, if BSV bulls regain strength, a rally could occur. A decisive move above the 200-day EMA could provide the momentum needed to retest the $50 mark by the end of June. If this breakout is supported by increased adoption, BSV could target $65 by the end of 2025. Conversely, if BSV continues to decline within the downward wedge, its price may drop toward $24. Nevertheless, a breakout from this pattern and a move above the 200-day EMA or the $40 level could shift the trend to bullish.
