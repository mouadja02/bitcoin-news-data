They Rise Over 100 Percent!","While Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins experienced a pullback in the last 24 hours, two altcoins attracted attention with their big increases. At this point, altcoins named StormX (STMX) and NEM (XEM) that will be delisted on Upbit increased despite waiting for their delisted status. According to Upbit’s statement, on July 3, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit announced that it will delist STMX and XEM. While the delist announcement usually brings about major declines in the prices of the respective altcoins, the opposite happened for STMX and XEM. STMX and XEM are seeing unexpected price increases, with STMX trading at 2.48 won, up nearly 190% in the last 24 hours, while XEM is trading at 10.3 won, up 160% in the last 24 hours. While STMX and XEM have experienced a huge boom in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin and altcoins have seen declines. BTC is down 1%, Ethereum is down 2.2%, XRP is down 2.3%, and Solana (SOL) is down 3%. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Unexpected Breakout from Two Altcoins Waiting to Be Delisted!

2025-07-02T06:46:56,"New SEC Guidance Clears the Air for Crypto ETP Issuers: Details Inside","The post New SEC Guidance Clears the Air for Crypto ETP Issuers: Details Inside appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On July 1, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) issued guidance for crypto ETP (Exchange Traded Products) users to resolve the regulatory ambiguity. The official notice released by the SEC outlines the role of crypto issuers and the information they must include in their filings. It provides detailed information on how users calculate NAV and select benchmarks to custody practices, service provider agreements, governance structure, and potential conflicts of interest. SEC’s Views on Clarity in Crypto Assets The SEC guidance aims to provide greater clarity for the crypto assets regulatory framework, outlining certain disclosure requirements under federal law. SEC stated that ETP issuers must register their offerings and classes of securities under the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. SEC added : “Issuers of crypto asset ETPs are also subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. However, the crypto asset ETPs addressed in this statement are not registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940.” Was the SEC Notice Necessary? Token ETPs (exchange-traded products) are becoming more popular as big investment firms start using them. With more money flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs , the SEC is working on new rules to better manage digital assets. These rules will require token ETPs to report any suspicious activity to help reduce risks. [post_titles_links postid=”477508″] Key Highlights of SEC Crypto ETP Guidance Provides a description of the objective of trust and tracking guidelines, the issuer’s policies– use and limitations, the issuer’s rights, the issuer’s guidelines on forks, airdrops, and other similar events. Described the associated risks of liquidity, cybersecurity, technology, regulation, and tax. Provides detailed calculation of NAV, describes securities, and defines the roles of Directors, Executive Officers, and Significant Employees involved in crypto ETP. Final Thought As the SEC is collaborating with crypto exchanges to create universal listing standards for token ETFs, potentially allowing users to bypass the lengthy 19b-4 process. After 75 days of review, crypto exchanges can release the qualified ETPs. SEC’s purpose with the guidance is to ensure investor protection, maintain fair and orderly markets, and facilitate capital formation.

2025-07-02T06:45:43,"Does Ethereum Have an Advantage over Bitcoin for Corporate Treasuries?","Ethereum is “getting its own MicroStrategy era,” said former developer Eric Conner on X on Tuesday, drawing comparison to the world’s leader in corporate Bitcoin accumulation: Michael Saylor’s Strategy. The developer highlighted two “live experiments” of companies that have already started Ethereum treasuries, Tom Lee’s BitMine and Joe Lubin’s SharpLink . These two could be the pioneers for the next wave of Ethereum treasury companies seeking additional yields on top of their digital asset investments. 1/ ETH is getting its own MicroStrategy era. Two live experiments: Tom Lee’s BitMine and Joe Lubin’s SharpLink. Here’s how each plans to stack ETH and juice shareholder value — Eric Conner (@econoar) July 1, 2025 ChatGPT of Crypto BitMine announced this week that the company is adding Fundstrat’s Tom Lee as Chairman. It also revealed plans for a $250 million private placement to stack Ethereum as part of the company’s treasury strategy, and its stock surged 400% as a result. The firm will stake its ETH to earn extra income and will measure success using an “ETH per share” model of how much Ethereum each stock share represents. This is very similar to how Bitcoin treasury companies use BTC Yield to show stockholders. Lee believes Ethereum will benefit as traditional finance moves onchain, stating that more tokenized dollars as stablecoins will increase demand for Ethereum. “Stablecoins have proven to be the ‘ChatGPT’ of crypto, leading to rapid adoption by consumers, merchants, and financial services providers,” he said. “We’re kind of like the plumbing of what banks will look like in the future because they will be staking Ethereum on their balance sheet of crypto in order to fund and operate their stablecoin.” We asked @fundstrat (Chief Investment Officer of @FundstratCap ) to explain the strategic decision for $BMNR to focus on Ethereum due to its role in stablecoins. “Stablecoins are the ChatGPT of Fintech.” “They provide a logarithmic benefit over traditional systems.”… pic.twitter.com/nNQ7pKrCaR — TBPN (@tbpn) June 30, 2025 BitMine’s mining DNA lets it spin up validators and “tap DeFi rails, turning a once-capital-intensive operation into a cash-flow engine secured by Ethereum,” said Conner. Meanwhile, ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin is taking a bigger gamble with his gaming firm SharpLink, which raised $425 million to stack and stake Ethereum. Conner concluded that this is just the beginning of the Ethereum treasury company phase, and more firms will follow. “Firms are waking up to ETH’s combo of reserve asset and native yield. Expect the ETH-per-share scoreboard to get crowded fast.” Ethereum Price Dips Regardless of the clear impact on Ether supply and demand this will have, spot ETH prices remain lackluster. ETH has lost 2.3% on the day, falling back below $2,400 during the Wednesday morning Asian trading session. However, it found support there, and downsides were limited. The asset has done very little since it cleared $2,200 in early May, with some investors describing it as a “stablecoin.” Even with the bullish fundamentals and institutional interest in the asset, many are clearly still selling at these prices.

2025-07-02T06:32:38,"Arizona Governor Vetoes Crypto Seizure Reserve Bill, Citing Law Enforcement Concerns","Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has vetoed House Bill 2324, a measure aimed at creating a reserve fund to manage crypto assets seized through criminal forfeiture. Key Takeaways: Arizona Governor vetoed a bill that would have created a reserve fund for seized crypto assets. The proposal aimed to give the State Treasurer authority to invest or trade seized crypto. Texas moved ahead with its own Bitcoin reserve fund. In a letter released Tuesday , Hobbs argued the bill would discourage local law enforcement from cooperating on digital asset seizures by shifting control of seized crypto assets away from local jurisdictions. The Arizona House narrowly passed HB 2324 last week in a 34-22 vote. Arizona Bill Sought State Control Over Seized Crypto Assets Reserve The proposal sought to give the State Treasurer authority over the Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund, allowing the state to invest or trade crypto assets obtained from criminal proceedings, including in exchange-traded funds containing digital assets. Earlier in May, Arizona approved HB 2749, becoming the second U.S. state to pass a crypto reserve law. That legislation focuses on handling unclaimed crypto presumed abandoned, whereas HB 2324 specifically targeted assets seized from criminal activity. Meanwhile, Arizona lawmakers continue to weigh other crypto-related proposals, such as SB 1062, which would recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender in the state. Arizona’s move comes as some US states abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In May, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation , joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. On a positive note, last month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law , establishing a state-funded Bitcoin reserve, the first of its kind in the country. Unlike similar initiatives in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas is creating a standalone reserve fund entirely separate from the state treasury. The fund will be overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar and aims to explore Bitcoin as a strategic asset class. “We can buy land, we can buy gold; I think the state of Texas should have the option of evaluating the best performing asset over the last 10 years,” said bill author Senator Charles Schwertner. Bitcoin Adoption as Treasury Asset Finds Momentum As reported, over the past week, at least nine UK firms, from web design startups to mining businesses, have announced plans to buy Bitcoin or revealed recent purchases to add the cryptocurrency to their corporate treasuries. Among the UK firms, AI services provider Tao Alpha disclosed plans to raise £100 million after revealing a bitcoin treasury plan that triggered investor interest. Smarter Web Company, a small website design firm, saw its market value rocket from £4 million to over £1 billion in just two months after announcing its Bitcoin purchases in April, although shares have since cooled. In the US, Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC acquired 3,724 Bitcoin for $386 million as part of plans to go public through an SPAC merger, while Japan’s Metaplanet raised $517.8 million on the first day of its ambitious “555 Million Plan,” which targets 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027.

SOL price is now recovering and might aim for a fresh increase above the $150 zone. SOL price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $160 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $147 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $152 resistance zone. Solana Price Trims Gains Solana price struggled to continue higher above $160 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $155 and $152 support levels. It even dipped below $150 and tested the $145 zone. A low was formed at $144 and the price is now correcting some losses. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $160 swing high to the $144 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $147 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $150 level. The next major resistance is near the $152 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $160 swing high to the $144 low. The main resistance could be $155. A successful close above the $155 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $160. Any more gains might send the price toward the $165 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $150 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $145 zone. The first major support is near the $142 level. A break below the $142 level might send the price toward the $136 zone. If there is a close below the $136 support, the price could decline toward the $125 support in the near term.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index registered a score of 63 on Wednesday, down just one point from the previous day, indicating continued market confidence. Bitcoin had nearly reached $108,000 on Tuesday before sliding into a short-term correction. Analysts are closely watching to see if the cryptocurrency will retest its all-time high of $111,970 set on May 22. Historical Trends Cast Shadow Over Q3 Analysts have flagged the third quarter as historically slow for Bitcoin. “From the historical data, this quarter is generally the slowest out of all, for both $BTC and $ETH,” said trader Daan Crypto Trades. Since 2013, Bitcoin has averaged just a 5.47% gain during Q3. If the trend continues, Bitcoin could rise to about $111,000 by September 30. Daan attributes the slower performance to “slower summer months where there’s generally less action, volumes [and] liquidity.” Q2 Outperforms Averages Bitcoin delivered a solid second quarter with a 31% gain, ending at $108,383—about 4% above the historical Q2 average of 27% since 2014. June also saw the asset print its highest monthly candle. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market. Its dominance stands at 65.5%, up nearly 13% year-to-date, according to TradingView. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index stands at 20 out of 100, suggesting it is still Bitcoin’s market.

2025-07-02T06:14:18,"OFAC sanctions crypto wallets tied to Russian bulletproof hosting provider Aeza Group","United States authorities have sanctioned a crypto wallet linked to Russia-based Aeza Group, accused of enabling ransomware operations and darknet markets. According to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the designation targets Aeza Group’s entire cyber infrastructure, including affiliated entities and four individuals in leadership roles. The group allegedly offered bulletproof hosting services that allowed ransomware operators, malware distributors, and darknet vendors to operate with impunity by evading detection and law enforcement. The sanctions extend to Aeza International Ltd., a UK-based front company used to lease IP addresses to cybercriminals, as well as two Russia-based subsidiaries, Aeza Logistic LLC and Cloud Solutions LLC. OFAC also designated four senior executives, including CEO Arsenii Penzev and general director Yurii Bozoyan, both of whom were arrested by Russian law enforcement for their involvement in the darknet drug marketplace Blacksprut. Aeza’s infrastructure reportedly supported groups like Meduza and Lumma infostealer operators, BianLian ransomware, RedLine infostealer panels, and the now-defunct Blacksprut marketplace. These services allowed threat actors to steal sensitive data and siphon funds from global victims, including crypto users. You might also like: Russian-British dual national charged for sending crypto to fund pro-Russian militias in Ukraine The designated crypto address, hosted on the Tron blockchain, was identified as an administrative wallet used to receive payments for Aeza’s services. According to Chainalysis, the wallet processed over $350,000 in crypto and funneled payments through a third-party processor to obscure the financial trail and make tracing difficult. Investigators reportedly found that the wallet received direct payments from customers, including infostealer vendors, and routed illicit funds to various cryptocurrency exchanges. A separate report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs corroborated these findings, noting that the designated address showed “regular cash-out points to global cryptocurrency exchanges” and payment service providers. Analysts observed that the payment patterns aligned with known pricing for Aeza’s hosting services, suggesting that infostealer vendors and other threat actors were likely among the group’s customers. TRM also identified links between the wallet and other cybercrime platforms through intermediary addresses, including connections to the sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Garantex. TRM said that websites linked to Aeza and its affiliates had gone offline shortly after the designation was announced. “Today’s designations underscore a continuing trend of growing focus by authorities on disrupting not just individual threat actors, but also the infrastructure that enables their operations,” TRM said. “Aeza Group’s role in facilitating global cybercrime illustrates how infrastructure providers can serve as critical enablers—and potential pressure points—for law enforcement and regulators alike.” Earlier this year, OFAC led a coordinated effort with the United Kingdom and Australia to sanction another Russia-based bulletproof hosting provider, Zservers, for offering infrastructure to the LockBit ransomware gang. OFAC targets crypto wallets Beyond infrastructure, OFAC has also been focused on dismantling crypto-based cybercrime financing. In April, the agency sanctioned eight crypto addresses used by Yemen’s Houthi movement to fund arms procurement and terrorist activities. On-chain data showed over $45 million moved through Garantex in connection with these operations. Similarly, in March, OFAC blacklisted 49 crypto wallets tied to Nemesis, a darknet marketplace operated by Iranian national Behrouz Parsarad. The site was involved in trafficking fentanyl and other synthetic drugs, processing nearly $30 million in sales using Bitcoin and Monero before its seizure in 2024.

In a veto letter to House Speaker Steve Montenegro, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has blocked House Bill 2324, which aimed to establish a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund funded by cryptocurrencies seized through criminal forfeiture. Initially rejected by the House on May 7, the bill was revived after a narrow 16-14 Senate vote on June 19 when Republican Senator Janae Shamp, who had previously opposed it, filed a motion to reconsider. The measure returned to the House and passed on June 24 with a 34-22 vote, proposing that seized digital assets be overseen by the State Treasurer and allocated partly to the Attorney General’s office, the state’s general fund, and the reserve fund itself. In the veto letter, Hobbs argued that diverting these assets into a state-managed reserve fund could undermine local agencies’ willingness to participate in investigations and seizures, ultimately weakening enforcement efforts against crimes involving digital assets. “Today, I vetoed House Bill 2324. This bill disincentives local law enforcement from working with the state on digital asset forfeiture by removing seized assets from local jurisdictions,” she wrote.

This move targets retail investors seeking affordable entry points into the crypto market. By offering smaller contract sizes, like 2,500 XRP valued at roughly $5,200, Robinhood lowers the capital needed for futures trading. The platform’s recent $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp fuels this expansion, boosting its global reach. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its presale, raising $11,400,000 with over 575 million tokens sold to 12,600 holders. With Phase 5 underway, MUTM’s innovative DeFi model sparks curiosity about which crypto will lead. XRP futures gain traction Robinhood is introducing micro XRP futures, allowing traders to engage with 2,500 XRP per contract. This reduces the financial barrier for retail investors in the crypto market. The contracts, cash-settled to limit risk, align with rising interest in crypto investments.

Phase 6 will see a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, while the token launches at $0.06, ensuring a 100% ROI. Analysts project MUTM could hit $3 post-launch in 2025, driven by its robust DeFi ecosystem. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, boosting engagement. Innovative DeFi lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending system. Its Peer-to-Contract model applies smart contacts to automatically adjust to the market conditions on the basis of interest rates. This guarantees a stabilization of lenders and borrowers. The Peer-to-Peer system provides a direct form of transactions, which is fitting in volatile assets. A collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on a sufficient Ethereum increases the level of reliability decreasing the risks of depegging. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a CertiK audit and has a score of 95.00 in the security rating and no vulnerabilities have been identified. Additionally, a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK rewards vulnerability reports across four severity tiers. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a secure, scalable DeFi platform in the crypto market. Solana and Bitcoin futures also in focus Robinhood’s micro Solana and Bitcoin Friday futures cater to diverse crypto investments. Solana futures leverage its high-speed blockchain, but price volatility tempers expectations for a $5 surge. Bitcoin futures, backed by CME’s infrastructure, benefit from renewed bullish momentum. However, both face stiff competition from innovative projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Robinhood’s Bitstamp acquisition strengthens its platform, yet Solana and Bitcoin lack the utility-driven focus of MUTM’s lending and stablecoin innovations. Investors eyeing crypto prices today may find MUTM’s presale more enticing, offering immediate ROI and long-term potential in the evolving crypto market. A bright horizon for investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing attention as Phase 5 nears completion, with over 575 million tokens sold. Unlike XRP, Solana, or Bitcoin, MUTM’s focus on lending, staking, and a native stablecoin positions it for growth. Its projected $3 price in 2025 offers a 100x return from the current $0.03. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy now should explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

2025-07-02T06:09:07,"US Giant Tech Company Files for IPO: Big Bitcoin Plans Also Revealed","San Francisco-based cloud-based design platform Figma has formally filed its IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company filed its Form S-1 filing with the SEC today. According to the data in the filing, Figma has approximately $69.5 million in spot Bitcoin ETF assets as of March 31, 2025. While this move was considered an indicator of the company's strategic interest in digital assets, Figma's board of directors also approved a new $30 million BTC investment plan with the decision taken on May 8, 2025. Within this scope, an equivalent amount of USDC was purchased and it was planned to convert these assets into Bitcoin. Related News: Altcoin Listed on Major Exchanges Announces Collaboration with Donald Trump-Linked Project, Triggering a Price Surge As part of the IPO, Figma intends to list shares of its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “FIG” in its own name and in the name of existing shareholders participating in the sale. The Company currently has no public market history. In the statements made, Figma's shares were organized into three different classes: Class A: One vote per share, Class B: 15 voting rights per share (Convertible), Class C: Non-voting shares (with limited conversion rights). The majority of voting rights after the IPO will reportedly remain with the company’s CEO and co-founder Dylan Field, who will retain most of the voting power through proxy grants from co-founder Evan Wallace and the Wu-Wallace Family Foundation. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-02T06:08:01,"The Race to Buy Bitcoin: Corporations Scooped up More BTC Than ETFs For Third Straight Quarter","Corporate treasuries have surpassed ETFs for Bitcoin purchases for a third consecutive quarter. Around 131,000 BTC was accumulated by public companies in the second quarter, growing their Bitcoin balance by 18%. Meanwhile, ETFs accumulated 111,000 BTC with an 8% increase over the same period, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. More companies are “trying to benefit from the Strategy playbook in a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment,” reported CNBC, citing figures from the treasury data provider. Increasing Value For Shareholders “The institutional buyer who is getting exposure to Bitcoin through the ETFs is not buying for the same reason as those public companies who are basically trying to accumulate Bitcoin to increase shareholder value at the end of the day,” Nick Marie, head of research at Ecoinometrics, told the outlet. Some recently updated entities: – Effex Solutions Kft. — 0.254 BTC – @KVcegcsoport — 1.079 BTC – @MARAHoldings $MARA — 49,940 BTC – Vanadi Coffee, SA $VANA.MC — 64 BTC CC @ferenckovacs , @HotelAuroraHU , @HotelAtlantisHu , @fgthiel pic.twitter.com/g6KYLODwKF — BitcoinTreasuries.NET (@BTCtreasuries) July 1, 2025 The researcher added that corporations don’t really care if the price is high or low, “they care about growing their Bitcoin treasury so they look more attractive to the proxy buyers.” He added that it isn’t much to do with macro trends or sentiment, but has become a different kind of mechanism that can push Bitcoin forward . According to Bitcoin Treasuries, there is currently 849,245 BTC, worth around $90 billion at current market prices, held by public companies. However, Saylor’s Strategy holds the lion’s share, or 70% of this total. Private companies hold 290,878 BTC, worth around $31 billion. 141 public and 42 private companies now hold 5.7% of the total circulating Bitcoin supply combined, while ETFs and other institutional funds hold around 7%, according to BT. Analysts suggested this corporate treasury trend may be a temporary ten-year arbitrage opportunity that could normalize as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream and regulatory constraints on direct crypto investments ease. “You can think about this wave as a bunch of companies that are trying to benefit from this arbitrage.” Ethereum Next? Meanwhile, Ethereum could be the next asset that corporations target for their treasuries due to its ability to provide additional yields through staking. Just this week, Bitcoin network firm BitMine announced that it has taken on Fundstrat’s Tom Lee as Chairman, revealing plans for a $250 million private placement to accumulate Ethereum as part of the company’s treasury strategy. Publicly-listed gaming tech firm SharpLink also has a $460 million Ethereum treasury that it has staked for additional yields.

2025-07-02T06:00:19,"Figma’s Strategic $70M Bitcoin ETF Holding Signals Major Corporate Crypto Investment Trend","BitcoinWorld Figma’s Strategic $70M Bitcoin ETF Holding Signals Major Corporate Crypto Investment Trend The intersection of technology and finance continues to surprise and innovate. In a fascinating development that underscores the evolving landscape of corporate treasuries, design software powerhouse Figma has reportedly made a significant foray into the digital asset space. According to disclosures stemming from Figma’s SEC filings for its initial public offering (IPO), the company holds a substantial $70 million worth of spot Bitcoin ETF shares. This revelation, initially brought to light by Bitcoin Magazine on X, is far more than just a financial footnote; it’s a powerful indicator of burgeoning institutional Bitcoin adoption and a potential blueprint for future corporate crypto investment . What Does Figma’s Bitcoin ETF Holding Signify for Corporate Finance? For many, Figma is synonymous with innovative design and collaborative creativity. Yet, this news positions the company as a forward-thinking entity in the financial realm as well. The decision to allocate a considerable portion of its assets to Bitcoin ETF shares is not a casual one. It suggests a calculated move to diversify and potentially enhance its treasury holdings. Unlike direct Bitcoin purchases, which can introduce complexities related to custody and security, investing in a regulated ETF offers a more familiar and accessible pathway for traditional corporations to gain exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This strategic choice by Figma highlights several key aspects: Accessibility and Ease: Spot Bitcoin ETFs simplify the process for corporations to invest in Bitcoin, bypassing the operational hurdles of direct cryptocurrency management. Validation and Legitimacy: A company of Figma’s standing making such an investment lends significant credibility to the digital asset market, signaling that Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a legitimate asset class. Diversification Strategy: It implies a conscious effort to move beyond traditional treasury assets, seeking new avenues for growth and inflation hedging in an unpredictable economic environment. Unpacking the Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Through ETFs The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year marked a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. These funds, which directly hold Bitcoin, provide a regulated and straightforward investment vehicle for a wide range of investors, including institutions. For entities like Figma, this means they can participate in Bitcoin’s potential upside without the need to navigate the intricacies of crypto exchanges, private keys, or cold storage solutions. This convenience is a critical driver behind the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption . The trend extends beyond just tech companies. We’ve observed a growing interest from various sectors in incorporating digital assets into their portfolios. Figma’s significant holding through an ETF underscores a maturing market where regulated products are bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. Is Corporate Crypto Investment Becoming the New Norm? Figma’s bold move prompts a crucial discussion: are we on the cusp of a new era where corporate crypto investment becomes a standard component of treasury management? Historically, corporate treasuries prioritized stability and liquidity, focusing on cash, bonds, and money market funds. However, with persistent inflation concerns, low interest rates on traditional assets, and the search for enhanced returns, some pioneering companies are re-evaluating their strategies. The perceived benefits of integrating digital assets like Bitcoin into a corporate treasury include: Inflation Hedge Potential: Bitcoin’s finite supply is often cited as a strong argument for its role as a hedge against currency debasement and inflation. Growth and Innovation Alignment: For tech companies, investing in cutting-edge assets like Bitcoin can align with their brand identity as innovators and appeal to a tech-savvy investor base. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets can offer diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. However, it’s essential to acknowledge the inherent challenges. Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a significant factor, and the evolving regulatory landscape requires careful navigation. Companies embarking on corporate crypto investment must conduct thorough due diligence and establish robust risk management frameworks. Insights from Figma’s SEC Filings: Transparency and Strategy The fact that this disclosure came via Figma’s SEC filings is particularly noteworthy. As a company pursuing an IPO, Figma is obligated to provide comprehensive transparency regarding its financial positions to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and potential investors. The inclusion of $70 million in Bitcoin ETF shares in these public documents signifies a deliberate and well-considered financial strategy, rather than a speculative, off-the-books venture. It implies that Figma’s board and financial leadership have assessed the risks and rewards, deeming this investment a legitimate and integrated part of their overall financial planning. This level of transparency, mandated by SEC filings , sets a precedent. As more corporations explore or increase their exposure to digital assets, similar disclosures will likely become more common, offering invaluable insights into the evolving corporate approach to the crypto ecosystem. The Future Trajectory of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Figma’s substantial Bitcoin ETF holding is more than just a piece of news; it’s a significant marker for the increasing maturity and mainstream acceptance of the crypto market. It vividly illustrates how regulated investment products are paving the way for broader institutional Bitcoin adoption . As more companies observe the strategic moves of their peers, and as the regulatory environment continues to provide clarity, we could witness an accelerated pace of this trend. What should investors, market analysts, and industry watchers anticipate next? Increased Corporate Disclosures: Look for more companies, both in tech and other sectors, to reveal similar crypto asset holdings in their financial reports. Further Regulatory Clarity: Ongoing guidance and frameworks from regulatory bodies like the SEC could further de-risk and encourage mainstream corporate participation. Diversification of Crypto Products: The development of new, regulated crypto financial products beyond spot ETFs could open even more diverse avenues for corporate investment. Conclusion: A Pivotal Shift in Corporate Treasury Management Figma’s reported $70 million investment in Bitcoin ETF shares is a compelling testament to the growing confidence in digital assets within the corporate world. It powerfully underscores the strategic importance of regulated crypto products in facilitating broader institutional Bitcoin adoption and is actively reshaping traditional treasury management practices. This development is not merely about a design company venturing into crypto; it’s about a significant industry player making a calculated, transparent move that reflects a profound paradigm shift in corporate crypto investment . As SEC filings continue to unveil such insights, the narrative around digital assets in mainstream finance will undoubtedly strengthen, charting a new course for corporate financial strategies globally.

2025-07-02T06:00:04,"Bitcoin Weekly RSI Climbs Toward Upper Boundary – Will BTC Bulls Push Through?","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to grind through the $100,000 to $110,000 range, its weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is steadily climbing toward the upper trendline – fuelling hopes for a bullish breakout and the potential for a new all-time high (ATH) in the near term. Bitcoin RSI Pushing Toward Upper Trendline In an X post published today, seasoned crypto analyst Titan of Crypto remarked that Bitcoin “still has fuel in the tank.” The analyst shared the following BTC weekly chart, highlighting that the digital currency’s market structure remains strong, marked by a series of higher highs and higher lows. According to Titan of Crypto, Bitcoin’s weekly RSI is approaching its upper trendline after rebounding from the lower end of the range in April 2025. Historical data shows that BTC price has often peaked whenever the weekly RSI touched this upper boundary. For context, the RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of the underlying asset’s price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 typically indicating overbought conditions and those below 30 suggesting oversold territory. If BTC mirrors its historical patterns – rallying alongside a rising weekly RSI – it could be on track for a new ATH of around $140,000. As of now, BTC is trading approximately 4.7% below its current ATH of $111,814, set on May 22. BTC Looks Bullish On Monthly Timeframe Other prominent analysts are also pointing to potential upside for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. For example, Rekt Capital shared the following BTC monthly chart, noting that Bitcoin has “fully confirmed” a breakout from its monthly range. The analyst added: Thus, now is the time for buy-side volume to step in to facilitate trend continuation. Until that volume comes in however, it wouldn’t be out of the ordinary for additional retesting of the blue Range High to occur to grab extra buy-side liquidity in an effort to fuel the next uptrend. Similarly, analyst Jelle highlighted a bullish setup on Bitcoin’s chart, noting a bullish engulfing candle and a potential breakout from a symmetrical triangle structure. They also pointed out that BTC might benefit from a negative funding rate. For the uninitiated, a negative funding rate means short traders are paying long traders, indicating bearish sentiment in the market. This can be bullish for Bitcoin, as it raises the chances of a short squeeze and a potential price rebound. That said, investors should remain cautious and watch for signs of bull market fatigue , which could lead to a short-term pullback. At press time, BTC is trading at $106,665, down 1% over the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-weekly-rsi-climbs-toward-upper-boundary-will-btc-bulls-push-through/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin monthly candle|Bitcoin technical analysis|bitcoin weekly rsi|btc|BTCUSDT|bullish engulfing candle|relative strength index|technical indicator",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T06:00:00,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Chapter 1 Draws Solana & Bitcoin Traders Amid Uncertainty Around Stellar’s DeFi Adoption","Altcoin investors are closely watching the markets as Q3 2025 kicks off with strong catalysts across major blockchains. Among the top altcoins to buy now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming investor favourite alongside heavyweights like Bitcoin, Solana, and Stellar. As Stellar’s DeFi market continues to face uncertainty, MAGACOIN FINANCE Chapter 1 gains attention from Solana and Bitcoin traders. As capital rotates from older large-cap plays into newer, narrative-driven projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing investors with its capped supply, grassroots political story, and clear roadmap — qualities that are becoming harder to find in today’s meme-heavy market. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Chapter 1 is Drawing Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025. It sits at the top of many analysts’ watchlists because it uniquely blends meme coin energy with political branding and actual governance. Every stage of its presale sold out faster than forecasted, reflecting growing trust in its third-party audited contracts and fixed supply. Unlike typical meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE plans to offer real tools for holders and a decentralized political community, giving it staying power beyond speculative hype. Early investors compare it to Dogecoin or Shiba Inu but with a critical difference: MAGACOIN FINANCE has a clear path for utility and governance, not just viral appeal. That makes it an attractive option for traders seeking explosive narratives with a foundation for long-term growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE vs Stellar: Big Partnerships but Unclear DeFi Path Stellar (XLM) has had a strong quarter with Mastercard integrating Stellar into its Crypto Credential framework and PayPal preparing to launch PYUSD stablecoin on Stellar. XLM’s price may surge to $1 if it continues to gain strong buying demand in Q3 and Q4. However, XLM’s reversal might Source: Coingecko However, despite new smart contract upgrades under Protocol 23, Stellar’s role in DeFi remains uncertain, leading some liquidity to chase higher-potential narratives like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Traders seeking clearer governance and capped tokenomics find MAGACOIN’s model appealing by comparison. MAGACOIN FINANCE vs Solana & Bitcoin: Major Momentum vs Early-Stage Potential Solana and Bitcoin dominate the market this quarter. Solana’s new U.S. ETF, booming DeFi volumes over $275 billion last week, and a 156% YTD stablecoin surge cement its leadership, though SOL now struggles around resistance channels. Bitcoin, meanwhile, hovers with record ETF inflows and U.S. reserve plans pushing dominance past 65%. But while these giants attract institutional money, traders chasing bigger multiples are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its early-stage launch, strict capped supply, and political meme narrative make it a prime candidate for outsized returns — offering the kind of fresh upside Bitcoin and Solana may no longer match this cycle. Final Thoughts Bitcoin continues to dominate with ETF-driven demand and a robust macro story. Solana is still the leader in DeFi and stablecoins, while Stellar’s big partnerships show promise but also raise questions on long-term DeFi traction. For investors chasing the next big meme-political narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. It’s a top choice among investors as it combines viral energy with fixed supply, external audits, and real community governance, giving early backers a rare shot at serious upside. As traders search for the top altcoins to buy now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly climbing to the top of watchlists and its chapter 1 is drawing major attention.

Bitcoin had hit $109,000 and a $2.1 trillion market cap, driven by ETF inflows and favorable macro trends. However, H1 2025 saw a sharp slowdown. The total market cap fell to $2.4 trillion mid-cycle before recovering to $3.31 trillion by July 1. Bitcoin experienced a major drawdown but rebounded to a new ATH of $112K, supported by steady institutional buying from Strategy and Metaplanet. Macroeconomic pressures added to volatility. The Fed held rates steady at 4.25%-4.5%, with inflation at 2.4%. Geopolitical tensions, including U.S.-China tariffs and Middle East unrest , kept investors on edge. Despite this, crypto showed resilience, backed by regulatory clarity and rising demand from emerging markets. Investor sentiment was highly volatile. The Fear & Greed Index plunged from 94 in December to 10 in March but recovered to 64 by July. Still, sentiment remains range-bound between 40 and 65, signaling lingering caution in the market.

Metaplanet and Strategy aggressively expanded their BTC holdings, marking a corporate treasury shift toward Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. Ripple dropped its cross-appeal in the SEC case, paving the way for a near-end to the multi-year legal battle. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), backed by Trump family ties, expanded USD1 stablecoin on BNB Chain , boosting RWA and DeFi interest. Final Outlook For H2 2025 Despite all the ups and downs, H1 2025 proved just how resilient the crypto market has become. Bitcoin surged to a new high of $112K, and the overall market rebounded to $3.31 trillion. Now, if bullishness increases, then Bitcoin may hit $180,000 – $200,000, Ethereum $5,000 – $6,000, by year-end 2025. This growth could be fueled by future Fed rate cuts, ETF inflows, and the Stablecoin Payment Act. Moreover, DeFi is also regaining momentum with $112B in TVL, and institutional interest keeps rising. With altcoin ETFs on the horizon and big players entering the space, H2 2025 could be the setup for a major breakout, which could possibly take the total crypto market cap toward the $4 – $5 trillion mark.

2025-07-02T05:51:29,"Macro Analyst Says Buying XRP at $2 is Like Buying Bitcoin at $50. Here’s why","While the broader cryptocurrency market continues to fluctuate, some analysts argue that investors are overlooking the long-term significance of specific digital assets. Despite price stagnation, a growing number of XRP advocates believe the asset is significantly undervalued at current levels. For those following its development closely, this period may represent a strategic opportunity rather than a moment of retreat. Institutional Positioning and Market Design Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist and a well-known advocate for XRP, recently highlighted the token’s potential in a post on X that challenges mainstream sentiment. He likened buying XRP at $2 to acquiring Bitcoin when it was just $50, but with a major distinction. He believes that XRP already benefits from the utility, regulatory frameworks, and institutional infrastructure that Bitcoin lacked during its early stages, suggesting it could experience more significant growth. Aljarrah pointed to the nature of current market volatility, suggesting that the asset is currently undervalued for a reason. According to him, this volatility is “engineered to exhaust retail participants” and remove short-term holders from the market. Aljarrah believes institutional players should reposition quietly ahead of major developments in tokenized finance. In his view, the instability that discourages individual investors is being used by larger entities to secure control over key digital assets before widespread infrastructure activation. $2 $XRP is like buying Bitcoin at $50 but with utility, regulation, and infrastructure already in place. Volatility is engineered to exhaust retail participants, shake out weak hands, and allow institutions to reposition before the tokenized infrastructure is fully activated. pic.twitter.com/WnhUX75LJw — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) June 30, 2025 Some believe institutions like BlackRock are looking to accumulate XRP at current low prices , and investors who sell their tokens to these institutions will miss out on potentially life-changing profits when the price starts to grow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Strategic Advantage Unlike many speculative cryptocurrencies, XRP has made notable progress in building partnerships and securing use cases , especially in cross-border payments. Its integration into enterprise and banking systems has given it a level of credibility that few digital assets have achieved. For this reason, analysts such as Aljarrah view XRP’s current price of $2.22 not as a reflection of its actual value but as a byproduct of larger strategic forces at play. With the tokenization of traditional financial assets becoming an increasingly prominent trend, Aljarrah sees XRP as a foundational layer for what is to come. XRP is already dominating the tokenization market , and Aljarrah suggests that the groundwork has already been laid. The volatility, in this context, serves as a strategic delay, giving institutions time to accumulate before the system shifts to widespread adoption.

The announcement was made on July 1, after underwriters in Bit Digital’s recent public offering fully exercised their option to buy an additional 11.25 million shares. In total, the company issued 86.25 million shares, with net proceeds amounting to $162.9 million after deducting fees and estimated offering expenses. Bit Digital confirmed it will use the funds to acquire Ethereum ( ETH ). Bit Digital, which trades on Nasdaq under the ticker BTBT, has been building its Ethereum strategy since 2022. The company now runs one of the largest Ethereum staking platforms operated by a public company. Its platform includes validator infrastructure, custody services, and yield tools for ETH staking. The raise is one of the largest single-purpose ETH capital raises by a public company to date. It demonstrates that companies are starting to view Ethereum as more than just a technology platform and as a balance sheet asset.

Santiment reported that crypto markets are showing a clear bullish bias following the Senate’s narrow approval of the bill. According to their update, Bitcoin miners could benefit from the bill’s inflationary implications, while Elon Musk has expressed frustration over the legislation. Despite its controversy, the bill is fueling optimism across the crypto sector. Bitcoin Could Shine Amid Soaring Debt The bill would significantly raise the U.S. national debt, triggering inflation concerns. Historically, investors have looked to Bitcoin as a hedge against both inflation and a weakening dollar. If inflation picks up or trust in the dollar slips, Bitcoin could see strong demand as a digital safe haven. Ethereum and Altcoins in the Mix Market analyst Marius suggests that Ethereum and infrastructure-based altcoins may also benefit, as investors seek higher-risk, high-reward assets. However, speculative tokens and meme coins could underperform, especially in a cautious market environment. Additionally, the bill’s broader macroeconomic impact plays a significant role. With over $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $1.2 trillion in entitlement cuts, without any revenue offsets, the bill is expected to increase inflationary pressure in the U.S. economy. This strengthens the appeal of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a hedge against the debasement of fiat currencies. [post_titles_links postid=”477412″] Crypto Reaction Crypto analyst Crypto Dad highlights that the newly passed “Big Beautiful Bill” offers a significant boost to the crypto sector. Notable crypto-friendly provisions include: A de minimis exemption for transactions under $300 simplifies everyday crypto usage. Tax deferrals and simplified rules for staking and mining rewards make participation more attractive. Combined with the inflationary pressure from massive tax cuts and spending hikes, Bitcoin’s narrative as an inflation hedge is gaining traction. As regulatory clarity improves and macroeconomic risks rise, crypto markets, especially Bitcoin, appear well-positioned for an upward move. Institutions May Stay Cautious While retail interest is likely to grow, institutions may remain cautious. Rising debt and the potential for Federal Reserve tightening could lead big investors to wait for more clarity on interest rates and inflation trends.If the bill passes the House with its crypto-friendly provisions intact, it could spark a broader rally in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and select altcoins. However, the final impact will hinge on the Federal Reserve’s next move and whether inflation pressures lead to another rate hike.

2025-07-02T05:30:00,"Crypto Security Under Pressure as Swiss and US Authorities Respond to Risks","Authorities in both the United States and Switzerland are taking decisive steps to address mounting concerns in the digital asset space. In Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont has signed a bill into law prohibiting state agencies from accepting or holding cryptocurrency, marking a clear policy shift away from public sector crypto engagement. Meanwhile, Swiss regulators have directed Swissquote, the parent company of the crypto-enabled Yuh app, to address a surge in phishing and impersonation scams, which have targeted users through hundreds of fraudulent websites. Connecticut Draws a Line on State Crypto Holdings with New Law Signed by Governor Lamont Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont has signed into law a bill that formally restricts the state government’s use and custody of digital assets. House Bill 7082, which was passed by both chambers of the state legislature earlier this year, was signed on Monday and is set to take effect on Oct. 1. Draft of House Bill 7082 (Source: LegiScan ) The new law specifically prohibits Connecticut’s government from “accepting or requiring payment in the form of virtual currency” and from “purchasing, holding, investing in or establishing” any form of cryptocurrency reserve . In doing so, Connecticut becomes one of the first US states to formally enshrine such restrictions, even as the federal government and other states push forward with bold pro-crypto initiatives. A Rebuff to the National Momentum The legislation, introduced by state Representative Jason Doucette in February, effectively places a hard stop on the integration of digital assets into state operations. It arrives in sharp contrast to federal initiatives introduced by President Donald Trump, including an executive order earlier this year establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” These national-level directives seek to expand the federal government’s digital asset holdings through both purchases and seizures, positioning the US as a potential global leader in state-backed crypto reserves. Connecticut’s decision to move against digital asset integration comes at a time when a political rift is emerging around cryptocurrency policy, both at the federal and state levels. President Trump’s close ties to crypto industry figures and his broader push to make the US a hub for blockchain innovation has amplified these divisions. While Connecticut now stands firmly against state-level digital asset reserves, other states are moving in the opposite direction. Texas Governor Greg Abbott approved a bill in June to create a state-managed cryptocurrency reserve. Similarly, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte signed legislation in May to establish a state-held Bitcoin treasury, and similar proposals are being explored in states like Wyoming and Florida. Meanwhile, several other states have attempted but failed to enact similar legislation in 2025. Legislative efforts in South Dakota, Montana, and Pennsylvania to create Bitcoin reserves were unsuccessful, reflecting ongoing concerns over volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and ideological opposition. This divergence of strategy among the states suggests that digital asset policy is becoming a new axis of partisan and regional disagreement, akin to previous battles over cannabis legalization, environmental regulation, and healthcare. Beyond banning crypto use in state transactions and reserves, HB 7082 also updates licensing rules for crypto-related businesses operating in Connecticut. The legislation includes additional compliance requirements for money transmission licensees dealing in digital assets, further tightening the regulatory framework in a state known for its cautious approach to fintech innovation. These changes could have implications for crypto exchanges and fintech startups seeking to operate in Connecticut, potentially leading to an outflow of crypto-related business to more permissive jurisdictions. A Fork in the Road for State-Level Crypto Policy With the passage of HB 7082, Connecticut joins a minority of US states opting to explicitly restrict government engagement with digital assets. Whether this conservative posture becomes a model for other skeptical legislatures or a footnote in a larger wave of crypto adoption remains to be seen. The disconnect between state and federal strategies, and between states themselves, highlights the current disjointed regulatory landscape of the US crypto ecosystem. As the industry continues to mature—and as political influence shapes its future—Connecticut’s stance may be viewed either as prudent risk management or as a missed opportunity to participate in the evolving digital economy. With the bill set to take effect in October, Connecticut officials now face the task of enforcing this policy in an era where digital assets are increasingly embedded in commerce, finance, and even politics. Swiss Regulators Crack Down on Phishing Surge Targeting Crypto Platform Yuh Meanwhile, Swiss regulators have ordered Swissquote, the parent company of the crypto-friendly Yuh app, to take urgent action to reduce the rising tide of phishing and impersonation scams plaguing its trading platforms. The directive follows revelations that more than 600 fraudulent websites mimicking Swissquote's services were uncovered in the first half of 2025 alone. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), which oversees the country's banking and financial services sector, issued the order after identifying a significant uptick in fake login portals and phishing attempts, particularly targeting users of the Yuh app—a platform known for its accessibility to digital asset trading alongside traditional financial services. Phishing and impersonation schemes have long been a thorn in the side of fintech and crypto firms. However, the sophistication and frequency of these attacks have sharply increased in 2025, driven in part by artificial intelligence tools that enable scammers to generate more convincing fraudulent content at scale. Swissquote CEO Marc Buerki confirmed that while none of the company’s internal systems had been breached, the rise in external impersonation and spoof websites poses a serious threat to user trust and platform integrity. Yuh App in the Crosshairs The Yuh platform has become one of the most targeted crypto-enabled applications in Switzerland, according to FINMA. Launched as a joint venture between Swissquote and PostFinance, Yuh allows users to invest in both cryptocurrencies and stocks, making it a popular gateway for newcomers to the crypto space. Its growing user base and digital footprint have also made it an attractive target for cybercriminals, who replicate the app’s branding and user interface to lure unsuspecting users into handing over their login credentials. Bloomberg reports that many of the fake sites detected so far used social media promotions and spam emails to redirect users to phishing pages designed to look like official Swissquote and Yuh login portals. Swissquote is far from alone in facing this digital onslaught. According to cybersecurity firm CertiK, phishing, social engineering, and other scam vectors have accounted for approximately $2.1 billion in crypto losses so far in 2025. The majority of these losses stem not from technical flaws in blockchain code but from users being tricked into giving up sensitive information. Crypto losses in Q3 2025 by scam vector (Source: CertiK ) CertiK's Q3 2025 report reveals that address poisoning, fake support messages, and deepfake videos are also becoming increasingly popular with scammers. A particularly alarming case occurred in April, when a $330 million theft—one of the largest in crypto history—was carried out against an elderly investor through a targeted social engineering campaign. Even experienced professionals are not immune. In June, Mehdi Farooq, a venture partner at crypto investment firm Hypersphere, admitted that he had lost most of his life savings to a highly convincing phishing scam. Farooq’s public disclosure sparked widespread discussion in the crypto community about improving security awareness and incident response. FINMA’s Expectations In its notice to Swissquote, FINMA emphasized that financial institutions operating in the digital asset space must go beyond securing internal systems—they must actively monitor and respond to external impersonation threats that could harm users and damage trust in the financial system. The regulator expects Swissquote to enhance its threat detection capabilities, improve user awareness programs, and cooperate with cybersecurity firms and international watchdogs to take down malicious websites more quickly. Failure to comply could result in penalties or further regulatory scrutiny.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9776/crypto-security-under-pressure-as-swiss-and-us-authorities-respond-to-risks,"REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T05:29:44,"Grayscale Wins SEC Approval to Launch New Crypto ETF","The fund tracks the top five cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin dominating the portfolio. This milestone happened amid broader shifts in the regulatory landscape, especially as the SEC is reportedly exploring a more simplified listing process for crypto ETFs. This could potentially allow issuers to skip the lengthy 19b-4 application in favor of a faster S-1 filing. Analysts also raised the odds of approval for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin spot ETFs to 95%, with decisions expected by October. Bloomberg experts also expat a near-term green light for a basket-based crypto ETF and elevated approval chances for other altcoins like Dogecoin and Cardano.Overall, the SEC’s evolving stance could be the start of a new era of crypto investment access through traditional markets. Grayscale Gets ETF Nod Grayscale secured approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The fund is composed of the five largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization according to the CoinDesk Five Index. Bitcoin (BTC) holds the dominant share at 80.2%, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at 11.3%. Solana (SOL) makes up 2.7%, XRP accounts for over 4.8%, and Cardano’s ADA holds a 0.81% weighting. A crypto ETF is a type of investment fund that tracks the price of one or more cryptocurrencies and trades on traditional stock exchanges, just like stocks. Instead of buying and holding the actual crypto, investors can gain exposure to its price movements through the ETF. Some ETFs hold the cryptocurrencies directly (spot ETFs), while others track futures contracts or indexes. Crypto ETFs make it easier and safer for traditional investors to access the crypto market without needing a crypto wallet or exchange account. Approval from the SEC Historically, Grayscale’s crypto trusts offered investors arbitrage opportunities by exploiting the premium or discount to the fund's net asset value (NAV), largely due to their lock-up periods and the absence of in-kind redemptions. However, as the firm continues to convert these trusts into ETFs, such profit windows have gradually closed. According to Grayscale, the goal of the newly approved ETF is for its share value to track the weighted prices of the underlying digital assets, minus any expenses and liabilities. Grayscale is known for pioneering crypto investment vehicles, and provided a gateway for traditional investors to gain digital asset exposure without directly holding cryptocurrencies. This conversion is a turning point for both the firm and the broader industry as it reflects a trend toward more regulatory maturity and mainstream acceptance. The company’s efforts to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF were initially blocked by the SEC, which started a legal battle that began in June of 2022. After more than a year, a federal judge sided with Grayscale in August of 2023 by declaring the SEC’s denial “arbitrary and capricious.” This victory allowed Grayscale to proceed with its ETF plans. Today, its Bitcoin ETF has the highest expense ratio on the market at 1.5%, but also ranks as the leading revenue-generating Bitcoin investment product. SEC Eyes Faster Crypto ETF Process The United States SEC is also reportedly considering a streamlined listing process for crypto ETFs. This could significantly reduce the time and complexity involved in bringing these products to market. According to crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett , the SEC may allow ETF issuers to bypass the traditional 19b-4 application—which is a form that currently must be submitted before listing a financial product on a public exchange. Instead, issuers would file a form S-1, which initiates the registration process. After a 75-day review period, if the SEC does not raise objections, the issuer could proceed to list the ETF without the usual back-and-forth negotiations with regulators. This potential change could be a huge step in modernizing the SEC's approach to crypto products and improving efficiency in the listing process. While the proposed structure could drastically reduce approval timelines and regulatory friction, details about eligibility criteria for the cryptocurrencies that might qualify are still unclear. The lack of specificity on which digital assets could be fast-tracked under the new system leaves room for speculation and continued lobbying from fund managers and industry participants eager to see a broader range of crypto ETFs approved. As it stands, the SEC has not confirmed these changes, and ETF issuers are still awaiting formal clarification. The conversation around ETF innovation took place at a time when the SEC already approved the first-ever staked crypto ETF in the US. The REX Shares Solana ETF (STAK) recently received the green light, and incorporates staking rewards into its investment model. This approval could pave the way for other altcoin and staking-enabled ETFs, especially as the SEC now faces a wave of pending applications involving Litecoin, Dogecoin, Solana, XRP, and Ethereum. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart , these proposals face final deadlines later in 2025, with some potentially reaching a decision as early as October. If the SEC moves forward with the simplified listing process, it could unlock a whole new era of crypto investment vehicles. Analysts Up Altcoin ETF Approval Odds Meanwhile, analysts raised the likelihood of SEC approval for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin spot ETFs to 95%. Bloomberg ETF experts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart shared the updated forecast in a post on X , and pointed to the increasing momentum and regulatory developments that could lead to a wave of approvals in the second half of 2025. The same 95% probability was also assigned to the potential approval of a spot ETF tracking a basket or index of crypto assets, which could be granted as early as this week. While the final decision on the Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs is expected by October, optimism continues to build across the altcoin ETF landscape. Other cryptocurrencies are also in the mix, with analysts assigning a 90% approval probability to spot ETFs for Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche. These decisions are slated for the fourth quarter.. More niche projects like Sui and Tron have lower chances of approval in the near term, with odds at 60% and 50%, respectively, for the ETFs filed by Canary Capital. These figures suggest that while the mainstream altcoins may soon achieve ETF status, lesser-known tokens face a more uncertain regulatory path. On the other hand the SEC’s hesitancy around staking is still very evident, especially after it delayed its decision on whether the Bitwise spot Ether ETF could include staking features. The regulator also postponed its decision on approving the Osprey Bitcoin Trust for trading. Despite this cautious approach, the wave of upcoming ETF approvals could be the start of a transformative period for altcoin exposure in traditional financial markets.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9774/grayscale-wins-sec-approval-to-launch-new-crypto-etf,"REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|SOL|ALTCOIN","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T05:27:07,"Renowned Economist Robert Kiyosaki Said, “I Bought Bitcoin Today,” and Added: “My Target for BTC is $1 Million, If I’m Wrong…”","Famous economist and author of the book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” Robert Kiyosaki once again reiterated his confidence in Bitcoin (BTC). Announcing that he had purchased another BTC in a post on his social media account, Kiyosaki admitted that this investment may have been wrong, but stated that he stood by his long-term belief. “I bought another Bitcoin today. I could be wrong. But it wouldn’t be the first time. I still believe that Bitcoin will reach $1 million soon. If I’m wrong, I’m wrong; but if I’m right, I’m a winner, not a loser,” he said. While Kiyosaki predicted that the BTC price could reach $1 million in the future, he added that people should not act impulsively with the herd mentality. Related News: Ripple-backed Company's $100 Million XRP Announcement Causes a Stir Kiyosaki also touched on the difference between the investment approaches of the rich and the poor in his post. According to him, while the poor focus on prices, the rich look at the amount of assets they have: “I don't really care about the current price of gold or silver. What matters is how many ounces of gold or silver I have. Same goes for Bitcoin. I look at the price, but what I really focus on is how many Bitcoins I have.” Kiyosaki stated that he bought his first Bitcoin at $6,000 and wanted to buy more with all the “fake money” he had at the time. Reiterating his $1 million BTC target for 2030, the famous economist said, “Those who will be rich in the future will be those who have the most Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

This move means, for the first time in nearly five years of legal battles between the SEC and Ripple, everyday investors in the U.S. can now gain exposure to XRP through a regulated investment product on the New York Stock Exchange. The Grayscale ETF includes multiple major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP, making it the biggest multi-token crypto ETF in the market. Many in the crypto space are calling this a massive moment for XRP, hinting it could soon clear the path for individual spot XRP ETFs to be approved next. Biggest news from today IMO… xrp will now be accessible to everyday investors via Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF. After nearly 5yrs of SEC vs Ripple litigation. And now anyone will be able to easily access xrp in SEC-regulated investment vehicle. Full circle moment. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 2, 2025 Crypto analysts and XRP supporters are celebrating as this approval signals a shift in the SEC’s stance toward XRP. Around 17 more XRP ETFs are reportedly waiting for SEC approval. While the exact number isn’t officially confirmed, multiple applications are in line, and today’s development has significantly increased the hope that more approvals could start rolling in over the coming months. [post_titles_links postid=”477484″] Why does this matter? Until now, U.S. investors faced hurdles buying XRP through exchanges due to regulatory uncertainty and the ongoing Ripple-SEC lawsuit . With this new ETF, investors can simply buy shares backed by XRP, just like any traditional stock, without dealing with crypto exchanges or wallets. This move could bring massive inflows of capital into XRP, as institutional investors and traditional traders who previously avoided direct crypto exposure can now safely invest in it. At the same time, XRP’s price chart is tightening, showing signs of a breakout setup. If Bitcoin rallies and market conditions remain strong, XRP could soon make a major move upward.

2025-07-02T05:03:57,"Ethena stalls below key level as 40M ENA token unlock approaches","Ethena’s native token ENA is trading at $0.2546 at press time, down 4% in the last 24 hours and extending its 17% decline over the past month as another token unlock looms. The recent pullback has placed ENA within a cautious range between $0.2507 and $0.2659 over the past day, with price action stalling below key resistance as a sizable token unlock looms. According to Tokenomist data , roughly 40.63 million Ethena ( ENA ), valued at $10.34 million, are set to be unlocked today, July 2. This represents 0.67% of the current circulating supply. With only 39% of the total 15 billion ENA maximum supply in circulation so far, today’s unlock is part of a broader vesting schedule that could introduce periodic supply pressure. Such unlocks could boost sell-side liquidity and affect sentiment in the short run, but Ethena’s prior unlocks have been absorbed without lasting downside. However, the timing creates a degree of uncertainty, especially given the drop in trading volume and interest in derivatives prior to the event. You might also like: Ethena Labs and Securitize enable 24/7 swaps between USDtb and BlackRock’s BUIDL In the last 24 hours, volume has dropped by almost 29% to $115 million, while Coinglass data indicates that derivatives volume has dropped 37.7% to $316.75 million. Open interest has also eased slightly to $319.06 million, reflecting some trader hesitation ahead of the unlock. On the technical side, ENA is still under pressure . Most major moving averages, from the 10-day to the 200-day, flash sell signals. The token’s persistent trading below its 20-day EMA and SMA suggests weak short-term momentum. The relative strength index is approaching oversold territory at 41.4, but it is still neutral. ENA price analysis. Credit: crypto.news While momentum and MACD indicators show early signs of recovery, they are not strong enough to reverse the overall trend. The Bollinger Bands’ narrowing indicates less volatility. The price is still trading near the lower band, which is a warning sign that may indicate a sharp breakdown or a reversal based on volume confirmation. If ENA manages to hold above the $0.25 support zone and absorbs today’s token unlock without a breakdown, renewed volume could drive a move back toward $0.28. A close above that level would open the path to retest the $0.30–$0.32 range. Failure to hold $0.25, particularly under continued low volume and increased token circulation, could expose ENA to further downside. A decisive break below $0.245 would weaken the structure, putting the $0.22–$0.23 zone in focus and dragging sentiment with it.

2025-07-02T05:00:00,"Bitcoin Holds Key Level Amid $108,000 Rejection, But Analysts Suggest Caution This Quarter","Bitcoin (BTC) attempted to reclaim the $108,000 resistance level again but faced rejection as the third quarter (Q3) started, leading some market watchers to suggest caution for the upcoming months. Related Reading: Solana Summer Loading? SOL Eyes $180 Following Staked ETF-Fueled Breakout Bitcoin Holds Crucial Range Bitcoin’s price ended the second quarter with a retest of the $108,000 barrier before being rejected and closing Q2 and June around the $107,140 area, its highest monthly close in history. Despite the positive performance, the flagship crypto started July with a pullback toward the $105,000, hitting a one-week low of $105,623. Analyst Rekt Capital affirmed that this suggested BTC’s post-breakout retest is in progress, which would strengthen the cryptocurrency’s case for another leg up. The analyst previously explained that Bitcoin needed a weekly close above the $104,400 support after losing it, as reclaiming this area would solidify its price recovery and position the cryptocurrency for a retest and confirmation of this level. Additionally, it would continue building its base around this area to transition into BTC’s second Discovery Uptrend. According to the Tuesday analysis, the new weekly close suggests Bitcoin is positioned for another post-breakout retest. The analyst also noted that, in the past 40 days, BTC broke out of two 2-week downtrends but was rejected from the crucial 6-week downtrend, around the $108,000 mark, during the same timeframe. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted the rejection from this level, affirming that “it is mandatory for bulls to step in quickly and not allow the price to have too big of a dip.” The flagship crypto needs a “strong bounce from the most important support and resistance level, just at $106-104K,” which it has momentarily held. To the analyst, failing to hold this area would open the door for a bigger pullback, risking a drop to the Macro support between $101,000 and $102,000. He highlighted a big gap between the current support area and the Macro support, which formed on the recent price recovery. BTC Risks Massive Drop In Q3 Sjuul pointed out that below the $101,000 support, “there is not much to defend the price from falling much lower,” adding that the “historical quarterly return of BTC for Q3 has not been great, so this adds some extra caution to the picture we have taken from the chart.” Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades asserted that historical data shows that Q3 is generally the slowest period for Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) due to the decreasing activity, volume, and liquidity during the summer months. He added that, as a new quarter and month begin, BTC will likely see a “choppy start,” but Bitcoin is still consolidating within its current range and descending channel, suggesting that investors should give it time to “play out and watch for confirmations” of the direction it will take for the rest of the month. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury Nonetheless, analyst Ali Martinez gave a warning signal, as an indicator that had predicted “every major Bitcoin crash” has just appeared. Per Martinez, the Tom Demark Sequential indicator, a rare warning that has historically preceded violent pullbacks, flashed a sell signal in the quarterly timeframe. Notably, the same signal appeared in 2015 and 2018, with BTC retracing over 75% and 85% after the indicator flashed. If it follows its historical performance, the analyst forecasted that BTC could drop to the $40,000 mark this quarter. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,901, a 1.16% decline in the daily timeframe.

2025-07-02T04:57:57,"SEC approves conversion of Grayscale’s crypto large-cap fund to an ETF","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved Grayscale’s request to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund into a spot exchange-traded fund. According to a July 1 SEC filing , approval allows the fund to list and trade on NYSE Arca, marking its transition from a private trust into a fully regulated ETF. The fund tracks the CoinDesk 5 Index, which includes Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ). At the time of the SEC’s approval, the fund was composed of approximately 80.2% Bitcoin, 11.4% Ethereum, 4.8% XRP, 2.8% Solana, and 0.8% Cardano. The assets are valued daily based on CoinDesk reference rates and rebalanced quarterly. Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund was first launched in 2018 and has traded over the counter under the ticker GDLC since 2019. The newly approved ETF structure allows for daily creation and redemption of shares in baskets of 10,000, settled in cash through authorized participants. The fund calculates its net asset value at 4:00 p.m. ET each business day. You might also like: Grayscale updated its Top 20 list for Q3, adding AVAX and MORPHO The SEC approved the change through an accelerated rulemaking process. It also allowed amendments to NYSE Arca’s rules to let ETFs be structured as limited liability companies and based on index-tracked portfolios. To meet regulatory standards, at least 85% of the fund’s assets must consist of digital assets already backing SEC-approved exchange-traded products. If that threshold is breached, the fund manager must rebalance or pause trading to stay within regulatory limits. Grayscale has been working to convert several of its crypto trusts into ETFs. The firm won a legal battle in 2023 after a federal judge ruled that the SEC’s previous rejection of its Bitcoin ETF application was “arbitrary and capricious.” It’s Bitcoin trust now operates as an ETF with an expense ratio of 1.5%, the highest among its peers. The approval comes as other firms wait on similar ETF proposals. Bitwise, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton have all submitted filings to convert or launch diversified crypto funds. Grayscale’s latest approval may help set a framework for future multi-asset crypto ETFs under existing exchange rules.
