2025-07-01T21:10:00,"Not all Bitcoin holding firms will avoid death spiral, new report says","Nearly 200 companies now hold billions in Bitcoin, but a new report cautions that only a few can avoid the dangers of a potential death spiral. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) corporate adoption is accelerating fast, with nearly 200 entities now holding over 3 million BTC on their balance sheets. But as new players seem to rush in, only those who can skillfully grow their Bitcoin holdings per share are more likely to survive the risks ahead. As of May 2025, about 199 entities reportedly hold 3.01 million BTC, roughly $315 billion at current prices. Among these, 147 companies — both private and public — hold around 1.1 million BTC, valued at $115 billion. And this isn’t static. Since early 2024, Bitcoin held by such entities has more than doubled. Corporate Bitcoin adoption among different entities | Source: Breed.VC The story here isn’t just about accumulation, but about how companies whose main purpose is to hold Bitcoin are being valued differently, say analysts at Breed.VC. Think of these as Bitcoin holding companies — Strategy is the poster child. A new report highlights that for these firms, survival and success depend on commanding what’s called the Multiple on Net Asset Value, or shortly MNAV. Essentially, this is a premium investors pay above the Bitcoin value on the books. Wait and see But this premium, the report explains, “hinges on trust in and execution by the core team.” It’s not just about owning Bitcoin; investors want to see these firms execute a playbook that grows Bitcoin holdings per share faster than anyone could by simply holding Bitcoin on their own. Bitcoin holdings and MNAV | Source: Breed.VC Strategy currently dominates with about 580,000 BTC, over half of all corporate-held Bitcoin, valued around $60 billion. Yet its market capitalization sits at $104 billion, giving it an MNAV of about 1.7 times. Historically, Strategy’s 2x MNAV has been the gold standard. The report outlines three main levers Strategy has used since 2020: Issuing convertible debt with low coupons, which converts to equity only if the share price jumps substantially, protecting shareholders from dilution unless performance warrants it. Running at-the-market stock issuance programs, allowing them to sell new shares when the price exceeds MNAV and then dollar-cost average into more Bitcoin. Reinvesting all free cash flow from legacy businesses into buying spot Bitcoin. Others are watching and learning. New entrants are adopting and tweaking this approach, some even enabling Bitcoin holders to swap coins for shares without triggering capital gains, or acquiring undervalued businesses and turning that value into Bitcoin. Others pursue distressed Bitcoin litigation claims or raise capital via PIPE deals, apparently navigating regulatory grey areas to their advantage. You might also like: Strategy joins Russell Top 200 Value Index with $64b BTC on the books The roster of Bitcoin treasury players is growing fast. Over 40 companies have announced Bitcoin treasury strategies in the first half of 2025 alone, raising tens of billions to back these moves. These firms come from all over: Metaplanet from Japan is capitalizing on low interest rates there, Semler Scientific and GameStop in the U.S. have pivoted their treasuries, and pure-play firms like Twenty One Capital — backed by Tether and Cantor — are also in the mix. Contagion risk Yet, despite all the optimism, the report cautions that “nothing in finance is bulletproof,” especially in this space. Strategy itself faced a brutal stress test during the 2022–23 bear market. Bitcoin’s price plummeted 80%, the MNAV premium collapsed, and capital dried up. Though the company survived, the threat is clear. Crypto treasury company death spiral | Source: Breed.VC An extended bear market combined with looming debt maturities could force firms to sell Bitcoin to meet obligations, potentially triggering a vicious cycle of price drops and forced sales. This risk is said to be particularly acute for newer companies lacking Strategy’s scale and reputation. They often raise capital on tougher terms with higher leverage, which in downturns could accelerate margin calls and distressed selling, amplifying market pressure. The report predicts that “when failures inevitably hit, the strongest players are likely to acquire distressed companies and consolidate the industry.” “Fortunately, contagion risk is muted because most financing is equity-based; however, companies that rely heavily on debt pose a greater systemic threat.” Breed.VC Looking ahead, the Bitcoin treasury company model appears to be just getting started, and not only for Bitcoin. The playbook is already spreading to other crypto assets. For example, Solana has DeFi Development Corp, which holds over 420,000 SOL and is valued around $100 million, and Ethereum has SharpLink Gaming, which raised $425 million in a round led by Consensys. The report expects this trend to grow globally, with more companies chasing higher leverage to amplify success. However, it also foresees that “most will fail.” In that shakeout, only a handful will maintain a lasting MNAV premium through “strong leadership, disciplined execution, savvy marketing, and distinctive strategies.” In short, the game is evolving. Bitcoin treasury firms aren’t just holders anymore as they are becoming their own breed of companies, entities that must demonstrate skill and discipline to outperform the market they invest in.

2025-07-01T21:08:43,"Wall Street Just Gave XRP a Seat at the Table With Latest Grayscale Announcement","The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved the conversion of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund into an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This significant regulatory decision allows the fund to be publicly traded on traditional financial markets while offering exposure to a basket of digital assets. According to the announcement posted by crypto enthusiast Amelie, the ETF will include several prominent cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). XRP’s Inclusion Marks a Significant Development The inclusion of XRP in this ETF has attracted considerable attention within the cryptocurrency community. The decision is particularly significant given XRP’s lengthy history of regulatory scrutiny in the United States. Many market observers interpret this as a major milestone for XRP, considering the asset has faced multiple legal and regulatory challenges over recent years. Amelie’s post highlighted the importance of this development, particularly for XRP holders and the broader crypto ecosystem. Community Reactions Reflect Market Sentiment Several cryptocurrency commentators responded to the announcement. An X user named X Finance Bull remarked that while the list of assets in the ETF is strong, the presence of XRP holds special significance, especially in light of the hurdles it has faced. This sentiment underscores how the regulatory clarity around XRP evolves in the U.S. financial landscape. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another X user, FairyFrens, described the development as a pivotal moment for XRP. Their comment emphasized that fund conversions of this nature often reshape the structure and dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. They also questioned how other financial funds might respond following this approval, suggesting that it could influence broader trends in digital asset investment vehicles. Isabel, another participant in the discussion, emphasized the macroeconomic implications of the SEC’s approval. She noted that the U.S. economy is currently experiencing a downturn. In her view, this decision could serve as a catalyst to attract global capital inflows into the U.S. financial system. Isabel argued that the ETF, including XRP, has the potential to inject vitality into related industries, contribute to economic growth, and create employment opportunities within the digital economy. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market The SEC’s decision to approve the conversion of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund into an ETF represents an important step in the continued integration of digital assets into traditional financial markets. This approval not only reinforces the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum but also elevates XRP’s standing in regulated investment products. The move could potentially pave the way for further adoption of cryptocurrency ETFs that incorporate a diversified range of assets. The regulatory validation also signals a shift in how U.S. authorities are approaching the crypto sector. By allowing XRP to be part of a publicly traded ETF, the SEC indirectly acknowledges its role as a legitimate asset in diversified investment portfolios.

2025-07-01T21:00:08,"Solana Hits New Milestone: Wallets Holding 0.1+ SOL Reach Record High","Solana has returned to the spotlight as speculation around a potential Solana ETF approval gains momentum. While still unconfirmed, growing signals from market insiders suggest that regulatory green lights may not be far off. If approved, a Solana ETF would mark a major milestone for the ecosystem, opening the door to traditional capital flows and broader institutional exposure, similar to what Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced following their own ETF breakthroughs. For long-term investors, this development could set the foundation for a new phase of sustainable growth. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh data from Glassnode, which shows that the number of wallets holding over 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high. This milestone marks an increase in retail participation and growing confidence in Solana’s long-term potential. As the network continues to mature, the rise in small holders also signals expanding grassroots adoption—an encouraging sign during a period of market uncertainty. While short-term price action may still be driven by broader macro trends, sentiment around Solana is clearly improving. If ETF approval becomes a reality, the combination of increased accessibility and rising on-chain adoption could significantly boost Solana’s market position in the coming months. Solana Growing On-Chain Adoption Solana is currently trading below the $150 mark after experiencing a sharp retracement from its May high. The asset has lost more than 20% in value since peaking earlier this cycle, driven largely by broader market consolidation and declining risk appetite across altcoins. Despite the recent pullback, SOL continues to hold a strong support zone near the $135–$140 range, which has proven resilient during previous sell-offs. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, noting that a sustained push above key supply zones—particularly the $155–$165 range—could reignite bullish momentum. However, the market remains in a phase of indecision. Price action across major assets, including Solana, reflects uncertainty as traders wait for a clear breakout or breakdown to confirm the next move. Without a strong catalyst, SOL may continue to consolidate alongside the broader altcoin market. Amid the sideways price action, one encouraging signal is the growing on-chain adoption. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared data from Glassnode showing that the number of wallets holding over 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high, now exceeding 11.44 million. This steady rise in non-zero wallets points to expanding retail participation and long-term holder confidence, even as short-term volatility persists. = 0.1 | Source: Ali Martinez on X"" width=""860"" height=""484"" srcset=""https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/btc.jpeg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/btc.jpeg?w=750 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/btc.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/btc.jpeg?w=860 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/btc.jpeg?w=1140 1140w"" sizes=""(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"" loading=""lazy""/> The divergence between price action and user adoption suggests that Solana’s fundamental growth remains intact. If momentum returns and macro conditions improve, Solana may be well-positioned for a breakout, especially with ETF rumors fueling speculative interest. For now, the $150 level remains a psychological pivot as the market watches for signs of direction. SOL Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $149.30, just below the key resistance confluence of the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, all clustered between $150 and $151. This area has acted as a strong technical barrier, and SOL’s repeated failure to reclaim it reflects the market’s hesitancy amid broader uncertainty. After rallying to $159.99 earlier in the session, bears stepped in and pushed the price back down, closing the candle with a bearish wick, signaling ongoing selling pressure. The chart reveals a prolonged consolidation pattern that has developed since the mid-May rejection near $180. Despite several bounce attempts, SOL has not been able to regain bullish momentum. The volume profile also suggests fading interest during upswings, a common trait during accumulation or exhaustion phases. Notably, price remains above the March low, preserving a key higher low structure, which is crucial for the broader bullish outlook. If SOL breaks above the $151–$155 range with sustained volume, it could trigger a move toward $180. However, failure to clear this resistance might lead to another test of support around $135. Traders should watch for a decisive close above the moving average cluster to confirm trend continuation, especially with ETF speculation fueling long-term optimism.

2025-07-01T21:00:03,"XRP Is Gearing Up For Another Surge – The 4-Hour Chart Says It All","On the 4-hour chart, XRP is showing signs of coiling up for a breakout. The structure remains intact , as long as the broader market doesn’t break down, the chart looks primed for an upward move. Launchpad Is Set – XRP Bulls Are Waiting For Confirmation XRP is approaching a pivotal moment on the chart, according to SquirtleCharts’s post on X, and the key resistance level at $2.23 is acting as the gatekeeper. If it breaks above this level with strength and follow-through, it could unlock a rapid move toward $2.32, and from there it could surge to $2.65. The structure is bullish , the altcoin has formed a solid base, momentum is building , and the price action is coiling within a framework. The launchpad is ready, but without an upward move in volume, the breakout could face rejection at the resistance zone. Pinnacle_Crypto revealed that XRP is showing a bullish setup on the daily chart, currently trading within a descending wedge pattern, a formation associated with trend reversals and breakouts. The price has bounced strongly from the key support zone near $2.10, which also aligns with the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a technical level that acts as a dynamic support in trending markets. Currently, XRP is aiming for a 25% move to the upside, with the next resistance target at around $2.85. A break above the descending wedge resistance could confirm the move and trigger further upside. It is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, a setup that precedes high-volatility breakouts. Price action is tightening, and with each dip bought up, FOMOwiz outlined that buying pressure is increasing, pointing to ongoing accumulation. Momentum is building as altcoin compresses near the triangle. The structure suggests that a breakout is looming, and if bulls seize control, the price could surge toward the resistance at $3.35. Triangle Pressure Building — XRP Prepping For A Breakout XRP is in a critical accumulation phase on the 2-day chart, coiling within a massive triangle. This pattern is tightening price action where buyers and sellers reach a temporary balance, and heavy accumulation suggests that smart money is preparing for a move. CRYPTOMOJO_TA mentioned that Q3 is underway, and momentum could pick up dramatically, propelling price toward the $4.60 resistance level. Another analyst, James, pointed out a striking similarity between the 2-week chart and the patterns observed during the 2017 bull run. The structure mirrors the giant accumulation triangle that formed back then, followed by a breakout pump that surges price into new highs , the same symmetrical triangle re-accumulation is now taking shape . Based on the chart pattern, James anticipates a final pump in price targeting a range between $4.5 and $5.4.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-gearing-up-for-another-surge-the-4-hour-chart/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|CRYPTOMOJO_TA|FOMOwiz|James|Pinnacle_Crypto|SquirtleCharts|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-01T20:50:31,"Connecticut Governor signs bill banning public officers from using BTC and other crypto assets","The Governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont, has banned public officers from using Bitcoin and other crypto assets. In a bill signed June 30th, the governor also prevented the state’s storage, exchange, and transactions. The law, now known as House Bill 7082 or Public Act 25‑66, passed the state House and Senate without opposition as the House voted 148–0, and the Senate voted 36–0 to go through easily. However, some believe the acceleration to the bill’s passing is not unconnected to the Democrats’ overwhelming majority in Connecticut, especially amid the consistent criticism of President Trump’s involvement with memecoins and digital finance since he came on board as President. This criticism likely influenced the state’s decision to regulate cryptocurrencies more strictly. The bill, which was referred to the House Committee on Banking in February 2025, was passed on June 30th and will come into full effect from October 1st, 2025. Democrats dominate the Connecticut legislature (Source: Bitcoin King on X) The law stated new rules for crypto businesses to follow, which include that any entity trading virtual currencies, including crypto transactions, digital wallets, and Bitcoin Exchanges, must get a license from the State Banking Commissioner. Such entities must also explain clear risk warnings to consumers, issue receipts after each transaction, and strictly follow anti‑money‑laundering rules. If they allow minors to trade, they must have gotten their parents’ consent beforehand. Connecticut’s conservative stance on crypto and Bitcoin investments and trading is coming after several of its neighbouring states in the US continue to support creating a Bitcoin reserve to hold a portion of their wealth. Supporters say the law will protect citizens from exploitation and risks According to supporters of the law, House Bill 7082 is meant to help protect users from being exploited due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, especially for underage people. Also, the law is created to help protect Connecticut’s money and resources from unnecessary risks. However, industry enthusiasts do not agree, noting that while the law might protect citizens due to the unregulated side of crypto, if not done carefully, it could stifle innovation in a growing creative industry. Others are more critical of the move, describing it as an action that will hurt taxpayers. Meanwhile, some believe the law is simply a statement and the state will eventually reverse its decision in the next few years once it sees its costs. Crypto attorney Aaron Brogan is among those who think the law does nothing of substance in the long run. Connecticut says No, when other US states are saying Yes With Connecticut deciding to ban its government from using or investing in Cryptocurrency, it is going away from what other neighbouring and high-profile states are doing. Most of these states already use Bitcoin as a store of value and investment for their assets. In June, Texas made a bold move in crypto. Its governor, Greg Abbot, ratified a bill known as Senate Bill 21 that allows Texas to create a strategic reserve for Bitcoin . This immediately made Texas the latest US state to create a Bitcoin Reserve while officially allocating $10 million to Bitcoin. According to its lawmakers, this prepares the state for the inevitable future of digital finance, where it will become a part and parcel of its economy and the global economy. They also believe this step will help protect their funds from inflation and instability, which will help grow Texas financially in the long run. Arizona and New Hampshire have passed similar bills to set up a strategic Bitcoin and digital assets reserve fund, which their lawmakers believe will help them stay ahead of new technologies and not get left behind. Interestingly, New Hampshire also has laws that support using digital assets as innovation tools to bring financial freedom.

The European fintech announced on July 1, 2025, noting that it was integrating Chainlink ( LINK ), with the strategic aim of bolstering interoperability . Chainlink’s cross chain standard, CCIP, will enable more than $380 million of its institutional-grade onchain money market funds to be accessible to users much more easily and compliantly. “Until now, Spiko MMFs were deployed natively across multiple networks — but investors couldn’t move their shares from one chain to another. The only workaround was to redeem on Network A and re-subscribe on Network B — a clunky, time-consuming, and costly process. That’s officially a thing of the past,” Spiko posted on X. In this case, CCIP will power Spiko’s regulated money market funds, with these MMFs approved by France’s markets regulator. Chainlink will offer the cross-chain interoperability solution that will benefit users looking to tap into traditional financial instruments on-chain.

The two assets, backed by euro and U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills, are the first EU-approved USD- and EUR-denominated money market funds whose shares are issued as fungible tokens on a public blockchain. It’s part of the massive tokenization trend currently being witnessed across the world. “By integrating CCIP, we’re extending our tokenized money market funds across chains while maintaining the compliance and operational standards required by institutional investors,” said Paul-Adrien Hyppolite, co-founder and chief executive officer of Spiko. Spiko aims to use Chainlink to scale access to its funds, with regulatory and operational standards around identity verification checks, such as know your customer and anti-money laundering. CCIP integration sees Spiko tap into another key blockchain-powered solution after the platform adopted Chainlink SmartData to offer real-time NAV reporting. Chainlink continues to attract massive adoption initiatives as its solutions power growth and traction for projects across decentralized finance, banking, and real-world assets, among others.

2025-07-01T20:30:18,"MiCA regulations caused 82% of crypto media sites in Europe to lose traffic in Q1 2025","Crypto news sites across Europe lost visibility fast in the first three months of 2025 after MiCA rules kicked in. According to a detailed report from Outset, over 80% of crypto-native media in the region saw traffic fall. While MiCA mainly targets crypto service providers, not publishers, the rules swept up media outlets anyway, especially those running sponsored posts, affiliate links, or anything remotely promotional without the right disclaimers. In January, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) warned that even editorial content must be stripped of investment talk unless licenses are in place. Google responded quickly. Pages without proper disclaimers or jurisdiction tags got buried. Sites outside the EU weren’t safe either if their content targeted Europe in German, French, Dutch, or Spanish. The traffic drops weren’t just algorithmic. Geopolitical tensions and the broader crypto market downturn made the hits worse. Germany issued threats, and traffic collapsed anyway Germany had 34 crypto-native media outlets. By February, 21 of them were down. BaFin, the country’s regulator, issued public warnings about unlicensed “investment-like” promotion. Coin-Update lost over 51%. Krypto Magazin fell 45%. Cointelegraph Germany plunged 63%. March didn’t fix much—half the German outlets were still dropping. A few sites fought back with disclaimers and legal fine print. BitcoinBlog.de bounced up 47.4% in March. Krypto News and Kryptozeitung also posted small rebounds. Others stayed down for the count. The few winners—CryptoMonday, Blockzeit, CoinJournal DE, and Crypto Valley Journal—used stronger legal tagging and multilingual coverage. In total, just 9 German-language sites recorded any growth that quarter. CoinJournal DE benefited from its ownership by Investoo Group, a UK firm that owns a bunch of multilingual crypto sites optimized for SEO and local compliance. In 2020, Investoo added CoinJournal to its portfolio and later merged bitcoinmag.de into it. The combined traffic and shared legal infrastructure helped them hold steady during the crackdown. Other former Investoo brands like Kryptoszene.de, now independent, still saw growth. It probably pivoted to niche German-first content after the split. Blockchain Stories DE and Block-Builders.de also grew across the quarter. French outlets fell hard while only a few climbed back up France had 25 crypto-dedicated media outlets at the start of Q1. Most dropped. The Blog lost nearly 72%. Coinhouse, CryptoNews France, and Conseils Crypto each lost around 40%. Cointelegraph France underperformed even though it’s tied to Frekaz Group, which also owns Cointribune. Cointribune held up better, mostly due to its structure as a hybrid VC-media startup under Frekaz. But it wasn’t immune to search penalties. Franchise models, like Cointelegraph’s French edition, struggled more—limited backend access and lower investment in SEO made a difference. By March, things improved a bit. Stelareum climbed back up 9%. Blockchain France grew 72.64%. InvestX jumped 60.71%. Cryptoast and Bitcoin.fr also showed mild gains. In total, only four French outlets finished the quarter with stable growth: ActuCrypto.info, Blockchain France, The Market Periodical, and InvestX. All of them leaned on compliance tools, clear risk language, and wider language support. The Netherlands and Belgium didn’t pass new crypto media laws, but that didn’t protect anyone from Google. Dutch-speaking outlets took heavy hits in February. Out of 21 sites, over 76% lost traffic. Bitcoinexchangenederland.nl got wrecked—down 92.96%. Bitcoin Koers dropped more than 50%. Crypto Insiders fell even without regulatory pressure. The same pattern held in Spain and Italy. Spanish outlets were hit by the late 2024 ad rules from CNMV. By February, 70% had traffic losses. CriptoPasion dropped nearly 47%. Cointelegraph ES and BeInCrypto’s Spanish edition both lost around 20%. Bit2Me News was the outlier, up 149.40% after a spike in March. The rest stayed down. Italy also saw 70% of crypto media lose ground. The Cryptonomist dropped 42%. Cointelegraph Italy fell 46%. Only Borsainside grew. CONSOB’s early 2025 advisories didn’t help, especially for influencer-linked platforms. The UK wasn’t even part of MiCA , but got slammed anyway. The FCA started enforcing its own crypto ad rules in January. Five UK-facing crypto outlets were tracked. The Market Periodical and MyCryptoSpaceUK posted gains, but they were small—MyCryptoSpaceUK stayed under 10K monthly visits. Bitcourier and Cryptouk.io failed to recover.

January started with 26.57M visits across all outlets. By March, it was 22.22M. That’s a 16.37% drop in just two months. Only 16 outlets gained any traction, and just half of those had steady growth month to month. Traffic across Europe was mostly concentrated in a handful of sites. BTC Echo, Crypto Insiders, Cointribune, Bitcoin Magazine, Cointelegraph ES, and Newsbit’s Dutch and German versions had over 1M monthly visits. They made up 60% of all crypto media traffic. Lower-tier sites—those under 100K visits—added up to just 6.24% of the region’s traffic. Mid-level outlets filled in the rest. Germany and France led the region in audience. Italy and the UK underperformed. Belgium split between Dutch and English sites. Portugal had zero crypto-native publications. Meanwhile, mainstream financial sites outperformed crypto media.

2025-07-01T20:10:02,"€748 billion UniCredit reveals capital protected Bitcoin ETF","Italy’s second-largest bank, UniCredit SpA has launched a capital investment certificate spanning a five-year time period. The product is tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). It appears that European banks are ready to move beyond their skepticism of cryptocurrencies and start participating meaningfully in the digital asset market as UniCredit SpA, one of Europe’s largest banking institutions with €748B ($881B) in assets, launches a new structured product tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The product is exclusively targeted at professional clients and offers full capital protection at maturity. The five-year, dollar-denominated investment certificate will mirror the performance of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF. UniCredit reveals capital protected Bitcoin ETF According to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News and confirmed by UniCredit, the certificate guarantees 100% capital protection at maturity while capping the maximum return at 85% of the ETF’s performance. The product is set to be available for subscription from July 1 to July 28, with a minimum investment requirement of $25,000. While capped returns may not appeal to high-risk traders, they offer a palatable entry point for investors still wary of the notorious volatility of cryptocurrencies. This kind of investment structure is often called a “capital-protected note,” and it is typically used in volatile or emerging asset classes where investor confidence may be low. “We are seeing increasing interest from professional investors in instruments tied to emerging asset classes such as cryptocurrencies,” Chicco di Stasi, UniCredit’s head of Group Investment Product Solutions and Equity & Credit Sales and Trading, said. “With this product, we offer our professional clients a distinctive solution — the first of its kind in Italy.” Bitcoin has outperformed much of the broader crypto market in 2025, and has gained approximately 14% year-to-date, while many smaller tokens have experienced steep losses. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) , launched by BlackRock, has played a pivotal role in mainstreaming Bitcoin investment. Since its approval by U.S. regulators in January 2024, the ETF has grown to over $75B in assets under management, making it one of the most successful exchange-traded funds of all time. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also launched a separate Bitcoin ETP in Europe. Italian and European banks consider crypto expansion European banks are cautiously stepping into the digital asset industry. Earlier this year, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Italy’s largest banking group, confirmed its first spot Bitcoin purchase and launched a digital asset trading desk for institutional clients. Spain’s Banco Santander SA is also reportedly exploring options to expand its digital asset offerings. The bank is in early-stage planning to launch a stablecoin and provide access to cryptocurrencies for retail clients through its digital banking arm. Across the European Union, regulatory clarity around digital assets has improved with the gradual rollout of MiCA , the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, which is aimed at bringing more transparency and consumer protection to the industry. European investor interest in crypto is rebounding following a turbulent 2022 and 2023, which was marked by high-profile crypto firm bankruptcies and market volatility. The success of UniCredit’s product could prompt the company to expand its digital asset offerings further and encourage even more European banks to follow suit.

The crypto market cap declined by around 4 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $3.366 trillion on Tuesday, July 1, during the mid-North American trading session. Amid the midterm crypto bearish outlook, on-chain data analysis shows institutional investors have continued to accumulate relentlessly. For instance, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, recorded a net cash inflow of about $102 million on Monday, thus registering 15 consecutive days of cash inflows. Will U.S. SEC’s Approval of Spot Altcoin ETF Trigger Market Reversal? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has remained on the side of pro-crypto regulations since the 2nd inauguration of President Donald Trump. On Tuesday, the SEC granted approval to the conversion of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap (GDLC) Fund into an ETF. The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which has about $774 million in Assets Under Management (AUM), holds several digital assets led by Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The approval of the GDLC‘s conversion to ETF is a major milestone for the entire altcoin market, which has been expecting more spot ETF approval in the coming months. As a result, the approval will play a crucial role in net crypto traded volume during the next few months. The expected demand growth in the spot market will likely trigger a bullish reversal in the near term. Midterm Expectations Following the approval of GDLC conversion to an ETF product, the odds of an altseason in the near term have significantly surged. Furthermore, the U.S. SEC will imminently approve more crypto spot ETFs in the near future. Yes, this is what everyone wants, what makes sense and what we think will happen and why we so bullish (95% on most of the coins) approval. Q is what will the standards be.

2025-07-01T20:00:25,"Genius Mathematician Urges XRP Holders to Buckle Up. Here’s why","A bold mathematical prediction has ignited excitement among XRP holders, thanks to a viral video shared by Levi of Crypto Crusaders. In the clip, a mathematician named Giovanni uses advanced modeling techniques to forecast Bitcoin’s future, and by extension, offers a compelling glimpse into XRP’s explosive potential. As the market enters a critical phase, his insights are urging XRP investors to prepare for what could be a dramatic uptrend. The Math Behind Bitcoin’s Explosive Future Giovanni’s analysis relies on a combination of regression lines and a power law formula, in which Bitcoin’s price is proportional to time raised to the power of six. Here, time refers to the age of the Bitcoin network, and the “power” amplifies the value growth exponentially. According to Giovanni, this model forecasts that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin in eight years, and $10 million in two decades. These projections may sound ambitious, but they are grounded in historical trends and logarithmic growth patterns, not mere speculation. GENIUS Mathematician Urges XRP Holders To BUCKLE UP! #XRP pic.twitter.com/B0vCVoKSA7 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) June 30, 2025 This model suggests that Bitcoin’s price has historically followed a mathematically consistent upward curve that reflects not just market hype but the intrinsic maturation of its decentralized network. As the system ages, the price naturally escalates along the curve, making this forecast particularly powerful for long-term investors. Why XRP Could Outperform Bitcoin Levi of Crypto Crusaders takes Giovanni’s projection a step further by connecting it to XRP’s historical behavior. He notes that while Bitcoin drives the market, XRP often mirrors its performance, but with significantly greater gains. During the last major bull move, when Bitcoin rose from $50,000 to around $110,000 (a 2x increase), XRP surged from $0.50 to about $3, a 6x rally. Levi applies this same ratio to current market levels. With Bitcoin now trading at approximately $106,232 and XRP at $2.19, he argues that if Bitcoin reaches the projected $150,000 to $200,000 range during this cycle, XRP could logically climb to between $15 and $25. His conservative estimate places XRP at $20 at the cycle’s peak, an outcome that fits with previous market dynamics and historical correlations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Conditions and XRP’s Current Position At present, XRP trades around $2.19, showing significant strength amid broader market optimism. Bitcoin’s steady climb has created favorable tailwinds, and XRP appears to be gaining momentum as investor confidence returns. With the SEC litigation largely behind Ripple, regulatory uncertainties that once held XRP back are quickly fading. Moreover, Ripple’s increasing global footprint in payments infrastructure, along with rising institutional interest in XRP-related services, adds fundamental support to these bullish technical projections. XRP’s unique utility in cross-border finance continues to distinguish it from many other altcoins, enhancing its credibility as a high-upside asset in the evolving financial ecosystem. Buckle Up: A Mathematical and Market-Driven Call Giovanni’s prediction, backed by decades of trend analysis, aligns perfectly with what seasoned XRP analysts like Levi have observed over multiple market cycles. If Bitcoin does peak in the $200,000 range as the model suggests, XRP’s amplified response could create generational wealth for long-term holders. For those positioned early, the message is clear: buckle up. The next wave may not only validate this bold mathematical model, but it could also solidify XRP’s place among the most explosive assets in the crypto market.

2025-07-01T19:55:35,"Man Allegedly Converts $1,700,000 Worth of Fake Checks and Fraudulent Wire Transfers Into Bitcoin After Multiple Scams","A central New York man is currently in custody for turning $1.7 million worth of fraudulent checks into Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to official District of Rhode Island court documents , Tushal Rathod has been charged with wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Court documents show an affidavit by FBI special agent Samuel Morgan detailing Rathod’s allegations. From 2022 to 2024, Morgan alleges Rathod collected nearly $2 million in fraudulent checks and business email compromise (BEC) fraud. According to the affidavit, “During a BEC, scammers obtain the login credentials of an email user of a business email account. Typically, the credentials are obtained during a ‘spearphishing’ cyber campaign.” In a BEC, thieves use the stolen credentials to monitor e-mail transactions, stepping in with fraudulent communications over sensitive matters like upcoming financial transactions. BECs sometimes even involve malware. Rathod allegedly then spread the fraudulent funds out across seven accounts in six different banks. Furthermore, most of those funds were then converted into BTC. Rathod allegedly worked with several co-conspirators and took on different names to different people. Says Morgan, “In my training and experience, I know that fraudsters and individuals who conduct BEC schemes often work with a vast network of money launderers to help them ‘clean’ funds and then re-integrate the ‘cleaned’ funds into the economy so that the funds can be used free from the taint of criminal activity. This allows the scammers to profit from their fraudulent conduct and to avoid getting caught.” Rathod was arrested and arraigned last Wednesday. He is currently awaiting his detention hearing in custody.

2025-07-01T19:40:46,"Buffett Indicator hit 205%, signaling extreme market overvaluation","The Warren Buffett Indicator has climbed to 205%, the highest point ever tracked. That figure officially tops levels seen during both the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis. It means the total market cap of US stocks now sits at more than double the country’s GDP, marking the most expensive valuation on record. The market hit this milestone just as trading began for the second half of 2025, and Wall Street’s reaction? Flat. Stocks barely moved. The metric may be screaming red, but traders seem to be holding their breath. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 426 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 hovered near the flatline and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6%. The Dow’s movement came after a change in trading behavior. Investors dumped tech names like Microsoft and Nvidia, two of the biggest winners in Q2, and rotated into health-care firms. Amgen, Merck, and UnitedHealth each jumped close to 3%, while Johnson & Johnson added almost 2%. The tech-heavy Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which gained nearly 23% last quarter, started Q3 down 1%. Trump tax bill passes Senate as Musk slams it, Powell hints at pause President Donald Trump’s new tax and spending bill passed the Senate on Tuesday with a narrow 51-50 vote. The legislation, which includes sweeping budget changes, now moves to the House. But it’s already facing public criticism from major corporate names. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, called the bill “utterly insane and destructive” on Truth Social. In response, Trump posted on the same platform calling for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to investigate the government subsidies that Musk’s companies have collected. This is the second time this year the two have clashed over federal funding and regulatory priorities. Elon’s reaction came on the same day Tesla stock dropped more than 5%. It was one of the worst-performing names among large caps. His public comments raised concerns about political backlash against clean energy subsidies, a key part of Tesla’s business model. Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a policy update during a European Central Bank panel in Portugal. Powell said that without Trump’s tariffs, the Fed would have likely cut interest rates again by now. “In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence,” Powell said . He didn’t clarify whether July would be too soon for another move, instead saying any decision would be based on data. Corporate bitcoin buying overtakes ETFs for third quarter On the crypto side, corporate buying of bitcoin continued to outpace ETFs for the third straight quarter. Public companies added around 131,000 BTC in Q2, increasing their holdings by 18%. In comparison, ETFs added 111,000 BTC, a growth of 8%. Leading the pack is Strategy, still holding the largest stash among public companies. But others are catching on. Ben Werkman, Chief Investment Officer at Swan Bitcoin, said the landscape is shifting. “It’s going to be very hard to catch Strategy’s scale,” Werkman said. “They’re going to be the preferred landing spot for institutional capital because of the deep liquidity around their equity, while these smaller equities are going to be really good risk returns for retail investors and smaller institutions that want more of that upside.” Back on Wall Street, Berkshire Hathaway’s stocks responded to the Buffett hype. Class A shares closed at $733,214.44, up $4,414.44 or 0.61%, while Class B shares ended the day at $488.70, rising 0.60%. These gains came as the Buffett Indicator dominated headlines, though the company’s performance had no direct link to the broader market overvaluation that the metric tracks. Markets had already recovered significantly after their April slide, triggered by Trump’s aggressive tariff policies. Back then, the S&P 500 flirted with bear market territory. Since then, things have turned. The S&P 500 closed out Q2 with a 10.6% gain, and the Nasdaq jumped nearly 18%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This prestigious position is typically reserved for a handful of U.S. companies whose operating profits exceed $10 billion quarterly by generating billions in revenue. According to a July 1 Bloomberg report , Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) has now secured membership in this Wall Street elite circle. Michael Saylor’s Strategy to Join Wall Street Elite With $14 Billion Windfall https://t.co/TUXH3nEpy9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 1, 2025 The dramatic turnaround from near-obscurity stems from Bitcoin’s price recovery in April and May and a recent accounting methodology change at Strategy regarding the valuation of its substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Per Bloomberg projections, Strategy is expected to generate approximately $112.8 million in second-quarter revenue from its traditional software operations. Critics Double Down on Saylor’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Despite Record Performance The anticipated record profit for the quarter ending June 30 comes amid intensified criticism from prominent skeptics, including renowned short-seller Jim Chanos. During a recent Odd Lots podcast episode titled “On the Absurdity of Bitcoin Treasury Companies,” Chanos criticized Strategy’s treasury strategy and advised investors to short MSTR stock while purchasing Bitcoin directly, betting that the large premium the stock commands over its token holdings will eventually contract. Noted short-seller Jim Chanos is now shorting shares of Strategy (formerly @MicroStrategy ) while simultaneously buying Bitcoin directly. #JimChanos #Bitcoin https://t.co/EKkOhUWttz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 15, 2025 Chanos shared Strategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition data, commenting: “It looks like Saylor will be happy to sell you some more MSTR stock, as he tapped the common equity ATM for over half a billion dollars again last week.” In that case, it looks like Saylor will be happy to sell you some more $MSTR stock, as he tapped the common equity ATM for over half a billion dollars again last week. pic.twitter.com/N8Sp0t26yO — James Chanos (@RealJimChanos) June 30, 2025 The Wall Street investor also revealed insider information suggesting that Strategy was being considered for S&P 500 inclusion, though this decision has reportedly been delayed until September. However, Saylor maintains that most critics fundamentally misunderstand Strategy’s business model. He has faced criticism for over four years, yet his company has dramatically outperformed both single stocks and the broader S&P 500 index. Strategy’s shares (MSTR) have skyrocketed more than 3,130% since Saylor initiated Bitcoin purchases in mid-2020 as an inflation hedge. Source: Google Finance During the same timeframe, Bitcoin has gained approximately 1,000%, while the S&P 500 has risen around 115%.

Recall that Strategy concluded its strongest month since November 2024 with a 32% surge in April, closing at $380.11, up from $288 at the period’s start. Strategy Accounting Changes Drive Q2 Profitability as Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Spreads Strategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings are beginning to translate into profitability primarily due to anticipated modifications in cryptocurrency asset accounting regulations. Despite widespread awareness of the accounting methodology change , the first-quarter loss has attracted several class-action lawsuits alleging that Strategy executives made false and misleading statements that harmed shareholders. Strategy stated its intention to “vigorously defend against these claims” in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing . Saylor’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy has inspired numerous imitators seeking to replicate his success. Other companies are also adapting the approach for different cryptocurrency tokens. For example, SharpLink Gaming Inc. is accumulating Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, while Upexi Inc. recently raised $100 million to purchase Solana tokens. SharpLink Gaming has emerged as the world’s largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum (ETH), after acquiring 176,271 ETH for $463 million. #ETH #Sharplink https://t.co/ynahjYt7Hd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 A group of hedge fund executives recently attempted to raise $100 million to acquire BNB, Binance’s native token , through a publicly traded vehicle.

2025-07-01T19:30:00,"Senate passes Trump’s massive budget bill, with no mentions of crypto or Bitcoin","Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” passed the Senate, but without any provisions related to the crypto industry. Trump’s budget bill passed the Senate, but the crypto industry has little to celebrate. On Tuesday, June 1, the U.S. Senate passed the sweeping budget bill, with a razor-thin margin. Yet, despite Donald Trump’s past vocal support for the crypto industry, the bill had no crypto-related provisions. Specifically, there was no mention of “digital assets,” “Bitcoin,” “Ethereum,” “crypto,” “web3,” or “blockchain” anywhere in the over 1000-page bill. This is despite specific efforts by pro-crypto Senators to include tax breaks for the industry in the bill. Notably, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal advocate for digital assets, argued for changing the tax code for crypto mining and staking. She argued that miners and stakers were taxed twice, once when they received block rewards and then again when they had to sell them. For years, miners and stakers have been taxed TWICE. Once when they receive block rewards, and again when they sell it. It’s time to stop this unfair tax treatment and ensure America is the world’s Bitcoin and Crypto Superpower. 🇺🇸 — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 30, 2025 You might also like: Senator Lummis pushes for crypto-friendly amendments in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Miners and stakers seek relief from taxation Currently, the IRS classifies profits from crypto mining and staking as income, which is taxed at fair market value at the time of receiving them. Once the miners sell their crypto, they have to report capital gains and pay a flat rate on these profits. While these taxes don’t strictly entail double taxation, miners and stakers complain that the system is overly burdensome. Namely, they have to pay taxes before realizing any profits, or before converting any crypto to fiat. You might also like: Guide to paying taxes on cryptocurrency income Lummis also advocated for tax exemptions for small crypto transactions, or a “de minimis” rule. These are often transactions that involve small payments for gas fees, small transfers, etc. While transactions don’t generate much tax income, they are a significant burden when it comes to tax reporting. The crypto industry was one of the biggest donors in the November 2024 elections. They supported candidates from both parties, raising over $190 million for their campaigns.

2025-07-01T19:29:48,"Socialist Zohran Mamdani may become a New York mayor. Why does crypto X push against him?","33-year-old socialist Zohran Mamdani became a surprise favorite among the NYC mayoral candidates from the Democratic Party and is considered a likely winner in the election. Mamdani’s socialist platform is criticized for being naive and unrealistic. However, his popularity is a signal to capitalists that the masses of New Yorkers are unheard of. Why does crypto X blast Mamdani? Is he an enemy of cryptocurrencies? Table of Contents Zohran Mamdani’s background and platform Can Mamdani save New York? Why does Crypto Twitter not like Mamdani? Conclusion Zohran Mamdani’s background and platform Zohran Mamdani’s parents are Ugandan academic and political commentator Mahmood Mamdani and award-winning Indian American filmmaker Mira Nair. Mamdani’s family moved to the USA from Uganda when Zohran was seven. Mamdani is Muslim and an outspoken socialist. He criticizes Israel’s actions in Palestine while opposing anti-semitism at the same time. Mamdani has a degree in African studies. Prior to starting a political career, he worked as a housing counselor. He has been a member of the New York State Assembly from the 36th district since 2021. Mamdani announced he is running for mayor of New York in October 2024. His platform is based on the idea that New York got too expensive to live in for working-class New Yorkers, which is true, given that even one-bedroom apartments in working-class districts can cost over $3,000 or even $4,000 per month. Mamdani’s supporters use slogans such as “Freeze the Rent” and “A City We Can Afford” while Mamdani is addressing the cost-of-living crisis in his speeches. His initiatives include abolishing payment for the use of buses, creating affordable city-owned grocery stores across the city, providing public child care, freezing housing prices, and building more affordable houses. These ideas resonated with young lodgers of New York and Asian and Latinx voters. In June, Mamdani became the leading candidate from the Democratic Party, beating former New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary. Mamdani’s success scared and angered Republicans, big business, and some of the moderate Democrats. Can Mamdani save New York? Just like Donald Trump before the presidency, Mamdani is criticized for lacking real experience in politics. His success owes much to social media and efficient promotion. The assembly years of Mamdani weren’t marked with any achievements. Now that his campaign has proved to be victorious, critics worry about a possible disastrous mayoral term of Mamdani. Mamdani’s ideas are criticized for being naive and even harmful : rent grows slower than the maintenance costs for apartment owners, while the promise to build affordable housing projects totally ignores the fact that New York has already been championing this strategy for many years. More than that, the rent prices for 40% of apartments are already controlled (landlords cannot raise the cost more than 5% a year). This policy shows poor results as the uncontrolled housing gets costlier, while controlled housing loses in quality as landlords cut expenses. Freezing the rent altogether will only make it worse. Mamdani’s plan to tax the rich to pay off his public projects may also find opposition from the governor and state legislature. As for the buses, critics say that free buses will attract new passengers who now use the subway. This pressure may worsen the traffic jam situation. Why does Crypto Twitter not like Mamdani? It seems that many of Mamdani’s plans are too hard to materialize, or they are just bad at their core. However, Crypto X (Twitter) has one more reason to hate a new Democratic leader: he is not a cryptocurrency champion, while his opponents in the election are pro-crypto. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa promised to widen the Bitcoin ATM infrastructure back in 2021. Also, he was urging local businesses to start accepting crypto payments. The incumbent NYC mayor, who is going to get re-elected as an independent candidate, Eric Adams, is a crypto advocate who famously said that he received his first three mayoral paychecks in Bitcoin. Adams was calling New Yorkers to oppose Bitlicense, a framework that stalls cryptocurrency business in New York, and participated in various other cryptocurrency initiatives. As NYC #Mayor , I will make #NYC the most cryptocurrency-friendly city in the nation Property taxes, fines & fees will be payable in #crypto We will open more crypto ATMs & incentivize businesses to accept crypto We must modernize our economy & make it accessible for ALL! pic.twitter.com/WW2zPncEps — Curtis Sliwa (@CurtisSliwa) September 1, 2021 Read more: New York Mayor Pushes State to Drop “Stifling” BitLicense Program Mamdani is not a strong crypto proponent. He used a cryptocurrency topic as the reason to criticize former governor Andrew Cuomo, calling him out for advising an OKX exchange that broke local rules and had to pay $505 million in fines. Andrew Cuomo could’ve spent the years since his resignation making amends and helping New Yorkers. Instead he hounded the women who spoke out about his serial harassment, fought to keep his book deal millions…and advised a foreign crypto exchange that broke US law. pic.twitter.com/kBxkNGdrgA — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) April 2, 2025 In 2023, Mamdani called to tighten regulations on cryptocurrency in New York, despite the fact that New York is already a tough jurisdiction for cryptocurrency businesses. Basically, that’s all Mamdani had to say about crypto during his lifetime. When crypto companies collapse, it isn’t the rich who suffer, it’s small investors who disproportionately come from low-income and communities of color. @NewYorkStateAG has a bill to address this and protect New York investors. Let’s do it! https://t.co/z0lCuPzkK9 — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) May 11, 2023 It is not Mamdani’s lack of support for crypto, nor the weakness of his platform, that is the target for Crypto Twitter. It seems that many in the community simply hate Mamdani for being a socialist, Israeli military aggression critic, and “tax the rich” proponent. Some even point at his Ugandan roots as a problem or bring up the fact that Mamdani is not poor himself, as if it means he is not honest with the voters. Your mom lets you stay in her $2 million condo in Chelsea. Why are you pandering? You are rich. You are a nepo baby. https://t.co/uq8bbSjHP9 — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) June 30, 2025 As many big figures in the crypto community don’t have reservations about being or becoming ultrawealthy, they seem to be angered and scared by the sudden success of Mamdani, who claimed, “I don’t think we should have billionaires because it is so much money in a moment of such inequality.” Zohran Mamdani: “I don't think that we should have billionaires.” Do you agree? Is there a point in being a billionaire besides for power? pic.twitter.com/zEyE0yHHp1 — Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein) June 29, 2025 Billionaire and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is one of the most concerned about Mamdani’s person on X. He cites the poorly based post suggesting that the results in the Democratic primary are not impressive as a thoughtful piece, and reposts various tweets that bring up Mamdani’s remoteness from the working class or his distaste for Benjamin Netanyahu as problematic. Socialism is a mental disease spread by those looking to prey on the economically illiterate. — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) June 30, 2025 One of the retweeted posts is by Anthony Pompliano, a cryptocurrency podcaster and the new CEO of the ProCap BTC Bitcoin treasury company. On his podcast, he shared a clip in which ​​market analyst Jordi Visser explains why the youth lean toward socialism. Frustration and the feeling that the system is failing them are to blame. Visser, however, sees that Bitcoin may be the way out–something that is missing from Mamdani’s platform. In the same video, Pompliano shares the text from a venture capitalist, Peter Thiel, who cites student debt, unaffordable housing, long-term negative capital, no stake in the capitalist system, and the lack of eagerness of the boomer generation to pass the power to younger generations. Interestingly, Pompliano suggests that the solution for the youth would be copying the behavior of successful people of the past: accumulating capital, embracing new technologies, and taking risks–diving into the Bitcoin space matches all three suggestions. However, it only emphasizes that the old-school pipeline of the American Dream is systematically broken, and Bitcoin is one of the newer bypasses in the post-2008-and-2020-crises world order. Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss made a viral post condemning the youth supporting Mamdani. He concluded that socialism can be a hard lesson for Zoomers and millennials to learn why socialism is a bad idea. A lot of people have asked me if I will get involved in the NYC mayor race by supporting a candidate that can defeat Zohran Mamdani. TBH, I’m torn and undecided. Like every other city run by democrats, NYC is a broken kleptocracy. Taxes are astronomical and services are pathetic… — Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) June 26, 2025 However, many in the comment section pointed out that instead of speaking about how good it is for New Yorkers to “learn it the hard way,” Winklevoss could come up with a more positive program, for instance, educating the youth about dangers of socialism the same way Mamdani earned his popularity–via social media, or just through “throwing good money at [capitalism] to work outside your trust fund.” Blaming socialism for millennial disillusionment is wild when it was capitalism—2008, student debt, unaffordable housing—that radicalized millennials. Also rich (ha): a billionaire crypto mogul lecturing NYC on kleptocracy while VC money launders luxury towers and rig… — efficientenzyme (@efficientenzyme) June 26, 2025 Conclusion New York is home to Gemini, MoonPay, Circle, Paxos, and other cryptocurrency projects. The mayor of the city will have an impact on the crypto industry of the U.S., per se. The probable victory of Mamdani casts a shadow on the prospects of the cryptocurrency business in New York, as the crypto sector is nonexistent in his campaign. It’s four months until the November election, and things can change.

2025-07-01T19:20:45,"Japanese Game Developer CyberStep Pioneers Ambitious $6.96M Crypto Reserve for Web3 Future","BitcoinWorld Japanese Game Developer CyberStep Pioneers Ambitious $6.96M Crypto Reserve for Web3 Future In a significant move signaling the growing convergence of traditional entertainment and decentralized finance, CyberStep, a prominent Japanese game developer renowned for its popular online claw machine game Toreba, has launched an ambitious new initiative. This strategic pivot into the digital asset space marks a bold step, setting a precedent for how established gaming companies are embracing the future of finance and technology. Why is this Japanese Game Developer Making Waves? CyberStep’s decision to dive deep into the cryptocurrency world isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a calculated move. On July 1, the company officially unveiled CRYPTECH Capital, a dedicated division poised to manage its foray into digital assets. This isn’t merely about dabbling; it’s about establishing a robust foundation within the burgeoning Web3 ecosystem. For a leading Japanese game developer , this move underscores a belief in the long-term viability and transformative potential of blockchain technology, especially as it relates to interactive entertainment. Building a Strategic Crypto Reserve: The Vision At the heart of CyberStep’s new venture is the commitment to building a substantial crypto reserve . The company’s strategy involves converting tokens generated from its various Web3 services into established major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). These assets will then be held on the company’s balance sheet, providing a stable foundation and potentially new avenues for growth. This approach demonstrates a clear understanding of market dynamics, opting for blue-chip cryptocurrencies known for their liquidity and relative stability within the volatile crypto landscape. CyberStep’s Bold Digital Asset Strategy Unpacked The financial commitment behind this initiative is noteworthy. CyberStep has initially allocated 200 million yen (approximately $1.39 million) for immediate crypto purchases within the fiscal year ending May 2026. This initial investment is just the beginning. The long-term vision for this digital asset strategy is to expand the reserve significantly, aiming for a target of 1 billion yen (around $6.96 million), contingent on favorable market conditions. This phased approach allows the company flexibility to adapt to market fluctuations while steadily building its digital asset portfolio. It’s a pragmatic and forward-thinking strategy for managing risk and maximizing potential returns. The Future of Web3 Gaming and Beyond CyberStep’s move highlights a broader trend: the increasing integration of blockchain technology into the gaming industry. The creation of Web3 services, which leverage decentralized technologies, is a key component of this shift. By converting tokens from these services into major cryptocurrencies, CyberStep is not only diversifying its assets but also strengthening its commitment to the decentralized future. This could pave the way for more innovative in-game economies, true digital ownership for players, and new forms of interaction within the Web3 gaming sphere. It positions CyberStep at the forefront of this evolving digital frontier, potentially inspiring other traditional game developers to explore similar paths. What Does This Mean for CyberStep Crypto Holdings? The establishment of CRYPTECH Capital and the accumulation of a substantial CyberStep crypto reserve could have several implications: Enhanced Financial Stability: Holding major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH can act as a hedge against inflation and offer diversification from traditional fiat currencies. Future Investment Opportunities: A strong digital asset base provides capital for future Web3 projects, acquisitions, or partnerships. Industry Leadership: By proactively embracing crypto, CyberStep solidifies its position as an innovator in the gaming and tech sectors. Player Engagement: The integration of Web3 elements could lead to more engaging and rewarding experiences for players, potentially increasing user retention and growth for games like Toreba. This strategic decision reflects a growing confidence among established companies in the long-term value and utility of digital assets. CyberStep’s ambitious venture into building a significant crypto reserve through CRYPTECH Capital is a clear signal of the evolving landscape where gaming, technology, and finance intertwine. This Japanese game developer is not just observing the Web3 revolution; it’s actively participating, aiming to secure its financial future and innovate within the digital realm. Their strategic approach, focusing on major cryptocurrencies and a phased investment, sets a compelling example for other traditional businesses considering a leap into the decentralized world. As the digital economy continues to expand, CyberStep’s proactive stance positions it for remarkable growth and influence in the years to come.

2025-07-01T19:13:00,"“Not off the table”: Fed comment could trigger Bitcoin, altcoin rally","Bitcoin and altcoin prices could stage a strong rally in July after a surprise statement from Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair. In a statement, Powell changed his tune on when the Fed will start cutting interest rates. For the first time this year, he did not rule out slashing rates as soon as in the July meeting. He said : “I really can’t say. It’s going to depend on the data. And we are going meeting by meeting. I wouldn’t take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table. It’s going to depend on how the data fall.” In his testimony to Congress last week, Powell insisted that the bank would maintain a wait-and-see approach before hiking interest rates. He and other officials are assessing the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs on interest rates. You might also like: Senator Lummis pushes for crypto-friendly amendments in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Some Federal Reserve officials have supported a July interest rate cut. In recent statements, Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman have insisted that Trump’s tariffs were having a limited impact on inflation and that a July cut would be necessary. Still, traders and the futures market are unconvinced that the Fed will cut in July. Polymarket data pegs a July cut at 17% and no change at 82%. The CME FedWatch tool puts the odds of a cut at just 19.1%. A July rate cut would be highly bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins because it would reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. It would also increase risk appetite among investors, as happened during the COVID-19 pandemic when the bank brought rates to zero. The rate cut would also coincide with the passing of Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which introduces some tax cuts and reduces regulations. Some of the money saved in taxes will be invested in cryptocurrencies. While a July rate cut is not guaranteed, most analysts anticipate one in September, with odds standing at over 75%. In a statement this week, Goldman Sachs predicted three cuts this year, while Morgan Stanley sees seven in 2026. Bitcoin and altcoins have other catalysts Bitcoin and altcoins have other catalysts that will push them higher this year. For example, Bitcoin demand continues rising, with spot ETF inflows nearing the $50 billion mark. More companies like Coinbase, Block, GameStop, and MetaPlanet continue to accumulate Bitcoin. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve several altcoin ETFs later this year. Odds of an XRP ETF being approved this year have jumped to 85%, while Solana ( SOL ) has soared to 99%. ETF approvals will likely lead to more inflows among investors. Further, regulatory clarity in the crypto industry is happening, which will attract more investors. For example, the US Senate has passed the GENIUS Act , which focuses on the stablecoin industry.

2025-07-01T19:10:45,"Bitcoin: Smarter Web Company’s Strategic BTC Purchase Signals Growing Confidence","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Smarter Web Company’s Strategic BTC Purchase Signals Growing Confidence In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, major corporate moves often signal shifts in market sentiment and investment trends. Recently, the cryptocurrency community turned its attention to a significant announcement from the UK-based web development firm, The Smarter Web Company (SWC). This move highlights a growing trend among companies embracing digital assets. Let’s delve into the specifics of their latest BTC purchase and what it means for the broader landscape of Bitcoin adoption. Smarter Web Company’s Latest BTC Purchase: A Deep Dive On July 1st, The Smarter Web Company made headlines with its press release confirming an additional acquisition of 230.05 BTC. This latest acquisition was made at an average cost of $107,126 per Bitcoin, demonstrating SWC’s continued belief in the long-term value of the premier cryptocurrency. This strategic addition significantly boosts their overall holdings, bringing SWC’s total Bitcoin stash to an impressive 773.58 BTC. To put this into perspective, here’s a quick look at SWC’s growing Bitcoin portfolio: Transaction BTC Amount Average Cost (USD) Total Holdings (BTC) Previous Holdings (Estimated) N/A N/A 543.53 Latest Purchase (July 1) 230.05 $107,126 N/A New Total Holdings N/A N/A 773.58 This substantial accumulation underscores a deliberate strategy by Smarter Web Company to diversify its treasury assets and potentially hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. It’s not just a one-off transaction; it’s part of a pattern of increasing confidence in digital currencies. Why Are Companies Making Significant Bitcoin Investments? The decision by companies like SWC to allocate a portion of their balance sheets to Bitcoin isn’t arbitrary. It’s often driven by a confluence of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, the search for uncorrelated assets, and the belief in Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. Here are some key reasons: Inflation Hedge: With global quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, many corporations view Bitcoin as a digital equivalent to gold – a scarce asset that can preserve purchasing power over time. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it inherently deflationary, appealing to investors looking for assets not subject to traditional monetary policy. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer diversification away from fiat currencies and traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Future-Proofing: As the world becomes increasingly digital, embracing cryptocurrencies can be seen as a forward-thinking move, positioning a company at the forefront of financial innovation. These compelling reasons contribute to the growing trend of corporate crypto investment , making headlines and influencing market dynamics. The Growing Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption SWC’s latest acquisition is not an isolated incident but rather a testament to a broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Companies globally, ranging from tech giants to traditional financial institutions, are increasingly exploring or actively holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has been a trailblazer in this space, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC and openly advocating for its adoption as a corporate treasury asset. Tesla, Square (now Block), and various investment funds have also made significant forays into Bitcoin, validating its status as a legitimate asset class. This institutional embrace lends significant credibility to Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market. It moves Bitcoin beyond being just a speculative retail asset to a recognized component of corporate financial strategy. The increasing liquidity and regulated products surrounding Bitcoin also make it more accessible and appealing for larger entities. Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings on the Market When a company like Smarter Web Company makes a substantial BTC purchase , it sends ripples through the market. Such large-scale acquisitions can: Boost Confidence: They signal to other corporations and retail investors that Bitcoin is a viable and valuable asset, potentially encouraging further investment. Reduce Circulating Supply: By holding Bitcoin off exchanges in corporate treasuries, these purchases effectively reduce the liquid supply available for trading, which can exert upward pressure on prices, especially in a supply-constrained asset like Bitcoin. Enhance Legitimacy: Each corporate adoption step helps normalize Bitcoin, moving it closer to mainstream financial acceptance and potentially paving the way for more favorable regulatory environments. Increase Volatility (Potentially): While generally positive, large corporate movements can also contribute to market volatility, especially if a company decides to sell a significant portion of its holdings. However, most institutional players are focused on long-term holding strategies. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone monitoring the pulse of the crypto market and anticipating future trends in crypto investment . Navigating the Future of Corporate Crypto Investment The decision by Smarter Web Company to further expand its Bitcoin holdings underscores a strategic outlook on digital assets. For companies considering similar moves, careful consideration of market volatility, regulatory landscapes, and long-term objectives is paramount. It’s not just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about integrating a new asset class into a comprehensive financial strategy. Looking ahead, we can anticipate more companies exploring digital assets as part of their treasury management strategies. The continued development of regulatory frameworks, coupled with increasing institutional infrastructure, will likely make it even easier and more appealing for corporations to engage with cryptocurrencies. The narrative around Bitcoin is shifting from a niche technology to a globally recognized, strategically important asset. Conclusion: A Bold Statement in the Digital Age The Smarter Web Company’s latest acquisition of 230.05 BTC, bringing their total to 773.58 BTC, is more than just a financial transaction. It’s a powerful statement of confidence in the future of decentralized finance and the enduring value of Bitcoin . This move aligns SWC with a growing cohort of forward-thinking corporations that are recognizing and acting upon the transformative potential of digital assets. As the digital economy continues to evolve, such strategic investments by established companies like Smarter Web Company will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the financial landscape of tomorrow.

The offering runs from July 1 to July 28 and is limited to professional clients in Italy. Europe has not approved local spot Bitcoin ETFs; banks are turning to structured products as alternatives. UniCredit will offer a structured investment product tied to BlackRock ’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, according to a report published on July 1. The bank’s five-year certificate is denominated in U.S. dollars and includes full capital protection at maturity. Returns are capped at 85% of the ETF’s performance, and the minimum investment is $25,000, according to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg and confirmed by UniCredit. First Bitcoin ETF Structured Product for Italian Investors Based on the report, the offering is limited to professional clients in Italy and will run from July 1 to July 28. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, approved in the U.S. in January 2024, has since grown to $75 billion in assets. BlackRock also launched a separate Bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe earlier this year. “We are seeing increasing interest from professional investors in instruments tied to emerging asset classes such as cryptocurrencies,” said Chicco di Stasi, head of Group Investment Product Solutions and Equity & Credit Sales and Trading at UniCredit. “With this product, we offer our professional clients a distinctive solution —the first of its kind in Italy,” said di Stasi.

Intesa Sanpaolo conducted its first spot Bitcoin purchase in January and operates a trading desk. Banco Santander is considering digital asset services for retail clients through its online platform. The UniCredit certificate represents one of the first examples of a major eurozone bank packaging exposure to a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETF for local clients under structured terms. Its structure, offering capital protection with capped upside, is a cautious approach to client demand for digital asset exposure within a regulated product framework. It also shows how ETF-linked strategies are being adopted by banks to meet growing interest in Bitcoin without direct ownership or wallet infrastructure. European regulators have yet to approve their own spot Bitcoin ETFs. Structured certificates tied to foreign ETFs are emerging as a workaround. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the implications of offering capital-protected crypto products? Capital protection appeals to risk-averse investors and signals an effort to normalize crypto within traditional finance. It also reflects caution around volatility while still engaging with digital asset demand. How does linking a European product to a U.S. ETF work under regulation? By tying returns to a U.S.-based ETF, banks can structure exposure without relying on unapproved local crypto products. This workaround aligns with current EU restrictions on spot Bitcoin ETFs. What does this mean for broader bank adoption of crypto-linked instruments? It indicates a measured shift. Traditional institutions are more likely to offer wrapped or hybrid products before committing to full-scale crypto offerings, especially in uncertain regulatory environments.

GDLC holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, with BTC and ETH comprising over 91% of the portfolio. The conversion introduces one of the first SEC-approved multi-asset crypto ETFs in the U.S. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved Grayscale Investments’ request to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into a spot exchange-traded fund, according to a filing issued on July 1. NEW: There's the approval order for @Grayscale 's $GDLC to convert into an ETF. This is their Digital Large cap fund that holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. Final deadline was tomorrow https://t.co/jSt1HBWD3E pic.twitter.com/9kALeDD2Uh — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 1, 2025 The fund, which holds a basket of digital assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano, was initially launched in 2018 as a closed-end investment product for accredited investors. Grayscale Expands ETF Lineup According to the holdings data , Bitcoin and Ethereum account for the bulk of the fund’s portfolio, with a combined weight of over 91%. Bitcoin comprises 79.9% and Ethereum 11.3% of the portfolio, while XRP, Solana, and Cardano make up the remaining allocation. The fund’s composition is based on market capitalization and is subject to quarterly rebalancing, reflecting relative shifts in asset size and liquidity. With the conversion, GDLC will become a publicly traded ETF offering broader exposure to multiple crypto assets under a single structure. The SEC’s approval came a day before the final deadline for review. GDLC will join the firm’s existing lineup of converted products, following the approval of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) in January 2025. The ETF structure allows daily share creation and redemption, potentially reducing the premium and discount issues that affected GDLC as a closed-end fund. SEC Greenlights ETF Tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, and More While spot Bitcoin ETFs have drawn institutional inflows in 2024, multi-asset crypto ETFs remain less common in U.S. markets. Grayscale’s GDLC conversion introduces one of the first regulated products tracking a broader set of digital assets, subject to periodic rebalancing. Grayscale has also stated that any asset subject to enforcement action may be removed from the index during rebalancing. Trading for the converted ETF is expected to begin shortly, pending final operational readiness and exchange coordination. The approval brings attention to how multi-asset crypto funds are built and monitored. Unlike single-token ETFs, these products face questions about asset inclusion, index calculation, and handling of tokens flagged by regulators. With more issuers exploring bundled crypto exposure, regulators and fund managers may need to set clear rules on portfolio structure, rebalancing practices, and disclosure requirements. GDLC’s conversion could mark the start of a broader move toward regulated multi-asset offerings.

2025-07-01T19:00:25,"Bitcoin Price Risks Market Crash After Closing Below Final Weekly Resistance","Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has warned about a potential crash for the Bitcoin price, after the flagship crypto closed below a critical resistance level. The analyst also highlighted the level that BTC needs to reclaim to invalidate this bearish setup. Bitcoin Price Risks Crash With Weekly Close Below Resistance In an X post, Rekt Capital revealed that the Bitcoin price has closed below the final major weekly resistance at around $108,890. Based on this, he remarked that a possible early-stage Lower High resistance may be developing at around $107,720, with BTC at risk of crashing. The analyst added that Bitcoin will need to reclaim $108,890 as support on the daily to invalidate this Lower High. Related Reading: Pundit Warns Bitcoin Is Setting Up Liquidity Traps As It Campaigns For New ATHs In an earlier X post, Rekt Capital highlighted how significant it would have been if the Bitcoin price had closed above this final major weekly resistance. He noted that BTC had never performed such a weekly close. As such, if that had happened last week, he claimed it would not only be “historic” but would enable BTC to enjoy a new uptrend into new all-time highs (ATHs). However, the Bitcoin price now appears to be on a downtrend, having failed to hold above the $107,720 level successfully. BTC had reached an intraday high of $107,970 but has since then been on a decline and is now at risk of losing the $106,800 macro level. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has warned that BTC being below this level puts it in the danger zone. Meanwhile, based on historical bull market cycles, Rekt Capital has suggested that the Bitcoin price still has some more upside left. In an X post, he stated that history suggests that Bitcoin may end its bull market in two to three months. BTC Still Fuel In The Tank Despite the recent Bitcoin price drop, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto declared that the flagship crypto still has fuel in the tank. He claimed that the weekly market structure remains strong with a series of higher highs and higher lows. The analyst added that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is pushing towards its trendline.

2025-07-01T19:00:00,"SEC eyes single-track crypto ETF listings in quiet talks with exchanges","A little-known SEC consultation could scrap months of bureaucratic delays for crypto ETFs. Instead of dual filings, issuers may soon need just an S-1 and patience, setting the stage for an unprecedented wave of listings. FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett has uncovered early discussions between SEC officials and major exchanges about creating standardized listing rules for crypto ETFs. The potential overhaul could fundamentally change how these funds reach the market. Instead of navigating the bureaucratic maze of 19b-4 approvals, issuers might only need to file an S-1 registration and endure a 75-day waiting period. What’s catching industry observers’ attention is what exactly will qualify a token for this fast-track process. While SEC officials remain tight-lipped, multiple sources familiar with the talks suggest the criteria will likely focus on hard metrics like market cap, trading volume, and liquidity thresholds. These requirements could make or break many proposed crypto ETFs before they even reach the starting line. Per Terrett, the securities watchdog declined to comment when pressed for details. 🚨SCOOP: The @SECGov is in the early stages of creating a generic listing standard for token-based ETFs in coordination with exchanges. The thinking, I’m told, is that if a token meets the criteria, issuers could skip the 19b-4 process, file an S-1, wait 75 days, and the… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) July 1, 2025 You might also like: Bybit launches its MiCA-compliant platform for users in Europe A regulatory shift born of necessity? For an agency often criticized for its incrementalism, the SEC’s apparent willingness to consider a standardized path for token ETF listings marks a rare concession to operational reality. The move follows years of mounting pressure from asset managers, lawmakers, and even courts questioning the agency’s inconsistent treatment of crypto products, causing clogged filing pipelines and extensive back-and-forth with issuers. The current dual-filing system, which requires both an S-1 registration and a 19b-4 exchange rule change, has long been criticized as redundant, often adding months of unnecessary delays. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s landmark legal victory last summer, which forced the SEC to reconsider its spot Bitcoin ETF denials, exposed the regulatory arbitrage at play. Now, with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already trading, the agency appears to be preemptively structuring a clearer path for the next wave of funds, before another courtroom showdown forces its hand. This effort comes as crypto ETFs have evolved from niche products to mainstream contenders, with global assets under management surpassing $90 billion this year. But the SEC’s case-by-case approvals, often mired in repetitive disclosures and last-minute revisions, have struggled to keep pace. The proposed single-track system suggests the agency is acknowledging an unavoidable reality: crypto ETFs are here to stay, and manual vetting of every filing is unsustainable. By offloading initial eligibility checks to exchanges, regulators could focus on systemic risks rather than paperwork. The move mirrors the SEC’s 2020 “ETF Rule” modernization, which simplified traditional ETF launches, but with a critical twist. Unlike conventional funds, crypto ETFs face unique custody, valuation, and market manipulation risks, meaning any new standards will need to address these concerns head-on. If implemented, the changes could trigger a gold rush among mid-tier asset managers previously deterred by the cost and complexity of the 19b-4 process. However, the devil lies in the undisclosed listing criteria.

2025-07-01T18:50:43,"Strategic Bitcoin ETF Acquisition: Sixty Six Capital Boosts Crypto Holdings to 126.8 BTC","BitcoinWorld Strategic Bitcoin ETF Acquisition: Sixty Six Capital Boosts Crypto Holdings to 126.8 BTC In a significant move that underscores the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, Sixty Six Capital , a prominent investment firm listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), has announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin holdings. This strategic acquisition highlights the firm’s commitment to expanding its exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, particularly through regulated investment vehicles like a Bitcoin ETF . If you’ve been watching the crypto space, you know that institutional participation is a key indicator of market maturity, and this latest development from Sixty Six Capital certainly adds another layer to that narrative. What’s Driving Sixty Six Capital’s Bold Bitcoin ETF Strategy? On June 30, Sixty Six Capital revealed in a press release that it had acquired an additional 96,000 units of BTCC.B, a well-known Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Traded Fund. This latest purchase translates to approximately 13.5 BTC, a notable addition to their portfolio. For those unfamiliar, BTCC.B is an ETF that provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This makes it an attractive option for institutional players like Sixty Six Capital, who seek regulated and accessible pathways into the digital asset space. The firm’s decision to deepen its investment in a Bitcoin ETF like BTCC.B isn’t just a random act; it aligns perfectly with their stated focus on crypto and AI assets. This move demonstrates a clear long-term vision, positioning them to capitalize on the potential growth of both sectors. It’s a calculated step that reflects confidence in Bitcoin’s future trajectory and its role within a diversified investment portfolio. How Does This BTC Investment Impact Their Crypto Holdings? This recent acquisition significantly bolsters Sixty Six Capital ‘s overall digital asset exposure. With the addition of 13.5 BTC, the firm’s total BTC investment -equivalent holdings have now surged to an impressive 126.8 BTC. To put this into perspective, this isn’t just a small speculative play; it represents a substantial commitment to Bitcoin as a core asset. The consistent accumulation of Bitcoin, especially through a regulated product, signals a strategic approach to managing their crypto holdings . It suggests that the firm views Bitcoin not merely as a volatile speculative asset, but as a legitimate store of value and a potential hedge against traditional market uncertainties. This growing treasury of Bitcoin could also serve as a foundational asset for future ventures or strategic partnerships within the crypto ecosystem. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Holdings on the Rise? Sixty Six Capital ‘s move is part of a broader trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption. Investment firms, corporations, and even some sovereign wealth funds are beginning to allocate portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Why? Several factors are at play: Accessibility: Bitcoin ETFs like BTCC.B offer a regulated and familiar investment vehicle, removing the complexities of direct crypto custody and management. Inflation Hedge: Many institutions view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, given its finite supply and decentralized nature. Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets can offer portfolio diversification benefits. Maturing Market: The cryptocurrency market is becoming more regulated and liquid, making it more palatable for institutional capital. This growing confidence from major players is a crucial indicator for the wider market, often preceding broader retail adoption and infrastructure development. The more institutions enter, the more legitimacy and stability the crypto market gains. The Strategic Play of a Crypto Investment Firm Sixty Six Capital is not just any firm; it’s a crypto investment firm that explicitly targets both crypto and AI assets. This dual focus positions them at the forefront of two of the most transformative technologies of our time. Their latest Bitcoin acquisition is a testament to their belief in the long-term value proposition of digital assets, especially Bitcoin, which is often seen as the foundational layer of the crypto economy. Their strategy appears to be one of consistent accumulation during market opportunities, leveraging regulated products to minimize operational risks. This methodical approach is a stark contrast to the more speculative retail trading often seen in the crypto space, highlighting a sophisticated understanding of market dynamics and long-term value creation. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? While the acquisition is positive, the crypto landscape is not without its challenges. Market volatility remains a key concern, and regulatory uncertainty in various jurisdictions can impact sentiment. However, for a firm like Sixty Six Capital , these challenges also present opportunities. Dips can be seen as accumulation opportunities, and clearer regulations could pave the way for even greater institutional inflows. The opportunity lies in being an early mover in a rapidly evolving asset class. By building substantial crypto holdings now, Sixty Six Capital is positioning itself to benefit significantly from future market appreciation and the continued mainstreaming of digital assets. Actionable Insights for Investors What can individual investors learn from Sixty Six Capital ‘s strategic move? Consider Diversification: Explore how digital assets, even a small allocation, might fit into your long-term portfolio strategy. Research Regulated Products: For those uncomfortable with direct crypto ownership, explore Bitcoin ETF s or other regulated investment vehicles available in your region. Long-Term Vision: Institutional moves often reflect a long-term perspective, emphasizing holding over short-term trading. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on institutional adoption trends as they often signal market maturity and future growth areas. A Compelling Future for Institutional Crypto Sixty Six Capital ‘s recent acquisition of 13.5 BTC via the BTCC.B ETF is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal. It underscores the growing confidence among sophisticated investors in Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset class. As a dedicated crypto investment firm , their strategic accumulation of institutional Bitcoin holdings reflects a proactive approach to capturing future growth in the digital economy. This move, increasing their total crypto holdings to 126.8 BTC, reinforces the narrative that digital assets are steadily becoming a staple in modern investment portfolios, moving from the fringes to the mainstream.

In a new interview with CNBC, Ark CEO Cathie Wood shares her outlook on the US economy. “Well, I think we have been climbing a wall of worry. I mean, a lot of people expected tariffs and wars and the controversy between the Fed and the President to really shake markets up. And of course, there has been some volatility. But these are the kinds of bull markets that I think are the most durable, when the market climbs through all of that controversy. It’s really signaling something. And I think the things that it’s signaling are: interest rates probably are coming down. And I think what many people are not focused on in the inflation statistics are the housing numbers. And they get in there with a long lag. We think that the shift, or the concentration toward just a very few stocks– which was a very unhealthy bull market – that is changing, and the market is broadening out. And I think deregulation is probably one of the most important things that this administration is doing to unleash animal spirits.” When asked what she thinks about opposing views – that the economy is doing fine – Wood points to housing and manufacturing numbers before making her prediction that this will all transition smoothly into a recovery. “Well, I think we’ve been pretty consistent on this idea that we’ve been through a rolling recession. If you look at housing, which is actually having a little bit of a relapse today, housing plummeted in 2022 when interest rates shot up, and it has not recovered. Manufacturing has not recovered. And so we do believe that they will recover as interest rates come down, deregulation takes hold, and some certainty about tax cuts and so forth occurs – including immediate expensing, perhaps, of capital goods, which would be very positive. So we think we’ll move from a rolling recession into a recovery.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-01T18:40:45,"Ethereum ETF Staking: SEC’s Crucial Delay Fuels Market Uncertainty","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Staking: SEC’s Crucial Delay Fuels Market Uncertainty The cryptocurrency world holds its breath as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once again hits the pause button on a pivotal decision. This time, it’s the highly anticipated Bitwise proposal to include staking in its spot Ethereum ETF , a move that could reshape how investors access the second-largest digital asset. The news, initially reported by @PhoenixNewsIO on X, highlights the regulatory body’s cautious approach, which also saw a postponement for the 21Shares spot Dogecoin ETF. What does this mean for the future of crypto investments, and why is the SEC taking its time? What’s the Latest on the Ethereum ETF Staking Proposal? For months, the crypto community has been buzzing with anticipation surrounding the approval of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds. Following the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, many believed Ethereum would be next in line. However, the path for Ethereum appears to be fraught with additional complexities, primarily due to its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and the integrated concept of staking. Bitwise, a prominent asset manager, submitted a unique proposal that sought to incorporate a staking component into its spot Ethereum ETF. This means that, if approved, the ETF would not only hold physical Ethereum but also stake a portion of it to earn yield, potentially passing those returns on to investors. This innovative approach aims to offer a more comprehensive exposure to Ethereum’s ecosystem. The SEC’s latest move, a delay in its decision, indicates a need for more time to thoroughly review the implications of such a structure. Why is the SEC Decision Taking So Long? The SEC’s prolonged deliberation on the Bitwise Ethereum ETF with staking is not entirely unexpected. The agency operates under a mandate to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. When it comes to novel financial products like crypto ETFs, especially those involving staking, the SEC faces several unique challenges and concerns: Investor Protection: The SEC scrutinizes whether investors fully understand the risks associated with staking, including smart contract vulnerabilities, slashing penalties, and the illiquidity of staked assets. Market Manipulation: Concerns persist about the potential for manipulation in the underlying spot markets for cryptocurrencies, even with Ethereum’s significant market capitalization. Custody and Security: Staking introduces additional layers of complexity regarding the custody of assets and the security protocols required to protect staked ETH. Classification of Staking: A fundamental question for the SEC is whether staking rewards or the act of staking itself constitutes a security offering under U.S. law, which would bring it under a different regulatory framework. The approval process for a spot Bitcoin ETF was relatively straightforward in comparison, as Bitcoin operates on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism without staking. The transition of Ethereum to PoS adds a new dimension that the SEC must carefully evaluate. Key Differences: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum ETF Approval Process Feature Bitcoin Spot ETF Ethereum Spot ETF (with Staking) Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Yield Generation No inherent yield generation Staking offers yield Regulatory Complexity Primarily market manipulation concerns Market manipulation, staking classification, custody of staked assets Precedent Grayscale court ruling was pivotal New territory for staking within ETFs Broader Implications for the Crypto ETF Landscape The SEC’s cautious stance extends beyond Ethereum. The simultaneous delay of the 21Shares spot Dogecoin ETF application underscores a broader regulatory hesitancy towards a wider range of digital assets. While Bitcoin’s approval created a precedent, it did not open the floodgates for all cryptocurrencies. Each asset and its unique characteristics, particularly its consensus mechanism and associated activities like staking, are subject to individual scrutiny. This ongoing delay for the Crypto ETF applications could mean a slower, more deliberate rollout of diversified crypto investment products in the U.S. It signals that the SEC is not simply rubber-stamping applications but is taking a measured approach to ensure regulatory clarity and investor protection in a rapidly evolving market. Diving Deeper into the Bitwise Ethereum Proposal Bitwise Asset Management has been a proactive player in the crypto ETF space, being one of the first to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF and now pushing the boundaries with its Ethereum staking proposal. Their strategy is to offer investors not just exposure to the price movements of ETH but also the potential to earn passive income through staking rewards, mirroring the benefits of directly holding and staking Ethereum. The inclusion of staking in an ETF product presents significant operational and regulatory hurdles. How would the staking rewards be managed? What are the tax implications for investors? How would the ETF ensure liquidity for redemptions if a significant portion of its ETH is locked up in staking? These are complex questions that Bitwise and the SEC are likely grappling with during this review period. The success of the Bitwise Ethereum ETF with staking could set a crucial precedent for future yield-bearing crypto products in the traditional finance world. The Complexities of ETH Staking and Regulatory Scrutiny ETH staking is a fundamental aspect of Ethereum’s post-Merge network. It involves locking up ETH to support the network’s security and operations, for which participants earn rewards. While attractive for its passive income potential, integrating staking into a regulated ETF product introduces several layers of complexity: Benefits of Staking for Investors (if integrated into an ETF): Passive Income: Potential to earn yield on ETH holdings, enhancing overall returns. Network Security: Contributing to the stability and security of the Ethereum network. Accessibility: An ETF could make staking accessible to traditional investors without the technical complexities of self-staking. Challenges for ETFs Incorporating Staking: Liquidity: Staked ETH is typically locked for periods, impacting the ETF’s ability to meet redemptions. Slashing Risk: Penalties for validators’ misbehavior could lead to loss of staked ETH. Centralization Concerns: Large institutional stakers could raise concerns about network decentralization. Regulatory Classification: The ongoing debate whether staking rewards constitute unregistered securities. The SEC’s decision will likely hinge on how these challenges are addressed and whether the proposed structure adequately protects investors from the unique risks associated with ETH staking within a regulated product. Market Reaction and Future Outlook The market’s reaction to the latest delay has been relatively muted, as such postponements have become a common occurrence in the crypto ETF approval saga. However, the underlying sentiment remains one of cautious optimism. Analysts generally anticipate that spot Ethereum ETFs will eventually gain approval, though the timeline for those including staking remains highly uncertain. Many experts point to May 2024 as a critical window for a final SEC decision on several spot Ethereum ETF applications, including those from VanEck and Ark Invest/21Shares, though these do not currently include staking. The Bitwise proposal with staking adds another layer of complexity that might require more time. Investors should brace for continued volatility and further delays as the SEC navigates this uncharted regulatory territory. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts While the wait for a spot Ethereum ETF with staking continues, here are some actionable insights for those interested in the crypto market: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on SEC filings and announcements from asset managers. Regulatory developments are key drivers of market sentiment. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between pure spot ETFs and those with staking components. Each carries different risk profiles and potential benefits. Consider Direct Staking (with caution): For those comfortable with the technical aspects and risks, direct ETH staking remains an option, but understand the implications of locking up your assets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t place all your investment hopes on a single regulatory approval. The crypto market offers a vast array of opportunities. A Glimpse into Tomorrow: The Evolving Crypto Landscape The SEC’s decision to delay the Bitwise Ethereum ETF staking proposal is a reminder that the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance is a gradual, complex process. While frustrating for some, these delays underscore the regulatory body’s commitment to due diligence in a nascent yet rapidly maturing asset class. The eventual approval of such products, especially those incorporating yield-generating mechanisms like staking, would mark a significant milestone, opening doors for broader institutional and retail adoption. The journey towards fully regulated and innovative crypto investment vehicles continues, characterized by a delicate dance between technological advancement and regulatory prudence. The crypto market remains dynamic, promising both challenges and immense opportunities for those who stay informed and adaptable.
