2025-07-02T18:50:08,"Design Giant Figma Goes Public, Reveals $70M Bitcoin ETF Holdings and $30M Ready to Buy More","Design software giant Figma has filed for its initial public offering with the SEC, revealing substantial Bitcoin exposure, including $69.5 million in Bitcoin ETF holdings and an additional $30 million earmarked for future cryptocurrency investments. The company’s S-1 filing mentions Bitcoin 21 times, while strongly highlighting crypto as a core component of its treasury strategy alongside traditional marketable securities. BULLISH: @figma just disclosed $69.5M in spot #Bitcoin ETFs in its SEC IPO filing – with board approval to buy $30M more. This isn’t a crypto company. This is a mainstream tech brand holding $BTC on its balance sheet. Adoption is happening quietly, but at the highest levels. pic.twitter.com/zmTrRyuyqj — ︎ Teo Mercer (@TeoMercer) July 2, 2025 Initially, Figma’s Board of Directors approved a $55 million investment in Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF on March 3, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, the position was valued at $69.5 million. The company subsequently authorized another $30 million Bitcoin investment on May 8, 2025, purchasing USDC as an intermediate step to stabilize the investment before converting to Bitcoin at an optimal time. Figma will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker “FIG” with Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen & Company, and J.P. Morgan serving as joint lead book-running managers. The offering size and pricing remain undetermined pending market conditions and SEC approval processes. Corporate Bitcoin Strategies Evolve Through ETF Adoption Figma’s approach involves a hybrid strategy that combines direct Bitcoin ownership and ETF exposure. As mentioned above, the company has invested $55 million in the Bitwise ETF. The subsequent purchase will be made with $30 million in Bitcoin, with the USDC stablecoin serving as a strategic positioning tool for optimal Bitcoin entry timing. This methodology enables treasuries to avoid Bitcoin’s volatility while maintaining readiness for favorable purchasing opportunities. Figma’s risk disclosures acknowledge the impact of Bitcoin ETF volatility, noting that a 10% decline in Bitcoin prices would result in a $7 million reduction in the fair value of its investment. “ A hypothetical 10% decrease in the price of the Bitcoin exchange traded fund would decrease the fair value of this investment as of March 31, 2025 by $7.0 million ,” the filing said. The company emphasizes that unrealized losses are related to Bitcoin price movements rather than credit-specific factors, thereby avoiding the recognition of expected credit losses. Corporate Bitcoin adoption has accelerated dramatically, with 141 companies now holding 849,245 BTC, worth $91 billion at current prices of $107,144. Source: BitcoinTreasuries However, most corporations opt for direct Bitcoin ownership through treasury management rather than ETF exposure, as seen in Figma’s approach. The design software company’s filing coincides with broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, including UniCredit’s structured Bitcoin ETF product for Italian professional clients , which offers capital protection features. With no local spot Bitcoin ETFs approved, UniCredit’s certificate offers a controlled entry point into digital assets. #btcetf #italy https://t.co/c5uT0P0oMS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 These developments, particularly the strategic corporate accumulation of Bitcoin, indicate growing institutional interest in regulated Bitcoin exposure. In fact, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts spot Bitcoin ETFs could collectively hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated 1.1 million BTC within one year. If the trend persists for a year, the current ETF inflows suggest institutional accumulation may exceed individual holdings exponentially. Regulatory Clarity Drives ETF Innovation and Adoption The filing arrives as the SEC streamlines crypto ETF regulations through new guidance issued July 1 . The new SEC’s guideline for token-based ETFs establishes structured disclosure frameworks that benefit companies like Figma, which seek regulated exposure to cryptocurrency. The SEC has issued new guidance to clarify crypto ETF filings, aiming to streamline approvals for token-based exchange-traded products. #CryptoETFs #SEC https://t.co/gshzi1Qa55 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 2, 2025 New requirements cover net asset value calculations, custody practices, service provider selection, and potential conflicts of interest for crypto ETF issuers. The regulatory framework enables generic listing processes that could allow qualifying crypto ETPs to bypass traditional 19b-4 rule changes. Exchanges may list crypto ETFs after 75-day reviews, significantly reducing time-to-market for new products and expanding investment options. Notably, Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund conversion to spot ETF status demonstrates regulatory progress toward multi-asset cryptocurrency funds. The fund, which has been approved, holds Bitcoin (79.9%), Ethereum (11.3%), as well as XRP, Solana, and Cardano. This provides diversified crypto exposure through a single, regulated vehicle. This development is not isolated to Bitcoin. Similarly, Bloomberg analysts assign 95% approval odds for Solana, Litecoin, and XRP spot ETFs to arrive in the second half of 2025, with approval for a crypto index ETF possible this week. Bloomberg ETF analysts have sharply raised expectations for US approval of spot funds tracking Solana, Litecoin, and XRP. #ETFs #XRP https://t.co/dKK2ZIbW8c — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Over 70 cryptocurrency ETFs currently await SEC review, spanning various digital assets beyond Bitcoin. In fact, the REX Osprey Solana Staking ETF launched on Wednesday as the first US-listed fund to incorporate crypto staking. The ETF was approved after meeting SEC requirements, which included a 40% allocation to overseas exchange-traded products.

2025-07-02T18:45:16,"Bitfinex Warns Momentum Fading for Bitcoin, Hints at Local Top Rather Than Vertical Acceleration for BTC","The research arm of a top crypto exchange thinks Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be losing momentum. In a new research report , Bitfinex notes that BTC’s broader market structure remains healthy, with longer-term support levels still standing. Current data, however, suggests the top crypto asset is heading into a transition phase, according to the exchange. “Both order flow data and on-chain metrics are now aligning to suggest consolidation or a local top, rather than continued vertical acceleration. Spot volume has cooled, taker buy pressure has weakened, and profit-taking has intensified – especially among short-term holders who rode the move from sub-$80,000 levels.” BTC is trading at $105,864 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 1% in the past 24 hours. Bitfinex’s researchers argue that Bitcoin could witness short-term price upticks but will likely remain range-bound until it sees a significant surge in new demand. “For now, Bitcoin is in a waiting game. Structural positioning remains intact, and there’s no major breakdown risk as long as $94-99,000 holds. But for new all-time highs to be reclaimed, a catalyst, either in the form of macro relief, strong ETF flow momentum, or a breakout in global liquidity, will be necessary.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-02T18:42:29,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF now earns more annual fees than its S&P 500 ETF","BlackRock is making more money from Bitcoin than from the S&P 500. No one expected it to happen this fast, but now it has. The $75 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is generating more annual fee revenue than the $624 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). The numbers are clear: IBIT brings in $187.2 million a year, just above the $187.1 million IVV earns. This comes from Bloomberg data calculated as of July 1. The reason this is happening? Fees. IBIT charges a 0.25% expense ratio, while IVV only charges 0.03%. And despite being almost nine times smaller, IBIT has drawn steady inflows in 17 out of the last 18 months, mostly from a mix of regular investors and huge institutions. BlackRock didn’t say anything when asked to comment, but the revenue shift speaks for itself. Bitcoin fund takes control of ETF cash Since spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, IBIT has pulled in $52 billion out of the $54 billion in total inflows across all Bitcoin ETFs. That gives it control of more than 55% of the total market, based on Bloomberg’s figures. It’s already one of the top 20 ETFs by trading volume. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said this showed how much investors wanted easy Bitcoin access without dealing with new platforms. “It’s an indication of how much pent-up demand there was for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin as part of their overall portfolio without having to open a separate account somewhere else,” he said. Hickey also pointed out how Bitcoin has completely outpaced smaller altcoins in how it’s seen by investors, as the clear store of value. Nate Geraci, president at NovaDius Wealth Management, said IBIT passing IVV in revenue shows two things: people want Bitcoin, and stock ETF fees are shrinking. “Although spot Bitcoin ETFs are priced very competitively, IBIT is proof that investors are willing to pay up for exposures they view as truly additive to their portfolios,” Nate said. The IBIT and IVV combo could help BlackRock pass State Street in overall ETF trading. Right now, BlackRock handles 25% of ETF trading by dollar volume, with State Street ahead at 31%, based on Bloomberg Intelligence numbers shared by Athanasios Psarofagis. Bitcoin’s rise has also been backed by Wall Street, especially Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has spent billions buying the coin outright. Hedge funds are also going after convertible debt linked to Strategy, using trades that involve shorting the stock while holding the bonds. Bitcoin stays stable while traders adjust But while the money keeps flooding in, Bitcoin’s price hasn’t been moving much lately. In the last two months, it’s been stuck in a range between $93,000 and $111,000, one of the tightest stretches in years. It was trading at around $108,480 on Wednesday, up about 2.4%. The low volatility is a major change from the wild swings of past years, when the price could move 5% or more in a single day. This quiet period is backed by the Deribit BTC Volatility Index, which tracks expected 30-day price swings. It’s now at the lowest level in two years. Source: Deribit Michael Longoria, a research analyst at GSR, said this signals a change in how Bitcoin is viewed. “Bitcoin is becoming less speculative and more akin to a volatile macro asset,” he said. With volatility down, traders looking to profit from big moves are seeing fewer chances. Some investors have shifted to writing call options on Bitcoin they already own, which gives them some income while limiting how far the price can move. David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, said this kind of trading is now common. “These are kind of covered call overwriting strategies, and they basically have the effect of lowering volatility,” David said. He added that in the past, most options investors were looking for leverage and quick upside. But now, more are focused on controlling risk and earning steady returns. This calmer market fits with who’s in control now. A report from Glassnode shows that while transaction volume is going down, settlement value is going up. That means fewer trades, but each one carries more value. More high-net-worth players are holding large positions, while individual traders are stepping back.

2025-07-02T18:41:49,"Peter Thiel and Billionaire Consortium To Launch New Bank Serving Cryptocurrency Startups: Report","PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and a handful of other tech billionaires are reportedly launching a new bank partially dedicated to serving crypto startups. According to a new report from Financial Times, Thiel and other investors – such as the CEO of military contracting company Anduril – to create a bank called Erebor, which references to popular fantasy series The Lord of the Rings. FT says the billionaires intend for the bank to serve crypto startups and take the place of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a crypto-friendly bank that ended up going bankrupt in 2023. However, the Erebor plans to lend traditionally as well. As stated by the bank in its public application to acquire the necessary licenses to operate in the US, according to FT, “The bank will be a national bank… providing traditional banking products, as well as virtual currency-related products and services, for businesses and individuals.” FT says the bank will focus on key industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), defense, manufacturing, digital assets as well as non-US companies looking to access the US banking system. People close to the matter say that Thiel and others have been mulling over launching Erebor since the collapse of SVB, which was the go-to bank for crypto firms for many years. According to the report, Erebor also said in its application filing that it would be looking to “differentiate itself” by serving those who “are not well served by traditional or disruptive financial institutions, in particular with respect to insufficient access to credit.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-02T18:32:38,"Top Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Predictions as of Late","TL;DR Despite being on a downtrend, SHIB has caught the attention of crypto analysts and even NBA legend Scottie Pippen, with predictions of a 40% rally and signs of a classic trend reversal forming. The lead developer Shytoshi Kusama teased multiple upcoming announcements, fueling speculation that July could be successful period for the meme coin. The Next Potential Targets Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a substantial resurgence on a couple of occasions last year, but it currently trades far below those peaks. As of this writing, the self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer is worth roughly $0.00001136, meaning a 33% decline on a yearly scale. Still, it remains the subject of bullish price predictions. Earlier today (July 2), the X user Dami-Defi argued that SHIB “bounced off key daily support and broke its local downtrend.” The analyst described this as a “classic reversal setup,” envisioning a 40% spike to as high as $0.00001600. For their part, the X user PumpSwap Alpha expects a price explosion in the short term: I’m anticipating a major move on $SHIB soon. The pump feels overdue. Like this if you believe Shiba Inu is about to explode in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/tw8lhQmwR7 — PumpSwap Alpha (@PumpswapAlpha) June 30, 2025 It is worth noting that the NBA legend Scottie Pippen also put his name among the optimists. He recently asked his more than 700,000 followers on X which cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin (BTC) they are bullish on, saying his picks include SHIB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, and other well-known altcoins. This isn’t the first time Pippen has shown interest in assets different than BTC. In May, he claimed that the altcoin season “is here,” shifting his attention toward SHIB, XRP, ETH, SOL, ADA, and more. The Calm Before the Storm? Important elements that could trigger a price ascent for SHIB are potential partnerships that the project may ink in the near future or groundbreaking disclosures involving its ecosystem. Earlier this week, Shytoshi Kusama said on X that the community should be prepared for “many announcements, releases, and discussions around everything we’ve built thus far and where we see the future going.” Some of the people commenting on the post took this as a positive sign that the ongoing month could be highly successful for the meme coin. However, only time will tell whether this will be the case.

2025-07-02T18:30:18,"Crypto Thefts Soar To $2 Billion In 2025, Breaking Records And Trust–Report","Crypto theft has hit a record in the first half of 2025. Over $2.1 billion vanished in at least 75 hacks and exploits. That total tops the previous H1 high set in 2022 by about 10% and almost matches every dollar stolen in all of 2024. Major Theft Figures Revealed According to a TRM Labs report , hackers walked off with roughly $2.1 billion between January and June. They struck 75 separate times. That breaches the H1 2022 mark by about 10% and nearly equals the full‑year haul from 2024. Losses hit over $100 million in January, April, May and June. Those months show this threat isn’t limited to a one‑off event. Bybit Breach Overshadows All The largest single loss was the $1.5 billion February breach at Dubai‑based Bybit exchange. That attack alone accounted for nearly 70% of losses this year. It set the average size of hacks to nearly $30 million, twice the $15 million H1 2024 average. Even excluding Bybit , heists in excess of $100 million continue to occur. State Actors Driving Theft According to analyses, North Korea‑linked groups are behind about $1.6 billion of all stolen funds so far. That’s roughly 70% of the total. Experts say these thefts feed into the country’s sanction‑evasion schemes and weapons programs. At the same time, June 18 saw a roughly $90 million hack of Iran’s largest exchange, Nobitex. Security firms link that attack to Predatory Sparrow, a group said to work for Israel. They moved money into addresses with no private keys, hinting at a symbolic motive. Attack Methods And Security Steps Reports show infrastructure hacks —like private‑key thefts, insider jobs and front‑end hits—accounted for over 80% of stolen funds in H1. Those breaches tend to be about 10 times larger than attacks on smart contracts. Protocol exploits, such as flash‑loan and re‑entrancy bugs, made up another 12%. Smart contracts still carry risk, but they get patched faster than hidden back‑door or insider schemes. Industry experts say the rise in state‑backed thefts calls for stronger measures. Cold storage should be the norm. Multi‑factor authentication must cover all critical accounts. Frequent audits are a must. Beyond those basics, teams need insider‑threat programs and social‑engineering training. Global law enforcement, financial intelligence units and blockchain‑forensics firms like TRM Labs need to work closer than ever. Sharing alerts fast and tracing funds across borders can clamp down on these giant thefts. It’s a tall order, but as crypto grows more tied to national security, so does the need for a united defense.

2025-07-02T18:25:45,"Trump’s One Big Beautifl Bill TLDR: Good or Bad for Bitcoin?","There has been a notable uptick in crypto crowd chatter following the Senate’s passage of US President Donald Trump’s sweeping “One Big Beautiful Bill,” with Vice President JD Vance breaking a 50-50 tie. Santiment reported a measurable increase in the social volume of the words “big,” “beautiful,” and “bill.” This means that crypto traders are actively linking market outlooks to the bill’s potential policy shifts. While the legislation itself offers no direct crypto provisions, the on-chain analytics platform noted that the traders appear to be positioning for possible ripple effects. These include broad tax cuts and consumer spending incentives that could fuel a “risk-on” sentiment favorable for Bitcoin and altcoins. Bill’s Depreciation Incentives Attract Miners The bill’s return of 100% bonus depreciation is another underreported aspect Santiment flagged as potentially bullish for Bitcoin mining. This is because it allows firms to immediately write off mining equipment purchases. Such a move is expected to incentivize rapid ASIC deployment and potentially increase Bitcoin’s hash rate. Historically, higher hash rates align with bullish cycles, particularly during monetary expansion. As such, the report noted that if looser fiscal policy intersects with rising M2 supply, crypto assets may see upward momentum. Despite market optimism, Santiment highlighted disappointment following the failure to include Senator Cynthia Lummis’ proposed amendment. The amendment aimed to address staking, mining, and microtransaction tax complications, an omission many in the industry had pushed for over the weekend. Overall, the social sentiment is still skewed bullish. Traders are mostly anticipating potential indirect benefits to crypto investments as tax cuts on overtime and tips put more disposable income into circulation. Certain others, however, remained cautious as the bill’s deep spending cuts to healthcare and green energy have triggered market anxieties, which even led to tensions between Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The latter had publicly criticized the bill and hinted at political realignment. When tracking the social reactions to this conflict, Santiment found a slight dip in Bitcoin prices mirroring Tesla’s decline. This reflected the continued correlation between Tesla stock movements and crypto market reactions during significant political events. Additionally, Dogecoin entered the narrative as traders referenced Musk’s previous humorous support through the so-called DOGE department. His current remarks warned that the bill could damage future-focused companies, further adding to volatility in sentiment. “Sell the Rumor, Buy the News” Patterns Emerge The social metric analysis suggests that while the Senate’s passage of the bill has not yet translated into significant price rallies for Bitcoin or major altcoins, the crowd mood has shifted toward cautious optimism, which is consistent with “sell the rumor, buy the news” behavior often seen in crypto markets. The ongoing legislative process is expected to influence crypto market sentiment depending on how political negotiations evolve, particularly around the potential impact on fiscal spending, Treasury markets, and Federal Reserve liquidity actions. While direct crypto wins were absent in the Senate version, the broader implications of consumer liquidity, policy volatility, and fiscal-monetary interactions will remain critical watchpoints for traders seeking to position around the “Big Beautiful Bill” narrative in the coming weeks.

(ATXG) has announced a new non-binding agreement to purchase a total of 12,000 Bitcoin, revising the 8,000 BTC purchase plan it announced in May. This potential acquisition is worth approximately $1.3 billion at current prices. The company said in a statement today that the acquisitions will be financed through the sale of ATXG shares, which are traded on Nasdaq. However, details of the plan remain unclear. Addentax said the final agreement is subject to signing, a comprehensive due diligence process being completed and necessary approvals being obtained. Addentax said, “This specification sets the preliminary framework for the planned acquisition and is not a binding contract.” The company explained that critical details such as how many BTC will be purchased, how many shares will be issued, and share pricing have not yet been determined. Despite this, management continues to intend to allocate significant resources to its long-term Bitcoin investment strategy. Related News: Renowned Economist Robert Kiyosaki Says, “Bitcoin Seems Very Expensive Right Now, But I'm Still Buying It,” and Explains Why However, Addentax’s market value remains below $7 million as of today, according to Google Finance data. The company’s plans to make a crypto investment of this scale have raised questions among investors, with its shares trading below $1 for over a year. Experts point to the potential risk of share dilution and volatility. The company’s past crypto ventures have also attracted attention. In May, it announced that it had held an acquisition talks worth around $800 million with “influential” crypto representatives, including memecoin investors named TRUMP, but stated that no binding agreement had been made at the time. Addentax, a textile company, is one of the latest to join the ranks of companies planning to create cryptocurrency reserves. However, some observers argue that such statements can sometimes be used to boost company stocks. The 2017 Long Island Iced Tea company’s name change to Long Blockchain Corp. and the explosion of its stock price remains one of the most remembered examples of this. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-02T18:05:45,"Trader Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says Only ‘Small Sliver’ of Time Left in Bull Market – Here’s His Timeline","An analyst who nailed Bitcoin’s pre-halving correction last year is warning that BTC ‘s current bull market cycle may be nearing an end soon. The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 108,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical precedence, Bitcoin may reach a cycle peak within just a few months. “If we’re talking about September, October, with it just being July now – July, August, September, and then October – that’s already two to three months, potentially, that we have left in this bull market.” The analyst says that based on other market cycles, Bitcoin is probably about 88% of the way through its current bull run , meaning that risk is asymmetrically skewed to the downside for BTC. “If we’re thinking about this being the entire cycle that we’ve already seen in terms of upside, from bear market bottom to bull market top, and potentially this additional upside, potentially over a period of two to three months extra, then it just showcases to us that maybe we have a very small sliver of time and price expansion left versus the price expansion and time that we’ve already seen elapse over the course of this cycle, which comes down to that 88% figure.” Source: Rekt Capital Looking at his chart, the trader suggests Bitcoin may soar somewhere near $140,000 before reaching the cycle’s high. Rekt Capital notes that some analysts are suggesting this cycle may be different from prior ones and run for longer, but such theories will have to be tested when the time is right.

2025-07-02T18:00:34,"Bitcoin Finds Support Above 50-Day SMA, But Next Direction Remains Uncertain","Bitcoin is holding steady above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), showing signs of underlying strength despite a lack of clear directional momentum. With rising trading volume and mixed technical indicators, the next move could swing either way, keeping the market on edge. RSI Holds Neutral As Bitcoin Awaits A Clearer Signal According to Shaco AI, in a recent update on X, Bitcoin is currently hovering around $107,264.17, positioning itself just above two key moving averages. It’s nudging the 25-day SMA at $107,229.82 and holding slightly above the 50-day SMA, which sits at $107,040.81. This positioning reflects a mild bullish bias in recent sessions, keeping both bulls and bears on alert. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Market Crash After Closing Below Final Weekly Resistance Looking at momentum indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is resting at 53.36—firmly in neutral territory. This suggests that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold at the moment, offering no strong directional clues as it keeps the market guessing. Furthermore, the Average Directional Index (ADX) adds to this indecisive mood, coming in at a soft 20.44. This low reading signals a weak trend, meaning there’s not enough force from bulls or bears to drive a clear breakout just yet. In other words, the market isn’t leaning heavily in either direction. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains in negative territory at -137.33. Although it isn’t signaling any strong downward momentum, traders may want to stay cautious and alert for any sudden shift in the current tone. Despite the technical indecision, market activity is picking up. Bitcoin’s recent trading volume has surged to 1903.51, well above the average of 1522.43. This uptick signals a rise in interest and participation, indicating that traders are actively positioning themselves in anticipation of Bitcoin’s next move. Critical Zones At Play As Market Prepares For A Directional Push Looking at key levels, Shaco AI highlighted that resistance is at $108,789.99, which seems to be a strong level to overcome. The level marks a significant ceiling for Bitcoin, and any attempt to push higher will need solid momentum to break through. On the other hand, support lies at $104,622.02. This support level will be critical in case the price begins to retreat, as a breakdown here could open the door for further downside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $110,000: Why BTC Must Break Out Of This Wedge Based on current indicators, the analyst suggests it’s wise to keep an eye out for potential movement in either direction.

2025-07-02T17:59:43,"Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin Could Hit $200K by Year-End","Analysts at Standard Chartered believe Bitcoin may be gearing up for its biggest dollar rally yet . According to the bank’s H2 2025 market outlook, Bitcoin could climb to $135,000 by September 30 and reach $200,000 by the end of December. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s global head of digital assets research, highlighted rising demand from crypto funds and corporate treasuries as major factors. He also cited favorable government policies as a key driver of Bitcoin’s expected growth. Strong Inflows from ETFs and Treasuries Drive Optimism Kendrick pointed out that strong inflows into Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and growing interest from companies are now driving Bitcoin’s price. In the second quarter of 2025, spot ETFs and corporate treasuries bought 245,000 BTC. Large companies, excluding those in the Strategy Sector, purchased around 56,000 BTC. Meanwhile, the Virginia-based firm added nearly 69,000 BTC during the same period. Kendrick noted that while Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, has slowed its pace, other firms are stepping in to fill the gap. He expects even more crypto assets to be bought in the third quarter than in the second. If his forecast is correct, Bitcoin would gain over $92,000 in just six months, rising from its current price of $107,644. This would mark a record-breaking second-half performance in the cryptocurrency’s 15-year history. Investors Turning to Bitcoin as a Macro Asset Standard Chartered analysts explained that in Q2, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $12.4 billion in assets. This is more than gold ETFs, despite global tensions, especially in the Middle East. Kendrick sees this as a sign that investors are seeing the top coin more seriously as a store of value . He also noted that hedge funds have not significantly increased their short positions. This shows that investors are confident in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Traditionally, Bitcoin peaked around 500 days after its “halving” event and then declined. Kendrick believes that the cycle no longer applies, saying that ETFs and corporate buyers, which did not exist in earlier years, are now driving prices. He noted that long-term holders are likely to sell less in 2025, and continued buying will overpower any selling pressure. Policy Changes That Could Boost Bitcoin Kendrick pointed out possible policy changes that could give Bitcoin an extra push. He said that if President DonaldTrump announces a new Federal Reserve Chair early, it might lead to faster interest rate cuts. This move could raise Bitcoin’s price. Furthermore, if the GENIUS stablecoin bill, which now has bipartisan support , is passed into law soon. This would make dollar-backed tokens more popular and attract more retail investors, which would also help Bitcoin. Kendrick said Bitcoin’s price has followed long-term U.S. bond yields since early 2024 and expects this to continue. Additionally, new 13F filings suggest that big investors, including sovereign wealth funds, are buying Bitcoin. Kendrick expects this buying to increase in the next filings in August, which could push the price higher.

The agreement uses an at-the-market (ATM) share issuance structure, allowing Green Minerals to raise funds flexibly over a 12-month period. Flexible Capital Structure to Minimize Dilution The deal includes a put option that lets Green Minerals issue new shares based on market conditions. This provides capital access when needed while helping maintain shareholder value and minimizing unnecessary stock dilution. Meanwhile, LDA Capital receives a call option, enabling it to subscribe for up to 1% of the company’s shares at NOK 6.95 each at any point over the next year. A Strategic Push Toward Bitcoin Accumulation At current market rates, if Green Minerals raises the full $25 million, it could acquire around 232.34 BTC. As of now, the company holds approximately four Bitcoins but aims to significantly expand this figure through targeted funding strategies. BTC is currently recovering, approaching the $107,000 mark with a recent high of $107,724. This aligns with Green Minerals’ bullish stance on Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Leadership Sees Bitcoin as Core to Growth Executive Chairman Ståle Rodahl called the LDA deal a “strategic mechanism to fund growth,” emphasizing the importance of flexibility and resilience in a volatile market.

2025-07-02T17:40:49,"Did Elon Musk Really Invest $104B in XRP? The Truth Unveiled","In the world of crypto, few names generate as much interest—or confusion—as Elon Musk. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Musk's Twitter posts have notoriously sent cryptocurrencies soaring or crashing, and his public musings about Bitcoin and Dogecoin are the stuff of legend. But in June of 2025, a new wave of speculation washed over the crypto space: that Musk would be investing a whopping $104 billion into Ripple's XRP. The news spread like wildfire, causing people to discuss it, causing prices to fluctuate, and creating a flurry of social media posts. But is this rumor genuine, or is this yet another example of crypto's rumor mill gone wild? The Beginning of the Musk-XRP Rumor The latest craziness began when certain crypto news aggregators and social handles started sharing headlines asserting Elon Musk wasn't just interested in XRP, but was going to invest a mind-boggling $104 billion in the token. Others even cited ”insider sources” or stated leaked documents suggested Musk's intention to use XRP as the basis for his payment strategies on X (formerly Twitter) or Tesla. Musk rumors are discredited fact-checked by reputable crypto news outlets shortly after. There is no such valid information, Crypto Times says, that Musk plans or has invested in XRP. The $104 billion, in particular, appears to be a hoax, most likely stemming from previous speculations or misinterpreted tweets. “There is no official confirmation, filing, or credible report that Elon Musk is investing $104 billion—or any sum remotely close—into Ripple’s XRP.” — Crypto Times, June 2025 Why Do Musk Rumors Move Markets? Elon Musk's influence on crypto markets is the stuff of legend. His tweets about Bitcoin's energy usage, to mention just one example, have wiped out billions in market cap overnight. His fondness for Dogecoin turned a meme coin mainstream. So when rumor associates Musk with a new token or initiative, traders and bots react instinctively, sometimes before verifying the information. The XRP rumour was not unique. Within hours, #ElonMuskXRP was trending on Twitter, and leveraged trading volume exploded. Some XRP traders were celebrating, while others insisted on a normal ”buy the rumor, sell the news.” Fact Check: What's Actually True? No Official Investment : No SEC filing, company press release, or credible source confirms any Musk investment in XRP. No Public Endorsement : Elon Musk has never tweeted about XRP, nor has he publicly endorsed Ripple or its token anywhere in recent history. Viral Rumor Misinformation : The $104B figure also appears to be recycled rumor fuel, promoted by social media algorithms and clickbait headlines. Crypto Times and other mainstream publications enhance the importance of skepticism and research, especially when rumors involve celebrity figures like Musk. Why XRP Still Matters—With or Without Musk Despite the false rumor, XRP remains one of the most widely traded cryptocurrencies on the planet. Ripple's aggressive expansion to grow its On-Demand Liquidity network, achieve regulatory clarity, and work with banks maintains real-world adoption momentum. The Musk rumor, as false as it may be, did serve to highlight just how quickly sentiment can shift—and just how much attention XRP continues to attract. Conclusion The Elon Musk-XRP saga is the ultimate text book demonstration of what happens when rumors, hype, and Twitter converge in crypto. While the idea of a $104 billion investment was great copy, reality—the way it so often does in crypto—was much less dramatic. For investors and hobbyists alike, the lesson is straightforward: make sure to check your facts before you FOMO, and let's face it here, the world of digital assets is one where not everything that's trending is real.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9783/did-elon-musk-really-invest-104-b-in-xrp-the-truth-unveiled,"XRP|MARKET|SPONSORED|BTC|DOGE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T17:30:00,"Top Cryptos That Could Outperform Bitcoin (BTC) This Summer","While Bitcoin holds the spotlight, a quiet reshuffling is happening beneath the surface. A new wave of altcoins is drawing investor focus, not with headlines, but with traction. Leading that charge is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a $0.03 DeFi upstart gaining speed fast enough to put legacy tokens on notice. Buyers who invest at this moment will see 100% returns on investment as soon as the token gets listed. Over $11.4 million has been raised so far, and there are over 12,600 early investors. By the time the presale reaches Phase 6, the token price will be at $0.035, a 16.67% immediate return on any stage 5 investment. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, continues its recovery path, stable, scalable, and favored by builders, making it a solid if more measured play. But as summer liquidity builds and market sentiment shifts, the real upside appears to be with Mutuum Finance. Solana’s Edge Over Bitcoin This Summer Solana (SOL) is currently trading $150, and its DeFi and the app ecosystem is growing ambitious fast. It is also making an impact in the institutions: U.S. banks have been collaborating with Solana, and a potential launch of Solana-focused ETFs presupposes further penetration of the mainstream. Bitcoin (BTC), at about $107,385, still has a tight range, with the wind of the ETF now following it, yet developments in the Solana environment and developer activity continue to lead indicators that the asset is yet set to perform better than Bitcoin this summer. Comparisons to legacy assets notwithstanding, when positioned against BTC, Solana is more of an apples to oranges task in proving valuable enough to trade in, this as all eyes remain on other emerging coins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Disrupts DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing DeFi lending with a platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. There are also the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the users to agree on terms among themselves. This direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users climb the ranks they will be rewarded in bonus tokens token holding fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. Long-Term Built, Audited, and Now Backed by $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into measurable credibility. A rigorous smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry’s most trusted security firms, has confirmed that the codebase meets high standards for transparency and safety, offering assurance to both investors and users. To further shore up its ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on an Ethereum-based fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to USD. In contrast to the algorithmic models, which are susceptible to depegging, the current stablecoin is programmed to launch long-lasting liquidity, stability, and dependability to the retail and institutional users. Bitcoin grabs attention, but real gains may lie elsewhere. Solana shows steady growth, yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight, $11.4M raised, 100% ROI locked in for Phase 5 buyers, and major traction in DeFi.

Despite having just $52 billion in AUM — a fraction of IVV’s $624 billion in total assets — IBIT’s higher fee structure has turned it into a bigger moneymaker for the world’s largest asset manager. Bloomberg estimates that IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. That means it generates around $187.1 million in annual fees, despite managing roughly nine times more in assets than IBIT. IBIT launched in January 2024 as part of a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs approved by U.S. regulators. Since then, the fund has seen inflows every month except one, amassing $52 billion in assets to date. That makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market by a wide margin. The rapid growth of IBIT highlights the ongoing demand for regulated bitcoin investment products, particularly those offered by established financial firms like BlackRock. For investors, the appeal lies in gaining exposure to bitcoin without the technical hurdles or security risks of holding the asset directly. While IBIT’s management fee is higher than more traditional ETFs, it reflects the added complexity, custody and regulatory requirements involved in offering exposure to a digital asset like bitcoin.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/02/blackrock-s-bitcoin-etf-now-generates-more-revenue-than-its-flagship-s-and-p-500-fund,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin ETF|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T17:29:18,"Bitcoin nears $110K after breaking previous resistance, TIA leads altcoin gains","Bitcoin showed strength after struggling early on Wednesday, as it neared the $110,000 level after trading above $109,000 as market participants adopted a cautious stance, resulting in subdued trading activity. The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation hovered around $3.4 trillion, showing little directional bias. Bitcoin briefly retreated to $105,560 during early Asian hours after failing to clear resistance the previous day, while the Crypto Fear & Greed Index edged down to 63, still in the “Greed” zone but reflecting a slight dip in sentiment. Altcoins fared no better, with most managing to pull off modest single-digit gains as of late Asian trading hours on July 2. Why is Bitcoin stuck? Bitcoin powered past the previous resistance zone of $108,000 as the general market sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam. The deal includes a 20% tariff on all imports from Vietnam to the US. Over the past seven days, Bitcoin has been stuck between a narrow trading range of $105,430 – $108,706 as traders awaited a potential catalyst to break the deadlock. Some of the caution was warranted, as a series of high-impact US economic data releases are scheduled this week, keeping risk appetite in check. The tone was set by the ADP private payrolls report released on Wednesday, which showed a surprise decline of 33,000 jobs in June, which marked the first monthly contraction in two years and sharply missed market expectations for a 90,000–100,000 gain. The weakness, particularly in services and professional sectors, raised concerns over the strength of the US labour market and added to fears of a broader economic slowdown. Bitcoin briefly spiked following the ADP print, pushing toward the upper end of its range near $108,000 as traders speculated on a more dovish Fed response. Investors are now bracing for the official non-farm payrolls data due on Thursday, which is expected to confirm the cooling trend in employment. Forecasts suggest around 110,000–120,000 new jobs added in June, with the unemployment rate seen ticking up to 4.3%. The market will also be watching the ISM services PMI and the release of the FOMC meeting minutes for further clues on the Fed’s policy direction. There’s also the looming July 9 deadline for the White House’s tariff decision, which could reintroduce volatility across risk assets if trade tensions escalate. Until there’s more clarity on the macro front, traders are likely to remain sidelined. Further weighing on sentiment, US spot Bitcoin ETFs ended a 15-day inflow streak on Tuesday with $342.2 million in net outflows. This marked the first sign of institutional pullback after over $4.7 billion poured in since June 9, and retail traders often view this as a bearish sign. Signs of fading risk appetite were also noticeable across derivatives markets, with the BTC Binance futures premiums falling to a 21-month low of 3.9% today. Will Bitcoin go up? Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at just 3.5% below its all-time high, which means the broader bullish structure remains intact. When looking at the Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap, a significant cluster of liquidation interest remains concentrated just above the $105,000 level. Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. To the upside, the heatmap shows a dense buildup of short liquidation levels between $107,800 and $109,000. As such, Bitcoin must decisively break and hold above $109,000 to unlock further upside and trigger a liquidation cascade that could fuel a breakout rally. In the meantime, on X, most market commentators were expecting a retest of all-time highs soon. See below.

According to pseudonymous analyst StefanB, if Bitcoin fails to maintain strength above $108,900, a level he marks as a key short-term pivot, the current rally could turn into a deviation. 4-hour BTC/USDT perpetual contract chart.

Altcoin market The total market cap of all altcoins rose 3.2% to $1.29 trillion over the past day. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index at 22 means much of the action is limited to Bitcoin, which remains the dominant market force at the time. Large-cap altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) saw gains ranging between 1 and 5%. Meanwhile, Celestia, Sonic, and SPX6900 led gains, rising 6.6%, 6.1% and 5.5% respectively. See below: Source: CoinMarketCap Celestia: TIA printed modest gains late in the day after Celestia’s latest mainnet upgrade, Lotus, was successfully deployed on the Mocha testnet.

2025-07-02T17:27:09,"Analysis Company Shares July Expectations for Bitcoin and Altcoins – Will They Continue to Sleep, or Will the Giant Awaken?","July may continue to be a historically low-volume month for cryptocurrency markets, despite the intense political and economic agenda. According to a new report by Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33 Research, this summer could be as quiet as previous years. Recalling that July is a volatile period in the US, referred to as the “Trump trade,” Lunde drew attention to important agenda items such as the budget bill, resumption of tariff decisions, and crypto-related executive order calendars. However, despite all these potential price movements, past Julys were also notable for low-volume trading periods. “In July 2022, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius went bankrupt. Last year, there were events such as the assassination attempt on Trump and Biden's resignation. During the same period, BTC distributions from Mt.

Despite all this, the second lowest monthly trading volume in the last four years was seen in July,” Lunde said, adding that the market went into a kind of “sleep” in the summer months.

July 4: The “One Big Beautiful Bill” budget bill, which President Trump is expected to sign and could increase the U.S. budget deficit to $3.3 trillion, could come into effect. This could have a short-term positive impact on digital assets such as Bitcoin, which are limited in supply. July 9: 90-day tariff moratorium ends. Trump is expected to take new trade measures against certain countries. This could put pressure on markets. July 22: Final assessment and proposal submission date for the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), which was signed in March and planned to be created with approximately 200,000 BTC (approximately $21 billion) of US seized crypto assets. The fact that details about this reserve have not been shared with the public since March increases uncertainty. Lunde warned investors that an announcement could be made on this issue at any time. Although Bitcoin is only 3% off its all-time high, funding rates, leveraged ETF exposures, trading volumes and options data reflect a cautious market stance, a factor that reduces the risk of sudden liquidations in potential uptrends, according to Lunde. “It may seem lazy to assume that this summer will be as quiet as previous years. But my current base case is that nothing new is happening. So the best strategy is to remain patient and hold onto existing positions,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-02T17:15:51,"When Will Bitcoin’s Price Reach its Top This Cycle? Analysts Give Key Insights","Long-term Bitcoin holders are seeing their unrealized profits decline even as BTC trades a little over 4% from its all-time highs. According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant, the average unrealized profit for long-term holders, based on the MVRV ratio, is around 220%. The figure is notable but lower than the 300% and 350% levels seen during the March and December 2024 market peaks. LTH Profits Slide The realized price for long-term holders now stands at $39,000, which means that significant gains are still present despite the decline in unrealized profits. Moreover, the current profit levels are similar to those last seen during the October 2024 correction, which further indicates that while BTC remains strong, the market has yet to reach peak profit extremes. To match previous cycle tops, CryptoQuant said that Bitcoin would need to climb toward $140,000, a level many are anticipating. As Bitcoin trades near $107,000, market participants are preparing for a period that has historically brought slower activity and new narratives. According to crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades, the cryptocurrency has entered the third quarter of 2025, a period historically known for slow price action and lower volumes. Summer months typically bring reduced liquidity for both BTC and ETH, which makes Q3 the quietest quarter of the year. However, Daan noted that this slower period often sets the stage for new narratives to emerge, which could present new opportunities ahead for traders. This aligns with Bitfinex experts, who said that the bull run is intact, but expect Q3 to be slower Weaker Momentum? While seasonal patterns are in play, one concerning factor is Bitcoin’s Bull Score, which has moved into neutral territory at 50. The metric gauges market conditions needed to continue a rally, and requires a reading of 60 or higher for upward momentum to continue. As such, a reading of 40 would indicate a bearish environment. The current neutral level suggests that the leading crypto asset lacks sufficient bullish strength to support a sustained price rally at this stage.

Open interest in perpetual futures listed on offshore exchanges rose by nearly 10% to $26.91 billion, the highest single-day increase since March 2, according to data source Velo. The data tracking website included activity in USD and USDT-denominated perpetuals listed on Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, and Hyperliquid. Open interest refers to the number of active or open contracts, often expressed in terms of their cumulative dollar-denominated value. An uptick in open interest alongside a price rise is said to confirm the uptrend. BTC's price surged over 3.5% to $109,600 due to a host of factors, including the disappointing U.S. ADP jobs report, which strengthened calls for Fed rate cuts, Trump's trade deal with Vietnam, and the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK). Furthermore, the perpetual funding rates of BTC and ETH rose slightly from an annualized 5% to over 7%, suggesting renewed demand for leveraged bullish plays.

2025-07-02T17:00:15,"Bitcoin Bounces Off Key Demand Level – Price Discovery On The Menu?","Bitcoin has experienced heightened volatility over the past few days, moving between critical levels as market participants await a clear breakout or breakdown. After testing $105,000 as support, BTC rebounded strongly and pushed back toward the $109,000 resistance zone—an area that has capped upward momentum for several weeks. While bulls remain in control of the broader structure, price action continues to show hesitation just below the all-time high, leaving the market in a state of uncertainty. Related Reading: Solana Hits New Milestone: Wallets Holding 0.1+ SOL Reach Record High To confirm the next leg of the long-term trend, Bitcoin needs to break into price discovery territory above $112,000 with strong volume and follow-through. Until that happens, the current range-bound conditions could persist, especially as traders weigh macro factors and profit-taking activity increases. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis pointing to another strong bounce from the 50-day moving average and exponential moving average (MA/EMA) cluster, key dynamic support levels that have repeatedly triggered bullish reactions. This bounce reinforces the underlying strength in the current trend, suggesting that buyers continue to step in at crucial levels. As long as BTC holds above this support zone, the path toward a breakout remains intact—but confirmation is still needed. Bitcoin Prepares For Expansion Phase Bitcoin appears poised to enter a new expansive phase, with a breakout above its all-time high potentially triggering a fresh wave of bullish momentum, not just for BTC, but for the broader crypto market. After weeks of grinding just below the $112,000 resistance level, Bitcoin has struggled to push decisively higher. However, the structure remains bullish, and buyers have consistently defended key demand zones around $105,000. This ability to maintain higher lows during a period of consolidation signals strong market control by the bulls. According to Jelle, Bitcoin has just seen another powerful bounce from the 50-day moving average and exponential moving average (MA/EMA) cluster—an area that has historically acted as a dynamic support zone. Each time BTC has touched this cluster in recent months, it has rebounded with renewed strength, and the latest bounce is no exception. Jelle believes this reaction confirms the uptrend remains intact, with conditions aligning for a breakout. “The trend is up—new all-time highs are very much on the menu this week,” Jelle noted, emphasizing the importance of sustained momentum above current resistance. If Bitcoin can close decisively above $112K, it would likely ignite a surge in altcoins, many of which have lagged during BTC’s dominance-driven phase. With bulls maintaining control and technical support holding firm, the market is now watching for confirmation that Bitcoin is ready to enter price discovery once again. A successful breakout could mark the beginning of the next major leg in the crypto cycle.

The 12-hour chart shows a series of failed breakouts above the $109K level in recent weeks, highlighting the strength of this resistance zone. However, bulls have continued to defend higher lows, maintaining overall market structure and preventing deeper corrections. The latest candle shows a 1.93% surge, reclaiming the 50- and 100-period moving averages around $106,000, a key short-term cluster that previously acted as support. Volume also picked up during this bounce, suggesting renewed buying interest as Bitcoin tries to establish bullish momentum.

2025-07-02T17:00:14,"SEC Releases New Crypto ETF Rules That Affect XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Others","In a pivotal regulatory update, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued new guidance detailing disclosure requirements for issuers of crypto asset exchange-traded products (ETPs). This move directly affects offerings linked to XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other digital assets. The announcement, made by the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance on July 1, 2025, aims to strengthen investor protections and provide clarity around the application of existing securities laws to spot crypto ETFs. The development was highlighted by XRP Chancellor on X, and it signals a major step toward integrating crypto more securely into traditional financial markets. As interest in spot crypto ETFs continues to surge, this guidance provides a clearer framework for how issuers must present information about these investment products to the public. BREAKING: SEC RELEASES NEW GUIDANCE FOR CRYPTO SPOT ETFs. DISCLOSURE RULES CLARIFIED FOR ISSUERS OF $XRP , $BTC , $ETH & MORE! pic.twitter.com/hAjeKdwqX3 — XRP Chancellor (@xrpchancellor) July 2, 2025 New Standards for Crypto ETF Disclosures According to the SEC, crypto ETPs, often structured as trusts holding digital assets directly, must comply with disclosure obligations under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although these products are not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, they are still subject to anti-fraud provisions and the same core disclosure principles that apply to traditional securities. Issuers must now provide detailed and asset-specific information on the front page of their prospectuses. This includes a summary of the investment objective, the type of crypto asset held, how it’s managed, and how its value may change over time. The SEC emphasizes that each crypto asset is unique, and disclosures must reflect the particular characteristics and risks of the underlying asset. For example, issuers offering XRP-backed ETFs must identify any relevant legal risks, such as the historic SEC v. Ripple Labs litigation , and clearly explain XRP’s underlying blockchain technology, use case, and potential vulnerabilities. This level of specificity is also expected for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and any other digital asset included in a spot ETF. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Protection and Market Confidence The SEC’s guidance also requires a discussion of risk factors that may impact the trust and the value of its crypto holdings. These include price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, cybersecurity risks, and possible weaknesses in the underlying blockchain network. Issuers must also disclose whether the trust anticipates selling crypto assets over time to cover operating expenses, which could reduce the value of the ETF shares. This renewed focus on transparency aims to foster investor confidence and protect market integrity as crypto products become increasingly mainstream. The SEC reiterated that generic or boilerplate disclosures are not sufficient. Each ETF must offer tailored, fact-based information that reflects the realities of the specific crypto asset it tracks. Implications for XRP and the Broader Market This regulatory update is especially meaningful for XRP, which recently gained access to SEC-regulated investment vehicles after years of legal uncertainty . As XRP Chancellor noted, the new rules not only provide a path for wider adoption of XRP-based ETFs but also set a precedent for how the SEC may approach future crypto-linked investment products. With this guidance, the SEC has laid the groundwork for safer, more transparent crypto investing, marking another key milestone in the evolving relationship between digital assets and Wall Street.

Standard Chartered, a renowned financial institution, has just dropped a bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that’s sending ripples across the entire market. They’re not just bullish; they’re projecting an astonishing climb for Bitcoin (BTC) to hit $135,000 by Q3 and a staggering $200,000 by year-end. This isn’t just a hopeful guess; it’s a meticulously crafted Standard Chartered forecast underpinned by significant market shifts. What’s Driving This Bold Standard Chartered Forecast? Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s astute head of digital asset research, is the man behind this groundbreaking projection. His analysis, widely reported by Cointelegraph, points to several powerful catalysts that are reshaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. Gone are the days when post-halving corrections were the primary concern; new demand dynamics are now firmly in the driver’s seat. The Power of Spot Bitcoin ETFs One of the most significant factors fueling this bullish outlook is the sustained inflow into Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Since their approval, these investment vehicles have revolutionized how institutional and retail investors access Bitcoin. Unlike previous cycles where direct crypto exchange purchases were the norm, ETFs provide a regulated, familiar pathway for traditional finance players to gain exposure to BTC. This has unlocked a torrent of new capital, creating unprecedented demand pressure. Institutional Access: ETFs simplify compliance and custody, making Bitcoin a viable asset for large funds and wealth managers. Retail Convenience: Everyday investors can now buy Bitcoin exposure through their brokerage accounts, often with lower fees and greater security. Liquidity Boost: The massive inflows enhance Bitcoin’s market liquidity, making it more attractive for larger trades. The Rise of Corporate Treasury Adoption Beyond ETFs, another pivotal driver is the growing trend of corporate treasury adoption . More and more companies are beginning to view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate reserve asset for their balance sheets. This strategic move is often driven by a desire to hedge against inflation, diversify holdings, or simply capitalize on Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. When a major corporation allocates a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin, it signals immense confidence and sets a precedent for others to follow. Think about companies like MicroStrategy, which pioneered this trend. Their continued accumulation of Bitcoin demonstrates a strong belief in its future value. As more corporate treasuries consider this strategy, the demand for BTC will only intensify, creating a robust floor for its price and propelling it upwards. Understanding Bitcoin’s Unique Market Dynamics Kendrick’s observation about Bitcoin diverging from typical post-halving corrections is crucial. Historically, Bitcoin has often experienced a price dip or consolidation period shortly after its halving events, as the market adjusts to the reduced supply of new BTC. However, this cycle appears different. The sheer volume of new demand generated by Spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing corporate treasury adoption seems to be overriding these historical patterns. The crypto market outlook is therefore shifting from one dominated by retail speculation and supply shocks to one increasingly influenced by institutional capital and strategic corporate allocations. This maturation of the market suggests a more stable, yet powerfully upward, trajectory for Bitcoin. Key Differences in This Cycle: To illustrate the divergence, consider these points: Feature Previous Cycles (Typical Post-Halving) Current Cycle (Post-Halving 2024) Primary Demand Driver Retail speculation, hype, FOMO Institutional inflows via ETFs, corporate treasury adoption Market Reaction to Halving Initial consolidation or correction Sustained demand overriding typical correction Market Maturity Nascent, highly volatile, less regulated Growing institutionalization, clearer regulatory pathways What Does This Mean for Investors and the Crypto Market Outlook? This bold Bitcoin price prediction from Standard Chartered underscores a significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape. It suggests that Bitcoin is no longer just a fringe asset but is rapidly integrating into mainstream finance. For investors, this could mean continued growth potential, but it also highlights the importance of staying informed about market dynamics. Benefits and Opportunities: Validation: A major bank’s bullish stance lends significant credibility to Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Growth Potential: The $200K target indicates substantial upside for current and prospective holders. Market Maturation: Increased institutional involvement can lead to greater stability and reduced volatility over time, though short-term swings are always possible. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Despite institutional adoption, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Price movements can be rapid and unpredictable. Regulatory Landscape: While improving, regulatory clarity remains an ongoing challenge in various jurisdictions. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rates, and geopolitical events can still influence Bitcoin’s price. Actionable Insights: Given this exciting forecast and the evolving crypto market outlook , what should you consider? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news regarding ETF inflows, corporate adoption announcements, and macroeconomic indicators. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin’s potential is high, a diversified portfolio remains a prudent strategy for managing risk. Long-Term View: Standard Chartered’s prediction is for year-end, suggesting a long-term perspective is beneficial for capitalizing on such growth. Understand Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose. While the outlook is positive, no investment is without risk. A Compelling Future for Bitcoin Standard Chartered’s audacious Bitcoin price prediction of $200,000 by year-end is more than just a number; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system. Fueled by the relentless demand from Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the strategic embrace of corporate treasury adoption , Bitcoin appears poised for an unprecedented ascent. This cycle is indeed different, with new, powerful demand drivers dictating the market’s rhythm. As the crypto market outlook continues to mature, Bitcoin’s journey promises to be one of the most fascinating financial stories of our time.

2025-07-02T16:40:12,"Bitcoin Rebounds Toward $110K, Presaging What Could Be a Volatile July","Bitcoin BTC is bouncing hard towards $110,000 on Wednesday, shrugging off Tuesday's brief risk-off wave that dragged the price below $106,000. Recently, the largest crypto traded at its strongest price since June 11, around $109,500, up 3.5% over the past 24 hours. The action came as Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam, helping risk assets across the board. The Nasdaq at midday is ahead 0.8%. Under the deal, the U.S. will impose a 20% tariff on goods from Vietnam and a 40% levy on transshipped goods—products routed through Vietnam on their way to the U.S. U.S. exports, in turn, will face no tariffs when entering the Vietnamese market. Boosting crypto sentiment specifically could be the debut of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK), the first such crypto staking product available in the U.S. ""Volume in $SSK now at $20M, which is really strong, top 1% for a new launch,"" wrote Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas a short while ago . Balchunas noted that SOLZ — a futures-based SOL ETF that opened for business in March — did just $1 million of volume on its first day of trade. July could be big (in either direction) July is shaping up to be a potentially volatile month for bitcoin, driven by Trump administration's policies, according to Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33. Trump is expected to sign a controversial expansionary budget bill dubbed the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" by Friday. The bill, which could widen the U.S. deficit by $3.3 trillion, is seen by some as bullish for scarce assets like BTC, Lunde said. Another key date looming is the July 9 tariff deadline, which could see more aggressive trade posturing from Trump. Thirdly, July 22 is the final deadline for action on long-awaited crypto executive order, with potential updates on the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. ""July is crowded with latent Trump volatility,"" Lunde said. Still, crypto markets are relatively calm without excessive froth, he noted. ""There are few reasons to expect a massive broad deleveraging of the crypto market, as crypto-leverage remains contained,"" he said. ""This favors maintaining spot exposure and staying patient as we progress into a period well known for its seasonal apathy.""",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/02/bitcoin-rebounds-toward-110k-presaging-what-could-be-a-volatile-july,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|SOL|BUSINESS","Markets|Market Wrap|Bitcoin|Trump|Breaking News|News",cryptocompare

So, what is the reason behind Standard Chartered’s bullish price prediction for Q3, lets find it out. Why Is Standard Chartered So Bullish? According to Standard Chartered, analysts there are two main drivers behind this predicted surge, first a massive inflow into Bitcoin ETFs and second the growing demand from corporate treasuries. JUST IN: $1.1 trillion Standard Chartered predicts #Bitcoin to hit $200,000 this year pic.twitter.com/XplFnxahSP — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 2, 2025 In the second quarter of 2025 alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries snapped up around 245,000 BTC. Since January 2024, ETFs have attracted more than $48 billion in net buying. More Corporate firms and giant institutions are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, and even government-linked funds are increasing their exposure through indirect investments. Therefore, Standard Chartered believes this trend will only get stronger in the months ahead. Standard Chartered Past BTC Price Predictions Earlier this year, Standard Chartered predicted Bitcoin would reach $120,000 by mid-2025. Bitcoin has already surpassed $112,000 in Q2, just shy of that target but well above the $85,000 seen at the start of the year. The bank’s new targets are even more ambitious, with a long-term vision of $500,000 by 2028 if current trends continue. As of today, Bitcoin is trading around $ 109,000 reflecting a 3% rise seen in the last 24hours. Volatility Still in the Picture Of course, it won’t be a smooth ride. Standard Chartered does warn that there could be some bumps ahead, especially between late Q3 and early Q4. Sudden pullbacks or profit-taking could shake up the market for a while. But overall, if the ETF momentum and corporate interest keep growing, this could be the year Bitcoin breaks all its old records, and $200,000 might not sound so crazy after all.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-standard-chartered-predict-btc-to-hit-135k-in-q3/,"BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET","News",cryptocompare
