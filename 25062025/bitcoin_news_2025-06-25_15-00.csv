2025-06-25T12:43:08,"XRP Echoes Bullish Pattern That Came Ahead of BTC Price Breakout to $100K","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Imagine a ship caught in a fierce storm, battered by large waves and swaying wildly yet staying afloat. It indicates that beneath the turmoil, resilience persists, suggesting that smooth sailing will follow once the storm passes. Similarly, when an asset's price refuses to decline despite bearish signals from key indicators, it suggests underlying strength and a potential bull run ahead. That's the current situation in the XRP market and mirrors conditions in the bitcoin market that foreshadowed BTC's historic run higher from $70,000 to $100,000 late last year. Let's have a look at both. XRP is the payments-focused cryptocurrency used by the Fintech company Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions. The two, however, are not interchangeable. XRP defies bearish MACD histogram The underlying strength in XRP is evident from the way prices have been behaving relative to the MACD histogram in recent weeks. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is an exponential moving average (EMA)--based trend-following indicator widely tracked by both institutions and retail investors to identify price trends and measure trend momentum. The MACD bars crossing from negative to positive indicate a bullish shift in momentum, suggesting the start of an uptrend in the asset's price. A crossover below zero suggests otherwise, with consecutive deeper bars indicating a strengthening of the downward momentum. XRP's weekly chart MACD, used by traders to gauge long-term trends, crossed below zero in the first week of March, signaling a renewed downtrend. However, a pronounced downtrend has not yet materialized, with prices mainly trading back and forth between $2 and $2.60, barring occasional short-lived dips below $2. The divergence, marked by persistently bearish MACD and largely directionless trading, hints at bullish vibes or resilience beneath the surface – bulls successfully absorbing supply. This prolonged divergence means the potential for a sudden bull revival and price increases. The bull case is supported by the upward-sloping 50-, 100- and 200-week simple moving averages (SMA). BTC defied bearish MACD in 2024 The above-discussed divergence in XRP is similar to the conditions in BTC last year when the weekly MACD kept flashing red throughout the Summer. At the same time, BTC traded range-bound, barring occasional short-lived dips below $60,000. CoinDesk noted the divergence in mid-September last year when BTC changed hands at around $59,000. Weeks later, BTC rose to $70,000, eventually topping the same in November to hit record highs above $100,000. Let's see if XRP follows the same path.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/25/xrp-echoes-bullish-bitcoin-pattern-that-presaged-breakout-to-usd100k,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T12:41:42,"Riding the breakout: How to trade assets making new all-time highs with Dentoshi","The crypto market has a reputation for being fast-moving and volatile – but when assets begin testing and breaking new all-time highs (ATHs), traders face some of the most critical decisions of their careers. In a recent Twitter/X Spaces session hosted by Kraken VP Growth Matt Howells-Barby, veteran trader @ Dentoshi unpacked the mindset, tools and strategies she uses to navigate those conditions. Whether you’re a trend trader, a meme coin speculator or someone sitting on the sidelines wondering when to act, Dentoshi explains strategies and tactics for managing risk and riding momentum without falling into emotional traps. Trading the all-time high break When Bitcoin hit a new ATH on May 22 , the reaction was brief but euphoric. For Dentoshi, whose BTC holdings are largely in cold storage , the moment was more of a signal to watch “ what comes next – especially for altcoins .” History suggests that after BTC sets an ATH, a rotation into alts often follows. But there are a few things we need to see on the charts for this to happen, like a drop in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) and ETH/BTC strength , but these things have not happened yet. Dentoshi cautions: “ This cycle is different .” “Institutional capital is in the game now, and much of it enters via ETFs – not onchain or through altcoin speculation. That changes the liquidity dynamics.” Trading with @KrakenPro on the go @Dentoshi pic.twitter.com/k5j1VsHC9R — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) November 18, 2024 Trading the chop: Knowing when to step back One of the session’s recurring themes was the importance of understanding market conditions . In sideways, choppy markets – like much of early 2025 – Dentoshi scales down activity significantly. “Sometimes you can be right about the level but wrong about the timing.” Instead of trying to catch every bounce, Dentoshi waits for confirmation of trend shifts , especially via EMAs (exponential moving averages) analysis. Position sizing and the art of timing Dentoshi referenced a famous tweet by pseudonymous trader GCR that sums up her key philosophy: ""During altcoin cycles, you should maximize risk at the the beginning, and slowly reduce it over time, but most people do the opposite"". -GCR — Route 2 FI (@Route2FI) November 11, 2024 “Too many traders do the opposite: Hesitate during the early breakout, then go all-in near the top.” Dentoshi warns against behavior that leads to this result: how greed often grows alongside market confidence , leading to poor entries late in the move. “Be realistic about targets, manage expectations during consolidation, and take profits without blindly rotating gains into new positions.” Manage risk in the bull run with trailing stops on @KrakenPro Learn how @Dentoshi uses them in combination with EMA chart analysis pic.twitter.com/WgBslCnuC7 — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) November 25, 2024 Tools of the trade: EMAs, dominance and narrative momentum So how does she separate the false starts from the real trends? Dentoshi relies heavily on: EMAs for trend direction and exhaustion points BTC and ETH dominance metrics Volume and chart patterns Narrative momentum : If narratives rotate quickly and fail to stick, the market likely isn’t ready for sustained altcoin rallies. Watch @Dentoshi dive deep into Patterns: Breaking down flags and pennants like a Pro. Showing a classic bullish play. Setting a target price using Flagpoles. That lady can draw pic.twitter.com/te30cYR1ru — Kraken Pro (@krakenpro) April 11, 2025 In strong markets, trending narratives last longer . Memecoins can ride these waves when sentiment and volume align. Journaling, focus and staying sane Dentoshi is adamant about mental hygiene. She journals trades (ideally 2–3 times per week), sets clear entry/exit rules , and tunes out Twitter noise by following a curated list of serious traders. She also emphasizes the need for low-dopamine hobbies – activities that help break the constant feedback loop of screen-watching and FOMO. “Have a plan, not a prediction,” she said. “There are no safe entry points; only safe strategies.” What’s next: Summer slowdown or altcoin renaissance? With ETH in a tight 25-day range and Bitcoin hanging between key EMA levels, Dentoshi is watching for signs of breakout strength. Until then, her playbook remains cautious: Mark key levels Set price alerts Wait for volume and trend confirmation If ETH breaks out, we could see an altcoin resurgence. If not, a long, slow summer could be on the horizon. Price alerts on @KrakenPro Enabled https://t.co/aRJF10On2o — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) April 2, 2024 Trading ATHs: Final thoughts Trading ATH breakouts requires more than guts. It demands discipline, a clear system and an ability to avoid noise.

2025-06-25T12:40:30,"Unlocking Bitcoin Investment: The Blockchain Group’s Strategic $4.72M Capital Raise","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Bitcoin Investment: The Blockchain Group’s Strategic $4.72M Capital Raise In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, significant moves by established players often signal deeper market trends. Recently, The Blockchain Group, a prominent French blockchain company, made headlines with a strategic capital raise aimed squarely at increasing its Bitcoin investment . This development isn’t just about one company’s financial maneuvers; it offers a compelling glimpse into the evolving landscape of institutional interest in digital assets. What’s Driving This Significant Bitcoin Investment? The news is straightforward yet impactful: The Blockchain Group announced it has successfully issued 800,690 new ordinary shares, raising a substantial €4.07 million (approximately $4.72 million). The explicit purpose? To acquire more Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t their first foray into BTC; the firm already holds a notable 1,728 BTC. So, what compels a publicly traded company to double down on an asset known for its volatility? Long-Term Conviction: This move signals a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, mirroring sentiments from other major corporations. Strategic Positioning: By increasing its crypto holdings , The Blockchain Group positions itself to benefit from potential future appreciation of Bitcoin, aligning its balance sheet with the growth of the digital economy. Market Opportunity: Companies often seize opportunities during periods they perceive as undervalued or ripe for accumulation, indicating a strategic timing behind this raise. The Blockchain Group’s Strategic Move: Boosting Crypto Holdings For those unfamiliar, The Blockchain Group is a French company actively involved in various aspects of the blockchain ecosystem. Their decision to allocate fresh capital directly into Bitcoin is a powerful statement. It’s a tangible demonstration of how traditional financial structures are adapting to and embracing the decentralized future. Let’s look at their current and projected holdings, assuming the entire raised capital is converted to BTC at a hypothetical price (for illustrative purposes, let’s use a round number like $60,000 per BTC, though actual acquisition prices will vary): Metric Current Status Potential After Raise (Illustrative) Existing BTC Holdings 1,728 BTC 1,728 BTC Capital Raised N/A $4.72 Million Estimated New BTC Acquired (at $60k/BTC) N/A ~78.67 BTC Total Potential BTC Holdings 1,728 BTC ~1,806.67 BTC This table illustrates the direct impact of their fundraising on their balance sheet, significantly increasing their exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Is This a New Wave of Institutional Adoption for Bitcoin? The Blockchain Group’s action is not an isolated incident. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed a growing trend of institutional adoption , with major corporations, investment funds, and even sovereign entities adding Bitcoin to their reserves. This includes companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and numerous ETFs now holding significant amounts of BTC. What does this collective embrace signify? Validation of Bitcoin: Each institutional entry lends further credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it beyond speculative retail interest. Increased Liquidity: More institutional capital flowing into Bitcoin markets can lead to deeper liquidity, potentially reducing volatility over time. Shifting Perceptions: It helps shift the public and regulatory perception of Bitcoin from a niche, risky asset to a mainstream investment vehicle. This ongoing trend suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a technology, but as a foundational element of future global finance. The Blockchain Group’s move reinforces this narrative, signaling confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Assets? The implications of such strategic investments extend far beyond Bitcoin itself, influencing the broader landscape of digital assets . As more institutional money flows into the crypto space, several outcomes become more likely: Benefits: Enhanced Stability: Greater institutional participation can bring more stability and maturity to the crypto markets, reducing extreme price swings. Regulatory Clarity: As institutions engage more, the pressure for clearer and more comprehensive regulatory frameworks will likely increase, fostering a safer environment for all participants. Innovation and Infrastructure: Institutional demand often spurs further investment in underlying infrastructure, security, and innovative applications within the blockchain ecosystem. Challenges: Market Centralization Concerns: While beneficial for stability, large institutional holdings could lead to concerns about centralization of control over certain assets. Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating complex and evolving global regulations remains a significant challenge for companies looking to increase their crypto exposure. Volatility Risk: Despite growing maturity, digital assets, including Bitcoin, remain subject to significant price volatility, posing risks to institutional balance sheets. For individual investors, observing these institutional moves can provide valuable insights. It suggests that a long-term, strategic approach to digital assets might be increasingly validated by major players. It also highlights the growing importance of understanding the fundamentals behind these assets, rather than just short-term price action. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Decentralized Future The Blockchain Group’s decision to raise $4.72 million specifically to bolster its Bitcoin holdings is a powerful testament to the growing institutional confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. It’s a strategic maneuver that not only strengthens the company’s own financial position but also contributes to the broader narrative of Bitcoin’s legitimization and integration into mainstream finance. As more companies follow suit, we can expect the digital asset landscape to continue evolving, bringing both exciting opportunities and new challenges. This move underscores the belief that Bitcoin is not just a passing trend, but a fundamental component of the future financial system.

2025-06-25T12:40:09,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Trader Says BTC Dominance at Breaking Point – Are Altcoins About to Explode?","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading with a solid bullish bias, having surged above $107,000, gaining over 5% in just two days, and reclaiming upside momentum. The recent bullish price action is mainly driven by Bitcoin’s dominance , which has risen to 65.3%. This surge suggests that investors are increasingly favoring Bitcoin in light of macroeconomic uncertainties and institutional inflows. Additionally, this strength is evident in the total market capitalization of $2.13 trillion, occurring just as traders prepare for the final segment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s congressional testimony. Alt Season just 3-4 weekly candles away! Bitcoin Dominance right now is 65.57% and we are going to tap the blue box – Supply OB (Weekly TF).

BTC has cleared a multi-week descending trendline and now holds above the 50-EMA ($104,513) and a former resistance level at $106,135. Momentum is firm, backed by a MACD crossover and a bullish engulfing formation above $101,400—laying the groundwork for further upside if price breaks $108,738. Bitcoin price chart – Source: Tradingview A move beyond that level could pave the way for a price of $110,486 and $112,081, making the Bitcoin price prediction bullish. Altcoin Rotation: A Question of When With BTC dominance near historical cycle highs, analysts are watching closely for a shift in capital toward altcoins. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s dominance typically tops out between 67% and 71% before giving way to broader altcoin rallies. #BTC dominance is trying hard to stay above 65.2% support. Hope it tanks soon! — Vuori Trading (@VuoriTrading) June 24, 2025 That threshold could be approaching. BTC dominance is currently at 65.3% Peak dominance in past cycles: ~71% Potential altcoin breakout window: next 1–3 weeks Traders speculate that if Bitcoin consolidates near its highs, funds may rotate into undervalued altcoins. Despite potential short-term corrections, sentiment is building that an “altcoin season” could materialize by mid-July. Institutions and ETFs Drive Momentum; Bitcoin Supported Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries continue to support the price. On Tuesday alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $588.55 million in inflows—the 11th consecutive day of positive flow, according to SoSoValue.

This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term.

2025-06-25T12:30:26,"Ethereum ETFs Witness Remarkable $71.3M Inflow Surge","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETFs Witness Remarkable $71.3M Inflow Surge The digital asset landscape is buzzing with renewed optimism as U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs continue to attract significant capital. On June 24, these groundbreaking investment vehicles recorded a combined net inflow of an impressive $71.3 million, marking the second consecutive day of positive momentum. This influx signals growing institutional confidence and investor interest in Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It’s a compelling development that underscores the evolving acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. What’s Driving the Surge in Spot Ethereum ETFs? The recent approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a pivotal moment, opening doors for a broader range of investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This regulatory clarity has injected a fresh wave of enthusiasm into the market. Investors, both retail and institutional, are increasingly recognizing Ethereum’s foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a myriad of other blockchain applications. The ability to invest through a regulated, familiar product like an ETF removes many of the complexities and perceived risks associated with direct crypto ownership, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Key factors contributing to this surge include: Regulatory Validation: The SEC’s approval lends significant legitimacy to Ethereum as an asset class. Accessibility: ETFs simplify the investment process, allowing participation through traditional brokerage accounts. Institutional Appetite: Large financial institutions are now able to allocate capital more easily, leading to substantial inflows. Market Maturation: The cryptocurrency market, particularly Ethereum, is seen as maturing, offering more stable investment opportunities compared to its earlier, more volatile days. Diving Deeper: Who’s Leading the ETH ETF Charge? While the overall picture for ETH ETFs is overwhelmingly positive, a closer look reveals interesting dynamics among the individual funds. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) emerged as the clear leader, pulling in a staggering $98 million in inflows on June 24 alone. This performance is a testament to BlackRock’s immense market presence and investor trust, mirroring its dominant role in the Bitcoin ETF space. BlackRock, as one of the world’s largest asset managers, brings unparalleled credibility and reach, often becoming the preferred choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to new asset classes. However, not all funds experienced the same positive trajectory. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) recorded a net outflow of $26.7 million on the same day. While this might seem concerning at first glance, it’s important to view such movements in context. Outflows can occur for various reasons, including profit-taking by early investors, portfolio rebalancing, or simply individual investor decisions that do not necessarily reflect a broader negative sentiment towards the asset class. In a nascent market like spot Ethereum ETFs, it’s natural to see some volatility in individual fund flows as investors adjust their positions. Understanding the Significance of Ethereum Inflows The consistent positive Ethereum Inflows are more than just daily statistics; they represent a fundamental shift in how mainstream finance views and interacts with digital assets. For Ethereum, these inflows can have several profound implications: Price Support: Increased demand from ETFs can create buying pressure, potentially supporting or driving up Ethereum’s price. Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and larger asset bases in ETFs contribute to greater market liquidity for ETH. Ecosystem Growth: As more capital flows into Ethereum, it can fuel further development and innovation within its extensive ecosystem of decentralized applications. Mainstream Adoption: The success of these ETFs serves as a powerful indicator of Ethereum’s growing acceptance as a legitimate investment asset, paving the way for even wider adoption. This trend echoes the journey of Bitcoin ETFs, which, after their launch, saw significant inflows contributing to Bitcoin’s price appreciation and overall market validation. Ethereum’s path appears to be following a similar trajectory, albeit with its unique characteristics tied to its utility as a programmable blockchain. The Strategic Role of BlackRock ETHA in Market Dynamics BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, or BlackRock ETHA , is quickly establishing itself as a dominant force in the nascent spot Ethereum ETF market. BlackRock’s reputation for innovation and its vast network of institutional clients give it a significant edge. Their strong inflows suggest that a considerable portion of institutional capital entering the Ethereum ETF space is choosing BlackRock as their preferred vehicle. This is not surprising, given BlackRock’s track record of launching successful financial products and its commitment to providing secure and efficient investment solutions. Their entry and subsequent leadership in this market segment underscore the institutional demand for regulated crypto products and could set a benchmark for other asset managers. Navigating the Nuances: The Case of Fidelity FETH While BlackRock captured the headlines with its large inflows, the $26.7 million outflow from Fidelity FETH highlights the diverse strategies and investor behaviors within the market. Fidelity, a respected name in asset management, has been a long-standing proponent of digital assets, demonstrating a commitment to the space through various initiatives. An outflow, especially in the early days of a new product, can be attributed to several factors: Early Investor Profit-Taking: Some investors might have bought in anticipation of the ETF launch and are now realizing gains. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large institutional investors often rebalance their portfolios based on risk assessments or strategic shifts. Smaller Fund Volatility: Newer or smaller funds might experience more pronounced daily fluctuations in flows compared to larger, more established ones. It’s crucial for investors to look beyond single-day movements and consider the broader trend and Fidelity’s overall commitment to the digital asset space. The competitive landscape for Ethereum ETFs is just beginning to unfold, and various funds will find their niche among different investor segments. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors considering exposure to Ethereum through ETFs, these developments offer several insights: Long-Term View: Focus on the long-term potential of Ethereum and its ecosystem rather than daily price or flow fluctuations. Diversification: Spot Ethereum ETFs can serve as a valuable diversification tool within a balanced investment portfolio. Due Diligence: While ETFs offer convenience, it’s still essential to understand the underlying asset (Ethereum) and the specific fund’s structure and fees. Market Volatility: Be prepared for continued volatility in the broader crypto market, even with the increasing institutionalization. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The consistent positive inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, particularly the remarkable performance of BlackRock’s ETHA, signal a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. These inflows are not just numbers; they represent growing institutional validation, increased accessibility for investors, and a powerful step towards mainstream adoption of digital assets. While individual fund flows may fluctuate, the overarching trend points to a robust and expanding interest in Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable investment. As the market matures, the role of these ETFs in shaping Ethereum’s future price action and ecosystem growth will undoubtedly become even more pronounced, ushering in a new era for digital asset investment.

2025-06-25T12:30:20,"Crypto Rally Or Crash? Powell Just Made July The Market’s Make-Or-Break","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s appearance on Capitol Hill Tuesday left risk-asset traders with a single, binary question: does the most interest-sensitive summer in years end with a crypto breakout or a macro-driven crash? In a prepared statement, Powell stressed that “inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated,” adding that the Federal Open Market Committee is “well-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.” Crypto’s Fate May Be Sealed In July For crypto markets already oscillating on every nuance of policy guidance, the message was clear: the next four weeks—anchored by the 12 July CPI release and the 19 July payrolls report—will decide whether July’s FOMC delivers relief or a reality check. POWELL: WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE MEANINGFUL TARIFF INFLATION EFFECTS JUNE, JULY AUGUST POWELL: IF WE DON’T SEE THAT, THAT WOULD LEAD TO CUTTING EARLIER — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) June 24, 2025 Powell’s caution sits atop a rare public split inside the Board itself. Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both Trump appointees, have openly argued that tariff-related price spikes are likely to be “one-time shifts” and therefore should not stand in the way of an early cut—potentially as soon as the 30 July meeting. Seven of their colleagues disagree, laying out projections that keep policy unchanged through December. Powell, for his part, told lawmakers: “I don’t think we need to be in any rush, because the economy is still strong.” Related Reading: Crypto Bull Run Over? Here’s What A Top Trader Just Said Markets reacted by flattening the front end of the curve. Two-year Treasury yields fell to 3.806 percent, while the benchmark 10-year dipped to 4.285 percent—both lows not seen since early May—after the testimony and a surprise cease-fire in the Middle East turbo-charged a global “risk-on” bid. Yet expectations for July remain finely balanced: CME FedWatch shows that traders have whittled the probability of a first 25-basis-point cut to roughly 19%. Crypto traded the cross-currents rather than the headline. Bitcoin, which had cratered to $99,000 on Monday, reclaimed $106,000 by Wednesday morning, mirroring the rebound in equities and high-beta currencies as the dollar slumped on falling yields. Ethereum, meanwhile, held above $2,400—even as Powell’s tone was widely described as hawkish. The broader crypto complex moved in sympathy, with BNB punching through $644 and Solana stabilising near $146. Related Reading: Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant Veteran traders on X distilled the stakes. Pseudonymous analyst Byzantine General wrote, “We got a lot of clarity now. All eyes on the July CPI print.” Nic from CoinBureau added that July “is in play—maybe—but nothing’s locked in,” as Powell’s testimony brought no big surprises. Meanwhile, Jim Bianco commented: “Trump appointees Waller and Bowman are suggesting a July cut. Powell is reiterating ‘no.’ Will the July FOMC meeting see at least two dissenters?” For now, Powell’s “watch and wait” stance has bought the FOMC four more weeks of optionality. If July inflation confirms the down-trend, the policy door swings open, and the next rally for crypto could morph into a full-blown melt-up. If it doesn’t, the crash could come just as fast. As Byzantine General put it, the market “got clarity.” What it did not get is comfort. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,892.

The BTC price plunged to lows of $98,200 following US attacks on Iran but quickly rebounded and is up nearly 9% in the past 3 days after ceasefire talks emerged. A ceasefire has restored some confidence in the market, and it is now inching towards retesting its ATH of $112K. On the behavior of BTC price action, a report on Tuesday by K33 research report reveals that the 30-day ETF flows and BTC returns share an “R² of 0.80”, indicating that spot Bitcoin ETF flows remain a key market driver. Similarly, the 11-day streak in US spot Bitcoin ETFs with recent $588 million inflows on June 24th proves the point. Since June 10th, over $2.2 billion in inflows have been measured, which signals tremendous institutional interest. Moreover, most recently, Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC , LLC has bought $386 million worth of Bitcoin, following this week’s recent buys of Strategy, Metaplanet, and the Blockchain Group, into their treasury.

Following closely, Fidelity’s FBTC added $217.6 million in new capital. At the same time, other smaller contribution amounts came from Bitwise and VanEck. In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC experienced outflows, losing $85.2 million. Meanwhile, Ether-based ETFs had mixed results. VanEck’s EFUT gained $98 million, but Grayscale’s ETHE lost $26.7 million. Consequently, total inflows for ETH ETFs reached $71.3 million. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Will BTC Retest $112K? The Q2 price action witnessed a magnificent run, with its gains surging from $75K To $112K, marking nearly 49% gains by May 22nd. However, the momentum reduced and ended up in a range; this range turned out to be a flag pattern in June. The recent surge from the lower to the higher border indicates this pattern. If the upper border is breached, it is more likely that its price may retest to $112K soon, and breaking that would trigger a strong rally.

2025-06-25T12:21:31,"Galaxy Digital: Crypto Cycles And AI Servers Collide (Rating Upgrade)","Summary Upgrading Galaxy Digital to buy after the recent pullback, as risk-reward has improved and technicals look supportive for a new uptrend. Helios data center transition offers stable, high-margin recurring revenue, reducing reliance on volatile crypto markets and boosting long-term sustainability. Valuation is reasonable at current levels, with potential for 36–37% upside if crypto market sentiment improves. Key risks remain: heavy crypto dependence, Helios execution uncertainty, and potential dilution. I recommend buying at $18.3, not higher. Introduction I have covered Galaxy Digital Inc. ( GLXY ) twice before, once under the ticker symbol GLXY on the TSE calling it a buy and recently as GLXY on the Nasdaq issuing a hold rating . The performances since then are depicted below. GLXY Performance after Buy rating GLXY Performance after Hold rating I did rate them a hold on May 19 but did not sell any shares as I believe the stock has more upside potential this year. After the recent pullback, I do see a more favorable risk-reward ratio in buying GLXY. Therefore, I am upgrading my rating to a buy again. Why I Am Long Again Recent momentum for Galaxy Digital has been halted by the combination of a crypto price correction and the pricing of a new share offering totaling around $500M. Proceeds of the set offering will be used to build out their Helios data center Infrastructure. What I did not cover so far due to length constraints is the Data Center opportunities GLXY has. Therefore, this will be the focus of this article. It is, however, quite significant to the company, as shown in their division of business fields into Digital Assets , which includes Global Markets, Asset Management, and Investment Banking, and Data Centers , which covers their Helios Data Center in Dickens County, TX, initially intended to be used for Bitcoin mining but now being repurposed to host AI HPC services. Demand for data centers is set to grow at almost 300% throughout 2030. Similarly, data center IT CapEx is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 23%, reaching $800B in 2028, per McKinsey. Even if these optimistic assumptions are halved, this would be a very attractive market for Galaxy Digital to enter. GLXY IR Their 15-year agreement with CoreWeave marks a shift in their revenue model. At an estimated $900M annual recurring revenue projected to fully materialize into 2027, they are now less susceptible to crypto price volatility. These revenues are both stable and of a high-margin nature, as GLXY projects 90%+ EBITDA margins for them due to their triple lease agreement structure. Conservatively estimated, this could net GLXY an additional $500M of net income per year. More capacity should be gradually unlocked and a full capacity of 2,500 MW could be reached in 2035, which at a 90% utilization rate and $150 per kW/month could earn them a total of $2.4B in ARR. This could in turn translate to $800-900M of net income from data centers annually, assuming higher depreciation costs causing EBITDA margins to decrease a little bit. This seems to be a much better field of business to operate in rather than Bitcoin mining, and I'm glad they're transitioning. Bitcoin mining is incredibly dependent on Bitcoin prices and, excluding mining efficiency increases, needs Bitcoin prices to double every four years just to earn the same revenues and profits. Still, one cannot deny the fact that Galaxy's stock price continues to be very dependent on Bitcoin prices, which drives the broader cryptocurrency market. In my latest BTC analysis, I shared the following: In the short term, though, I'm expecting a slight pullback to $97.5k or, in the worst case, to $93.5k We have now seen Bitcoin retrace to $98k. The worst might be behind us, but I continue to see a case for $93.5k as the worst-case current scenario. Either way, Bitcoin was super quick to regain the psychologically important $100k mark, despite economic and geopolitical uncertainties. In my view, this is clear evidence that the momentum is strong enough to reach further ATHs this year. Bitcoin's monthly RSI still has room for one further euphoric leap this year, as in all post-halving years, it has reached levels north of 90, whereas we have just seen 75 in 2024, a halving year. TradingView When it comes to valuation, traditional measures only get us so far. But looking at the P/B value, it has come down a little bit over the past few weeks. In my last coverage, it was at 2.7X and is now at 2.2X, which, in my view, is more reasonable and contains a little more room to run to the upside in case of continued crypto market euphoria. Specifically, I could see this value reach levels of 3X during peak investor sentiment, sometime around late Q3 or Q4 this year. This implies a short-term upside potential of 36%. Data by YCharts Since estimates are hard to find, I will do my own scenario analysis, based on FY 2025 and 2026. As long as a big portion of GLXY's profits stems from cyclical unrealized digital asset gains, they deserve to trade at high-single-digit P/E ratios, considering the unpredictability and the fact that profits vary greatly from true cashflows. As I assume rising digital asset prices in 2025, GLXY's net income would be boosted significantly by holdings gains as well as higher AUM, trading and lending usage, and advisory. I can imagine these developments to drive net income to around $700M in 2025, giving GLXY a forward P/E of 9.9X, which seems like the stock is neither over- nor undervalued for its 2025 upcoming performance. A continued crypto bull market is therefore already priced in. For 2026, gains or losses from the crypto markets are hard to forecast since it is supposed to be a crypto winter year. That could compromise net income drastically. They could, however, achieve revenues of $1B ($300M from financial services, $700M from Helios), which would put them at a forward P/S ratio of just below 7X, which is also reasonable considering their revenue will become much more predictable and be of high-margin nature. Checking technicals again, I realize that GLXY is trading at a crucial support of CAD25. The 200-day MA is also inching closer and could offer support. If these levels are lost, however, I could see the price moving down toward CAD20 (-20%). GLXY's recent drop of 30% also falls within its usual range of corrections since 2022. Weekly RSI down to 54 and daily RSI at 45 make me more confident at the start of a new uptrend. From then, it is important that they reclaim the descending trend line starting from their 2021 highs as support. Price has been rejected here three times on the daily chart in the last few weeks. Overcoming this resistance would give them a good foundation for trying to break through the key resistance zone at CAD34-36, which is my new preliminary price target, offering approximately 37% upside. TradingView Risks As mentioned in my prior coverage, GLXY's core risk remains its heavy dependence on crypto markets. A prolonged pullback in Bitcoin could lead to declining trading activity, lower AUMs, and negative net income. I particularly expect a lot of volatility going into 2026 where Galaxy will have to prove whether they can perform while reporting potentially large unrealized losses on their digital asset holdings. Additionally, Q1 2025's large loss as well as the Nasdaq listing increase the risk of shareholder dilution. Galaxy truly needs predictable revenues in order to safely be able to fund its costs and future expansions, so taking on debt and issuing a lot of shares is no longer necessary. Proceeds from share offerings are needed to restructure Helios and build it out in order to achieve maximum capacity. While likely, Helios has not proven to be economically viable and has not turned over a dime. This is set to change in the first half of next year but does remain an operational risk, as it is very hard to calculate ROI when investors don't precisely know about the amount of investment needed and whether projected capacity, revenues, and profits will truly materialize. Conclusion I am upgrading Galaxy Digital back to a Buy, though with less conviction than during the April lows. The recent pullback did improve the risk-reward ratio, but it is not as favorable as it was when prices hit $8-$12. Still, Galaxy Digital Inc. offers exposure to growing AI adoption, cryptocurrency financial services, and digital asset holdings growth. At today's prices, investors get the above-named sections for a fair valuation and decent technicals. Helios has the potential to make GLXY's financial profile more sustainable and less volatile over the coming years. This remains a 2025-focused investment, but I will continue to monitor both the Helios rollout and broader crypto dynamics closely. Depending on how these develop, Galaxy Digital could transition into a longer-term position for me, heading into 2026 and 2027. Disclaimer: At the time of writing this article, GLXY's stock price is at $18.3. I recommend buying at this price, not any higher.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797143-galaxy-digital-crypto-cycles-and-ai-servers-collide?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","GLXY|GLXY:CA",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T12:20:21,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Remarkable $588.6M Inflow Ignites Market Optimism","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Remarkable $588.6M Inflow Ignites Market Optimism Are you keeping an eye on the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’ve likely noticed a groundbreaking trend that continues to shape the landscape of digital asset investment. On June 24, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an astonishing combined net inflow of $588.6 million, extending their impressive streak to 11 consecutive trading days of positive flows. This surge signals robust institutional and retail interest, painting a bright picture for the future of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance. What Are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Why Do They Matter? For those new to the space, a US Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. Unlike futures ETFs, which track Bitcoin futures contracts, spot ETFs provide direct exposure to the price movements of the underlying asset itself. This distinction is crucial for investors who seek a more direct and less complex way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of buying and storing the cryptocurrency directly. The approval and subsequent launch of these ETFs earlier this year marked a monumental shift. They offer several compelling advantages: Accessibility: Traditional investors can now easily invest in Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts, just like they would with stocks or other ETFs. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying and selling. Regulatory Oversight: Being regulated products, they offer a layer of investor protection that direct cryptocurrency purchases might not always provide. Diversification: They allow for easier portfolio diversification by adding exposure to digital assets within a traditional investment framework. The sustained crypto inflows into these products underscore their growing acceptance and utility as a bridge between the burgeoning digital asset world and conventional financial markets. Unpacking the Recent Crypto Inflows: A Closer Look at the Numbers The $588.6 million net inflow on June 24 is not just a number; it’s a testament to sustained investor confidence. According to data from Farside Investors, this marks the eleventh consecutive day of net inflows, indicating a persistent buying trend rather than a one-off event. Let’s break down which funds are leading the charge: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a massive $436.3 million in net inflows. This performance solidifies IBIT’s position as a dominant force in the Bitcoin ETF arena. Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed with a strong $85.2 million in net inflows, demonstrating its continued popularity among investors. ARK Invest’s ARKB: The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) secured $43.8 million in net inflows, maintaining its steady appeal. Bitwise’s BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) contributed $9.8 million to the total, showcasing consistent interest. Grayscale’s BTC: Notably, even Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has historically seen outflows due to its conversion from a trust to an ETF, recorded a net inflow of $7.5 million. This is a significant shift and suggests that the selling pressure from GBTC might be subsiding, or even reversing. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) also witnessed a respectable $6 million in net inflows. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, highlighting the concentrated interest in these top performers. This distribution of inflows points to a clear preference for established and well-marketed funds, though the positive shift in Grayscale GBTC is particularly noteworthy. BlackRock IBIT Leads the Charge: What Makes it So Attractive? When we talk about the success of Bitcoin ETFs , it’s impossible to ignore the colossal impact of BlackRock IBIT . Its staggering $436.3 million inflow on June 24 alone accounts for the vast majority of the day’s total. BlackRock, as the world’s largest asset manager, brings unparalleled credibility, distribution networks, and marketing prowess to the table. Their reputation attracts a broad spectrum of investors, from large institutions to individual retail clients, who might feel more comfortable investing in Bitcoin through a familiar and trusted financial giant. The rapid accumulation of Bitcoin by IBIT since its launch has been a key driver of overall market sentiment. Its consistent positive flows suggest that a significant portion of new institutional capital is finding its way into the Bitcoin ecosystem through this specific vehicle. This isn’t just about BlackRock; it’s about the validation of Bitcoin as an investable asset class by a mainstream financial powerhouse. Grayscale GBTC’s Evolving Role in the Bitcoin ETF Landscape The journey of Grayscale GBTC has been unique among the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Prior to its conversion, GBTC operated as a trust, often trading at a significant discount or premium to its net asset value (NAV). Upon conversion to an ETF, many investors who had been locked into the trust, or who sought to arbitrage the discount, began to redeem their shares, leading to substantial outflows in the initial weeks. However, the recent $7.5 million net inflow for GBTC is a positive indicator. This shift could signify several things: Exhaustion of Selling Pressure: The initial wave of redemptions might be largely complete, with most of the profit-takers or discount-arbitragers having exited. New Inflows: New investors might be starting to see GBTC as a viable option, perhaps due to its slightly lower fee structure compared to its pre-ETF days, or simply as another entry point into the market. Market Maturation: As the overall Bitcoin ETF market matures, investors may become more comfortable diversifying their ETF holdings across different providers, including GBTC. The performance of GBTC will continue to be a key metric to watch, as its stabilization and potential for sustained inflows could further bolster overall confidence in the Bitcoin ETFs market. Benefits and Opportunities for Investors The sustained crypto inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs highlight several key benefits for investors: Ease of Access: No need for crypto exchanges, wallets, or complex security measures. Investors can buy and sell through their existing brokerage accounts. Institutional Participation: The ETF structure has opened the floodgates for large institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers to allocate capital to Bitcoin, which was previously challenging due to compliance and custody issues. This institutional backing adds legitimacy and stability to the market. Price Discovery: Increased liquidity and trading volume in regulated products can lead to more efficient price discovery for Bitcoin. Mainstream Adoption: The success of these ETFs accelerates Bitcoin’s journey into the mainstream, making it a more accepted and understood asset class. For investors looking to gain exposure to the digital asset space, these ETFs offer a compelling blend of innovation and traditional financial comfort. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Bitcoin ETFs While the recent inflows are certainly cause for optimism, it’s crucial for investors to understand that investing in Bitcoin ETFs is not without its challenges and risks. Bitcoin, by its very nature, is a volatile asset. Its price can experience significant swings in short periods due to: Market Sentiment: News events, regulatory changes, and even social media trends can heavily influence Bitcoin’s price. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, inflation data, and interest rate decisions can impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the US has approved spot ETFs, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally is still evolving and can change, potentially impacting the market. Custody Risks: Although the ETF structure aims to mitigate this, the underlying Bitcoin still needs to be securely stored by custodians, introducing a layer of operational risk. Fees: Investors should be mindful of the expense ratios charged by ETFs, as these can eat into returns over time. Therefore, while the accessibility is a huge plus, investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before allocating capital to these products. The Road Ahead: Future Outlook for Bitcoin ETFs and the Crypto Market The consistent crypto inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest a growing appetite for digital assets within regulated frameworks. This trend is likely to continue, with potential implications for the broader crypto market: Increased Institutional Adoption: The success of Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for other single-asset crypto ETFs (like Ethereum ETFs, which are already seeing progress) and potentially multi-asset crypto ETFs. Bitcoin Price Impact: Sustained demand from ETFs, which are continuously accumulating Bitcoin, could put upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, assuming supply remains constrained (e.g., post-halving effects). Market Maturation: The presence of regulated investment products fosters greater trust and understanding, contributing to the overall maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Innovation: As more traditional financial players enter the crypto space via ETFs, it could spur further innovation in financial products and services built around digital assets. The future looks promising for the integration of digital assets into global financial systems, with Bitcoin ETFs playing a pivotal role. Actionable Insights for Potential Investors If you’re considering investing in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs , here are some actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Understand the specific ETF you’re investing in, including its expense ratio, custodian, and historical performance. Understand Volatility: Be prepared for price fluctuations. Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and its ETFs will reflect that. Diversify: While Bitcoin ETFs offer exposure to a new asset class, they should ideally be part of a diversified portfolio, not your sole investment. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and macro-economic factors that could influence Bitcoin’s price. Long-Term Perspective: Many view Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate the impact of volatility. In conclusion, the consistent and significant inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs , particularly led by powerhouses like BlackRock IBIT and the surprising positive turn for Grayscale GBTC , underscore a powerful narrative: Bitcoin is increasingly being embraced by mainstream finance. This trend not only validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class but also opens new avenues for investors to participate in the digital economy with greater ease and confidence. As these ETFs continue to attract capital, they are poised to play an even larger role in shaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.

With bullish technical patterns forming and on-chain data aligning, BTC’s price structure paints a promising picture, but not without a few caveats. A recent report showed Bitcoin long-term holders are not distributing, which suggests the token is in a quiet accumulation phase. The lack of spikes in Dormancy flow reduces sell pressure from old coins, which could be a bullish signal for the token. The data from Glassnode, the BTC long-term holder (LTH) spending binary indicator, shows minimal spending for the first time since June 10. With LTH supply near all-time highs at around 14.7 million BTC which signals conviction where the seasoned investors remain reluctant to distribute despite recent market volatility. Previously, the minimal long-term holder selling occurred post-March 2020 which set the stage for explosive rallies. Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025: Will BTC Price Reach $110K? Bitcoin volatility has dropped below Gold for the first time ever, which signifies a historic shift in finance. This suggests that the star token is maturing and the market is recognizing it. Hence, as adoption grows and institutional confidence deepens, BTC could start to behave less like a wild rollercoaster and more like a stable store of value. As BTC price reclaimed $105K, and funding rates turned negative, there has been a classic set up of a short squeeze. With shorts piling in, history suggests an upward move could be imminent for Bitcoin & altcoins. In the long term, the BTC price has approached a crucial resistance zone, which suggests a major breakout is underway. Previously, when the price reached the final resistance zone between $69,400 and $72,150. On the other hand, the weekly CMF dropped below the average and triggered a rebound, similar to what happened before the Q4 2024 rally. On the other hand, the weekly MACD which was on the verge of undergoing a bearish crossover, has displayed a bullish divergence. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is expected to accumulate along the resistance zone for a couple of weeks until the buying volume intensifies, followed by a breakout to a new ATH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-breakout-alert-technicals-point-towards-a-new-ath-heres-whats-next/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Accordingly, the Arizona Assembly passed the Bitcoin reserve bill HB2324. The Arizona House of Representatives passed the Bitcoin reserve bill HB2324, creating a reserve fund for assets seized through criminal forfeiture to be included in the reserves. The bill, which is now before Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs for a final signature, will be the state's second reserve bill to be enacted if signed by Hobbs. As you may recall, Governor Katie Hobbs has previously approved or vetoed some bills. Accordingly, Hobbs vetoed two Bitcoin Reserve bills that would allow state investment (SB1373 and SB1025). She had previously signed the reserve bill HB 2749 and paved the way for the creation of a reserve fund for unclaimed assets. HB 2324 clearly outlines how funds from sales of seized cryptocurrencies will be allocated. The first $300,000 raised will be directed to the Anti-Racketeering Revolving Fund. Any amount above that will continue to support the same fund at 50%, 25% will go to the state’s General Fund, and the remaining 25% will be allocated to the newly created Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund.

2025-06-25T12:00:11,"European Central Bank Trials XRP Ledger For Bonds—But There’s A Catch","The European Central Bank (ECB) has quietly given the XRP Ledger a place in its wholesale-DLT sandbox—yet only behind the walls of a closed network. Annex II of the ECB’s June 2025 report describes 48 trials and experiments, but a single project run by Lithuanian fintech Axiology is the only one grounded in its technology. XRP Ledger Powers ECB Trial Axiology’s DLT Trading and Settlement System (TSS) is, in the ECB ’s own words, a “private, permissioned infrastructure built using the open-source code of the XRP Ledger.” The central bank immediately qualifies that pedigree: “While Axiology benefits from XRP Ledger technology, it operates as an independent system, designed to streamline trading, settlement, and custody of tokenized assets.” In short, the code is XRPL-inspired, but the sandbox itself is hermetically sealed. The trial rehearsed three events—primary issuance, coupon payments, and maturity redemption—while the Banque de France’s Trigger Solution handled central-bank money. In the issuance phase the ledger recorded that “Node sends asset amount from issuer’s operational wallet to created escrow wallet, which uses XRP Payment transaction,” after which “Operator transfers amount of asset from escrow wallet to final investor’s wallet, using XRP Payment transaction and thus finalizing DVP.” Later, during redemption, the report shows the flow reversing: “Node sends amount of asset from end-investor wallet to created escrow wallet, which uses XRP Payment transaction,” and finally “Operator transfers amount of asset from escrow wallet to Issuer Agent Operational Wallet using XRP Payment transaction, thereby finalising DVP and initiating burning process.” Those six sentences—the two structural descriptions plus four transaction steps—are the document’s entire reference set to “XRP.” Nowhere does the annex suggest that the token, open-network validators, or public liquidity pools were involved; every transfer ran strictly inside a permissioned ledger, and the cash side remained pure central-bank money . Axiology says its goal was to test the “performance and reliability” of synchronizing delivery-versus-payment in central-bank euros with a tokenized bond ledger. For the ECB, the exercise is one of many in a comparative sweep that already includes Canton, Corda, and Ethereum variants. The findings will inform whatever wholesale CBDC architecture the Eurosystem may one day pursue. The upshot is stark: the ECB did trial Ripple’s technology, but only in a sealed environment, detached from the public ecosystem. For proponents it is a technical validation; for skeptics it shows regulators are still wary of open networks. Either way, the catch remains: the technology was allowed inside the room, yet the door to public adoption stays seemingly firmly shut. At press time, XRP traded at $2.18, up 13% since the Sunday low at $1.90.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/european-central-bank-xrp-ledger-bonds/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|ECB|ECB CBDC|European Central Bank|ripple|XRP Ledger|XRP Ledger CBDC|XRP news|XRP price",cryptocompare

The achievement is part of CleanSpark’s aggressive expansion strategy and signals a growing consolidation of hashrate among US public miners as the Bitcoin network becomes increasingly competitive post-halving. Powering the Future with 50 EH/s Hashrate is a critical metric in the Bitcoin ecosystem, indicating how much computational power is being deployed to secure the network and validate transactions. A higher hashrate directly increases the likelihood of earning Bitcoin mining rewards. Reaching 50 EH/s is not only a testament to CleanSpark’s operational prowess but also a strategic defense against volatility and halving-induced revenue compression. CleanSpark’s vertically integrated infrastructure has proven instrumental in reaching this milestone. By directly managing its energy procurement and operational footprint, the company is able to minimize downtime and optimize margins — a critical advantage in an industry where power costs can make or break profitability. The company’s mining fleet is powered by a diverse mix of energy sources across its facilities, many of which leverage favorable power agreements and renewable energy options. This strategic flexibility allows CleanSpark to withstand fluctuations in electricity markets while maintaining efficient and reliable mining operations. Eyes Set on 60 EH/s The firm isn’t stopping at 50 EH/s. CEO Zach Bradford confirmed that CleanSpark is on track to reach 60 EH/s in the near term, which would further solidify its ranking among the global mining elite. The planned scale-up comes at a pivotal time, as many smaller and less efficient mining firms have struggled to remain profitable in the wake of the April 2024 halving, which cut Bitcoin block rewards in half from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. The move also reflects broader institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition — a belief increasingly shared by public miners who are choosing to hold their mined BTC rather than sell at market lows. In addition to mining at scale, CleanSpark’s Digital Asset Management division has begun actively managing its 12,500+ self-mined BTC — a significant treasury now being deployed to generate passive returns. Bradford emphasized that the firm’s approach allows it to finance growth without diluting shareholder equity. Rather than sell Bitcoin on the spot market, CleanSpark is reportedly exploring strategies like Bitcoin-backed lending, liquidity provision, and strategic DeFi deployments. This treasury-first strategy mirrors moves made by other institutional players, such as MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital, who are treating Bitcoin not just as a mined asset but as an active balance sheet tool. CleanSpark's Institutional Ascent CleanSpark's rise has come at a time of renewed attention on institutional Bitcoin adoption and US mining dominance. Following the halving, the barriers to entry in Bitcoin mining have risen considerably, pushing smaller miners out and giving large-scale, energy-efficient operations a commanding advantage. The firm's ability to scale efficiently and capitalize on treasury management has made it a darling of institutional investors, many of whom view Bitcoin mining equities as high-beta plays on the underlying asset. With CleanSpark's next goal of 60 EH/s on the horizon and a growing portfolio of managed BTC assets, the company appears well-positioned to capitalize on the next Bitcoin bull cycle — especially as demand surges from spot ETFs, sovereign wealth funds, and corporate treasuries. As Bitcoin's supply issuance slows and network difficulty increases, the firms that can mine most efficiently and deploy their capital with strategic foresight are likely to define the next decade of crypto infrastructure. CleanSpark is making a strong case that it intends to be one of them. Green Minerals Unveils $1.2 Billion Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Amid Deep Sea Mining Uncertainty Meanwhile, Norwegian deep sea mining firm Green Minerals ASA made waves in the financial and cryptocurrency sectors on Tuesday after announcing that it would invest up to $1.2 billion—in collaboration with its partners—to build a Bitcoin treasury, marking one of the boldest moves yet by a publicly traded European company to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The Euronext Growth Oslo-listed company said in a statement that it plans to acquire its first Bitcoin “in the next few days,” framing the move as a long-term strategy to integrate blockchain technologies and hedge against fiat currency risks. Executive Chairman Ståle Rodahl emphasized that the initiative would help “safeguard long-term value” while reinforcing the company’s mission of financial innovation and sustainable development. “Bitcoin’s decentralized, non-inflationary properties make it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat,” Rodahl said. “By integrating a Bitcoin treasury strategy, we are not only mitigating fiat risks but also reaffirming our commitment to financial innovation and the sustainable creation of long-term value.” Strategic Pivot Amid Regulatory Hurdles Green Minerals’ announcement comes at a precarious time. The company’s core business—mining deep sea minerals such as cobalt and rare earth elements—has come under increasing pressure from both environmental advocates and regulators. In 2024, Norway’s government ordered a moratorium on deep sea mining, freezing plans to issue permits originally slated for 2025. That decision was followed last week by another policy shift: the Norwegian Labor government proposed a temporary ban on new power-intensive crypto mining operations, citing better use cases for the country’s energy grid, such as community data centers. Despite these hurdles, Green Minerals appears to be embracing a parallel pivot into blockchain and crypto assets—a move increasingly common among public companies seeking alternatives to volatile fiat and legacy banking systems. Rodahl said the Bitcoin treasury would not replace the company’s existing operations but would serve as a financial foundation to support upcoming capital expenditures tied to its mining ambitions. “The program offers a robust hedge against currency debasement, particularly valuable for a company with a long project horizon,” he stated. Beyond Bitcoin accumulation, Green Minerals signaled its broader intent to integrate blockchain solutions into its mining operations. The company cited supply chain transparency, mineral origin certification, and operational efficiency as key blockchain-enabled improvements, suggesting a hybrid approach that aligns Web3 technology with industrial resource development. This mirrors growing interest in blockchain-based supply chain solutions among mining and logistics firms worldwide, where immutability and decentralization can ensure authenticity and sustainability—a key selling point in the increasingly ESG-conscious investment world. Following Strategy’s Playbook Green Minerals’ Bitcoin pivot follows a growing trend led by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and its chairman Michael Saylor, who has famously turned his enterprise software company into a Bitcoin powerhouse with more than 592,300 BTC—worth over $62 billion—held on its balance sheet. According to bitcointreasuries.com, more than 245 public companies now hold Bitcoin, a number that has grown by 13% in the past month alone, with cumulative holdings exceeding $88 billion. Other companies like Upexi, Wellgistics Health, and DeFi Development Corp. have taken a similar path, albeit expanding their crypto exposure to include assets like XRP and Solana. Bitcoin treasury data (Source: Bitcointreasuries ) While Green Minerals did not specify how many BTC it intends to accumulate initially, the $1.2 billion ceiling implies a substantial potential purchase that would instantly rank the firm among the top institutional holders of Bitcoin globally. Despite the bold announcement, investors responded with concern. Shares of Green Minerals plunged nearly 35% on Tuesday following the news, as markets weighed the ambitious Bitcoin strategy against regulatory uncertainty and ongoing setbacks in its core mining business. Critics argue that the company may be diverting focus from its already embattled seabed mining initiatives at a time when public sentiment and government policy are increasingly aligned against extractive oceanic practices. Additionally, Norway’s energy politics present a complicating factor. The government’s call for a reassessment of power-intensive industries—including crypto mining—could ultimately restrict Green Minerals’ ability to scale any digital asset-related ventures domestically, especially if future infrastructure needs intersect with regulatory bottlenecks. A Long-Term Bet on Bitcoin Regardless of short-term turbulence, Green Minerals is positioning itself as an early European adopter of Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset—a bold bet that aligns it with a growing cohort of global firms seeking refuge from inflationary fiat regimes and volatile commodity cycles. The company’s move also brings attention to a broader shift: as environmental regulations tighten and capital becomes harder to secure in traditional markets, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as an investment, but as a core financial infrastructure—especially by firms with long timelines and high exposure to macroeconomic risk. Whether Green Minerals can execute this vision successfully—and appease skeptical investors—remains to be seen. But in committing up to $1.2 billion to Bitcoin, the company has made clear that it sees the world’s leading digital asset not just as a hedge, but as a cornerstone for future value creation.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9700/clean-spark-and-green-minerals-expand-bitcoin-strategies-amid-market-shifts,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T11:57:26,"Trump's Crypto Involvement Still Muddies GENIUS Bill Progress","Down the years Donald Trump's business dealings have often raised eyebrows, known better as a property magnate and developer his interests have also spanned whiskey, steaks, education, television entertainment and obviously you cannot fail to notice the two United States Presidential election wins having switched from being a Democrat to a Republican.One of his latest family ventures has, of course, been the foray into social media with Truth Social, and his endeavours in Bitcoin that range from Stablecoin involvement down to good old non fungible tokens (NFT's) and meme stock, but based on the most recent company disclosures published on the website of World Liberty Financial, it seems that the Trump family may have divested their ownership to the point where they are no longer the ventures majority shareholders.Following research from a number of crypto focus websites, it has been discovered that the latest releases by WLF show that the family of the current President have now reduced its stake from a majority of 60%, down to a still sizeable minority of just 40%, and although there are no official statements yet on the reasons that exist behind the change, it does of course come on the verge of the US Senate gearing up to pass legislation that would regulate Stablecoins. For normal people who use crypto related offerings such as bitcoin online casinos , they can only probably dream of the kind of returns that the Commander in Chief has received alongside the relevant involved members of his family.It is already known that the 47th President and his family may have potentially gained to the tune of $57 million from their involvement in the company based on the filings from last year, but it has obviously led to plenty of commentary surrounding the ethics and fairness of the President backing a bill that would regulate one of his own companies. Self regulation around the world has rarely ever ended up with not creating great consequences, but given that Stablecoin at face value will now be under stricter regulation and a more stable footing, the bill also has its supporters.Those objecting stepped up their own complaints when President Trump appeared to give no wriggle room to the fact that the House of Representatives should automatically stamp the Senate's stablecoin bill through with approval, but the detractors are far from swayed and they more than made their points known during Monday's session, suggesting that the details still needed to be properly worked through and that this would definitely take some additional time.French Hill, the representative chairman of the House Financial Services Committee that has been at the primary stage of all stablecoin debate for the past few years in Congress, would not commit to honouring the President's request that lawmakers in the House summarily passed the bill through, and instead was quite determined that talks with the leadership were already underway because there were a number of issues that were required to be ironed out between the Senate's approved text, and the version that the House already had in progress.It seems that there will be no 'LIGHTNING FAST' approval of the so called 'GENIUS Act' that number 47 requested was got to his 'desk, ASAP - NO DELAYS, NO ADD ONS' in a previous visit to his own social media site.The Trump family dropping to 40% will quieten questions, but they will certainly not end them.

2025-06-25T11:56:10,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Top Analyst Eyeing $140K","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Top Analyst Eyeing $140K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a shaky start to the week, Bitcoin has bounced back strongly , now trading around $107,000 with a 5% recovery. But according to popular crypto analyst Crypto Rover, this could be just the beginning. He believes Bitcoin is preparing for its next major breakout, and this one might send prices soaring to $140,000. Bitcoin Price Eying $140k In a recent tweet post, crypto analyst Crypto Rove r believes Bitcoin is currently forming a bullish pattern known as a “bull flag,” which often leads to explosive upward moves in past Bitcoin cycles. He notes that Bitcoin has now spent nearly 200 days in sideways consolidation, a phase very similar to ones seen before earlier bull runs. In his view, once Bitcoin breaks past the $110,000 resistance, the path to $130K–$140K could open up rapidly. “This could be the final run-up,” Rover said, calling it “the most hated rally” as many remain skeptical during the consolidation phase. On-Chain Data Supports the Breakout Adding to Rover’s bullish thesis, data from CryptoQuant reveals that only 40,000 BTC per day is currently being sent to exchanges, the lowest level seen in over a decade. Historically, such low flows have coincided with market bottoms and the start of major rallies, including in 2016, 2019, and most recently in 2023. At the same time, Bitcoin spot ETFs are showing strong institutional demand. According to Fairside data , there have now been two consecutive weeks of inflows, with $588.55 million added on June 24 alone. Ethereum Eyeing $4000 Mark While the spotlight is on Bitcoin, Crypto Rover also has high hopes for Ethereum (ETH). Backed by a $4.4 million long position, he expects ETH to rise significantly, especially with signs of heavy accumulation from institutions like BlackRock. He has predicted that the ETH price could range between $2,600 and $4,000 , depending on how the breakout unfolds. He further added that current funding rates on both BTC and ETH are near zero or even negative, another classic sign of a bullish bottom forming.

2025-06-25T11:45:46,"Analyst Says $170,000 Bitcoin Is Closer Than You Think, BTC Approaching ‘Steep Part’ of Cycle","A popular crypto analyst believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) will hit the $170,000 mark sooner than most expect. Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 532,100 followers on the social media platform X that after a correction into the $90,000 range, Bitcoin may soon increase more than 60% from its current value. “$95,000 would make sense structurally. Then $170,000 is closer than you think.” TechDev’s bullish case is based on several indicators. He believes Bitcoin’s cycles have been correlated to the performance of the overall macroeconomy. Based on his chart and historical patterns, the analyst suggests the business cycle is bottoming and may start to increase, which has coincided with massive Bitcoin rallies in 2013, 2017 and 2021, when the flagship crypto asset hit the cycle peaks. “Re-evaluate your top calls.” Source: TechDev/X TechDev also uses the copper-to-gold ratio as a reliable signal pointing to a likely massive Bitcoin surge. The copper/gold ratio, often viewed as a proxy for economic risk appetite, has formed a bottom similar to 2020 and 2016, which preceded BTC bull runs, the analyst says. “The steep part lies ahead.” Source: TechDev/X The analyst previously said the M2 money supply’s year-over-year change is pointing to a brewing Bitcoin surge. The global M2 money supply – a key indicator of liquidity in the world’s financial system – has shifted from negative to positive annual growth. According to the analyst, this shift has historically preceded each of Bitcoin’s parabolic rallies by six to ten months, indicating a strong likelihood that a new upward cycle is approaching.

2025-06-25T11:40:43,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 25, 2025","After a day of significant increases, the crypto market is down today. The majority of the top 100 coins have dropped over the past 24 hours. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has fallen by 1.6% in that period to $3.4 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $99.8 billion. TLDR: The crypto market makes a turn back into red; Most top 100 coins saw price drops: BTC and ETH appreciated less than 1% each, trading at $106,413 and $2,443, respectively; Markets reacted to de-escalation in the Middle East, with higher-risk assets benefiting; ’Some are focused on short-term corrections, but Bitcoin is ultimately on the rise’; The market remains cautious; Geopolitical risks persists, as does the risk of investors turning away from risk assets. Crypto Winners & Losers Six of the top 10 coins per market cap are up, but with low increases of less than 1% per coin. Bitcoin (BTC) appreciated by 0.7%, now trading at $106,413. This is up from $101,924 seen two days ago. Furthermore, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated by 0.8%, changing hands at $2,443. It’s one of the category’s best performers again today. Lido Staked Ether (STETH) and Tron (TRX) also recorded a 0.8% rise each. XRP (XRP) recorded the highest decrease in this category of 0.7% to the price of $2.18. Moreover, the majority of the top 100 coins saw their prices drop over the past day. The highest decrease among these is Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL)’s 8.5% to $1.56. On the other hand, Pi Network (PI) appreciated the most today: 13.4% to $0.5998. This is the only double-digit change in this category. Aptos (APT) follows with a 9% rise to $4.83. Notably, the market has cooled off following several positive news seen yesterday. The prices saw a swift uptick yesterday after Japan’s Financial Services Agency proposed to reclassify digital assets under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which could cut crypto taxes from 55% to 20% and increase chances for spot ETFs.

That said, the dip is “not a long-term concern and is merely a distraction from Bitcoin’s true trajectory,” Harz says. “While some are fixated on short-term corrections, it is undeniable that Bitcoin, and particularly Bitcoin DeFi, is ultimately on the rise.” It’s certain that Bitcoin is actively maturing and entering a phase defined by institutional adoption, clearer regulation, and rapid technological progress, he says. This is because Bitcoin’s utility, says Harz. Institutions don’t just want to hold Bitcoin, but put it to work too. Moreover, Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , argued that Bitcoin’s safe-haven asset status is still taking shape. However, “recent signals suggest it’s edging closer.” “Traditionally seen as volatile, Bitcoin’s response to recent macro shocks, like the events in the Middle East, has been notably restrained, neither tracking gold perfectly nor mirroring equity sell-offs,” says Chait. Geopolitical shocks often trigger an initial flight to cash, but Chait says that “the combination of institutional rallies and macro-driven bids now means that dips are shallower and recoveries faster than in previous cycles.” “In recent market downturns, Bitcoin’s relatively shallow pullbacks, which have been paired with consistent institutional inflows, point to a shift in perception. Its increasing correlation with gold suggests it’s being viewed as a store of value, while on the other hand, its rapid rebounds reflect its growing integration into mainstream finance,” Chait concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $106,413. Over the last day, the price gradually increased from the daily low of $104,854 to the intraday high of $106,691. The coin has surpassed the $106,000 level. Investors now wait to see if it will break the $107,500 level next, or possibly drop below $104,000. These moves would open doors for further price rises or drops. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,443.

However, a recent Bybit report reveals a shift in sentiment, with XRP standing out as a strong altcoin contender. From November to May, XRP holdings on the platform more than doubled, and its price surged by 338%, from $0.50 to $2.19. This rise came as legal pressures between Ripple vs SEC eased , boosting confidence among retail and institutional investors. Despite the broader market favoring Bitcoin, XRP is now gaining momentum as traders begin shifting focus to its growing potential. XRP ETF Approval Hopes Fuel NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 Another boost came from speculation over an XRP spot ETF . According to prediction platform Polymarket, there’s an 85% chance of approval this year. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart is even more optimistic, placing the odds at 95%. Although President Trump’s comments about XRP becoming part of a U.S. crypto reserve didn’t pan out, they still helped fuel interest. Bybit noted that XRP’s holding percentage jumped from 1.29% to 2.42% in just six months. Bitcoin Remains King Despite XRP’s impressive gains , Bitcoin remains the clear market leader. Bybit’s data shows that 30.95% of assets held by users are in BTC. For every $1 of ETH held, there’s $4 in BTC. Bitcoin dominance has risen from 53.2% to 64% over the past year, while Ether’s share dropped from 18% to 9%. The concentration of BTC and ETH fell to 48.2% in early 2025 but bounced back to 58.8% by May, showing strong investor confidence. Institutions Still Opting for BTC and ETH The report reveals a clear divide between institutional and retail investor strategies. As of May 2025, retail traders held just 11.64% in BTC and 6.8% in ETH, nearly half the institutional holdings. This gap points to the cautious approach institutions take, favoring regulated large caps, while retail players remain more experimental. [post_titles_links postid=”474655″] Altseason Delayed? Altcoins have struggled recently, with the Altcoin Season Index dropping to 12 after stabilising at 17, its lowest in two years. Interest in smaller cryptocurrencies dropped sharply, from 35.2% in November to 23.5% in May. Meme coins and DeFi tokens held up relatively well, but AI tokens, GameFi, and NFTs saw declines. Despite Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high in May, altcoins failed to rally, suggesting that the traditional “altseason” is either delayed or canceled for now. This signals a strong Bitcoin season, where BTC outperforms top 50 altcoins. Institutions are favoring major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, pouring capital into ETFs and related investment products instead of rotating into smaller altcoins. Hopes for an altcoin rally have faded for now, as big players stick to the more established names.

2025-06-25T11:38:40,"Top Two ‘Whale Approved’ Altcoins To Buy Now","The post Top Two ‘Whale Approved’ Altcoins To Buy Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market has been volatile lately . Bitcoin dropped below $100K, and several altcoins, including Ethereum, Hyperliquid, Cardano, and Virtuals, plunged 20–30%. But on the contrary, whales and institutions are buying aggressively. Altcoin Buzz discussed this behavior in a recent video, highlighting how smart money is taking advantage of the dip while retail sentiment turns negative. Whales Are Buying the Dip Bitcoin, in particular, is showing strong signs of accumulation. Wallets holding 10 BTC or more are increasing while smaller wallets are shrinking. When large wallets are buying and retail investors are losing confidence, it is the perfect setup for bullish momentum to return to the crypto market. Bitcoin's elite vs. mortal wallets are moving in two different directions as its market value sits just north of $104.3K.

MicroStrategy also added another $26 million worth of Bitcoin recently. Bitcoin ETFs have almost bought $1 billion BTC in the past 2 days. On June 24, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $589 million in net inflows, marking the 11th straight day of gains. Bitcoin ETFs are buying 3x more than the weekly mined supply, a clear sign that a supply shock may be coming soon. LINK and ADA See Heavy Accumulation Chainlink is also catching the attention of big investors. While most projects drop in price after a token unlock, LINK often sees a price rise. Whales are buying even at higher prices. Data from Santiment shows that LINK jumped 11% today as the number of holders hit a new all-time high at 769,380. Additionally, active wallets over the past year are down 17.3% which shows that long-term holders see this as a prime buying opportunity.

In June alone, $310 million worth of ADA was accumulated, which is likely from large investors, not retail buyers. This kind of steady buying shows confidence in the long-term future of Cardano. Founder Charles Hoskinson’s willingness to work with other major crypto projects like Bitcoin and XRP has also boosted investor trust.

Whales and institutions are aggressively buying dips, seeing current volatility as a prime accumulation opportunity. They are positioning for future bullish momentum while retail sentiment turns negative. What does the increasing accumulation by large wallets mean for Bitcoin? The increase in wallets holding 10 BTC or more, combined with shrinking smaller wallets, suggests a redistribution of Bitcoin to strong hands, often a precursor to bullish market momentum.

After posting a solid 29.2% gain in Q2 so far, BTC might be gearing up for its next leg up, according to crypto analysts on X. Bitcoin Price Performance in Q2 2025 Q2 Growth: 29.2% so far April Return: 14.2% May Return: 11.1% June Return (so far): 1.90% In May, Bitcoin climbed from $94,177.90 to touch a monthly high of $111,704 on May 22. But after hitting that peak, BTC retraced 9.11% between May 23 and June 5. A brief rebound of 8.61% followed between June 6 and 10—but the price couldn’t break the previous swing high. Between June 11 and 22, Bitcoin dipped again by 8.46%, only to bounce 1.2% in the last 24 hours—hinting at possible renewed momentum. Bullish Flag Pattern Forming: Analyst Insight Crypto analyst Caption Faibik , in a recent post on X, revealed that Bitcoin is forming a classic bullish flag pattern—a continuation setup that often signals the next leg of a bull run. “Before the next surge, BTC may briefly dip to the $97K–$98K range,” says Faibik. “Once it breaks past the $108K resistance, the rally toward $130K is likely.” The bullish flag pattern features: A strong upward move (the flagpole) A slight downward or sideways consolidation (the flag) A breakout above the flag’s upper boundary signals continuation of the trend Bitcoin’s Key Levels to Watch Support Zone: $97,000–$98,000 Breakout Level: $108,000 Midterm Target Post-Breakout: $130,000 Experts agree that a strong daily close above $108K will confirm the bullish breakout and could open the doors to the much-anticipated six-figure surge. BTC Community Reacts: Dip Before the Rocket? Crypto analyst Chainbull and several BTC enthusiasts echo Faibik’s prediction, believing that the current dip is a healthy consolidation before the next leg up. If Bitcoin follows the expected pattern, a breakout to $130K could become the dominant narrative going into Q3.The charts suggest Bitcoin isn’t done yet. A short dip could lead to a major breakout—and BTC could be heading to $130K sooner than expected.

On June 25, Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd, a London-listed gold miner, has secured a £2 million funding facility, with £1 million available immediately, to begin implementing its Bitcoin Treasury strategy. The facility is structured as a zero-interest loan, maturing on 31 Dec. 2026, with the option for the lender to convert the debt into Bluebird shares at 2 pence per share. The funds will be used to purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ), marking the company’s entry into digital asset holdings alongside its core business in gold mining.

2025-06-25T11:25:54,"Crypto Stocks Surge as Iran-Israel Ceasefire Holds—For Now","U.S. crypto stocks rallied sharply on Tuesday after a tentative ceasefire between Iran and Israel , brokered by President Donald Trump, managed to hold despite early violations. The broader financial markets also posted gains, with investors seemingly relieved that the Middle East tensions had not escalated further—at least for the moment. Trump declared the ceasefire on social media late Monday, boldly asserting it would “go on forever.” However, both nations reportedly exchanged missile fire soon after the agreement took effect. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump criticized the behavior of both countries. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing,” he said. Coinbase Leads S&P 500 Gains as Robinhood Follows Among crypto stocks, Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) emerged as the standout performer. The crypto exchange closed the day with a 12.10% gain, making it the top gainer in the S&P 500 index. Mining companies also saw strong advances, with Riot Platforms rising 8.09%, Marathon Digital climbing 4.94%, and MicroStrategy—led by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor—adding 2.68%, according to Google Finance. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD) also benefited from the renewed optimism, posting a 7.41% gain. The retail brokerage’s uptick coincided with the launch of a new promotional campaign offering a 1% crypto deposit match, which runs through July 7. The S&P 500 itself rose 1.11% on the day, signaling broad market confidence even amid geopolitical uncertainties. Analysts noted that risk-on sentiment returned as fears of full-scale conflict between Iran and Israel temporarily eased. Mixed Reaction Across Crypto Stocks Despite the surge, not all crypto stocks participated in the rally. Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) fell 15.49% during Tuesday’s session. Still, the newly listed company remains up nearly 620% since debuting on June 6 at $31. Meanwhile, the crypto market held steady. Bitcoin gained 1.20% over the past 24 hours to trade at $106,487, while Ether rose 1.99% and XRP climbed 1.92%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The rising investor interest in digital asset firms has encouraged others to consider going public. On June 23, reports surfaced that leading crypto exchange OKX is exploring a U.S. listing following its return to the American market.

The document includes a 2014 email exchange between several industry insiders, including tech journalist Reutzel Bailey. In it, Bailey points out that Ripple’s concept existed even before Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 , raising new questions about who really started the digital finance revolution. 2014 E-mails confirm: “Ripple is older than Bitcoin.” pic.twitter.com/9c8cOF4065 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 24, 2025 Ripple’s Early Days According to Bailey, it was Ryan Fugger who first came up with Ripple in 2004. He created a platform called RipplePay to let people move value peer-to-peer, without relying on banks. However, it was Chris Larsen, now Ripple’s co-founder, who later took the project to the next level. Bailey believes Larsen tapped into the growing hype around Bitcoin to reframe Ripple as a cryptocurrency . “Larsen pushed this [Ripple] as a cryptocurrency to catch attention because the platform itself was not really about cryptocurrency at all,” Bailey said. Debunking the Copycat Myth The email conversation also dismantles claims that Ripple mimicked Bitcoin. Industry voice Jeffrey Cliff firmly stated , “Ripple predates Bitcoin,” countering concepts of Ripple as a “ copycat math-based currency .” Furthermore, Ripple’s concept emerged in 2004, and its cryptocurrency, XRP, was launched in 2012, which was four years after Bitcoin’s 2008 debut. This timeline firms Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency, even as Ripple claims an earlier ideological spark. [post_titles_links postid=”474636″] From RipplePay to the XRP Ledger In 2011, developers Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto , and David Schwartz began building the XRP Ledger (XRPL). They aimed to create something more efficient than Bitcoin, especially by avoiding its energy-heavy proof-of-work system. McCaleb reached out to Fugger and convinced him to turn RipplePay into a crypto network. That led to the creation of NewCoin in 2012, which was soon renamed OpenCoin , and later simply Ripple . The XRPL creators gave 80 billion XRP to Ripple. McCaleb personally received 9.5 billion XRP, which he sold off gradually – completing his exit in 2022. After leaving Ripple, he went on to co-found Stellar. Meanwhile, Chris Larsen stayed on and still serves as Ripple’s chairman today. A Legacy Beyond Bitcoin While Bitcoin may hold the title of the first true cryptocurrency, Ripple’s earlier origins show that the idea of decentralized value transfer was already taking shape years before. Today, as Ripple continues to innovate in cross-border payments, this rediscovered history adds depth to its role in the crypto world, reminding us that Ripple wasn’t just another Bitcoin competitor, but possibly one of the first to imagine a world beyond banks.

2025-06-25T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Nears $107K as Ceasefire Lifts Markets, Powell Eyed","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Crypto prices rose on Wednesday, riding the same relief wave that lifted global equities after Iran and Israel accepted a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. With the threat of an immediate oil supply crunch fading, traders moved back into risk assets. The price of bitcoin BTC rose to near $107,000, adding 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index gained 1%. That advance may be short-lived. “’Optimism about the fragile ceasefire holding between Iran and Israel has bubbled through markets, lifting equities, but more doubts are now creeping in about the truce holding,” said Susannah Streeter, the head of money markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. “A leaked report from U.S. Intelligence casting doubt on the effectiveness of the U.S. strikes in crippling Tehran’s nuclear capabilities, has led to some worries that military action could resume,” she said. Still, the ceasefire wasn’t the only reason for the rally. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told House lawmakers that the central bank is being patient before moving forward with interest-rate cuts. Powell pointed out that inflation is still elevated and could face additional pressure from tariffs in coming months. “Powell’s emphasis on a wait-and-see” approach underscores short-term uncertainty in rate policy,” Bitunix analysts wrote in an emailed statement. “The remarks provide markets with flexibility and are overall supportive of risk assets, but investors should closely monitor upcoming tariff developments and inflation data.” U.S. consumer-confidence data softened , pulling two-year Treasury yields to a six-week low of 3.78% and raising the perceived chances of a rate cut in July to about 20%, according to the CME’s FedWatch tool. That's up from about 13% a week ago. On Polymarket , traders are weighing an 18% chance of a cut. Powell will later today testify before a Senate committee. Traders will keep a close eye on the testimony, which comes as President Donald Trump keeps pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates, posting yesterday they should be “at least two to three points lower.” Crypto derivatives desks show a neutral approach around the 27 June expiry: Traders sold straddles and short puts close to $105,000 and $100,000, suggesting an expectation of tight price action, Jake O, OTC trader at Wintermute, said. Call option buying eyeing $108,000 and $112,000 for July and September points, however, to a modest bullish inclination, Jake added. Stay alert!

The last “White Brick” was placed anonymously, slotted right between two CryptoPunks, cementing meme culture into NFT history. The collector called MOG “the natural heir” to the NFT movement, linking punk provenance to memetic momentum. Artist Lorenzo Masnah said the mural’s punchline was intentional: “And I was excited to put this laughing cat up there because if you don’t quite understand memeconomics—the future of digital currency and art—JOKE’S ON YOU!” The Joycat image marks a symbolic shift from identity-driven NFTs to pure cultural velocity. The NFT Wall now stands as a prophecy and landmark as a snapshot of crypto’s chaotic, creative and ungovernable future. Derivatives Positioning The annualized three-month BTC futures basis on offshore exchanges has advanced slightly to 5% as sentiment stabilizes with BTC's quick rebound above $100K. The level, however, remains below May highs above 7%. A similar pattern is seen in ETH. BTC and ETH basis on the CME remain below 10%, with ETH slightly pricier than BTC. Perpetual funding rates for most major coins, including BCH and APT, continue to paint a moderately bullish picture.

2025-06-25T11:10:50,"ProCap BTC’s Bold Move: Anthony Pompliano’s Firm Files SEC 8-K for Monumental Public Listing and $1 Billion Bitcoin Acquisition","BitcoinWorld ProCap BTC’s Bold Move: Anthony Pompliano’s Firm Files SEC 8-K for Monumental Public Listing and $1 Billion Bitcoin Acquisition The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as a significant development unfolds, signaling a deepening convergence between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. At the heart of this excitement is the latest move by ProCap BTC , a firm founded by the influential American entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano , which has officially initiated steps to become a publicly traded entity. This strategic maneuver promises to reshape the landscape of institutional crypto investment, bringing a prominent Bitcoin advocate’s vision to the public markets. Understanding the Significance of This SEC Filing : What Does an 8-K Mean? An 8-K filing is a crucial document submitted by public companies to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It’s essentially a ‘current report’ that companies must file to announce major events that shareholders should know about. For ProCap BTC, this 8-K filing is not just a formality; it’s a declaration of intent, outlining their strategic merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. This move is a pivotal step towards establishing ProCap Financial as a new publicly traded entity, set to list under the ticker symbol CCCM. This type of filing is typically used for significant corporate events, such as changes in control, acquisitions, or in this case, a definitive merger agreement that paves the way for a public listing. The SEC’s oversight in such mergers ensures transparency and investor protection. While the crypto space often operates with a degree of decentralization, any entity seeking to bridge into traditional capital markets must navigate stringent regulatory frameworks. ProCap BTC’s proactive engagement with the SEC demonstrates a commitment to legitimacy and compliance, which could set a precedent for other crypto-native firms eyeing public markets. This regulatory dance is complex, given the SEC’s evolving stance on digital assets. For a company primarily focused on Bitcoin, which the SEC generally considers a commodity, the path might be clearer than for those dealing with tokens deemed securities. Nevertheless, the entire process, from initial filings to eventual listing, demands meticulous adherence to corporate governance and disclosure standards. This adherence to regulatory processes is vital for building trust among institutional investors and the broader public, who may still view the crypto market with skepticism. It signifies a maturation of the industry, moving from niche speculative assets to mainstream financial instruments. The very act of filing an 8-K signals a company’s readiness to open its books and operations to public scrutiny, a level of transparency often missing in the earlier, less regulated days of crypto. It also provides a foundational legal document for the upcoming public listing, outlining the terms and conditions of the merger and the future operational structure of ProCap Financial. Who is Anthony Pompliano and Why Does His Vision for ProCap BTC Matter? Anthony Pompliano, widely known as ‘Pomp,’ is a prominent figure in the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency community. A former Facebook and Snapchat product manager, Pomp transitioned into venture capital and became a vocal advocate for Bitcoin. His influence stems from his engaging content, including his popular ‘Pomp Podcast’ and his active presence on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). He has consistently championed Bitcoin as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a revolutionary technology capable of disrupting traditional financial systems. His early and consistent support for Bitcoin, even during bear markets, has cemented his reputation as a thought leader in the space, earning him a loyal following among crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors alike. ProCap BTC, under Pompliano’s leadership, was established with a clear vision: to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. The firm has consistently emphasized strategic investment in Bitcoin, reflecting Pompliano’s long-held belief in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. This public listing isn’t just about capital; it’s about amplifying ProCap BTC’s mission and making institutional-grade Bitcoin exposure more accessible to a wider array of investors. It’s a move that aligns with his broader narrative of Bitcoin’s inevitable integration into mainstream finance, demonstrating a tangible step towards that future. Pomp’s involvement lends significant credibility to ProCap BTC’s endeavors. His ability to articulate complex crypto concepts to a broad audience, combined with his network in both tech and finance, positions ProCap BTC uniquely for this ambitious public offering. His personal brand is intrinsically linked to the firm’s identity, attracting both retail and institutional interest. When a figure like Pompliano, with his track record and conviction, throws his weight behind such a significant corporate action, it resonates deeply within the crypto community and beyond, signaling confidence in the asset class and potentially inspiring others to follow suit. How Will ProCap BTC Navigate Its Journey to a Public Listing ? The planned merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. is the chosen vehicle for ProCap BTC’s public debut. Mergers with existing public shell companies or Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) have become a popular route for private companies to go public faster than a traditional IPO. While specific financial terms of the merger are still being finalized and will be detailed in subsequent filings, the strategic alignment with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. suggests a synergy aimed at leveraging existing public market infrastructure. Columbus Circle Capital Corp. likely brings a pre-existing public shell, potentially streamlining the listing process and reducing the time and cost associated with a traditional initial public offering (IPO), which can often be a lengthy and expensive undertaking. Upon finalization, the combined entity will operate under the name ProCap Financial, a strategic rebranding that reflects its broader financial ambitions beyond just Bitcoin. This new name signals a potential expansion into other digital asset classes or related financial services in the future, positioning the company as a comprehensive player in the evolving financial landscape. The choice of CCCM as the ticker symbol for the Nasdaq or NYSE listing is a crucial identifier, providing investors with a clear, accessible way to trade shares of the new company. This transition from a private firm to a publicly traded entity introduces new layers of scrutiny, reporting requirements, and corporate governance. Public companies are subject to quarterly and annual reporting, stricter auditing, and greater transparency requirements, which ultimately benefit investors by providing more comprehensive information and accountability. The benefits of going public for ProCap Financial are multi-faceted and extend beyond just raising capital. They include: Enhanced Capital Access: Public companies can raise significant capital through stock offerings, which can fuel growth, expansion, and large-scale investments like the planned Bitcoin acquisition. This capital can also be used for research and development, hiring top talent, or acquiring other businesses, providing a robust financial foundation for future endeavors. Increased Visibility and Credibility: A public listing brings greater public awareness and legitimacy, attracting a wider range of investors, including institutional funds that often have mandates to invest only in publicly traded entities. This increased profile can also enhance business partnerships and customer trust, opening doors to new opportunities. Liquidity for Early Investors: Going public provides an exit strategy for early investors and employees, allowing them to convert their stakes into liquid assets. This liquidity is a strong incentive for venture capitalists and angel investors who typically seek a clear path to realizing returns on their investments, making future fundraising easier. Talent Attraction: Publicly traded companies can offer stock options and other equity incentives, making them more attractive to top talent in a competitive market. The ability to offer publicly traded stock as compensation can be a powerful recruitment tool, helping to build a strong and experienced team. Improved Governance: Public companies typically adopt more robust corporate governance structures to comply with regulatory requirements, which can lead to better decision-making and accountability. This often results in a more disciplined and professionally managed organization. The Audacious Plan: A $1 Billion Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy One of the most compelling aspects of ProCap BTC’s public offering is its previously stated ambition to acquire up to $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This is not merely a passive investment; it’s a strategic move that underscores the firm’s conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value and a hedge against inflation. Such a substantial acquisition would position ProCap Financial as a significant institutional holder of Bitcoin, alongside major players like MicroStrategy, various Bitcoin spot ETFs, and other corporate treasuries that have added BTC to their balance sheets. This scale of investment reflects a strong bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future price performance and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class, signaling confidence in its digital gold narrative. The methods for this acquisition could vary, potentially including direct spot purchases from exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) deals to minimize market impact, or even strategic investments in Bitcoin mining operations. Given the scale, a diversified approach is likely to manage execution risk and price volatility. The firm might also explore options like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate volatility risks over time, or structured products to gain exposure without directly holding the underlying asset, though direct holding seems to be the stated intent. OTC desks are often preferred for large institutional buys to prevent significant price slippage that could occur from placing large orders on open exchanges, ensuring a more efficient and less disruptive acquisition process. A $1 billion Bitcoin acquisition by a publicly traded entity like ProCap Financial would send a strong signal to the market. It reinforces the narrative of institutional adoption, demonstrating that sophisticated investors are increasingly comfortable allocating significant capital to digital assets. This influx of capital could provide substantial buying pressure for Bitcoin, potentially influencing its price trajectory and overall market sentiment. It also serves as a validation for other corporations and institutions considering similar moves, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a treasury asset and an integral part of modern investment portfolios. The long-term implications for Bitcoin’s market capitalization and liquidity are substantial. Key Aspects of $1B BTC Acquisition Description Purpose Strategic long-term holding, balance sheet asset, institutional exposure to digital gold. Potential Methods Direct spot purchases, OTC deals, investments in mining infrastructure, structured products. Market Impact Increased institutional demand, potential price support, enhanced legitimacy for BTC, reduced supply on exchanges. Risk Factors Price volatility, evolving regulatory landscape, operational security for large holdings, market liquidity for such large buys. What are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Market and Beyond? ProCap BTC’s move is a microcosm of a larger trend: the increasing convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As more crypto-native companies seek public listings and more traditional financial institutions offer crypto products, the lines between these two worlds blur. This integration brings both opportunities and challenges, including the need for robust regulatory frameworks that can accommodate innovation while protecting investors. The success of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. has already opened the floodgates for institutional capital, and ProCap Financial’s direct public listing takes this integration a step further, providing another regulated pathway for exposure. The SEC’s role is critical here. While they have been cautious with certain crypto products, particularly those deemed securities, their engagement with firms like ProCap BTC seeking public listing through traditional routes indicates a willingness to oversee and regulate legitimate operations. This could pave the way for clearer guidelines and more predictable pathways for other crypto businesses looking to enter mainstream finance. The ongoing dialogue between regulators and industry participants is crucial for fostering an environment where innovation can thrive within a secure and compliant framework. This public offering could serve as a case study for future crypto firms contemplating a similar path, potentially accelerating the mainstream adoption of digital assets. This development could inspire a wave of similar initiatives. We might see more crypto investment firms, blockchain technology companies, and even DeFi protocols exploring traditional public markets as a means to scale and attract broader capital. This maturation of the industry is crucial for its long-term sustainability and widespread adoption. It signifies a shift from the fringes of finance to its core, as digital assets become an undeniable part of global investment portfolios. The ripple effect could lead to greater liquidity, deeper markets, and ultimately, more stability for the entire crypto ecosystem, fostering a more robust and resilient digital economy. Challenges and Opportunities While the prospect of ProCap Financial’s public listing and substantial Bitcoin acquisition is exciting, it’s essential to consider both the potential hurdles and the vast opportunities that lie ahead: Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Navigating complex and evolving SEC regulations, especially concerning crypto assets, remains a dynamic challenge. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of Bitcoin can impact the company’s balance sheet, profitability, and investor confidence, requiring sophisticated risk management strategies. Competition: A growing number of Bitcoin investment vehicles and public companies in the crypto space means ProCap Financial will operate in a competitive environment. Operational Security: Ensuring the secure custody of a substantial Bitcoin holding is paramount and requires cutting-edge security protocols and practices. Public Perception: Managing public perception and educating traditional investors about the value proposition of digital assets will be ongoing tasks. Opportunities: First-Mover Advantage: Potentially establishing itself as a leading publicly traded Bitcoin investment vehicle, attracting early institutional capital. Institutional Inflow: Attracting significant capital from institutions seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin without directly managing the complexities of crypto custody. Market Education: Helping to legitimize Bitcoin further in the eyes of mainstream investors and corporations, fostering broader acceptance. Innovation: Using public capital to fund further innovations in crypto financial products, services, and blockchain technology, driving future growth. Diversification: Offering a unique investment opportunity for portfolios looking to diversify into digital assets through a traditional stock market vehicle. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors interested in the crypto space but preferring traditional investment vehicles, ProCap Financial (CCCM) could offer a new avenue for exposure to Bitcoin. Here are some actionable insights: It’s crucial to conduct thorough due diligence on the company’s financial health, management team, and specific investment strategies once more details become publicly available through subsequent SEC filings (e.g., S-1 or F-1 registration statements). Monitor the broader regulatory environment for digital assets, as changes can significantly impact companies operating in this sector. Stay informed about SEC announcements and legislative developments. Consider the company’s long-term vision for its Bitcoin holdings and how it plans to manage volatility and security risks. Understand their approach to custody and risk mitigation. Evaluate the competitive landscape. How does ProCap Financial differentiate itself from existing Bitcoin ETFs or other publicly traded companies with significant Bitcoin holdings? As with any investment, consider your own risk tolerance and investment objectives before allocating capital to a company like ProCap Financial. The journey of ProCap BTC, from a visionary firm led by Anthony Pompliano to a publicly traded entity known as ProCap Financial, marks a significant milestone in the ongoing integration of digital assets into the global financial landscape. The ambitious plan for a $1 billion Bitcoin acquisition, coupled with the rigorous process of an SEC filing and public listing, underscores a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value and the maturation of the crypto industry. This development is not just a win for ProCap BTC; it’s a powerful testament to the transformative potential of cryptocurrency, paving the way for more institutional adoption and mainstream recognition. As ProCap Financial prepares to list under CCCM, the eyes of both the crypto and traditional financial worlds will be watching closely, anticipating the next chapter in this exciting narrative, and the profound impact it may have on the future of finance.

2025-06-25T11:05:53,"Google’s Quantum Computing Could Threaten Bitcoin Encryption, Warns NYDIG","The post Google’s Quantum Computing Could Threaten Bitcoin Encryption, Warns NYDIG appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Every time quantum computing advances, one question echoes across the crypto world: Is Bitcoin still secure? Google’s latest announcement has reignited that fear. The tech giant revealed a major leap in quantum capabilities, slashing the number of qubits needed to break RSA encryption from 20 million to just 1 million. That’s a massive jump, and it has sparked urgent debate about the future safety of Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundation . Table of contents What’s Happening with Quantum Computing? Understanding the Threat to Bitcoin Why RSA and Bitcoin’s Encryption Could Be at Risk Is Bitcoin Safe Right Now? Can Post-Quantum Cryptography Save Bitcoin? Conclusion: No Immediate Panic, But Urgent Preparation Needed FAQs What’s Happening with Quantum Computing? Quantum computing is no longer theoretical. Using principles like superposition and entanglement, these machines can process data in ways traditional computers can’t. Today’s quantum computers can operate with over 100 qubits, and advancements in error correction are making them increasingly stable and practical. The field is accelerating, and with it comes a looming concern: Can this tech break encryption standards like RSA—and eventually Bitcoin’s? Understanding the Threat to Bitcoin Bitcoin doesn’t use RSA. Instead, it relies on ECDSA and increasingly, Schnorr signatures, for cryptographic security. These offer multiple advantages: Smaller keys with equivalent security Faster processing Multi-signature aggregation for enhanced privacy But here’s the catch: According to a new report by the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), these systems are not immune. As quantum computing progresses, even Bitcoin’s current cryptography may become vulnerable. Why RSA and Bitcoin’s Encryption Could Be at Risk RSA encryption is widely used and considered secure because it relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. That security was challenged in 1994 when Peter Shor introduced an algorithm capable of cracking RSA, if run on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. Back then, such a machine didn’t exist. Today, we’re getting closer. With Google’s quantum milestone, that theoretical threat is beginning to look like a real-world problem. Is Bitcoin Safe Right Now? For now, yes. Bitcoin’s current cryptographic protections are strong enough against both classical and existing quantum computers. But the landscape is changing: Quantum hardware is improving rapidly Error correction is advancing Hybrid quantum-classical systems are being developed The clock is ticking. Bitcoin may be safe today—but without upgrades, that may not hold true in the next decade. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : She Thought It Was Love… Then Lost $430K in a Crypto Scam , Can Post-Quantum Cryptography Save Bitcoin? There is ongoing work in the field of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)—algorithms specifically designed to resist quantum attacks. But NYDIG’s report highlights some challenges: Larger keys and signatures Slower transaction speeds Reduced performance across the Bitcoin network This means that integrating PQC into Bitcoin is possible, but not without trade-offs in speed, efficiency, and scalability. Conclusion: No Immediate Panic, But Urgent Preparation Needed Bitcoin is not under threat today, but complacency is not an option. The takeaway from NYDIG and Google’s announcement is clear: the crypto industry must act now to ensure long-term security. Whether that means adopting post-quantum cryptographic standards or developing new protocols, the future of decentralized finance may depend on it. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Google Quantum AI explores quantum computing, which uses quantum mechanics (like superposition) to solve problems classical computers can’t. They aim to build large-scale, error-corrected quantum computers for various applications. Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computers right now? Yes, Bitcoin’s current cryptography (ECDSA, Schnorr signatures) is secure against existing classical and quantum computers. However, rapid advancements mean future vulnerability is possible. How does Google’s quantum computing breakthrough affect Bitcoin’s security? Google’s reduction of qubits needed to break RSA (from 20M to 1M) highlights the accelerating threat. While Bitcoin doesn’t use RSA, similar algorithms like ECDSA could eventually be at risk.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/googles-quantum-computing-could-threaten-bitcoin-encryption-warns-nydig/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T11:01:02,"NYSE Breaks New Ground: Trump Media’s Crypto ETF Eyes Listing","NYSE Arca has officially submitted a rule change proposal (SR-NYSEArca-2025-45) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking approval to list the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. The dual-asset fund, introduced last week by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), seeks to provide direct exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether within a single investment vehicle. Source: NYSE The application, filed via SEC Form 19b-4 , represents the next step following the ETF’s initial prospectus submission, which proposed a 3-to-1 value allocation favoring Bitcoin over Ether. If approved, the ETF would trade under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E, which governs commodity-based trust shares. NYSE Seeks Rule Change to List Trump Media’s Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF As outlined in the filing, the fund is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, LLC, with digital asset custody managed by Foris DAX Trust Company. Notably, pricing transparency will be provided through benchmark rates supplied by CF Benchmarks, a standard provider used in other SEC-approved ETFs. And also, the daily NAV, total holdings, and intraday indicative values will be published, with updates every 15 seconds during market hours. Trump Media filed with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, while the Trump Organization unveiled a $499 U.S.-made smartphone. #trump #etf https://t.co/tFTibnN0lg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 The fund’s creation and redemption process will occur in-kind, in blocks of 10,000 shares through authorized participants. This model allows the trust to deliver and receive Bitcoin and Ether directly, reducing potential tax implications and improving pricing efficiency. To meet SEC expectations for investor protection, NYSE Arca emphasized its membership in the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG) and cited reliance on market data from CME’s Bitcoin and Ether futures markets for pricing accuracy and fraud detection. The exchange also reaffirmed that it can apply existing market safeguards such as trading halts and compliance monitoring. NYSE Arca further emphasized that existing frameworks are sufficient to detect and prevent potential fraud or manipulation in the crypto markets. The proposed rule change must now go through the SEC’s formal review process. Once published in the Federal Register, the agency will open a comment period. The SEC will then decide to approve, reject, or extend the review timeline. If granted, the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum Trust would be one of the first U.S.-listed ETFs to offer simultaneous exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether. The move follows the SEC’s earlier approval of single-asset Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others. Trump Media Expands with Crypto ETF Ambitions Trump Media is moving closer to launching its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, but the fund faces steep competition and trust hurdles in a crowded market. #TruthSocial #BitcoinETF https://t.co/oBIWgcH4CX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 This is not the only ETF in development. Earlier this month, NYSE Arca also filed to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF , which would hold Bitcoin exclusively. Both products are part of Trump Media’s broader push into digital assets. @TrumpMediaTech has unveiled a $400M stock buyback and maintains a $2.3B Bitcoin reserve. #TrumpMedia #Bitcoin https://t.co/oCc9eMHuSo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 23, 2025 The company has announced plans to repurchase up to $400 million of its own shares and raised $2.32 billion through a private placement to establish a Bitcoin treasury. As of late May, $2.4 billion has been raised, though no acquisitions have yet been disclosed. Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social social platform, streaming service Truth+, and fintech brand Truth.Fi, has proposed additional funds, including the America First Bitcoin Fund and the America First Stablecoin Income Fund.

Cloud mining, with its low barriers to entry, high flexibility and green energy efficiency, is rapidly becoming a new entry point for mainstream investors to obtain crypto income. Compared with the traditional mining model, it avoids high hardware investment and complex operation and maintenance processes, providing a lower threshold for professional miners and ordinary investors to participate, becoming the most watched development trend in the crypto economy. Anyone – from newbies to experienced investors – can profit from cloud mining with just a smartphone and a few hundred dollars. But is it really possible to mine $9,000 without owning any hardware?
