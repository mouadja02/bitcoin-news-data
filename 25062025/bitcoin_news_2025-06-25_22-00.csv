2025-06-25T19:41:28,"SoFi to Launch Blockchain Remittances With Stablecoins as Crypto Returns to Platform","U.S.-based fintech platform SoFi (SOFI) said on Wednesday it will introduce international remittances through blockchain and stablecoins and allow users to invest in cryptocurrencies this year, making good on its promised digital asset push. The upcoming remittance service will let users send U.S. dollars and select stablecoins to recipients abroad with ""well-known"" blockchain networks processing the transactions, allowing funds to be sent around the clock, converted into local currencies and deposited quickly into recipients' accounts, according to the press release . The company says this will be significantly cheaper and faster than traditional methods such as wire transfers or bank-based remittances. The firm will also relaunch crypto trading services, letting users buy, sell and hold major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTC and Ethereum's ether ETH later this year. Future services could include staking, borrowing against crypto holdings and providing blockchain tech infrastructure to third-parties through SoFi’s Galileo platform, the firm said. The moves come as CEO Anthony Noto shared plans earlier this year to re-enter the crypto business after the firm suspended digital asset-related services in 2023 in order to obtain banking license under the previous administration's harsher regulatory environment towards crypto. The change is backed by recent guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that allows nationally chartered banks to offer crypto custody and stablecoin-related services. ""The future of financial services is being completely reinvented through innovations in crypto, digital assets, and blockchain more broadly,"" said Noto in a statment. ""We’re accelerating our efforts to give members more choice and more control, whether they’re investing, sending money across borders, or planning for their future.""

2025-06-25T19:30:45,"Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align","The Bitcoin price surge above $106,000 this week has reignited bullish sentiment across the market, with analysts suggesting that the stars are aligning for a rally to a new all-time high. From shifting geopolitical tensions to a major regulatory pivot in the United States (US), multiple macroeconomic factors appear to be setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next explosive move. Ceasefire And Rate Cut Buzz Fuel Bitcoin Price Optimism Over the weekend, the Bitcoin price briefly slipped, triggering over $200 million in leveraged long liquidations. However, this dip proved short-lived as the flagship cryptocurrency rebounded swiftly above $100,000 following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a total ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This sudden de-escalation helped ease global market anxiety, pushing Bitcoin past $106,000 and oil prices sharply down from $77 to under $70. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters ‘New Era’ Simultaneously, Optimism is building that the US Federal Reserve (FED) could begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Sharing new data by CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, crypto analyst CW disclosed that the odds of a FED rate cut have increased to 18.6% by July 30 during the scheduled FOMC meeting. The report reveals that 81.4% of market participants believe the FED to keep rates unchanged at their current level. However, FedWatch’s data indicates growing expectations for a rate cut by the September FOMC meeting, with 79% betting on a reduction and only 21.3% anticipating no change. Notably, lower interest rates generally benefit risk assets like Bitcoin by increasing liquidity and boosting investor sentiment. With geopolitical tensions easing and a possibly looser monetary policy on the horizon, Bitcoin could gain further momentum, potentially climbing to $110,000. Supporting this bullish forecast, crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin is gearing up for a rally toward a new ATH of $110,000 following its recent reclaim of the key $103,500 level. Although a retracement to around $102,500 remains possible, Bennett believes that once BTC cleans up support around $103,400, formed during Monday’s expansion, the next move could be parabolic. Regulatory Win Solidify Bitcoin’s Position In TradFi Beyond anticipated rate cuts and ceasefire announcements, the US FED recently made a landmark policy shift that could have profound long-term implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. By removing “reputational risk” as a factor in evaluating crypto firms’ access to bank servicing, the FED is effectively ending a key pillar of Operation Checkpoint 2.0—a campaign that restricted over 30 crypto and fintech companies from traditional financial infrastructure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Deviates From Global M2 Money Supply, Is The Bull Run Over? This recent change clears the way for greater institutional involvement in crypto. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have also followed suit, green-lighting crypto activities for banks and allowing them to participate in the digital assets market without prior approval. Together, these moves mark a regulatory pivot that not only legitimizes the crypto industry but could also accelerate demand and capital inflows into Bitcoin, potentially boosting its already significant valuation.

2025-06-25T19:19:54,"SharpLink Gaming Doubles Down on ETH with $30.6M Buy, Becomes World’s Largest Public Holder","Sports betting company SharpLink Gaming has solidified its position as the world’s largest publicly traded Ethereum holder, acquiring an additional 12,207 ETH for $30.6 million in a five-day buying spree that ended June 20. The Minneapolis-based firm now controls 188,478 ETH , worth approximately $457 million at current prices. This represents one of the audacious corporate crypto strategies since MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation campaign . Today, SharpLink announces that our ETH holdings have further increased to 188,478, which were acquired at an average price of $2,513 per ETH. https://t.co/7kENpBWM41 pic.twitter.com/reFHxplxA9 — SharpLink Gaming (@SharpLinkGaming) June 24, 2025 “ Increasing SharpLink’s ETH holdings underscores our forward-thinking approach to creating long-term value for our stockholders ,” said Joseph Lubin, Chairman of SharpLink’s Board and Ethereum co-founder. Since adopting Ethereum as its primary reserve asset on June 2, the company has generated 120 ETH in staking rewards while achieving 18.97% ETH per share growth, according to the company’s announcement . Strategic Vision Behind the Ethereum Bet SharpLink’s transformation began with a $425 million private placement led by Consensys Software Inc. in May. SharpLink Gaming has landed a $425 million private investment in public equity deal, with blockchain leader @Consensys #Gaming #Ethereum https://t.co/xdHEYt7rB8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 The deal brought Lubin aboard as Chairman, providing institutional credibility and deep Ethereum expertise to guide the company’s treasury strategy. Rather than holding cash or bonds, the company has committed to Ethereum as its primary reserve asset, making it the first Nasdaq-listed company to adopt an ETH-focused treasury model. SharpLink’s approach extends beyond simple price speculation, with the company deploying 100% of its ETH holdings in staking solutions to generate yield while supporting Ethereum’s network security. This dual-purpose strategy allows the firm to earn additional ETH rewards while participating in the network’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, potentially creating a compounding effect as staking rewards are reinvested. The timing appears calculated, coming as Ethereum trades within a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800 after surging 80% from April lows. Industry observers note that SharpLink’s accumulation coincides with growing institutional interest in ETH staking, particularly as more than 35 million ETH tokens have been staked , representing over 28% of the total supply locked in smart contracts. Ethereum staking has reached a new milestone this week, with more than 35 million ETH, over 28.3% of the total supply. #Ethereum #Staking https://t.co/KPGqYuLR5p — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 21, 2025 The company’s aggressive equity-to-crypto conversion model has also created some speculations in the traditional finance circles, particularly given the gaming sector’s historically conservative approach to balance sheet management. Institutional Momentum Builds Across Multiple Fronts Institutional demand for ETH continues to accelerate through traditional channels. In recent weeks, BlackRock and Fidelity poured over $21 million into Ethereum ETFs , while on-chain data shows whale wallets accumulated 871,000 ETH in a single day earlier this month. Ethereum is seeing its most aggressive whale accumulation in seven years, raising speculations about what comes next for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. #Ethereum #Whale https://t.co/R6YYsZtrzW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 17, 2025 We’re beginning to witness a mature approach to the company’s adoption strategy, as it is becoming more selective about the digital assets that align with its specific business models. Recent developments across the crypto space support this thesis, as SharpLink’s strategy is just a mirror of a broader trend of institutional capital flowing into alternative cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. Earlier this week, China’s Nano Labs announced a $500 million convertible note agreement to accumulate up to $1 billion in BNB tokens, targeting 5-10% of the total circulating supply. @NanoLabsLtd has entered into a $500 million convertible note agreement as part of a broader strategy to accumulate BNB worth up to $1 billion. #NanoLabs #BNB https://t.co/mPyfq9HiSQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 Similarly, Nasdaq-listed Classover Holdings has revealed plans to raise $500 million for a Solana-based treasury , with 80% of proceeds allocated to SOL purchases. Even traditional blockchain projects are exploring treasury diversification, with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson proposing a $100 million conversion of ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin . These moves suggest that the era of single-asset treasury strategies may be ending as companies seek to optimize their crypto holdings for specific use cases.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown early signs of recovery, while Solana and XRP are emerging as top altcoins poised to capitalize on the shift in sentiment. With global uncertainty dialing down, traders are now focused on breakout potential and upcoming resistance levels across key digital assets. This timely analysis is supported by Outset PR —a crypto-native PR agency that transforms market momentum into high-visibility storytelling. When the headlines shift, Outset PR ensures your project’s narrative moves in sync with the market. Ethereum (ETH): Poised for a Strong Recovery After Stabilization Source: tradingview Ethereum (ETH) is finding its footing between $2,000 and $2,500 as broader market sentiment improves. While recent pullbacks have tested short-term support, Ethereum’s fundamentals and developer momentum remain rock solid. A move back above $2,400 could set the stage for a retest of the $3,400 resistance—offering over 40% upside from current levels. With the RSI signaling room for growth and tensions easing globally, ETH may be gearing up for its next leg higher. Bitcoin (BTC): Holding Strong With Eyes on Breakout Above $113K Source: tradingview Bitcoin (BTC) is navigating a consolidation zone between $96,000 and $107,000, building strength for a breakout. With support holding at $92,000 and bullish sentiment returning as geopolitical fears subside, BTC could challenge the $113,000 resistance soon. If cleared, the next target lies near $123,000, offering a potential 10% rally. Despite short-term fluctuations, Bitcoin continues to be the dominant force in the market and remains on solid footing for a continued climb. Solana (SOL): Oversold and Ready for a Sharp Rebound? Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is currently trading between $119 and $152, showing signs of consolidation after recent price pressure. The RSI suggests the asset may be oversold, presenting a prime entry point for bullish traders. With growing developer activity and adoption, a breakout above $171 could pave the way toward $204—a potential 35% surge. Solana remains one of the most promising altcoins for the next market wave, especially if positive momentum returns. XRP: Momentum Building as Bulls Eye $2.95 Target Source: tradingview XRP is showing surprising resilience, holding steady between $1.84 and $2.27 while maintaining key support at $1.66. The RSI near 51 and a slight MACD uptick signal balanced conditions that could soon favor bulls. If XRP crosses the $2.52 resistance, it could accelerate toward $2.95, unlocking more than 20% upside. With legal clarity improving and interest in cross-border payments growing, XRP is positioning itself for a breakout moment.

2025-06-25T19:00:31,"Ethereum Builds Critical Pattern On Daily Chart, Volatility Ahead","The Ethereum 1-day chart is shaping an intriguing technical formation that could define its next move. This setup reflects growing uncertainty in the market but also sets the stage for high-impact volatility. Ethereum Approaches Decision Point: Breakout Or Breakdown? Ethereum is currently forming a megaphone pattern, a broadening formation characterized by widening price swings and increasing volatility. This structure typically reflects market indecision, as both bulls and bears battle for control, leading to expanding highs and lows. Sharoon Gill noted on X that the widening price action is a key signal that volatility is building, and a significant move could be on the horizon. Sharoon Gill points to two crucial levels to watch closely: a breakout above $2,400 would confirm bullish momentum and pave the way for further gains, while a drop below $2,240 may indicate a bearish breakdown and trigger a downward move. Evrenos Albarson shared a sharp take on Ethereum’s positioning, pointing out that the 4-hour chart looks decent, and for ETH to maintain any bullish momentum, it must reclaim the $2,550 level, a threshold that would signal strength and consolidation to the upside. However, if ETH fails to push above $2,550, the market could face a sudden drop to $1,800 as Evrenos Albarson targets a support zone from the consolidation phases. According to Bit Amberly, Ethereum is showing early signs of a rebound as it bounces off the lower boundary of a broadening wedge. This pattern, often associated with potential reversals, suggests that ETH may be gearing up for a bullish push and provide key support holds. If ETH holds above the $2,400 area, it will open the door for a climb toward $2,500, with further upside targets at $2,680 and $2,850 levels, which align with previous reaction zones and technical extensions. Ethereum Clears Channel, But Can It Sustain Above Resistance? Ethereum has broken out of a descending channel on the 2-hour chart, a move that signals a shift in short-term bullish momentum. This breakout marks the end of the recent downtrend . Currently, Crypto Avi mentioned that ETH is trying to break through the major resistance zone at $2,446 on the chart. If ETH manages to break above the resistance zone, the next upside target will be $2,700, a level that aligns with short-term technical projections. Whales_Crypto_Trading reported that Ethereum has successfully breached the ascending channel formation on the 8-hour chart, showing an acceleration in bullish momentum, pushing ETH beyond a technical boundary that had contained price action. If the momentum continues to build, Whales_Crypto_Trading suggests that ETH could surge toward the next target at $3,050, a level that represents an important resistance zone.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-builds-critical-pattern/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|Bit Amberly|Crypto Avi|ETH|ETH Price|ethereum price|ETHSUD|ETHUSDT|Evrenos Albarson|Sharoon Gill|Whales_Crypto_Trading",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T18:45:47,"US Senator Adam Schiff Introduces Legislation To Stop President Trump’s ‘Exploitation’ of Digital Assets","US Senator Adam Schiff has introduced a new bill that aims to prevent President Donald Trump and his family members from enriching themselves via crypto. The potential legislation , titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, high-ranking executive branch employees, special government employees and members of Congress from issuing, sponsoring or endorsing digital assets. The ban would last from 180 days prior to an individual’s public services until two years afterward, and it would also extend to officials’ immediate family members. If passed, the bill would also require public officials to include crypto assets in their annual financial disclosures and periodic transaction reports. Schiff (D-California) says in a new press release that Trump’s crypto deals “have raised significant ethical, legal and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of the presidency to enrich himself and his family.” “That’s why I am introducing legislation to prevent the financial exploitation of any digital assets by public officials, including the president and the First Family. We need far greater scrutiny of the president’s financial dealings, and to stop him and any other politician from profiting off of such schemes.” Trump’s recent financial disclosure with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics indicated he pocketed more than $57.3 million worth of income from the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Income from Trump’s controversial memecoin, Official Trump, wasn’t listed on the disclosure because it was released in 2025. Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials. The president hosted the top 220 TRUMP memecoin holders at his private national golf club in Washington, DC last month. The announcement of the event caused the price of the asset to skyrocket .

2025-06-25T18:43:17,"AI predicts Dogecoin price for July 1, 2025","As meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin ( DOGE ) continues to trade in tandem with the broader market, two artificial intelligence (AI) models are projecting that the token is likely to make modest moves on July 1. Their forecasts suggest a price range between $0.158 and $0.185, depending on how the broader market develops. As of press time, DOGE was trading at $0.16, gaining about 0.6% in the past 24 hours. However, the meme coin remains down nearly 1% on the weekly timeline. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Overall, sentiment around the asset is bearish, as confirmed by technical indicators. Dogecoin is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $0.202 and its 200-day SMA of $0.187, signaling continued downside pressure. Additionally, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 40.54, pointing to neutral-to-bearish momentum with room to decline further before reaching oversold conditions. ChatGPT predicts DOGE price Regarding the price outlook, OpenAI’s ChatGPT presented three potential scenarios for Dogecoin on July 1, shaped mainly by Bitcoin’s trajectory, market sentiment, and trading volume. In a bullish scenario, if Bitcoin ( BTC ) breaks through key resistance levels and Dogecoin garners renewed attention on platforms like X, the coin could rise to between $0.175 and $0.185. ChatGPT highlighted DOGE’s sensitivity to influencer buzz and meme-driven hype, noting that a surge in volume could spark a 5–10% rally. In a neutral scenario, Dogecoin is expected to trade within a tighter band of $0.165 to $0.170, assuming Bitcoin remains stable and no major DOGE-related news emerges. In such a case, the token could drift slightly upward in line with recent consolidation trends. On the bearish end, DOGE could fall between $0.158 and $0.162 if Bitcoin pulls back or if DOGE loses technical support around $0.163. Weak sentiment, low trading volume, or regulatory concerns could accelerate a drop below the $0.16 level. DOGE price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts DOGE price Meanwhile, Grok, xAI’s predictive model, issued a single forecast projecting Dogecoin to reach $0.17 by July 1. Based on its current price of $0.16 and DOGE’s historically volatile nature, Grok assumes modest upward momentum driven by community enthusiasm or a general market rebound.

2025-06-25T18:41:04,"Billionaire Philippe Laffont Hints at Bitcoin Price Doubling, Says De-dollarization and End of US Exceptionalism Coming Into Play","Billionaire investor Philippe Laffont says that he’s been taking more time to think about Bitcoin, and wondering why he didn’t get involved with BTC earlier. In a new interview on CNBC, Laffont, the co-founder of hedge fund Coatue Management, says that when trying to estimate the “net worth” of the entire global economy, he feels that it’s not unreasonable for Bitcoin to represent at least one or two percent of that. Translated into pricing, it would suggest that BTC could double in value at some point in the future, putting the flagship cryptocurrency above the $200,000 mark. Says Laffont, “Every day I do think ‘why do I not own it?’ And I think to be a good investor, it’s not just owning the obvious stock, sometimes you have to change your mind and say ‘well I made a mistake and I’m changing my mind’ and maybe Bitcoin will be like that… I thought of like the market cap of the world [and] the net worth of the world is, I think $450 to $500 trillion, equities are let’s say $120 trillion, gold above and under the ground is $20 trillion. And then Bitcoin is $2 trillion. And I was like okay, well $2 trillion – let’s say it represents half a percent of the net worth of the world, could it go to one of two. Some people say Bitcoin’s going to $100 trillion, I’m like okay that’s maybe a bit of an aggressive estimate but could it double or a period of time? And then we talked about the de-dollarization, the end of US exceptionalism, so those would be of the reasons.” At time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,566.

2025-06-25T18:30:17,"Why Bitcoin Whales Are Rapidly Moving Into MAGACOIN FINANCE Alongside XRP and Kaspa","As digital asset markets mature, institutional and high-net-worth investors—often called “whales”—are quietly rotating capital toward early-stage projects with structural integrity and growth potential . In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading this shift, alongside growing whale interest in XRP and Kaspa , signaling a new wave of focused accumulation beyond Bitcoin’s traditional reach. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Smart Money Magnet MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly earned credibility among strategic investors, raising over $10 million in its pre-sale and selling out multiple rounds with consistent velocity. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens , a completed audit by HashEx , and its no-VC, community-governed structure offer transparency rarely seen in early projects. Whale wallets show steady accumulation, and on-chain metrics reflect rising wallet concentration and minimal churn—two signals of long-term conviction. The project’s focus on operational staking and passive income utility has positioned it as a prime candidate for those seeking a blend of security, scalability, and potential appreciation. Bitcoin: The Original Whale Play Bitcoin continues to dominate market capitalization and long-term portfolios. However, with its recent climb above $111,000 , many whales are now reallocating portions of their BTC holdings into new assets that offer earlier-stage potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefiting directly from this strategic redistribution. XRP: Diversifying for Growth XRP’s established role in cross-border payments remains intact, but regulatory ambiguity and slower price movement have prompted many XRP holders to diversify. Strategic capital has begun flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE , as well as Kaspa , which is gaining traction for its innovation and on-chain efficiency. Kaspa: The Technical Powerhouse Kaspa’s unique architecture and high-speed proof-of-work consensus have earned it a growing base of large investors. With favorable funding rates and accumulation signals rising, Kaspa is emerging as a legitimate competitor in the high-performance layer-1 space, often alongside mentions of MAGACOIN FINANCE in analyst portfolios. Conclusion As whale capital rotates with precision in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE , XRP , and Kaspa are emerging as core allocations for investors seeking structural soundness and early growth trajectories. For those tracking where the smartest money is moving, these three assets are clearly on the radar.

2025-06-25T18:30:16,"BlackRock Executive Says the Quiet Part Out Loud about Ripple (XRP)","A recent post by well-known crypto commentator Digital Asset Investor has stirred fresh speculation around Ripple and its ties to institutional power. The post centers on a pointed observation about a BlackRock executive’s remarks regarding XRP, hinting that there’s more to Ripple’s strategy than meets the eye. Digital Asset Investor wrote: “If I’ve learned anything about Ripple in the last 7 years, it’s that most don’t leave… they’re deployed.” This comment aimed to connect Robbie’s past experience at Ripple with his present as BlackRock’s digital asset leadership. This suggests that Ripple’s connections within traditional finance and government circles aren’t accidental, but strategic. According to him, the movement of key personnel between Ripple and major financial institutions reflects a deliberate effort to position XRP at the center of global financial infrastructure. BlackRock Head Of Digital Assets says the quiet part out loud. If I've learned anything about @Ripple in the last 7 years it's that most don't leave..they're deployed. If you think Robbie missed the part about XRP being created by Bitcoin developers to be a better Bitcoin you… pic.twitter.com/oV6LpBMcdk — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) June 25, 2025 He continued with a sharp critique aimed at anyone downplaying XRP’s origins: “If you think Robbie missed the part about XRP being created by Bitcoin developers to be a better Bitcoin, you would be the perfect buyer of my igloo in south Georgia.” The reference to “Robbie” aimed at BlackRock’s digital asset leadership, implying that those in charge know exactly w hat XRP represents and are not overlooking its foundational design or long-term purpose. XRP: Engineered to Improve on Bitcoin Digital Asset Investor’s claim about XRP’s origin is well-supported. XRP was developed by a team including Jed McCaleb, David Schwartz, and Arthur Britto—all of whom were closely involved in the early Bitcoin ecosystem. Dissatisfied with Bitcoin’s slow transaction times and energy-heavy proof-of-work mechanism, the team designed XRP as a faster, more scalable digital asset capable of handling real-world financial use cases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike Bitcoin, which functions mainly as a decentralized store of value, XRP was designed to move value quickly and efficiently, particularly across borders . This focus on speed, cost, and scalability has long made XRP a unique asset within the crypto space and a potential fit for financial institutions seeking blockchain-powered solutions. Institutional Interest Is Not a Coincidence Digital Asset Investor’s post implies that institutions like BlackRock are more aware of XRP’s value than they let on publicly. While traditional media often focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum, insiders in the crypto space have speculated for years that XRP’s real-world utility and foundational design have caught the attention of Wall Street’s top firms, quietly but deliberately. The idea that key industry figures are “deployed” rather than coincidentally employed aligns with a long-standing belief in the XRP community: that Ripple’s influence and its network run deep within global financial corridors. Digital Asset Investor’s latest comments pull back the curtain on a narrative long whispered in crypto circles. If XRP truly was created to improve upon Bitcoin, and if major institutions like BlackRock recognize this, then the silence around XRP’s potential may be more strategic than skeptical. The quiet part is being said out loud, and the implications are hard to ignore. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-25T18:23:00,"In 2010, Hal Finney described the Bitcoin banks of the future. What did he say, and do we have such banks today?","In a 2010 Bitcointalk forum post, Hal Finney, a cypherpunk involved in Bitcoin from day one, described the way he sees the emergence of Bitcoin banks in the future. He believed that peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions would be rare. Instead, people will use better-scaled digital cash issued by Bitcoin-backed banks. Table of Contents How was Hal Finney, and what did he write about Bitcoin banks? Was he talking about Bitcoin treasuries? Do Bitcoin banks exist today? How was Hal Finney, and what did he write about Bitcoin banks? Finney was a cypherpunk community veteran, working on various solutions that would help maintain online privacy. For years, Finney worked at PGP Corporation. He is the creator of the first reusable proof-of-work system, and he was the first person to receive a BTC transaction from none other than Satoshi Nakamoto. No wonder he was an influential figure in the Bitcoin community. He died in 2014 at the age of 58. In December 2010, the Bitcointalk user with the wobber handle initiated the discussion about how Bitcoin banks could work. While some people suggested that such banks could safely store clients’ bitcoins, charging them some fees or giving loans against Bitcoin, others were skeptical, viewing the idea as worthless. One of the users even mentioned Ripple as an already existing example. Hal Finney joined the discussion. He wrote that Bitcoin-backed banks have a good reason to exist. He saw Bitcoin banks as organizations issuing Bitcoin-redeemable digital cash for settling transactions. Finney noted that Bitcoin is not an efficient means of exchange, so the secondary layer payment system will solve this problem. In another post, he explained that large purchases in Bitcoin need more time so that the parties involved will see several confirmations. Finney saw Bitcoin-backed digital currencies issued by banks as the way to avoid this inconvenience. According to Finney, Bitcoin will be used by banks to settle net transfers between each other, while individuals will use other digital money for regular transactions. Finney said that banks can have different policies, currencies, interest rates, etc. He mentioned George Selgin’s findings on free banking as the reference for Bitcoin banks and stated that these banks could be self-regulating, stable, and inflation-resistant. Read more: Who is Hal Finney, and did he create Bitcoin? Was he talking about Bitcoin treasuries? On June 22, 2025, a Bitcoin Strategy CEO at Semler, Joe Burnett, published a screenshot of Finney’s post, stating, “Hal Finney foresaw the rise of bitcoin treasury companies.” Hal Finney foresaw the rise of bitcoin treasury companies. pic.twitter.com/Fa0J39WCss — Joe Burnett, MSBA (@IIICapital) June 22, 2025 George Selgin, whose work was mentioned in Finney’s post about Bitcoin banks, noted that Burnett is wrong that Finney was talking about something similar to Bitcoin treasuries. He wrote: “Mr. Burnett doesn’t seem to know the difference between a bank and a treasury company, two entirely different things. What Finney envisioned was a competitive system of Bitcoin-based banks, the IOUs of which would serve as second-layer payments media.” It’s fair to say that Finney’s vision is way different from Bitcoin treasury companies, as they don’t issue Bitcoin-backed digital cash that would have exchange properties. Treasuries issue stocks that are influenced by Bitcoin but not backed by it. More than that, these stocks are not used to buy anything. Treasuries (e.g., Strategy) often issue debt to purchase more bitcoins, hoping that Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation will pay off the debt or at least propel stock prices higher. Free banking, mentioned by Finney, supposes the existence of private currencies issued by banks. Such banks existed in the 19th century in several countries; however, by the 1950s, they were gone. Do Bitcoin banks exist today? The banks described by Hal Finney don’t exist today. However, he wasn’t completely wrong about Bitcoin-backed banks. Some banks have elements of Bitcoin banks, while the crypto community embraced stablecoins, which serve as a convenient means of payment and savings. For instance, some banks create treasuries to accumulate Bitcoin. They do it to hedge against fiat money debasement and believe Bitcoin reserves can boost their holdings. One of the banks that recently started to accumulate Bitcoin is Solar Bank . The idea of a second-layer digital payment system and multiple digital currencies is fully realized in the form of the altcoin market. Many cryptocurrencies are cheap and quick to transact, so in this regard, Finney was close to what we know today. However, only a few of them are issued by the banks; mostly, it is stablecoins. Central banks of several countries are working on CBDCs, which are not Bitcoin-backed. The DeFi platforms may provide some of the banking services in a decentralized manner; for instance, you may lend or borrow crypto there or keep it in exchange for yield. However, one cannot redeem these cryptocurrencies for a fixed Bitcoin price. Such a phenomenon as neobanks is a type of platforms that provide bank-like services and allow operations with crypto. Indeed, until Bitcoin becomes much more widely used as a means of payment, there is no reason for Bitcoin banks to emerge, for there won't be any profit in supplying substitutes for a relatively upopular means of exchange. — George Selgin (@GeorgeSelgin) June 23, 2025 Selgin claimed that he doesn’t think Bitcoin banks will emerge soon, as there will not be profit “in supplying substitutes for a relatively unpopular means of exchange.” However, Selgin is not dismissing the possible emergence of Bitcoin banks in the future.

2025-06-25T18:22:16,"Kalshi crosses billion-dollar mark as DC’s legal dust begins to settle","With a courtroom battle barely in the rearview, Kalshi is reportedly raising over $100 million at a valuation topping $1 billion. The timing suggests a calculated bet: that regulated prediction markets are finally finding legal and institutional footing. On June 25, Bloomberg reported that Kalshi, the federally regulated prediction market, is raising over $100 million in a funding round led by crypto investment giant Paradigm. The deal would push its valuation above $1 billion and put it in the same league as its unregulated competitor, Polymarket, which is also rumored to be aiming for unicorn status with a fresh $200 million capital injection. Kalshi’s raise comes just weeks after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission abandoned its legal fight to block Kalshi from offering political event contracts, effectively greenlighting a market that lets users bet on election outcomes under U.S. oversight. You might also like: Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC files 8-K with U.S. SEC to go public via merger As legal clouds lift, Kalshi turns to growth and distinction The CFTC’s recent surrender in its case against Kalshi marks a turning point. For months, the agency argued that political betting threatened market integrity, but Judge Jia Cobb’s September ruling, later upheld, found the CFTC overstepped its authority. The agency’s abrupt withdrawal in May, without explanation, suggests regulators may be shifting tactics rather than conceding entirely. Advocacy groups like Better Markets warn the precedent could invite manipulation and distort election integrity, but for investors, it signals a rare alignment: a crypto-native business model operating within U.S. law. While Kalshi has not publicly detailed how the capital will be deployed, the company is likely looking to expand its footprint ahead of the 2026 midterms and further develop its exchange infrastructure while scaling its compliance architecture. The CFTC retreat effectively removed one of the biggest obstacles to Kalshi’s long-term operation inside the U.S., and the company is keen to set precedents for how risk, opinion, and information might be traded legally in the open. By contrast, Polymarket, Kalshi’s closest competitor, continues to operate in murkier waters. Regulation vs. rebellion: the billion-dollar split in prediction markets Polymarket is nearing a $200 million raise at a comparable valuation, per The Information. Despite being banned for U.S. users, the platform has thrived, processing $3.2 billion in election bets in 2024 alone. Its integration with X embeds real-time prediction data into social feeds, blurring the line between gambling and crowd-sourced forecasting. But Polymarket’s success comes with risks. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has repeatedly singled out offshore platforms “providing exposure to U.S. customers,” a thinly veiled reference to the market’s VPN-reliant user base. While backers like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Vitalik Buterin bet on its censorship-resistant model, the looming question is whether regulators will tolerate its growth, or clamp down harder.

The wallet, believed to have been inactive since late 2011 or early 2012, initiated a transaction earlier this week, transferring 61 BTC worth approximately $6 million. The remaining 239 BTC, still residing in the address, are valued at around $24 million. While no funds have yet been sent to known exchange addresses, the move has reignited debate over the behavior of early Bitcoin adopters and the broader implications for the market. Blockchain analytics platform Whale Alert flagged the transaction Sunday, noting the address had shown no activity for over 11 years. These so-called “Satoshi-era” wallets, often attributed to early miners or adopters, contain coins acquired when Bitcoin traded below $10. With today’s price hovering just under $105,000, the owner of this particular wallet is sitting on a return of more than 23,000%. Notably, the activity coincided with heightened market volatility. Following the transfer, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply, breaking key support zones around $100,700 and testing a local low of $98,445 before recovering slightly and strongly on Monday. Market analysts suggest that while the transfer did not trigger a mass panic, it has prompted traders to exercise caution. “These old-school moves can jolt short-term sentiment, with traders watching for potential dump or just a stealthy rebalance,” said one observer on X. The mystery behind the motivation remains. Some speculate the holder could be preparing to liquidate a portion of their holdings, while others suggest it may be part of a larger asset reallocation strategy. Still, the fact that most of the coins remain untouched has offered some relief to investors wary of a sudden flood of supply. This isn’t the only dormant whale to resurface recently. On May 13, another post-Satoshi-era wallet holding 300 BTC, valued at over $31 million, became active after 11.1 years. And in April, a staggering 1,078 BTC worth more than $100 million was moved from a 2013 wallet, underscoring the growing trend of long-silent addresses stirring as Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs. Meanwhile, while retail traders continue to scale back, recent data from Santiment shows that whales and sharks, wallets between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have collectively acquired over 83,000 BTC in the past 30 days. On June 20, Santiment further highlighted how wallets with over 10 BTC increased by 231 in just 10 days. In contrast, smaller wallets holding between 0.001 and 10 BTC declined by 37,465 over the same period. With Bitcoin trading slightly above $107,391 at press time, this accumulation, paired with the reactivations of ancient wallets, highlights how BTC ownership is changing and how these changes can quickly influence market mood and behavior.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/satoshi-decade-old-300-btc-wallet-suddenly-springs-to-life-as-bitcoin-price-stabilizes/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

In a recent testimony to the US Senate, Powell tells members of the Senate’s banking panel that while the US dollar appears to be doing better, the Fed has yet to formally form an opinion on the matter. “I would go back to the thought that markets have been digesting an unusually challenging set of circumstances and have reacted the way they reacted. The dollar has kind of stabilized just now, in fact it’s moved back up in the last couple of weeks a bit. There are plenty of people who are still writing that the dollar is still overvalued, we don’t have a view on that of course… I don’t really have an official view I’d like to share, [but] I think there are possible explanations…one of which is that people still feel the dollar is highly valued, but we’ll see.” Touching on the subject of tariffs, Powell says markets are in uncharted territory since tariffs have only ever been going down for many decades. “We’ve been going through a long period where tariffs have been going down. Since World War 2 really, it’s been a process of lowering tariffs globally… There isn’t a lot of modern learning on that.

MSTR stock was trading at $377 on Wednesday, a few points above this week’s low of $360. It has jumped nearly 70% from its lowest level this year. Strategy stock technical analysis points to a surge The daily chart shows that the MSTR stock price has been in a tight range since May. It has remained above the 100-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages, which have provided it with substantial support. Further, Strategy has formed a bullish pennant pattern, which often leads to additional gains. This pattern is composed of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle, with a breakout occurring when the two lines near their confluence level. The profit target in a bullish pennant is established by first measuring the length of the flagpole and then extrapolating the same distance from the breakout point. In this case, the flagpole’s length is $200—$420 minus $230. The breakout point is $385, bringing the target price to $585, up 52% from the current level. A drop below the support at $342 will invalidate the bullish forecast. This price is the neckline of the double-bottom pattern at $230. MSTR stock price chart | Source: TradingView Odds of Bitcoin price hitting all-time high are rising The main catalyst for the Strategy stock price is the odds of Bitcoin ( BTC ) hitting a record high before October have jumped to 81% on Polymarket .

The project combines meme appeal with technical credibility: a fully audited smart contract via HashEx , capped supply of 170 billion tokens , and a no-VC structure that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its community-first strategy, transparent rollout, and surging demand have made it one of the most closely watched early-stage projects of 2025. For many traders, it evokes the early momentum seen in past generational tokens—fueling speculation it could outperform legacy giants by percentage return. Bitcoin: The Benchmark with Modest Upside Bitcoin has recently pushed past $111,000 , driven by ETF adoption and institutional inflows. While it remains the cornerstone of the crypto market, many long-time BTC investors are allocating a portion of their portfolios to high-upside projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , looking to re-create the outsized returns of Bitcoin’s formative years. Ethereum: Innovation and Maturity Ethereum remains unmatched in smart contract deployment and Layer-2 development. But with its price range tightening, ETH investors are increasingly diversifying. MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the attention of Ethereum holders seeking breakout potential in a more agile, community-controlled ecosystem. Solana: Speed, Adoption, and Diversification Solana continues to perform as one of the fastest Layer-1 blockchains. However, many SOL investors are now turning toward VeChain , drawn to its enterprise focus and ability to execute in regulated environments. The shift underscores a broader trend toward utility-backed assets. VeChain: Real-World Utility on the Rise VeChain is gaining momentum thanks to partnerships, cross-chain compatibility, and growing institutional visibility. As more traders search for blockchain applications with real-world outcomes, VeChain stands out—especially to those rebalancing from more speculative holdings. Conclusion With its disciplined foundation, transparent growth, and rising adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming a contender to match or even exceed the relative percentage performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, VeChain’s enterprise integration is pulling attention from Solana holders seeking long-term reliability. Together, these two projects capture both ends of the crypto opportunity spectrum—early momentum and real-world application.

When confidence returns, altcoins tend to surge. Investors Poised On The Sidelines Many holders seem ready to hit buy. They’re holding onto stablecoins until charts, on-chain data or macro news clear up. A boost in stablecoin flows to exchanges could be one early hint that rotation is starting. Large moves by whale wallets into low-cap tokens may follow. In recent weeks, inflows of stablecoins into trading platforms have ticked higher. That’s a key signal to watch. If weekly inflows rise sharply—say above $5 billion—it may show serious appetite building. Past cycles saw similar spikes just before altcoin rallies began. Another one to monitor is decentralized finance platform volume. When stablecoins move from wallets to lending or liquidity pools, it usually indicates that traders are looking for return and preparing to swap to other tokens.

The notes bear interest at 4.875% and feature a conversion price of $15.87 per share — about 44% above BTDR’s current $11 trading price. The bond’s conversion rate of 62.9921 Class A shares per $1,000 principal means full conversion could yield roughly 20.8 million new shares. To cover this, Bitdeer prepaid Barclays $129.6 million for a call option with a zero strike price on over 10.2 million shares, or 49% of the conversion total. The option allows Bitdeer to settle conversions using shares from Barclays’ inventory rather than tying up its own stock. Bitdeer, is using roughly $129.6 million of the proceeds to fund the zero-strike call option, $36.1 million to pay the cash consideration for its concurrent note exchange transactions, and the remaining funds for datacenter expansion, the development of its ASIC manufacturing and working capital.

2025-06-25T17:31:10,"Bitdeer: The Elephant In The Room","Summary During the quarter ended March, Bitdeer reported $70.1 million in top line revenue a year over year decline of 41.3%. For the first time, the company reported SEALMINER sales as an individual revenue segment. Those sales made up 5.8% of top line revenue and have the company's best gross margins. Based on current market conditions Bitdeer's SEALMINER A2s appear to be highly cost effective machines relative to competing offerings from Bitmain. The company raised over $300 million in a senior convertible note offering. Simultaneous to that raise, Bitdeer spend $130 million on call options that look dubious so far. Back in late-February, I covered Bitdeer ( BTDR ) for Seeking Alpha and spent time dissecting what I felt were the weak points of the company's business. After what I viewed to be a pretty awful year for the company in 2024, my closing takeaway was pretty simple: I see a company that is growing increasingly reliant on a segment that produced the worst gross margins of its four business lines during 2024. But the lone comment to that article pointed out something rather important, Bitdeer is adapting its business and aims to become a major player in the ASIC space. The 'elephant in the room' that I neglected to mention in February was the company's SEALMINER ambitions. After a Q1-25 report with SEALMINER sales broken out, we can assess how that business compares with Bitdeer's existing segments. We'll also look at the recent convertible note offering from the company. SEALMINER Sales & Q1-25 Revenue During the quarter ended March, Bitdeer reported $70.1 million in top line revenue. This was a decline of 41.3% year over year but a slight sequential bump from the $69 million reported at the end of December. More importantly, Bitdeer reported its first quarter of negative gross profit at -$3.2 million: Data by YCharts Adjusted EBITDA was negative by over $56 million and the company drew down its cash position by roughly 55% from $476 million at the end of December to $216 million at the end of March. It wasn't all bad in Q1 though. For the first time, Bitdeer's Q1-25 report gives investors insight into the profitability of the company's mining rig manufacturing segment. And the early indications from that line are good: $ in Millions Revenue Gross Profit Gross Margin Self-Mining $37.2 -$3.8 -10.2% Cloud Hash $0.1 $0.0 0.0% General Hosting $9.6 $0.5 5.2% Membership $16.3 $0.9 5.5% SEALMINERs $4.1 $0.8 19.5% Source: Bitdeer At 19.5% in the first quarter, SEALMINER sales were Bitdeer's most profitable business segment by far. Self-mining actually came in negative after $41 million in COGS to generate $37.2 million in self-mining revenue. Cloud Hash is all but a memory with just $0.1 million in revenue in Q1 while Membership and General Hosting have seen considerable compression in gross margins compared 16% and 23% respectively during 2024. I'll admit, the margin from early SEALMINER sales are encouraging, especially compared to how the rest of Bitdeer's business is performing. But the company has a long way to go before SEALMINERs can make for some of the issues elsewhere. Bitdeer Revenue By Segment (Bitdeer/Author's Chart) SEALMINER sales were a very small portion of the company's top line revenue at just 5.8%. Given the degree to which Bitdeer is scaling self-mining exahash, I would expect self-mining to continue to generate the lion's share of Bitdeer's business for the remainder of this year: Bitdeer Production (Bitdeer/Author's Chart) As of end of May, Bitdeer's self-mining footprint reached 13.6 EH/s. This was largely attributed to the company energizing its SEALMINER rigs for self-mining in addition to selling them to the public. SEALMINER Profitability and Sales Projections When comparing mining rigs, hashrate and joule/TH metrics are often focal points in the market. Yet, powering the most efficient rig by J/TH might not be smart if the purchaser overpays for the machine. Thus, cost per TH is perhaps the more important metric, in my view. The screen shot below shows the top ten Bitcoin mining rigs organized by hashrate. Two of Bitdeer's A2 models crack the top ten but the bigger takeaway is how cost effective these machines are compared to Bitmain machines: Bitcoin Mining Rig Comparison (MiningNow) Keep in mind, this data is changing constantly. But at present time, Bitdeer's A2 rigs can be purchased for less than $10/TH while Bitmain's Antminers are often at least double the price per TH. This is important because it means the payback period on purchasing these machines is effectively half the time for the SEALMINER A2s: A2 Pro Hyd Pricing (MiningNow) The screen shot above shows the payback period on the A2 Pro Hyd is just 262 days given current market conditions. Antiminer S23 Hyd 3U has a payback period closer to 540 days. To me, the real question for Bitdeer investors going forward is can the company scale SEALMINER sales? ASIC Market TAM (Bitdeer) The company certainly believes this to be the case and projects $6.4 billion in revenue between 2025 and 2027 if it can achieve 30% share of the market. Bitdeer spent $59 million on R&D in the quarter - this spend was tied to development of the SEALMINER A3 and A4 units that are expected later this year. Bitdeer is guiding for 5.5-6 joules per TH on the A4s. Which, if achieved, would be a groundbreaking efficiency in the ASIC industry. $330 Million Convertible Note Offering Bitdeer announced a $300 million senior convertible note offering in mid-June. That offering was subsequently up-sized to $330 million and the notes pay 4.875% through July 1st, 2031. Each $1,000 in capital raised has a common stock conversion rate of 62.9921 Class A ordinary shares or $15.88 per share. Possible dilution from the converts - assuming it makes financial sense for the note holders to take BTDR shares - would be 20.8 million shares. Of the roughly $320 million in proceeds from the offering, Bitdeer will spend just under $130 million to pay for a zero-strike call transaction that would limit dilution risk to shareholders. Most of the remaining capital is earmarked for data center growth, ASIC development, working capital, and general corporate purposes. The call transaction is interesting to me. The calls are designed for conversion hedging and flexibility. At 10.2 million shares and a premium of $129.6 million, the price of BTDR stock has to exceed $12.70 per share to justify the wager. At current BTDR prices - $10.98 on June 24th close - you could argue the premium paid for that call transaction could have been better served as a simple repurchase plan rather than as an options play. For instance, at $11 per share, open market repurchases with $129.6 million buy 11.9 million BTDR shares rather than the 10.2 million from the call strategy. It's still very early, but with the benefit of hindsight, the short-term impact of the call strategy appears negative, from where I sit. The company is betting capital based on the assumption that its share price will increase. Which is a positive sign if you're a believer in Bitdeer's growth prospects. I'm much less convinced that Bitdeer can scale self-mining EH/s to 40 by Q4 this year based on where it was at the end of May. But I've been wrong about this company in the past and that could certainly happen again. Valuation Relative to Peers In the past, one of my biggest concerns about Bitdeer stock was its valuation relative to peers. I've typically looked at those valuations through price to book and price to sales multiples. The price to book story looks much better than it has in the past: Data by YCharts At just 2.7x book, BTDR is far less expensive than it was at the beginning of 2025 and is now a bit more in line with peers. The same is true for the forward sales multiple: Data by YCharts Here, we actually see BTDR is on the cheap side at just 2.7x forward sales. This puts the company below the info tech sector median of 2.8x forward sales and well below what we're seeing from the rest of the top miners in the industry. Closing Summary Now that we have a quarter of SEALMINER sales to assess, I'm coming around on Bitdeer. Not only were the mining machine sales the most profitable business for Bitdeer on a gross margin basis, but the cost per TH numbers from the A2 rigs are actually very good. Remember, my original bearishness BTDR has been due to Cloud Hash - this was a business that was unsustainable because it was a poor product for the plan purchasers. I'd argue the opposite is true for Bitdeer's mining machines. Those look cost effective and efficient given current market conditions. The question is whether or not Bitdeer can scale those sales. Based on the use of proceeds from the recent convertible note offering, I'd argue the company is betting on itself to achieve some of the numbers laid out in its TAM projections for ASIC growth. At $11 per share, the stock isn't nearly as overvalued as it was at the end of 2024 and it could be argued BTDR is actually cheap compared to mining stock peers. I'm upgrading BTDR from 'sell' to 'hold.'",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797249-bitdeer-elephant-in-room?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","BTDR",cryptocompare

In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE has risen to prominence as a preferred alternative for Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP traders moving beyond legacy ecosystems like TRON , driven by its scarcity-based framework and growing analyst support. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Market’s New Favorite MAGACOIN FINANCE brings together the viral appeal of meme culture with structural depth and institutional-grade mechanics. With over $10 million raised in presale and every phase selling out rapidly, it offers a capped 170 billion token supply , a full HashEx audit , and a 100% community-led model. The absence of venture capital control, coupled with on-chain accumulation trends and staking rewards, has set it apart from typical pre-launch tokens. For Bitcoin and XRP traders seeking clarity and early-stage momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the favored strategic pivot . Bitcoin: Rotating Profits into High-Upside Plays Bitcoin remains the foundation of many portfolios, holding above $105,000 amid institutional flows and macro strength. Yet as returns begin to normalize, BTC holders are increasingly rotating into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE —a shift that reflects a desire to harness asymmetrical upside before mainstream listings. XRP: Seeking Cleaner Narratives and Growth XRP continues to dominate the payments arena but remains burdened by ongoing legal complexities and stalled price movement. That’s why many in the XRP community are moving capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its transparent governance, scarcity model, and momentum-driven adoption. TRON: Stable Growth Meets New Competition TRON’s steady ecosystem growth in stablecoins and dApps has kept it on radar, but some traders are seeking more dynamic setups. For these investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a faster-moving alternative, built on structure, transparency, and aggressive early growth—qualities that TRON’s more measured expansion currently lacks. Conclusion With a scarcity-based design, real market traction, and growing interest from Bitcoin and XRP traders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a top alternative to TRON in 2025. Its fundamentals, clean structure, and growing demand are fueling momentum—positioning it as one of the most compelling early entries this year.

2025-06-25T17:05:22,"Next Technology: All Bitcoin, No Backstop","Summary Next Technology's valuation is driven by Bitcoin holdings but lacks any real operating business or cash flow to support its premium. The company issued over 400 million shares and warrants in Q1 to acquire 5,000 BTC, resulting in extreme dilution without the guardrails of a functioning business. BTC per share sits at ~$1.42, while the stock trades at $2.32, implying a speculative premium of ~40%. Given the absence of credible operations, poor digital infrastructure, and unsustainable capital structure, I rate NXTT a Strong Sell until fundamentals improve. Next Technology Holding (NASDAQ: NXTT ) is a Chinese tech company that markets itself as an AI-enabled software services provider and is also involved in other tech verticals like blockchain and new energy. The company was originally known as WeTrade Technology Co. but rebranded last year. Last year, the company also pivoted to being a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury company, though it has held BTC since 2023. NXTT has surged lately following the Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy pivot and recent Bitcoin purchase. Bitcoin adoption has accelerated greatly on the corporate level. Publicly traded companies are increasingly modeling their approach on Strategy's ( MSTR ) aggressive Bitcoin buy playbook, raising funds through debt or equity to purchase Bitcoin for treasury allocation or long-term strategic reserve purposes. Companies purchasing Bitcoin at scale do so in the hopes that their dollar-cost average, or cost basis as it's formally known, will appreciate over time, and the value of their holdings will compound, creating value for shareholders via an increase in BTC per share. Investors are also exposed to the underlying operating business of these companies - whether good or bad-which may amplify or diminish the appeal of the Bitcoin strategy; though for now, companies with bad underlying operating businesses still enjoy inflated valuations under the cloak of the Bitcoin narrative, and the market still assigns generous multiples despite ongoing operating losses, I believe this will normalize over time as the market reaches a more rational equilibrium between hype and fundamentals. I believe at some point, the market will recalibrate; and when it does, Bitcoin alone won't be enough to justify the premium on companies pursuing corporate treasury strategy. Companies with no real operating strength face the risk of eventually being forced to sell what they hold as long-term reserves. Their reserve assets could easily become ""fire sale"" assets. And at that point, the market will price them for what they are, not for what they hold. The market has seen this movie before, with the COVID-era SPAC mania , for example, which resulted in massive write-downs, and liquidations. While Bitcoin is different in the sense that it is liquid, scarce, and now globally adopted, it still tied to the same pattern of speculative capital chasing narrative premiums, often detached from fundamental performance. I believe at this juncture of early-stage but accelerating experimentation in Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy, it is imperative for investors to begin scrutinizing early the capital structure of the companies pursuing these BTC-overlay models. The reality is that virtually every company pursuing a Bitcoin (or other crypto) corporate strategy has or faces a highly dilutive or structurally fragile capital structure (in the traditional sense, and only propped up by the crypto holdings in most cases). If a business pursuing a crypto treasury strategy is using excess free cash flow for purchases, then that's an entirely different and easier conversation. In the context of Next Technology, which reported no revenue from its underlying business in Q1, Strategy is the reference model here to benchmark Next Technologies against in this piece. Strategy has engineered a capital structure around its corporate treasury strategy that amplified shareholder exposure to the underlying asset without compromising long-term integrity. I'll be unpacking the nuances between NXTT's and MSTR's strategies, poking necessary holes where warranted, and highlighting structural strengths for NXTT where deserved. Next's Q1 and Capital Structure Under the Lens Looking at Next Technology's latest 10-Q filing (Q1 2025), the first reality check for investors sizing up NXTT is that there was no revenue from its AI SaaS business in Q1, despite the headline of $193.4 million in net income driven entirely by unrealized Bitcoin gains (thanks to FASB accounting rules). Income statement (10 Q) Next Technology's rebranding from WeTrade last year and the subsequent dissolution of its subsidiary, WeTrade Technology Co. last year offered no operational income as we see on the income statement above, as the net income from discontinued operations was ""nil"", meaning even before dissolution there was no active sales generation or service revenue from its SaaS business. This lack of an operational backstop business for Next Technology is a glaring concern. Almost every publicly traded company can more accessibly engineer a capital injection through direct equity or warrants via a single or few PIPE investors to finance treasury asset purchases, but gaining the trust of institutional investors to underwrite a hybrid of strategic capital, like the convertible notes with low to zero interest which comes with a more measured and deferred dilution schedule that makes MSTR standout, requires the type of foundational confidence that at least sales generation from a backstop business gives institutional investors. That sales generation from a backstop business is missing in Next Technology's case. This hybrid of strategic, deferred capital is particularly important for a company pursuing a crypto treasury strategy, especially in the absence of core operational profitability and free cash flow because a sole reliance on equity means dilution happens faster than appreciation, and what happens to the BTC-per-share metric, which is a measure of investor exposure to the reserve asset, is that it also gets diluted. Cash flow (10 Q) The story of Next Technology's cash flow is similar to its income. Just as revenue was zero, operational cash flow was at a critical ""nil"" for both Q1 2025 and Q1 2024 (as shown in the cashflow statement above). There is no cash from core operations, and Next Technology relies on unsecured, interest-free loans from former execs and other third parties to cover operating expenses, posing a potential related-party risk. As of Q1, these short-term loans from former execs and third parties who are likely related parties amounted to $1.63 million and rose from $760k as of Q4 end (as shown in the next table from the Q1 10-Q). Other payables (10 Q) Though the payments due to related parties were recorded as $221,000 in the balance sheet (see the table below), a closer look at the 10-Q and the disaggregation of the Other Payables line items (seen in the preceding table) shows that the $2.06 million Other Payables balance includes $1.63 million in short-term loans from Next Technology's former executives and from other third parties, alongside $427,574 in professional fees and operating expenses (as seen in the preceding table). Balance sheet (10 Q) Next Technology is missing any type of sales generation from a backstop business and also faces structural risks from these related parties because they are essentially funding the company's ongoing OpEx, which creates an unsustainable reliance. In my view, the inability to raise funds from truly independent third parties implies a profound lack of external confidence in the company's fundamentals, and I believe institutions also think along the same lines. This persistent lack of sales, coupled with the inherent related party risks, both stand as glaring red flags, in my view. The Stockholders' Equity also paints a clearer picture of dilution. The common stock saw an extraordinary increase in value from $71,718,790 to $217,676,957. More critically, the number of shares issued and outstanding skyrocketed from 6,976,410 as of Q4 last year, to a staggering 436,265,135 by Q1. This massive increase is directly attributable to the issuance of hundreds of millions of shares and warrants for the 5,000 Bitcoin purchase in March. As I mentioned earlier, dilution is nothing new to Bitcoin treasury companies; however, what makes it particularly troubling in Next Technology's case is that it was done without the guardrails of a functioning business, institutional oversight, or capital structure discipline, leaving investors exposed to unchecked equity issuance without any offsetting operating value. Equity dilution (10 Q) So while the company boasts holding 5,833 BTC as of Q1 end, the real picture becomes clearer when you look at it on a per-share basis. With 436,265,135 shares outstanding, that translates to 5,833 BTC ÷ 436,265,135 shares = ~0.00001337 BTC per share. At BTC's current price of $106,000, the implied BTC value per share is $1.42. NXTT currently trades at $2.32. And at $2.32 per share, only ~$1.42 of that is backed by the actual Bitcoin holding. The premium to NAV baked into NXTT's valuation is about $0.90 per share, which is arguably speculative, especially given the company has no revenue, sees no cash flow, and has a highly dilutive capital formation. Takeaway Right now, the market is pricing in a ~60% Bitcoin backing per share and ~40% is purely narrative-driven. That's a very generous premium for a company with no operating business, no free cash flow, and heavy reliance on dilution. The moment the market starts discounting these risks or BTC sees downward price movement for macro or other reasons, the BTC premium on NXTT could evaporate - very fast. Next Technology official website as of June 25, 2025 (Next Technology) Trading at a premium to NAV is nothing new for Bitcoin treasury companies. However, Next Technology's premium feels particularly fragile given the lack of operating business, aggressive dilution, and speculative structure behind it. I'd close this piece with an extra, perhaps trivial, detail that may seem unconventional for Seeking Alpha, but I believe it's vital context. A thorough perusal of Next Technology's website shows no functional demonstration or documentation of any products across its claimed verticals-SaaS, Blockchain, New Energy, or Digital Assets. The website has no SSL certificate either. A public company with non-secure HTTP pages and non-functional product links reflects very poor digital infrastructure and a lack of execution, particularly for a tech firm touting blockchain and AI products. In a market where Bitcoin treasury strategies are gaining interest, NXTT is an example of what happens when form outruns substance. The company's Bitcoin holdings may look impressive at a glance, but everything else-the dilution, the lack of business fundamentals, the speculative capital structure, and the absence of execution-screams caution. For me, this is a Strong Sell until a credible business model emerges.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797241-next-technology-all-bitcoin-no-backstop?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","BTC-USD|MSTR|NXTT",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T17:01:01,"Ethereum's 'Identity Crisis' Is What Real Decentralization Looks Like","Ethereum faces widespread perception as a network in crisis. It has been characterized as a platform plagued by governance upheaval, community fragmentation, and high gas fees. Additionally, Ethereum receives a lot of criticism for its slow performance, which lags behind Bitcoin's institutional appeal and Solana's speculative excitement. This narrative misses Ethereum’s central purpose and strategy. Both of which are driven by deliberate decentralized innovation, which is now beginning to pay off. Ethereum’s “Identity Crisis” Ethereum has chosen the more difficult but ultimately more sustainable path. This is based on the fact that it has maintained functional governance, which enables continued technical advancement. It also preserves credible decentralization, creating competitive advantages that neither pure stability nor pure speed can replicate. This positions Ethereum as the only blockchain capable of long-term sustainable innovation. Concerns around Ethereum’s “identity crisis” reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes blockchain technology valuable in the first place. When critics focus on short-term metrics like transaction costs and processing speed, they’re forgetting the revolutionary potential of a truly decentralized computing platform. Ethereum's challenges are the growing pains of building something unprecedented: a global, permissionless computer that no single entity can control or shut down. The high gas fees demonstrate real demand for blockspace on the world's most secure and decentralized smart contract platform. The governance discussions that appear as ""upheaval"" to outsiders represent healthy democratic processes that other chains avoid by maintaining centralized control, or by effectively forbidding all change and improvement. This nuanced reality gets lost in narratives that prioritize simplicity over substance. Bitcoin’s Pet Rock Problem Despite being criticised as a digital “pet rock,” Bitcoin has received widespread respect as the first cryptocurrency to see legitimacy outside of the industry. “Bitcoin-maxis” even point to the chain’s inertia as a critical tenet of bitcoin’s value. Since the chain rarely updates, except for predictable supply halvings, bitcoin can remain a “digital gold.” However, this simplicity is a ceiling, not a strength. Bitcoin has ossified; initially slow to innovate, improvements are now effectively impossible. “Bitcoin-maxis” would argue that the chain’s ossification only strengthens the asset’s immutable value. But, bitcoin’s liquidity is tenuous; it relies on perception, and recent reports demonstrate that bitcoin's value isn’t an inherent certainty. Ethereum, by contrast, continues to evolve through major upgrades like the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 and the recent Pectra update. Unlike Bitcoin, the Ethereum community continues to demonstrate that it is capable of meaningful technological innovation. Ethereum’s Decentralization Is Key Many of Ethereum’s critics point to the impressive speed and low costs of other chains as examples of where Ethereum is failing. These feats are achieved quickly only by giving up on meaningful decentralization. Ethereum is a credibly neutral world computer with thousands of projects innovating on it precisely because of its ethos of decentralization. Some form of centralized leadership may seem like a small price to pay for quicker change, but decentralization matters in the same way that seat belts do. It's an inconvenience until it’s necessary; until an account is de-platformed, or the system makes an unpopular choice because of centralized interests that are not in line with its users’ values. History provides countless examples of centralized systems eventually serving their controllers rather than their users - this is such a common pattern it's practically a law. Traditional financial institutions routinely freeze accounts, deny services, or impose arbitrary fees based on political or business considerations. Decentralization is not a long-term goal; it is a foundational necessity for building systems permanently free from corruption. Ethereum Is Taking the Harder Path Ethereum has chosen the most technically and socially difficult but correct route: building a truly decentralized platform that serves the needs of its users. That's the hard thing to do, but it's also the right thing to do, because it produces the best result in the long term. This approach is slower than Solana’s and less obvious than Bitcoin’s, but it's the only path that delivers both continued innovation and genuine user sovereignty. It is beginning to see results, too. Earlier this month, Bernstein analysts published a research report stating that ""The narrative around value accrual of public blockchain networks is at a critical inflection point,” and “starting to reflect in investor interest in ETH ETF inflows."" Ethereum price is certainly trending upwards. Ethereum ETFs just completed their longest inflow streak of 2025, with BlackRock's ETHA fund alone adding $492 million in a single week . Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs experienced $582 million in net outflows during the same period. Despite this positive momentum, the Ethereum community needs to concern itself less with trailing indicators of success like price. As John Maynard Keynes famously warned, “the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” The Ethereum community must avoid getting distracted by price movements, governance drama, or competing narratives and unite around their common mission: building credibly neutral infrastructure that serves humanity's needs. Ethereum's ability to innovate while staying decentralized requires developers, researchers, validators, and users to shut out the noise and remain focused on building. This path is harder, but it's the only one that leads to sustainable success.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/25/ethereums-identity-crisis-is-what-real-decentralization-looks-like,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T17:00:24,"Metaplanet’s Audacious Bitcoin Holdings Expansion: Japanese Firm Eyes Massive BTC Accumulation","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet’s Audacious Bitcoin Holdings Expansion: Japanese Firm Eyes Massive BTC Accumulation In a move that has sent ripples through the global financial markets, Japanese-listed company Metaplanet has announced a monumental stride in its Bitcoin holdings strategy. This audacious expansion is not just a testament to the growing appeal of digital assets among traditional corporations but also positions Metaplanet as a significant player in the institutional adoption landscape. What does this mean for the future of corporate treasuries and the broader cryptocurrency market? Metaplanet’s Strategic Leap: Fueling Bitcoin Accumulation Metaplanet, a company traditionally focused on real estate and financial services, has made a decisive pivot towards becoming a major holder of Bitcoin. The core of this latest development is a substantial capital raise: the company successfully secured $515 million by issuing 54 million new shares. This significant infusion of capital is earmarked for one primary purpose: to aggressively expand its BTC accumulation efforts. The company’s ambition is striking. Already holding a substantial 11,111 BTC, Metaplanet has laid out an aggressive roadmap: Short-term Goal (End of 2025): Accumulate 30,000 BTC. Long-term Vision: Eventually reach an astounding 100,000 BTC. Ultimate Aspiration: Acquire a substantial portion, even up to 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, highlighting their long-term conviction in the digital asset. This strategy mirrors, and in some ways even surpasses, the pioneering moves made by companies like MicroStrategy. It signifies a profound shift in how corporations view Bitcoin – not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic reserve asset, a hedge against inflation, and a potential driver of long-term shareholder value. Why Are Companies Like Metaplanet Embracing Institutional Bitcoin? The decision by a Japanese company Bitcoin strategy of this magnitude isn’t made lightly. Several compelling factors are driving corporations globally to consider and adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset: The Inflationary Environment and Fiat Debasement In an era characterized by unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation, traditional fiat currencies are experiencing a decline in purchasing power. Corporations with significant cash reserves are finding their balance sheets eroding. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, offers an attractive alternative. It’s often dubbed ‘digital gold’ actuating as a superior store of value in a volatile macroeconomic climate. The ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative and Scarcity Bitcoin’s fundamental design, with a capped supply of 21 million coins, makes it inherently scarce. This scarcity, combined with its increasing global adoption and recognition as a legitimate asset class, strengthens its narrative as ‘digital gold’. For companies like Metaplanet, holding Bitcoin is seen as preserving capital and potentially benefiting from its long-term appreciation, rather than watching cash reserves diminish. Pioneering a New Era of Corporate Treasury Management Companies that strategically invest in Bitcoin are positioning themselves at the forefront of a financial paradigm shift. By being early adopters, they not only aim to capture significant upside but also differentiate themselves in the market, potentially attracting a new class of investors interested in forward-thinking financial strategies. Metaplanet’s move is a bold statement about their belief in Bitcoin’s future relevance. Comparing Metaplanet’s Strategy to Other Bitcoin Holders While MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, Metaplanet’s recent announcement places it firmly among the top institutional players. Let’s look at a brief comparison: Company Current BTC Holdings (Approx.) Strategy Funding Method MicroStrategy ~226,314 BTC Aggressive accumulation, public company as Bitcoin proxy Convertible notes, equity offerings, excess cash Metaplanet 11,111 BTC (current), 100,000 BTC (target) Strategic pivot, significant treasury allocation Share issuance Tesla ~9,720 BTC Initial large purchase, some sales, holds for treasury Cash reserves Metaplanet’s reliance on share issuance for this capital raise indicates a strong commitment from investors who believe in the company’s new direction and the value proposition of Bitcoin. This method allows them to acquire a significant amount of BTC without depleting their existing operational capital, demonstrating investor confidence in their strategic shift. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for Metaplanet? Benefits: Riding the Bitcoin Wave Enhanced Balance Sheet Strength: If Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, Metaplanet’s balance sheet could see substantial appreciation, strengthening its financial position. Inflation Hedge: Protection against the depreciating value of fiat currencies, preserving purchasing power. Investor Attraction: Appeals to a new class of investors keen on exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded entity, particularly in Japan where direct Bitcoin investment might have regulatory nuances for some. Market Leadership: Establishes Metaplanet as a leader in corporate digital asset adoption within Japan and potentially Asia. Challenges: Navigating the Volatility Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile. Significant price drops could negatively impact Metaplanet’s financial statements and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in Japanese regulations could affect their strategy. Market Sentiment: Negative news or market downturns in the broader crypto space could spill over and affect Metaplanet’s stock price. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to protect against hacks or loss. The Broader Implications for the Bitcoin Market Metaplanet’s ambitious plans for Metaplanet Bitcoin acquisition underscore a growing trend: the increasing institutionalization of Bitcoin. As more companies follow suit, several key implications emerge: Supply Shock and Price Impact If numerous companies adopt similar strategies, the demand for Bitcoin could significantly outpace its available supply, especially after halving events. This could lead to a ‘supply shock’, potentially driving up Bitcoin’s price in the long term. Each substantial corporate purchase removes more BTC from the circulating supply, making it scarcer. Validation of Bitcoin as a Legitimate Asset Class When publicly traded companies, especially those from traditional sectors, allocate significant portions of their treasury to Bitcoin, it sends a powerful signal to the broader financial world. It legitimizes Bitcoin as a serious asset class suitable for large-scale investment, moving it further away from its early reputation as a niche or speculative asset. Increased Market Maturity and Liquidity Greater institutional participation often brings increased market maturity and liquidity. As more sophisticated players enter the market, it can lead to more robust infrastructure, better trading mechanisms, and a deeper understanding of Bitcoin’s role in diversified portfolios. What Does This Mean for Investors? Actionable Insights For both traditional and crypto investors, Metaplanet’s move offers valuable insights: Observe Corporate Adoption: Keep a close eye on other companies that might follow Metaplanet’s lead. This trend indicates a fundamental shift in corporate finance. Diversification Strategy: For individual investors, it reinforces the idea of Bitcoin as a potential long-term store of value within a diversified portfolio. Long-Term Conviction: Metaplanet’s multi-year accumulation plan suggests a strong long-term conviction in Bitcoin, rather than short-term speculation. This can be a guiding principle for personal investment strategies. Research Underlying Businesses: When considering investing in companies that hold Bitcoin, it’s crucial to understand both their core business and their Bitcoin strategy. A New Era for Corporate Treasuries? Metaplanet’s audacious decision to raise over half a billion dollars specifically for Bitcoin acquisition marks a pivotal moment. It’s not merely an investment; it’s a strategic repositioning that signals profound confidence in Bitcoin’s future. This move by a significant Japanese company Bitcoin proponent could very well catalyze a broader trend among corporations seeking to future-proof their balance sheets against economic uncertainties. The journey to 100,000 BTC will undoubtedly be watched closely by the financial world, offering a compelling case study on the efficacy of Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. Metaplanet is not just buying Bitcoin; it’s investing in a vision of a decentralized, digitally-native financial future, challenging traditional notions of corporate finance and setting a new benchmark for institutional engagement in the crypto space.

After clearing crucial liquidity levels, Bitcoin appears ready to challenge its final resistance before setting a new all-time high.

2025-06-25T16:59:55,"BTC climbs past $107K as bulls regain control, Pi and SYRUP lead gains","Bitcoin pressed higher on Wednesday, carrying forward its relief rally as tempers cooled across the Middle East. The broader market moved in step, adding nearly 2% over the past 24 hours to lift the total crypto market cap to $3.343 trillion. With risk appetite reignited, the Fear and Greed Index ticked up to 66, marking a return to greed as investors leaned back into momentum. Although the altcoin market joined the rebound, meaningful gains were confined to a select few among the top 100 tokens. Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin’s surge appears tied to a mix of geopolitical calm, renewed risk appetite, and bullish technical momentum. Over the past 24 hours, the asset climbed 2.8% and briefly touched $108,000, marking a $10,000 recovery from its recent local lows just three days ago. The move liquidated over $210 million in long and short positions, as per CoinGlass, with high-leverage traders caught off guard by the sharp breakout. Fueling the rally were remarks from US President Donald Trump, who said the war between Iran and Israel is “over,” adding that Iran holds “a huge advantage” and is unlikely to escalate nuclear ambitions. Trump also hinted at diplomatic overtures, stating he would meet with Iranian leadership next week to potentially sign a non-nuclear agreement. These comments appeared to ease global tension and reinforced market-wide relief, pushing investors further into risk-on territory. Analysts had previously flagged $108,000 and $103,000 as liquidity-heavy zones, and the latest breakout is seen as a strategic sweep of those levels. CoinGlass data confirmed that much of the high-leverage liquidity has already been absorbed, leaving traders eyeing fresh upside targets. Momentum also drew strength from technical setups. Popular trader Titan of Crypto pointed to a breakout above the Kumo Cloud on the Ichimoku chart, an indicator often used to gauge trend reversals. BTC/USDT 1-day price chart. Source: Titan of Crypto. “If it clears the Fair Value Gap (FVG), the next stop could be $111K,” the trader noted. Some, however, were concerned about possible low-timeframe rejection zones but agreed that any pullback would likely be short-lived unless buyer exhaustion sets in. With key resistances getting tested and macro headwinds fading, market participants are increasingly positioning for a broader move. Liquidity heatmaps from Binance’s BTC/USDT pair show a dense cluster of liquidations and stop orders just above the $108,000 level, with additional stacked liquidity extending toward $111,000. This layered liquidity zone suggests that a successful breach above current highs could trigger a cascade of stop-outs and short squeezes, potentially accelerating Bitcoin’s next leg upward. Meanwhile, resistance below $106,000 appears to be thinning, which means any short-term pullback may find support quickly, adding further conviction to the bullish bias in the current setup. For many analysts, Bitcoin now appears poised to test the final stretch toward its all-time highs, with eyes locked on the $110,000 zone and talk of price discovery beginning to resurface.

Altcoin market Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap rose 2.3% to $1.31 trillion, with the Altcoin Season Index reading moving to 16, which means the majority of the top 100 altcoins continue to perform lower in comparison to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, was down 1%, trading at $2,418, while other large-cap altcoins such as Tron (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) also recorded losses of 1-2%. Pi (PI) clocked the highest gains among the top 99 altcoins, up 21.3% over the day, while Maple Finance (SYRUP) and DeXe (DEXE) followed with gains of 21% and 7.9% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap Maple Finance surged to a new all-time high of $0.65 on the back of rising investor conviction, as evidenced by a sharp increase in its holder retention rate.

Concurrently, Maple’s Total Value Locked has reached a record $1.58 billion, according to DeFiLlama, indicating growing demand for its on-chain lending services. Pi token rallied after Pi Network’s core team teased upcoming generative AI features, set to be unveiled during the Pi2Day event on June 28.

Steve McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, recently offered an optimistic outlook for several major altcoins, signaling a shift in how some firms are approaching the current cycle. The interview gained widespread attention and was shared by prominent crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), who posted a clip of McClurg naming XRP as one of the assets that could outperform Bitcoin in 2025. Her post helped spotlight McClurg’s remarks and added momentum to the conversation around XRP’s potential. More Than a 10% Upside During the discussion, McClurg pushed back on the idea of modest gains for leading altcoins. When asked whether a 10% upside was a fair expectation, he stated, “I think most of these will double this year.” XRP was the first token he mentioned among those expected to outperform Bitcoin, alongside SUI, Solana, HBAR, and Litecoin. McClurg described Canary Capital’s outlook as “very constructive” on cryptocurrencies with large market caps, and he highlighted some assets he believes will perform spectacularly. WOW!

He compared it to the Dow, saying it’s where investors might move “if you want to stay in crypto but have a flight to safety.” In contrast, he pointed to other large-cap assets as better positioned for upside in a bull market. Canary Capital has consistently shown interest in XRP and was among the first companies to apply for a spot ETF in 2024. XRP’s Strength in a Changing Market McClurg’s comments arrive as XRP continues to benefit from improving regulatory clarity and renewed institutional interest . Its unique positioning in global payments infrastructure, along with increasing adoption, supports the view that it could capitalize on current market momentum. Being named first in McClurg’s list subtly highlights how experienced investors seriously consider XRP. Experts believe a massive breakout is coming , and veteran investors like McClurg can see the asset’s potential. Even some in the Bitcoin community believe XRP will make a massive move this year. Bitcoin maximalists, such as Davinci Jeremie, have predicted that XRP can hit $24 in 2025 .

The U.S. Department of Justice says Leo Joseph Govoni, 67, of Clearwater, Florida, co-founded the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration (CSNT) around the year 2000, and CSNT employed John Leo Witeck, 60, of Tampa, Florida, as an accountant. The nonprofit managed court awards, settlements and other payments for people with disabilities and special needs. By 2024, CSNT managed over 2,100 special needs trusts containing approximately $200 million, with beneficiaries in almost every state, according to the indictment. However, the DOJ alleges that Govoni, Witeck and their unnamed co-conspirators purloined CSNT client-beneficiary funds and concealed their embezzlement through complex financial transactions. They allegedly sent fraudulent account statements with false balances to their disabled clients. Govoni allegedly used the embezzled cash to buy real estate, fund a brewery and pay personal debts.
