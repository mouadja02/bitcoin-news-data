2025-06-25T20:43:06,"JUST IN: Critical New Development Regarding Solana Spot ETFs","Invesco Capital Management LLC has filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF. The fund is expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX exchange, and will reportedly use the Lukka Prime Solana Reference Rate as a benchmark to track Solana’s (SOL) spot price performance. This development could signal a new era for crypto investment products on Wall Street. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart predict that Solana, XRP and Litecoin spot ETFs will have a 95% chance of approval by the end of 2025. According to analysts, Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera and Avalanche ETF applications also have a 90% chance of approval by the end of the year. Related News: Why Did Bitcoin and Altcoins Suddenly Rise? Experts Explain Three Reasons If these altcoin ETFs are approved by the SEC, it would be the biggest expansion in crypto investment products since Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. The SEC, which has only approved spot ETFs for these two crypto assets so far, could mark a historic turning point for crypto markets. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has also paved the way for new applications. This product group alone manages more than $100 billion in assets.

2025-06-25T20:42:14,"Vitalik Buterin Amplifies Pro-Ethereum Sentiments Validating Mass Adoption Following GENIUS ACT Approval","Vitalik Buterin has made some interesting comments about the Ethereum blockchain, all of which suggest that the Ethereum founder is anticipating global dominance, an outlook shared by Joseph Lubin , the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain. Buterin, who more commonly shares development timelines for the Ethereum blockchain, has clarified his bullish outlook for the network. Responding to assertions made by Lubin, who anticipates that Ethereum will serve a global audience, Buterin insists that the network already has. “Ethereum L1 is the world ledger,” he wrote. The billionaire crypto founder seems to be paying close attention to network development and key milestones achieved recently. One Ethereum supporter observed that $1.25 billion in ETH ETF inflows have been recorded over the past 19 days, marking an increase in institutional interest. Staked ETH tokens have also hit new highs as market players lock 28% of Ether’s token supply. This development comes as multiple Nasdaq-listed firms adopt crypto reserves, further tightening liquidity levels. The price of ETH made a massive price turnaround from the previous year. Although the second most valuable altcoin is still far away from its previously attained all-time high of $4,891, ETH has kicked off a slow but steady recovery since the start of the year. Notably, ETH has emerged as the best-performing cryptocurrency, knocking out leading assets such as Bitcoin and another altcoin to secure a 53% increase in price value over the past 60 days. At the time of this report, ETH is valued at $2,434 per coin. As the Ether supporter further explains before going on to make a case for Ethereum and its native token; “Institutions are noticing. We’ve come together to tell the world why. Introducing ETH: Digital Oil for the Digital Economy.” Buterin, who appeared to have followed these observations, shared an image of a bull, with the Ethereum logo atop its head, signaling a show of support for the bullish assertions made by Ethereum proponents.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-amplifies-pro-ethereum-sentiments-validating-mass-adoption-following-genius-act-approval/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Ethereum News|Vitalik Buterin",cryptocompare

The evaluations made reveal that especially large investors, namely “whales”, have once again aggressively switched to the buying side of the market. According to Alphractal’s data, Bitcoin’s 7-day Open Position Delta value has turned positive again. This development shows that whale investors are opening more positions in anticipation of the rise. The “Whale Position Sentiment” indicator used by the company also confirms this trend. Related News: GameStop, One of the Most Talked-About Companies in the US, Makes Another Move to Purchase a Massive Amount of Bitcoin According to CEO Joao Wedson, Bitcoin began to form a new support zone after reaching $ 108,000. Stating that this level indicates a base-forming process called the “last support point” (LPS) in technical analysis, Wedson stated that the $ 113,000 level could be targeted in the short term. He added that short positions could be risky unless the price enters a long-term horizontal consolidation. On the other hand, analysis of miner behavior found that the BTC.com mining pool was the source sending the most BTC to Binance. However, there has been a significant decrease in this flow in recent months. This indicates that miners are expecting the price to rise even more and the selling pressure has decreased, according to the analyst. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-25T20:38:08,"Why Did Bitcoin and Altcoins Suddenly Rise? Experts Explain Three Reasons","Bitcoin has gained nearly 10% in the past few days as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East eased. The world's largest cryptocurrency surpassed the $108,200 level today, according to Coinbase data, recovering 9.9% from the lows of around $98,400 seen on Sunday, June 22. Analysts have highlighted several factors that have supported this rally, with the most important one being the easing of concerns about conflict in the Middle East. “Bitcoin’s recovery today reflects the easing of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East,” said Thomas Perfumo, Kraken’s global economist. Perfumo noted that Bitcoin, as a macroeconomic asset, has already priced in changes in market risk perception. In addition, the ongoing interest of institutional investors is among the factors supporting the rise. Stating that companies such as MicroStrategy continue to purchase Bitcoin, Perfumo said that newly established funds also reinforce this cycle. He stated that the continuous inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs also create strong momentum when the selling pressure in the market decreases. Related News: BREAKING: Spot ETF Application Filed for Surprise Memecoin Brett Sifling, portfolio manager at Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, attributed Bitcoin’s rise this week to three main reasons. First, the temporary ceasefire between Israel and Iran has facilitated investors’ return to risky assets. Second, the Fed’s signals about possible interest rate cuts and its adoption of a crypto-friendly approach have boosted the market. Third, he said that positive inflows to Bitcoin ETFs for 10 consecutive weeks show that institutional demand is still strong. Dom Kwok, co-founder and COO of education platform EasyA, also said that President Trump’s signal for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran has brought relief to the market. He said that tensions over the weekend briefly dropped Bitcoin below $100,000, but investor confidence has been restored as energy markets have stabilized. Kwok noted that for long-term investors, such rapid declines are often just minor “chart breaks.” “Volatility makes headlines, but it’s important not to forget the bigger picture that drives gains,” he concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Bitcoin Price Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $104,699, beginning a bearish trend to $99,766. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as sellers failed to defend resistance channels. This pushed the BTC price toward $108K. Will the BTC price reach $100K?

Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T20:30:19,"Is MAGACOIN FINANCE the Answer for Traders Seeking Growth Beyond Bitcoin? Ethereum Holders Eye Uniswap","In a market where innovation meets opportunity, traders are constantly looking for assets with stronger growth potential than established leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the search for early-stage momentum intensifies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as a potential breakout , driven by its disciplined approach and surging community interest. At the same time, Ethereum holders are turning their attention to Uniswap, drawn by its innovation in decentralized trading and ongoing role in the evolving crypto ecosystem. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The High-Upside Contender MAGACOIN FINANCE has swiftly become one of the most followed presales of the year, raising over $10 million and gaining strong traction across every round. Its scarcity-focused tokenomics, capped 170 billion supply, and full HashEx audit provide a foundation of credibility rarely seen in similar projects. The project’s design blends viral market presence with thoughtful execution—offering staking, transparent governance, and a decentralized community model. This blend of strategic fundamentals and public momentum is drawing interest from both retail traders and larger players seeking high-upside alternatives in a maturing market. Bitcoin: The Foundation, But Limited Upside Bitcoin remains the dominant asset in crypto, trading steadily above $105,000 and serving as a key institutional anchor. Yet its stabilizing growth has prompted a strategic shift, as some traders look to allocate capital into emerging assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer the possibility of capturing momentum akin to Bitcoin’s earlier years. Ethereum: Diversifying for Innovation and Yield Ethereum continues to lead as a platform for decentralized innovation. However, as its growth levels off, many ETH investors are exploring complementary opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s smart contract compatibility and secure structure are making it an attractive candidate. Uniswap, too, continues to command attention for its yield farming mechanisms, governance utility, and strength in decentralized exchange volume. Uniswap: The DeFi Powerhouse As a flagship decentralized trading platform, Uniswap maintains robust daily activity and a strong user base. While its growth has matured compared to earlier phases, its continuous updates and integrations make it a key holding for many Ethereum-aligned investors. At the same time, the rising interest in early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE reflects a desire to pair long-term platforms with faster-moving investments. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a place among early-stage projects with the potential to redefine what high-upside growth looks like in today’s market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational, many traders are now complementing their portfolios with alternatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Uniswap—striking a balance between stability and breakout momentum.

2025-06-25T20:23:51,"GameStop’s Bitcoin push echoes Strategy, but without the cushion","GameStop just secured another $450 million in its debt-fueled sprint toward becoming a Bitcoin-heavy treasury, bringing its total capital raise to $2.7 billion. But unlike Strategy, the company is doing so with a retail business in free fall. According to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, video game retailer GameStop (GME) secured an additional $450 million through the full exercise of a “greenshoe” option tied to its $2.25 billion convertible notes offering earlier this month. The offering brought GameStop’s total capital raise to $2.7 billion, a war chest it says will fund corporate investments, including inquiring Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a treasury reserve asset. You might also like: US Bitcoin ETFs record 11 consecutive days of net inflows despite macro jitters A strategic imitation or reinvention in motion? GameStop’s aggressive pivot to Bitcoin echoes a now-familiar playbook. The company’s recent filings reference an “investment policy” that includes acquiring BTC as a treasury reserve asset. That language mirrors the model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which began stockpiling Bitcoin in 2020 amid macroeconomic uncertainty and balance sheet stagnation. However, the divergence is just as important as the resemblance. Where Strategy was a steady, if unexciting, software firm when it began buying BTC, GameStop is a declining retailer. Strategy’s core revenue has shrunk modestly, down 6.2% year-over-year, but the business remains intact. Its Bitcoin strategy has massively inflated its balance sheet, with information on its website showing total assets have ballooned from $2.4 billion in 2022 to over $43 billion as of Q1 2025. That’s a 591% annual increase. Additionally, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm has more than tripled its stock price, largely untethered from the fundamentals of its core enterprise software revenue. By contrast, GameStop’s fundamentals are deteriorating. Q1 2025 revenue dropped 17%, and the company closed over 400 stores. The collectibles segment and a leaner retail footprint helped produce a $44.8 million net profit in Q1, but the long-term growth trend remains negative. That makes the Bitcoin pivot feel less like vision and more like a gamble. Market reactions remain jittery. GME shares plunged 20% after the initial convertible note announcement in June, barely a month after its first Bitcoin acquisition. Unlike MSTR, which has historically traded at a premium to its BTC holdings, GME has yet to build that investor confidence. The make-or-break factor: Bitcoin’s price Strategy’s success relied on Bitcoin’s bull runs. Its $70,681 average cost basis versus the current $107,798 BTC price means even a significant crash wouldn’t wipe out gains. GameStop, however, entered the race when Bitcoin was trading above $108,000 in May, leaving almost no margin for error. Worse, GameStop’s $1.48 billion in long-term debt, per Q1 filings, demands constant market access. If Bitcoin stagnates or dips, the company could face a liquidity crunch, something Strategy avoided by front-running the 2021 and 2024 rallies.

2025-06-25T20:05:00,"Bitcoin's Dazzling Recovery From War Fear Takes It Back To Its Range Highs (Technical Analysis)","Summary Sellers failed to hold below the $100,000 mark. Momentum is not yet overbought, which leaves some space for movement. The 50-day moving average - previously used as resistance for the February pullback - is now acting as support, strengthening the current technical outlook. By Elior Manier The world’s leading cryptocurrency has demonstrated notable resilience in a week marked by geopolitical tensions and choppy risk sentiment . While traditional risk assets experienced volatile swings—gapping both higher and lower as headlines on the Israel-Iran conflict evolved—Bitcoin held its ground. A key signal of market resilience often comes at moments of maximum fear, when price action resists breaking key levels despite worsening headlines. That was precisely the case for Bitcoin. After peaking at a new all-time high of $112,030 in May, BTC pulled back, retesting the psychological $100,000 level. During the weekend escalation - when the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure - Bitcoin briefly dipped below this threshold, touching $99,000. Yet, despite the prevailing pessimism, sellers failed to hold below the $100,000 mark. This failed breakdown was followed by a decisive rebound, as markets began shifting away from war-driven fear. Bitcoin has since reclaimed the upper end of its recent range, indicating renewed bullish momentum. Let’s dive into the charts—from the weekly to the intraday timeframes—to better understand the current technical setup and what's the market picture for the leading crypto. Bitcoin Weekly Chart – Prior indecision met with a sharp response Bitcoin Weekly Chart, June 25, 2025 – Source: TradingView The previous weekly candles formed long-wicked doji patterns, signaling indecision and hesitation near all-time highs. This week, however, has kicked off on a more constructive note. From a candlestick perspective, a weekly close near the highs—especially with a breakout above the recent range—would confirm renewed bullish momentum . Until then, strength is cautiously maintained. That said, weekly momentum indicators remain in overbought territory, increasing the likelihood of consolidation—an outcome already visible on the lower timeframes. Bitcoin Daily Chart – Bullish sentiment supported by Daily 50-MA Bitcoin Daily Chart, June 25, 2025 – Source: TradingView Bitcoin is printing its third consecutive bullish daily candle, reinforcing the prevailing risk-on sentiment across markets. The 50-day moving average—previously used as resistance for the February pullback—is now acting as support, strengthening the current technical outlook. Meanwhile, RSI momentum remains near neutral but has shown a clear reluctance to drift into oversold territory. This suggests buyers continue to defend the $100,000 level effectively. A deeper correction below this threshold appears unlikely unless a new and unexpected bearish catalyst emerges for the crypto space. Bitcoin 4H Chart – Breaking out of the War Descending Channel Bitcoin 4H Chart, June 25, 2025 – Source: TradingView On this intraday timeframe, we get a better view of the prevailing consolidation that is taking Bitcoin to test its highs. Prices had been forming a descending channel as sentiment started to worsen; however, sellers could not maintain the bearish momentum. A rebound on the daily main support led to a breakout of the channel, with buyers now pushing above the pivot in confluence with the 200-period 4H moving average, which only caught up to the uptrend. Momentum is not yet overbought, which leaves some space for movement. One test for buyer strength will be breaching the 110,000 key mark – a failure to break and hold above this level points to higher chances of maintaining within the 100,000 to 110,000 range. Key levels to hold on your intraday charts: 99,000 to 100,000 Main Support 102,000 to 103,000 intermediate support 106,000 Pivot Zone & 4H MA 200 (immediate support) 112,000 Key ATH Resistance 109,000 to 110,000 Intermediate Resistance 115,000 - 117,000 Potential Resistance (Fibonacci Extension of past move) Safe Trades!

The expert also explained how this would lead to a “regulatory breakout” for XRP, with the altcoin coming out favored. Ripple Vs. SEC Lawsuit Approaching A Final Resolution In an X post , Abraham affirmed that market participants are witnessing the last chapter of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. He remarked that XRP is about to emerge not just free but favored. The expert then alluded to how both parties have jointly paused their appeals , which confirms that they are ready to settle and reach a final resolution. Both parties recently filed a status report before the appeals court, in which they asked for an extension of the pause on the case while they get an indicative ruling from Judge Analisa Torres. Abraham noted the joint motion , which has been filed in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, for this indicative ruling. He explained that both parties seek Judge Torres to dissolve the injunction against Ripple and lower the civil penalty against the crypto firm to $50 million. The expert remarked that this isn’t just a “slap on the wrist” but a public signal that Ripple won. Abraham added that institutions are watching. As to what happens next, the expert is confident that Judge Torres will issue her final ruling in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, likely validating that XRP is not a security . When this happens, Abraham predicts that every institution sitting on the sidelines gets the green light. This is what he described as the “regulatory breakout” moment. Basically, this would clear the “legal cloud” over XRP for good. XRP ETFs On The Horizon With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit in its final chapter, Abraham is confident that the XRP ETFs could get approval anytime soon. He noted that these funds have just entered their public comment phase. Meanwhile, their approval odds in 2025 are over 90% based on current legal momentum, clarity, and market demand. Based on this, the expert declared that the “ETF floodgate is about to burst.” He then proceeded to highlight the factors that will be the setup for the next XRP bull cycle, including the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. The end of the lawsuit will bring about regulatory clarity and also open the path for approval for the XRP ETFs . These ETFs will lead to institutional access. Meanwhile, Abraham predicts that XRP’s global use case will explode in the process, with utility demand being greater than retail speculation.

The Federal Reserve says former Bank of Hawaii employee Alohi Kaupu-Grace, 23, stole from customer accounts and falsified the customers’ signatures on cash withdrawal slips and cashier’s check purchase slips. Kaupu-Grace paid $5,200 in partial restitution to the bank and was fired in March. The Hawaii resident consented to an order from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors banning her from working for any of the Fed’s insured depository institutions. The ban will stay in place indefinitely unless the Board of Governors rescinds it, and the order doesn’t prohibit any other Federal or state agency or department from taking action against Kaupu-Grace. In May, Hawaii Island police arrested Kaupu-Grace for allegedly using someone else’s credit card. A victim contacted police after receiving a text from his credit card company about a fraudulent charge made to his account. The police say they tracked the credit card usage back to Kaupu-Grace, who allegedly secured the victim’s confidential information while working at Bank of Hawaii. She was charged with second-degree theft, second-degree identity theft, unauthorized possession of personal confidential information and fraudulent use of a credit card.

2025-06-25T20:00:19,"Why Bitcoin and XRP Investors Are Quickly Rallying Around MAGACOIN FINANCE, Backing Cardano","The cryptocurrency landscape is continually shaped by the pursuit of innovation and asymmetric growth. In 2025 , seasoned Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP investors are rallying behind MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its momentum, structure, and early positioning. Simultaneously, Cardano’s expanding utility and real-world partnerships are keeping it in focus as a balanced investment option for those seeking both performance and stability. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale That’s Captivating Smart Money MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the standout presales of the year, securing over $10 million while selling out multiple rounds in record time. Its 170 billion capped supply , full HashEx audit , and 100% community-owned model are redefining standards for transparency and scarcity. What differentiates it from typical projects is its structured rollout, staking rewards, and lack of VC involvement—qualities increasingly valued by retail and institutional investors alike. This growing wave of adoption is pulling in capital from across major coin ecosystems as the listing window tightens. Bitcoin: Profits Fueling the Next Generation With Bitcoin holding above $105,000 , it remains a foundational store of value. Yet, as upside moderates, BTC whales are rotating profits into earlier-stage assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE , aiming to replicate the kind of returns that once defined Bitcoin itself. This capital rotation is infusing fresh energy into projects that offer structural advantages and emerging traction. XRP: Seeking Clarity and New Opportunities Though XRP continues to lead in global payments, its price movement is weighed down by legal uncertainties and consolidation zones. This has pushed many investors to explore projects offering clearer governance and momentum. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its clean mechanics, decentralized model, and growing wallet activity—providing a compelling option for investors eager to realign their portfolios. Cardano: The Ecosystem Anchor Cardano continues to build on its vision of cross-chain interoperability. With recent announcements by Charles Hoskinson about XRP integrations , airdrops like Glacier , and expanded support via the Lace wallet , Cardano is gaining recognition as a hub for multi-chain activity. Its emphasis on slow, deliberate development appeals to those seeking long-term value—making it a steady counterpart to the rapid acceleration of MAGACOIN FINANCE . Conclusion Bitcoin and XRP investors are aligning with MAGACOIN FINANCE as it gains ground with strong fundamentals, transparent governance, and viral adoption. Meanwhile, Cardano’s ecosystem growth ensures it remains a reliable pillar for stability and future interoperability. Together, these assets represent a forward-looking strategy for navigating 2025’s evolving crypto landscape.

2025-06-25T20:00:00,"Crypto News Today: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Grows Like Wildfire as Bitcoin (BTC) and Top Cryptos Tumble","In the market faced by uncertainty, one altcoin is defying the downtrend, Mutuum Finance (MUTM ). Bitcoin (BTC) has slipped 4.67% amid mounting macro and geopolitical pressure. Major cryptocurrencies have followed suit, entering a sea of red as traders brace for more volatility. Amid the turmoil, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is bucking the trend, its presale token has surged nearly 200% to $0.03, fueled by strong demand, a dual lending DeFi model, and strategic buyback features. The project is priced at $0.03 today in phase 5 of its presale that has sold out over 45%. The project has raised over $11.1 million and brought on board over 12,400 investors in its ongoing presale. Unlike most altcoins caught in the downturn, this new coin continues to attract investors eyeing what crypto to buy now, thanks to its secured presale traction. Bitcoin Slides Below $103K as Market Sentiment Turns Risk-Off At the time of publication, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at around $102,200, decreasing more than 4.67% in the previous 24 hours as traders respond to renewed geopolitical uncertainty and risk-off attitudes in world markets. The newest drawback reported over $460 million wiped, and it is long positions that sustained the majority of liquidations. The technical indicators indicate the BTC is experiencing difficulties in maintaining the support of 103K, and indicators of momentum favor further bearish positions until a bullish volume reversal is observed. Although the general crypto market is also facing this correction, there are some smaller altcoins that found it possible to rise against the stream, including the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that has increased in value during the correction period. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,400 early adopters and more than $11.1 million raised, it’s clear to see this isn’t a flash in the pan wave of sentiment, Mutuum Finance is taking big steps as a key player in the DeFi. Whereas tokens are founded on ephemeral mania for the most part, Mutuum is founded on usability and sustained scalability with sound fundamentals backing it. Phase 5 investors will be rewarded with up to 2x ROI, when the token launch price of $0.06 is hit. Stable, Audited, and Future-Proof: A USD-Pegged Token on Ethereum In its strategic efforts to deepen its DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Unlike highly volatile algorithmic stablecoins, this token is crafted to hold its value even in extreme market fluctuations, earning it a solid store of value and medium of exchange. Security and integrity are central to the project. The Mutuum Finance platform was audited completely by CertiK, one of the most established blockchain security firms. This audit again testifies to the platform’s commitment to transparency, reliability, and long-term sustainability. Early Investors Reward as Community Grows To celebrate the presale action and express gratitude to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten of these winners will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens for being one of the early backers of the project. While the community expands rapidly, the early supporters are being rewarded, not only with the possibility of future upside, but with concrete, real-time rewards. While Bitcoin tumbles below $103K and top altcoins bleed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is breaking away from the pack. Defying the market correction, the project has surged 200% from its starting price, with Phase 5 tokens now selling at $0.03 and already over 45% sold out. More than 12,400 investors have contributed upwards of $11.1 million, betting on MUTM’s strong fundamentals, dual lending innovation, and fully audited infrastructure. Buyers in this stage could see 2x gains at launch, and potentially much more if current momentum holds. The next price jump is near, now is the time to act.

The upcoming remittance service will let users send U.S. dollars and select stablecoins to recipients abroad with ""well-known"" blockchain networks processing the transactions, allowing funds to be sent around the clock, converted into local currencies and deposited quickly into recipients' accounts, according to the press release . The company says this will be significantly cheaper and faster than traditional methods such as wire transfers or bank-based remittances. The firm will also relaunch crypto trading services, letting users buy, sell and hold major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTC and Ethereum's ether ETH later this year. Future services could include staking, borrowing against crypto holdings and providing blockchain tech infrastructure to third-parties through SoFi’s Galileo platform, the firm said. The moves come as CEO Anthony Noto shared plans earlier this year to re-enter the crypto business after the firm suspended digital asset-related services in 2023 in order to obtain banking license under the previous administration's harsher regulatory environment towards crypto. The change is backed by recent guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that allows nationally chartered banks to offer crypto custody and stablecoin-related services. ""The future of financial services is being completely reinvented through innovations in crypto, digital assets, and blockchain more broadly,"" said Noto in a statment.

From shifting geopolitical tensions to a major regulatory pivot in the United States (US), multiple macroeconomic factors appear to be setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next explosive move. Ceasefire And Rate Cut Buzz Fuel Bitcoin Price Optimism Over the weekend, the Bitcoin price briefly slipped, triggering over $200 million in leveraged long liquidations. However, this dip proved short-lived as the flagship cryptocurrency rebounded swiftly above $100,000 following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a total ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This sudden de-escalation helped ease global market anxiety, pushing Bitcoin past $106,000 and oil prices sharply down from $77 to under $70. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters ‘New Era’ Simultaneously, Optimism is building that the US Federal Reserve (FED) could begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Sharing new data by CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, crypto analyst CW disclosed that the odds of a FED rate cut have increased to 18.6% by July 30 during the scheduled FOMC meeting. The report reveals that 81.4% of market participants believe the FED to keep rates unchanged at their current level. However, FedWatch’s data indicates growing expectations for a rate cut by the September FOMC meeting, with 79% betting on a reduction and only 21.3% anticipating no change. Notably, lower interest rates generally benefit risk assets like Bitcoin by increasing liquidity and boosting investor sentiment. With geopolitical tensions easing and a possibly looser monetary policy on the horizon, Bitcoin could gain further momentum, potentially climbing to $110,000. Supporting this bullish forecast, crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin is gearing up for a rally toward a new ATH of $110,000 following its recent reclaim of the key $103,500 level. Although a retracement to around $102,500 remains possible, Bennett believes that once BTC cleans up support around $103,400, formed during Monday’s expansion, the next move could be parabolic. Regulatory Win Solidify Bitcoin’s Position In TradFi Beyond anticipated rate cuts and ceasefire announcements, the US FED recently made a landmark policy shift that could have profound long-term implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. By removing “reputational risk” as a factor in evaluating crypto firms’ access to bank servicing, the FED is effectively ending a key pillar of Operation Checkpoint 2.0—a campaign that restricted over 30 crypto and fintech companies from traditional financial infrastructure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Deviates From Global M2 Money Supply, Is The Bull Run Over? This recent change clears the way for greater institutional involvement in crypto. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have also followed suit, green-lighting crypto activities for banks and allowing them to participate in the digital assets market without prior approval. Together, these moves mark a regulatory pivot that not only legitimizes the crypto industry but could also accelerate demand and capital inflows into Bitcoin, potentially boosting its already significant valuation.

2025-06-25T19:19:54,"SharpLink Gaming Doubles Down on ETH with $30.6M Buy, Becomes World’s Largest Public Holder","Sports betting company SharpLink Gaming has solidified its position as the world’s largest publicly traded Ethereum holder, acquiring an additional 12,207 ETH for $30.6 million in a five-day buying spree that ended June 20. The Minneapolis-based firm now controls 188,478 ETH , worth approximately $457 million at current prices. This represents one of the audacious corporate crypto strategies since MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation campaign . Today, SharpLink announces that our ETH holdings have further increased to 188,478, which were acquired at an average price of $2,513 per ETH. https://t.co/7kENpBWM41 pic.twitter.com/reFHxplxA9 — SharpLink Gaming (@SharpLinkGaming) June 24, 2025 “ Increasing SharpLink’s ETH holdings underscores our forward-thinking approach to creating long-term value for our stockholders ,” said Joseph Lubin, Chairman of SharpLink’s Board and Ethereum co-founder. Since adopting Ethereum as its primary reserve asset on June 2, the company has generated 120 ETH in staking rewards while achieving 18.97% ETH per share growth, according to the company’s announcement . Strategic Vision Behind the Ethereum Bet SharpLink’s transformation began with a $425 million private placement led by Consensys Software Inc. in May. SharpLink Gaming has landed a $425 million private investment in public equity deal, with blockchain leader @Consensys #Gaming #Ethereum https://t.co/xdHEYt7rB8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 The deal brought Lubin aboard as Chairman, providing institutional credibility and deep Ethereum expertise to guide the company’s treasury strategy. Rather than holding cash or bonds, the company has committed to Ethereum as its primary reserve asset, making it the first Nasdaq-listed company to adopt an ETH-focused treasury model. SharpLink’s approach extends beyond simple price speculation, with the company deploying 100% of its ETH holdings in staking solutions to generate yield while supporting Ethereum’s network security. This dual-purpose strategy allows the firm to earn additional ETH rewards while participating in the network’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, potentially creating a compounding effect as staking rewards are reinvested. The timing appears calculated, coming as Ethereum trades within a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800 after surging 80% from April lows. Industry observers note that SharpLink’s accumulation coincides with growing institutional interest in ETH staking, particularly as more than 35 million ETH tokens have been staked , representing over 28% of the total supply locked in smart contracts. Ethereum staking has reached a new milestone this week, with more than 35 million ETH, over 28.3% of the total supply. #Ethereum #Staking https://t.co/KPGqYuLR5p — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 21, 2025 The company’s aggressive equity-to-crypto conversion model has also created some speculations in the traditional finance circles, particularly given the gaming sector’s historically conservative approach to balance sheet management. Institutional Momentum Builds Across Multiple Fronts Institutional demand for ETH continues to accelerate through traditional channels. In recent weeks, BlackRock and Fidelity poured over $21 million into Ethereum ETFs , while on-chain data shows whale wallets accumulated 871,000 ETH in a single day earlier this month. Ethereum is seeing its most aggressive whale accumulation in seven years, raising speculations about what comes next for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. #Ethereum #Whale https://t.co/R6YYsZtrzW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 17, 2025 We’re beginning to witness a mature approach to the company’s adoption strategy, as it is becoming more selective about the digital assets that align with its specific business models. Recent developments across the crypto space support this thesis, as SharpLink’s strategy is just a mirror of a broader trend of institutional capital flowing into alternative cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. Earlier this week, China’s Nano Labs announced a $500 million convertible note agreement to accumulate up to $1 billion in BNB tokens, targeting 5-10% of the total circulating supply. @NanoLabsLtd has entered into a $500 million convertible note agreement as part of a broader strategy to accumulate BNB worth up to $1 billion. #NanoLabs #BNB https://t.co/mPyfq9HiSQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 Similarly, Nasdaq-listed Classover Holdings has revealed plans to raise $500 million for a Solana-based treasury , with 80% of proceeds allocated to SOL purchases. Even traditional blockchain projects are exploring treasury diversification, with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson proposing a $100 million conversion of ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin . These moves suggest that the era of single-asset treasury strategies may be ending as companies seek to optimize their crypto holdings for specific use cases.

2025-06-25T19:17:15,"Middle East Tensions Ease, Triggering Crypto Rally: BTC, ETH, and These 2 Altcoins Surge","As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East ease, the crypto market is responding with renewed bullish energy. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown early signs of recovery, while Solana and XRP are emerging as top altcoins poised to capitalize on the shift in sentiment. With global uncertainty dialing down, traders are now focused on breakout potential and upcoming resistance levels across key digital assets. This timely analysis is supported by Outset PR —a crypto-native PR agency that transforms market momentum into high-visibility storytelling. When the headlines shift, Outset PR ensures your project’s narrative moves in sync with the market. Ethereum (ETH): Poised for a Strong Recovery After Stabilization Source: tradingview Ethereum (ETH) is finding its footing between $2,000 and $2,500 as broader market sentiment improves. While recent pullbacks have tested short-term support, Ethereum’s fundamentals and developer momentum remain rock solid. A move back above $2,400 could set the stage for a retest of the $3,400 resistance—offering over 40% upside from current levels. With the RSI signaling room for growth and tensions easing globally, ETH may be gearing up for its next leg higher. Bitcoin (BTC): Holding Strong With Eyes on Breakout Above $113K Source: tradingview Bitcoin (BTC) is navigating a consolidation zone between $96,000 and $107,000, building strength for a breakout. With support holding at $92,000 and bullish sentiment returning as geopolitical fears subside, BTC could challenge the $113,000 resistance soon. If cleared, the next target lies near $123,000, offering a potential 10% rally. Despite short-term fluctuations, Bitcoin continues to be the dominant force in the market and remains on solid footing for a continued climb. Solana (SOL): Oversold and Ready for a Sharp Rebound? Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is currently trading between $119 and $152, showing signs of consolidation after recent price pressure. The RSI suggests the asset may be oversold, presenting a prime entry point for bullish traders. With growing developer activity and adoption, a breakout above $171 could pave the way toward $204—a potential 35% surge. Solana remains one of the most promising altcoins for the next market wave, especially if positive momentum returns. XRP: Momentum Building as Bulls Eye $2.95 Target Source: tradingview XRP is showing surprising resilience, holding steady between $1.84 and $2.27 while maintaining key support at $1.66. The RSI near 51 and a slight MACD uptick signal balanced conditions that could soon favor bulls. If XRP crosses the $2.52 resistance, it could accelerate toward $2.95, unlocking more than 20% upside. With legal clarity improving and interest in cross-border payments growing, XRP is positioning itself for a breakout moment.

The bank cited the risk that customers could face debts they would not be able to repay due to the high price volatility of crypto assets behind this decision. In the statement on Barclays' official website, the following statements were used: “As of June 27, 2025, crypto transactions will no longer be possible with Barclaycard. A fall in the price of crypto assets could lead to debts that customers cannot repay.

2025-06-25T18:45:47,"US Senator Adam Schiff Introduces Legislation To Stop President Trump’s ‘Exploitation’ of Digital Assets","US Senator Adam Schiff has introduced a new bill that aims to prevent President Donald Trump and his family members from enriching themselves via crypto. The potential legislation , titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, high-ranking executive branch employees, special government employees and members of Congress from issuing, sponsoring or endorsing digital assets. The ban would last from 180 days prior to an individual’s public services until two years afterward, and it would also extend to officials’ immediate family members. If passed, the bill would also require public officials to include crypto assets in their annual financial disclosures and periodic transaction reports. Schiff (D-California) says in a new press release that Trump’s crypto deals “have raised significant ethical, legal and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of the presidency to enrich himself and his family.” “That’s why I am introducing legislation to prevent the financial exploitation of any digital assets by public officials, including the president and the First Family. We need far greater scrutiny of the president’s financial dealings, and to stop him and any other politician from profiting off of such schemes.” Trump’s recent financial disclosure with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics indicated he pocketed more than $57.3 million worth of income from the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Income from Trump’s controversial memecoin, Official Trump, wasn’t listed on the disclosure because it was released in 2025. Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials. The president hosted the top 220 TRUMP memecoin holders at his private national golf club in Washington, DC last month. The announcement of the event caused the price of the asset to skyrocket .

2025-06-25T18:43:17,"AI predicts Dogecoin price for July 1, 2025","As meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin ( DOGE ) continues to trade in tandem with the broader market, two artificial intelligence (AI) models are projecting that the token is likely to make modest moves on July 1. Their forecasts suggest a price range between $0.158 and $0.185, depending on how the broader market develops. As of press time, DOGE was trading at $0.16, gaining about 0.6% in the past 24 hours. However, the meme coin remains down nearly 1% on the weekly timeline. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Overall, sentiment around the asset is bearish, as confirmed by technical indicators. Dogecoin is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $0.202 and its 200-day SMA of $0.187, signaling continued downside pressure. Additionally, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 40.54, pointing to neutral-to-bearish momentum with room to decline further before reaching oversold conditions. ChatGPT predicts DOGE price Regarding the price outlook, OpenAI’s ChatGPT presented three potential scenarios for Dogecoin on July 1, shaped mainly by Bitcoin’s trajectory, market sentiment, and trading volume. In a bullish scenario, if Bitcoin ( BTC ) breaks through key resistance levels and Dogecoin garners renewed attention on platforms like X, the coin could rise to between $0.175 and $0.185. ChatGPT highlighted DOGE’s sensitivity to influencer buzz and meme-driven hype, noting that a surge in volume could spark a 5–10% rally. In a neutral scenario, Dogecoin is expected to trade within a tighter band of $0.165 to $0.170, assuming Bitcoin remains stable and no major DOGE-related news emerges. In such a case, the token could drift slightly upward in line with recent consolidation trends. On the bearish end, DOGE could fall between $0.158 and $0.162 if Bitcoin pulls back or if DOGE loses technical support around $0.163. Weak sentiment, low trading volume, or regulatory concerns could accelerate a drop below the $0.16 level. DOGE price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts DOGE price Meanwhile, Grok, xAI’s predictive model, issued a single forecast projecting Dogecoin to reach $0.17 by July 1. Based on its current price of $0.16 and DOGE’s historically volatile nature, Grok assumes modest upward momentum driven by community enthusiasm or a general market rebound. However, it also noted the absence of strong fundamental drivers and cautioned that DOGE could oscillate between $0.15 and $0.19, depending on external factors such as social media trends or Bitcoin’s movement.

2025-06-25T18:41:04,"Billionaire Philippe Laffont Hints at Bitcoin Price Doubling, Says De-dollarization and End of US Exceptionalism Coming Into Play","Billionaire investor Philippe Laffont says that he’s been taking more time to think about Bitcoin, and wondering why he didn’t get involved with BTC earlier. In a new interview on CNBC, Laffont, the co-founder of hedge fund Coatue Management, says that when trying to estimate the “net worth” of the entire global economy, he feels that it’s not unreasonable for Bitcoin to represent at least one or two percent of that. Translated into pricing, it would suggest that BTC could double in value at some point in the future, putting the flagship cryptocurrency above the $200,000 mark. Says Laffont, “Every day I do think ‘why do I not own it?’ And I think to be a good investor, it’s not just owning the obvious stock, sometimes you have to change your mind and say ‘well I made a mistake and I’m changing my mind’ and maybe Bitcoin will be like that… I thought of like the market cap of the world [and] the net worth of the world is, I think $450 to $500 trillion, equities are let’s say $120 trillion, gold above and under the ground is $20 trillion. And then Bitcoin is $2 trillion. And I was like okay, well $2 trillion – let’s say it represents half a percent of the net worth of the world, could it go to one of two. Some people say Bitcoin’s going to $100 trillion, I’m like okay that’s maybe a bit of an aggressive estimate but could it double or a period of time? And then we talked about the de-dollarization, the end of US exceptionalism, so those would be of the reasons.” At time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,566.

2025-06-25T18:30:17,"Why Bitcoin Whales Are Rapidly Moving Into MAGACOIN FINANCE Alongside XRP and Kaspa","As digital asset markets mature, institutional and high-net-worth investors—often called “whales”—are quietly rotating capital toward early-stage projects with structural integrity and growth potential . In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading this shift, alongside growing whale interest in XRP and Kaspa , signaling a new wave of focused accumulation beyond Bitcoin’s traditional reach. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Smart Money Magnet MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly earned credibility among strategic investors, raising over $10 million in its pre-sale and selling out multiple rounds with consistent velocity. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens , a completed audit by HashEx , and its no-VC, community-governed structure offer transparency rarely seen in early projects. Whale wallets show steady accumulation, and on-chain metrics reflect rising wallet concentration and minimal churn—two signals of long-term conviction. The project’s focus on operational staking and passive income utility has positioned it as a prime candidate for those seeking a blend of security, scalability, and potential appreciation. Bitcoin: The Original Whale Play Bitcoin continues to dominate market capitalization and long-term portfolios. However, with its recent climb above $111,000 , many whales are now reallocating portions of their BTC holdings into new assets that offer earlier-stage potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefiting directly from this strategic redistribution. XRP: Diversifying for Growth XRP’s established role in cross-border payments remains intact, but regulatory ambiguity and slower price movement have prompted many XRP holders to diversify. Strategic capital has begun flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE , as well as Kaspa , which is gaining traction for its innovation and on-chain efficiency. Kaspa: The Technical Powerhouse Kaspa’s unique architecture and high-speed proof-of-work consensus have earned it a growing base of large investors. With favorable funding rates and accumulation signals rising, Kaspa is emerging as a legitimate competitor in the high-performance layer-1 space, often alongside mentions of MAGACOIN FINANCE in analyst portfolios. Conclusion As whale capital rotates with precision in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE , XRP , and Kaspa are emerging as core allocations for investors seeking structural soundness and early growth trajectories. For those tracking where the smartest money is moving, these three assets are clearly on the radar.

2025-06-25T18:30:16,"BlackRock Executive Says the Quiet Part Out Loud about Ripple (XRP)","A recent post by well-known crypto commentator Digital Asset Investor has stirred fresh speculation around Ripple and its ties to institutional power. The post centers on a pointed observation about a BlackRock executive’s remarks regarding XRP, hinting that there’s more to Ripple’s strategy than meets the eye. Digital Asset Investor wrote: “If I’ve learned anything about Ripple in the last 7 years, it’s that most don’t leave… they’re deployed.” This comment aimed to connect Robbie’s past experience at Ripple with his present as BlackRock’s digital asset leadership. This suggests that Ripple’s connections within traditional finance and government circles aren’t accidental, but strategic. According to him, the movement of key personnel between Ripple and major financial institutions reflects a deliberate effort to position XRP at the center of global financial infrastructure. BlackRock Head Of Digital Assets says the quiet part out loud. If I've learned anything about @Ripple in the last 7 years it's that most don't leave..they're deployed. If you think Robbie missed the part about XRP being created by Bitcoin developers to be a better Bitcoin you… pic.twitter.com/oV6LpBMcdk — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) June 25, 2025 He continued with a sharp critique aimed at anyone downplaying XRP’s origins: “If you think Robbie missed the part about XRP being created by Bitcoin developers to be a better Bitcoin, you would be the perfect buyer of my igloo in south Georgia.” The reference to “Robbie” aimed at BlackRock’s digital asset leadership, implying that those in charge know exactly w hat XRP represents and are not overlooking its foundational design or long-term purpose. XRP: Engineered to Improve on Bitcoin Digital Asset Investor’s claim about XRP’s origin is well-supported. XRP was developed by a team including Jed McCaleb, David Schwartz, and Arthur Britto—all of whom were closely involved in the early Bitcoin ecosystem. Dissatisfied with Bitcoin’s slow transaction times and energy-heavy proof-of-work mechanism, the team designed XRP as a faster, more scalable digital asset capable of handling real-world financial use cases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike Bitcoin, which functions mainly as a decentralized store of value, XRP was designed to move value quickly and efficiently, particularly across borders . This focus on speed, cost, and scalability has long made XRP a unique asset within the crypto space and a potential fit for financial institutions seeking blockchain-powered solutions. Institutional Interest Is Not a Coincidence Digital Asset Investor’s post implies that institutions like BlackRock are more aware of XRP’s value than they let on publicly. While traditional media often focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum, insiders in the crypto space have speculated for years that XRP’s real-world utility and foundational design have caught the attention of Wall Street’s top firms, quietly but deliberately. The idea that key industry figures are “deployed” rather than coincidentally employed aligns with a long-standing belief in the XRP community: that Ripple’s influence and its network run deep within global financial corridors. Digital Asset Investor’s latest comments pull back the curtain on a narrative long whispered in crypto circles. If XRP truly was created to improve upon Bitcoin, and if major institutions like BlackRock recognize this, then the silence around XRP’s potential may be more strategic than skeptical. The quiet part is being said out loud, and the implications are hard to ignore. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

What did he say, and do we have such banks today?","In a 2010 Bitcointalk forum post, Hal Finney, a cypherpunk involved in Bitcoin from day one, described the way he sees the emergence of Bitcoin banks in the future. He believed that peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions would be rare. Instead, people will use better-scaled digital cash issued by Bitcoin-backed banks. Table of Contents How was Hal Finney, and what did he write about Bitcoin banks? Was he talking about Bitcoin treasuries? Do Bitcoin banks exist today? How was Hal Finney, and what did he write about Bitcoin banks? Finney was a cypherpunk community veteran, working on various solutions that would help maintain online privacy. For years, Finney worked at PGP Corporation. He is the creator of the first reusable proof-of-work system, and he was the first person to receive a BTC transaction from none other than Satoshi Nakamoto. No wonder he was an influential figure in the Bitcoin community. He died in 2014 at the age of 58. In December 2010, the Bitcointalk user with the wobber handle initiated the discussion about how Bitcoin banks could work. While some people suggested that such banks could safely store clients’ bitcoins, charging them some fees or giving loans against Bitcoin, others were skeptical, viewing the idea as worthless. One of the users even mentioned Ripple as an already existing example. Hal Finney joined the discussion. He wrote that Bitcoin-backed banks have a good reason to exist. He saw Bitcoin banks as organizations issuing Bitcoin-redeemable digital cash for settling transactions. Finney noted that Bitcoin is not an efficient means of exchange, so the secondary layer payment system will solve this problem. In another post, he explained that large purchases in Bitcoin need more time so that the parties involved will see several confirmations. Finney saw Bitcoin-backed digital currencies issued by banks as the way to avoid this inconvenience. According to Finney, Bitcoin will be used by banks to settle net transfers between each other, while individuals will use other digital money for regular transactions. Finney said that banks can have different policies, currencies, interest rates, etc. He mentioned George Selgin’s findings on free banking as the reference for Bitcoin banks and stated that these banks could be self-regulating, stable, and inflation-resistant. Read more: Who is Hal Finney, and did he create Bitcoin? Was he talking about Bitcoin treasuries? On June 22, 2025, a Bitcoin Strategy CEO at Semler, Joe Burnett, published a screenshot of Finney’s post, stating, “Hal Finney foresaw the rise of bitcoin treasury companies.” Hal Finney foresaw the rise of bitcoin treasury companies. pic.twitter.com/Fa0J39WCss — Joe Burnett, MSBA (@IIICapital) June 22, 2025 George Selgin, whose work was mentioned in Finney’s post about Bitcoin banks, noted that Burnett is wrong that Finney was talking about something similar to Bitcoin treasuries. He wrote: “Mr. Burnett doesn’t seem to know the difference between a bank and a treasury company, two entirely different things. What Finney envisioned was a competitive system of Bitcoin-based banks, the IOUs of which would serve as second-layer payments media.” It’s fair to say that Finney’s vision is way different from Bitcoin treasury companies, as they don’t issue Bitcoin-backed digital cash that would have exchange properties. Treasuries issue stocks that are influenced by Bitcoin but not backed by it. More than that, these stocks are not used to buy anything. Treasuries (e.g., Strategy) often issue debt to purchase more bitcoins, hoping that Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation will pay off the debt or at least propel stock prices higher. Free banking, mentioned by Finney, supposes the existence of private currencies issued by banks. Such banks existed in the 19th century in several countries; however, by the 1950s, they were gone. Do Bitcoin banks exist today? The banks described by Hal Finney don’t exist today. However, he wasn’t completely wrong about Bitcoin-backed banks. Some banks have elements of Bitcoin banks, while the crypto community embraced stablecoins, which serve as a convenient means of payment and savings. For instance, some banks create treasuries to accumulate Bitcoin. They do it to hedge against fiat money debasement and believe Bitcoin reserves can boost their holdings. One of the banks that recently started to accumulate Bitcoin is Solar Bank . The idea of a second-layer digital payment system and multiple digital currencies is fully realized in the form of the altcoin market. Many cryptocurrencies are cheap and quick to transact, so in this regard, Finney was close to what we know today. However, only a few of them are issued by the banks; mostly, it is stablecoins. Central banks of several countries are working on CBDCs, which are not Bitcoin-backed. The DeFi platforms may provide some of the banking services in a decentralized manner; for instance, you may lend or borrow crypto there or keep it in exchange for yield. However, one cannot redeem these cryptocurrencies for a fixed Bitcoin price. Such a phenomenon as neobanks is a type of platforms that provide bank-like services and allow operations with crypto. Indeed, until Bitcoin becomes much more widely used as a means of payment, there is no reason for Bitcoin banks to emerge, for there won't be any profit in supplying substitutes for a relatively upopular means of exchange. — George Selgin (@GeorgeSelgin) June 23, 2025 Selgin claimed that he doesn’t think Bitcoin banks will emerge soon, as there will not be profit “in supplying substitutes for a relatively unpopular means of exchange.” However, Selgin is not dismissing the possible emergence of Bitcoin banks in the future.

2025-06-25T18:22:16,"Kalshi crosses billion-dollar mark as DC’s legal dust begins to settle","With a courtroom battle barely in the rearview, Kalshi is reportedly raising over $100 million at a valuation topping $1 billion. The timing suggests a calculated bet: that regulated prediction markets are finally finding legal and institutional footing. On June 25, Bloomberg reported that Kalshi, the federally regulated prediction market, is raising over $100 million in a funding round led by crypto investment giant Paradigm. The deal would push its valuation above $1 billion and put it in the same league as its unregulated competitor, Polymarket, which is also rumored to be aiming for unicorn status with a fresh $200 million capital injection. Kalshi’s raise comes just weeks after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission abandoned its legal fight to block Kalshi from offering political event contracts, effectively greenlighting a market that lets users bet on election outcomes under U.S. oversight. You might also like: Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC files 8-K with U.S. SEC to go public via merger As legal clouds lift, Kalshi turns to growth and distinction The CFTC’s recent surrender in its case against Kalshi marks a turning point. For months, the agency argued that political betting threatened market integrity, but Judge Jia Cobb’s September ruling, later upheld, found the CFTC overstepped its authority. The agency’s abrupt withdrawal in May, without explanation, suggests regulators may be shifting tactics rather than conceding entirely. Advocacy groups like Better Markets warn the precedent could invite manipulation and distort election integrity, but for investors, it signals a rare alignment: a crypto-native business model operating within U.S. law. While Kalshi has not publicly detailed how the capital will be deployed, the company is likely looking to expand its footprint ahead of the 2026 midterms and further develop its exchange infrastructure while scaling its compliance architecture. The CFTC retreat effectively removed one of the biggest obstacles to Kalshi’s long-term operation inside the U.S., and the company is keen to set precedents for how risk, opinion, and information might be traded legally in the open. By contrast, Polymarket, Kalshi’s closest competitor, continues to operate in murkier waters. Regulation vs. rebellion: the billion-dollar split in prediction markets Polymarket is nearing a $200 million raise at a comparable valuation, per The Information. Despite being banned for U.S. users, the platform has thrived, processing $3.2 billion in election bets in 2024 alone. Its integration with X embeds real-time prediction data into social feeds, blurring the line between gambling and crowd-sourced forecasting. But Polymarket’s success comes with risks. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has repeatedly singled out offshore platforms “providing exposure to U.S. customers,” a thinly veiled reference to the market’s VPN-reliant user base. While backers like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Vitalik Buterin bet on its censorship-resistant model, the looming question is whether regulators will tolerate its growth, or clamp down harder.

2025-06-25T18:12:37,"Satoshi? — Decade-Old 300 BTC Wallet Suddenly Springs to Life as Bitcoin Price Stabilizes","A dormant Bitcoin wallet containing 300 BTC, valued at nearly $30 million, has reawakened after over a decade of inactivity, sparking speculation across the crypto community. The wallet, believed to have been inactive since late 2011 or early 2012, initiated a transaction earlier this week, transferring 61 BTC worth approximately $6 million. The remaining 239 BTC, still residing in the address, are valued at around $24 million. While no funds have yet been sent to known exchange addresses, the move has reignited debate over the behavior of early Bitcoin adopters and the broader implications for the market. Blockchain analytics platform Whale Alert flagged the transaction Sunday, noting the address had shown no activity for over 11 years. These so-called “Satoshi-era” wallets, often attributed to early miners or adopters, contain coins acquired when Bitcoin traded below $10. With today’s price hovering just under $105,000, the owner of this particular wallet is sitting on a return of more than 23,000%. Notably, the activity coincided with heightened market volatility. Following the transfer, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply, breaking key support zones around $100,700 and testing a local low of $98,445 before recovering slightly and strongly on Monday. Market analysts suggest that while the transfer did not trigger a mass panic, it has prompted traders to exercise caution. “These old-school moves can jolt short-term sentiment, with traders watching for potential dump or just a stealthy rebalance,” said one observer on X. The mystery behind the motivation remains. Some speculate the holder could be preparing to liquidate a portion of their holdings, while others suggest it may be part of a larger asset reallocation strategy. Still, the fact that most of the coins remain untouched has offered some relief to investors wary of a sudden flood of supply. This isn’t the only dormant whale to resurface recently. On May 13, another post-Satoshi-era wallet holding 300 BTC, valued at over $31 million, became active after 11.1 years. And in April, a staggering 1,078 BTC worth more than $100 million was moved from a 2013 wallet, underscoring the growing trend of long-silent addresses stirring as Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs. Meanwhile, while retail traders continue to scale back, recent data from Santiment shows that whales and sharks, wallets between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have collectively acquired over 83,000 BTC in the past 30 days. On June 20, Santiment further highlighted how wallets with over 10 BTC increased by 231 in just 10 days. In contrast, smaller wallets holding between 0.001 and 10 BTC declined by 37,465 over the same period. With Bitcoin trading slightly above $107,391 at press time, this accumulation, paired with the reactivations of ancient wallets, highlights how BTC ownership is changing and how these changes can quickly influence market mood and behavior.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/satoshi-decade-old-300-btc-wallet-suddenly-springs-to-life-as-bitcoin-price-stabilizes/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

In a recent testimony to the US Senate, Powell tells members of the Senate’s banking panel that while the US dollar appears to be doing better, the Fed has yet to formally form an opinion on the matter. “I would go back to the thought that markets have been digesting an unusually challenging set of circumstances and have reacted the way they reacted. The dollar has kind of stabilized just now, in fact it’s moved back up in the last couple of weeks a bit. There are plenty of people who are still writing that the dollar is still overvalued, we don’t have a view on that of course… I don’t really have an official view I’d like to share, [but] I think there are possible explanations…one of which is that people still feel the dollar is highly valued, but we’ll see.” Touching on the subject of tariffs, Powell says markets are in uncharted territory since tariffs have only ever been going down for many decades. “We’ve been going through a long period where tariffs have been going down. Since World War 2 really, it’s been a process of lowering tariffs globally… There isn’t a lot of modern learning on that. One of the reasons [now] is so challenging is that we don’t have modern precedent.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
