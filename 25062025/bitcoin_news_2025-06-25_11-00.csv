2025-06-25T08:40:50,"Deep Sea Mining Firm Goes Deep on Bitcoin With $1.2B BTC Treasury Plan","Green Minerals (GEM), a Norwegian deep-sea mining firm, said Wednesday it bought four bitcoin BTC in its first purchase following Monday's announcement of a $1.2 billion treasury strategy as it joins the ranks of companies including the largest cryptocurrency in its broader financial strategy. The company said it paid about 4.25 million Norwegian kroner ($420,000) for the bitcoin, or about $105,000 per token. The Oslo-listed firm, which trades on Euronext Growth, framed the move as part of a transition into a more tech-integrated model. Executive Chairman Ståle Rodahl called bitcoin a hedge against inflation and fiat debasement , citing its “decentralized, non-inflationary properties” as key advantages over traditional reserves, in Monday's statement. The treasury plan adds Green Minerals to a rapidly expanding list of public companies incorporating crypto into their balance sheets. Over 245 companies now hold bitcoin, up 13% in the past month alone, according to data from Bitcointreasuries. Together, they hold more than $88 billion in BTC. The announcement triggered a sharp selloff in the company’s shares, which fell almost 20% on Tuesday. They were recently 2% lower. The company will establish a transparent and secure framework for the acquisition, management, and reporting of bitcoin holdings, such as a bitcoin-per-share indicator that will provide shareholders with “clear insights into the digital asset value attributable to each share.” The “core operational strategy remains steadfast,” the company said “The bitcoin treasury program will support the company’s project plans.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/25/deep-sea-mining-firm-goes-deep-on-bitcoin-with-12b-btc-treasury-plan,"BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Finance|Bitcoin|Norway|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T08:36:38,"$250 billion stablecoin market: Real-time audits key to avoiding next crisis","With more than $250 billion now circulating, stablecoins are positioning themselves as integral components within the macro liquidity framework, offering substantial financial utility beyond only crypto trading. As regulatory concern mounts and the stakes rise, those who can mint at scale and move sizable capital into the ecosystem may become one of the pillars of a new financial era. According to Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of Falcon Finance, a synthetic dollar protocol, the bar we put up for stablecoin infrastructure must therefore match that of traditional financial institutions: “If a stablecoin wants to operate at macro scale, it has to earn the same trust we demand from clearing houses and settlement networks. That’s what we mean by infrastructure that doesn’t just scale, but endures.” — Andrei Grachev Why ‘real-time proof’ is the future of trusted stablecoins The stablecoin evolution is a double-edged sword. Grachev warns that the underlying infrastructure hasn’t matured at the same pace. “The next big stablecoin winner won’t just have liquidity—it’ll have trust built into its core systems.” It also won’t just offer liquidity but real-time proof of reserves and redemption mechanisms that can weather a crisis. “We mean transparency you can verify, redemption you can rely on, and resilience under stress. That starts with real-time proof of reserves—not monthly PDFs, but automated attestations, ideally on-chain.” A recent $250 million USD Coin ( USDC ) minting event is a case in point, pointing to a surge in demand for stable, dollar-pegged liquidity and hinting at the potential of the evolving digital markets. Minting at this scale implies increased interest in crypto exposure, deeper liquidity, and tighter spreads. In short, it often foreshadows a rally since stablecoins like USDC are frequently used to lay the groundwork for large-scale trades. Ultimately, the stability and long-term viability of the $250 billion stablecoin market depend significantly on robust, real-time auditing systems and rigorous infrastructure. Ensuring these standards are met will be critical to avoiding future crises and reinforcing stablecoins as reliable pillars of global finance.

He Answered the Question!","FED Chairman Jerome Powell will present the “Semi-Annual Monetary Policy Report” to the House Financial Services Committee yesterday and today. Powell, who made his first presentation yesterday, made important statements on many topics from interest rate cuts to cryptocurrencies. Accordingly, the FED Chairman stated that inflation would increase in the coming months due to tariffs, but added that he supports interest rate cuts later this year. Related News: FED Chairman Jerome Powell's Speech Text Released! What Did He Say About Interest Rate Cuts? - Donald Trump Had Harsh Words for Powell! At this point, Powell stated that tariffs will have an impact on inflation in the summer months, and that this impact could be short-lived or long-lived. “The FOMC's obligation is to keep long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at 2% and to prevent a one-time increase in the price level from becoming a continuing inflation problem,” Powell said. Powell said the economy has plenty of room to cut interest rates if needed. Powell said current interest rates are high enough to warrant rate cuts, but he said they are prepared to take action if the impact of income and tariffs is short-lived as data suggests. “We think we will start to see the impact of tariffs on inflation in the summer months, in the June and July data. We may see that inflation is not as strong as we expected and that tariffs do not affect inflation much. If this happens, we can start reducing interest rates earlier. On the other hand, if we see inflation coming in higher or the labor market remains strong, then we will probably act later. However, the majority of Fed members think that interest rate cuts should be made towards the end of the year.” FED Has No Authority Over Cryptocurrency! FED Chairman Jerome Powell also spoke about Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. At this point, Powell stated that the FED cannot and will not request authorization to purchase crypto. Powell added that the Fed cannot legally purchase cryptocurrencies and is not considering seeking such authority. However, he stated that banks can offer cryptocurrency services as long as security is ensured and are free to operate in this field. In addition to his crypto statements, Powell stated that the dollar will continue to be the reserve currency for a long time. *This is not investment advice.

Calls for the next Bitcoin bear market continue to ring loud as analysts predict lower prices. One crypto analyst, known on X as Astronomer, has taken to the platform to give investors a possible roadmap of where the cryptocurrency is headed next and where to start buying for maximum gains. Next Course Of Action After Crash Following the Bitcoin price crash, Astronomer pointed out that the price had fallen below the expected close. However, it seems that the decline was not completely over, as there could be another final drop. This could come after the market reversal that has taken hold over the last few days, presenting another buy opportunity. Related Reading: XRP Price At Risk Of 20% Crash To $1.55 If This Level Fails To Hold From here, the crypto analyst explains that there could be a reversal toward the $95,000 level, and also a possibility of a bounce toward $110,000. As a result of this, the next area of action that investors could start buying from is placed at the $97,000 level, but the price could go lower. Astronomer explains that weekend lows are usually taken out, and with this weekend low still above $97,000, the price could revisit this territory. Nevertheless, the analyst explains that those who have been sidelined throughout the rally, or those who want to begin getting into the market, the Bitcoin price at around $97,000 is a good place to start. In addition to the current market factors, the analyst also points to sentiment and geopolitics as supporting the analysis. “It’s a shame we have to take advantage of blood being shed, from what’s happening in the world, but also from the bears soon at the end of this dip,” the analyst said. Where Is The Bitcoin Price Headed? With the announcement from US President Donald Trump that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, the market has already seen a recovery, with the Bitcoin price rallying to $106,000 initially. This has already triggered a turn in the sentiment from Fear back to Greed as investors begin piling in again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Hits New Cycle High Above 66% – How This 4-Year ATH Affects Altcoin Season In a subsequent post, Astronomer explains that missing out on the buy below $97,000 is no cause for alarm. But cautions against buying now due to fear. The analyst explains that such a move is not advisable as it could lead to losses, as buying during high euphoric times is not advisable. Given this, it is likely better to wait for a correction before going into the market. “Buying higher now during high euphoric times (especially locally), is a worse idea,” Astronomer warned. “Create good habits, create a solid plan, and stick to both.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-100000-2/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

Key Takeaways: Polymarket is nearing a $200M raise at a $1B valuation led by Founders Fund. Despite bans and an FBI raid, the platform continues to grow and attract major backing. With over 21,000 open markets, Polymarket has become a global hub for political and economic betting. The raise is being led by Founders Fund, the venture capital firm co-founded by billionaire investor Peter Thiel. The deal would give Polymarket “unicorn” status, a notable milestone for a company that remains inaccessible to U.S. users. Banned and Raided, Polymarket Still Draws Big Money Despite being banned domestically and targeted by federal authorities, including a November FBI search that resulted in the seizure of electronics from founder Shayne Coplan, Polymarket has continued to attract both capital and attention. The new investment follows over $100 million in prior funding, including an undisclosed $50 million round earlier in 2025. It also comes shortly after Polymarket announced a partnership with Elon Musk’s X , aimed at integrating its betting markets with commentary from Grok, X’s AI chatbot. This might be the most unexpected partnership of the year: X just teamed up with Polymarket. The platform that predicted Trump’s win while every poll showed 50–50. But this isn’t just a partnership… It's the death of traditional media. Here’s why it changes EVERYTHING: pic.twitter.com/gh2y2Ho601 — Ricardo (@Ric_RTP) June 7, 2025 Polymarket has made headlines for its rapid growth, especially during the 2024 U.S. presidential election. At its peak in November, trading volume reached $2.5 billion, fueled by speculation on political and geopolitical events. The platform allows users to bet on topics ranging from global conflicts and economic trends to legislation and local politics. Recent markets include predictions on a potential U.S. recession, the odds of Israel striking Iran again, and the likelihood of the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act becoming law , currently sitting at 87% according to the site. According to its analytics dashboard , Polymarket hosts more than 21,000 open markets, with 1.2 million traders, 20 million open positions, and $700 million in active trading volume. Data from Dune Analytics shows May’s monthly trading volume at $1.1 billion, down from the November peak but still substantial. While its growth has been remarkable, Polymarket also faces regulatory pressure beyond the U.S., with bans or restrictions in France, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Poland, and Belgium. It has also drawn scrutiny over alleged manipulation of outcomes. The firm competes with other prediction platforms such as Kalshi, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and Y Combinator. CFTC Probes Super Bowl Contracts by Crypto.com and Kalshi In March, the CFTC announced that it is reviewing Super Bowl-related prediction contracts offered by Crypto.com and Kalshi Inc. to determine if they comply with federal derivatives laws. Crypto.com introduced its sports event trading product last year, enabling users to make predictions on high-profile events like the Super Bowl. Despite that, the CFTC has expressed concern over whether such contracts qualify as legal derivatives. In January, the agency’s five commissioners voted to initiate a 90-day review of the Super Bowl futures products, effectively extending the probe past the game’s February 9 kickoff.

According to a June 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ETF, proposed under the ticker symbol B.T., would hold 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum. The product is structured as a commodity-based trust, with Yorkville America Digital named as sponsor and Crypto.com’s affiliated trust entity, Foris DAX Trust Company, acting as custodian for both crypto assets. The ETF aims to provide a simplified, single-ticker exposure to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. If approved, it would trade on NYSE Arca and offer retail and institutional investors access to spot Bitcoin and Ethereum markets through traditional brokerage platforms. The latest Form 19b-4 submission follows Trump Media’s June 16 announcement that it had filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC. While the S-1 covers disclosure and structural details required for a public offering, the 19b-4 is a separate procedural step seeking regulatory approval for the product to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange. Both forms are necessary before the ETF can launch. The Form 19b-4 reiterates key elements first outlined in the S-1, including the fund’s passive investment strategy and the use of CME CF benchmark reference rates to calculate net asset value. You might also like: Trump Media files Form S-3 with U.S. SEC over $2.3B raise for Bitcoin treasury According to the filing, the fund’s Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings will be custodied in cold storage by Foris DAX Trust Company, a Crypto.com affiliate. In addition to custody, Crypto.com will also serve as the execution agent and provide staking and liquidity services to support the fund’s operations. With the 19b-4 now submitted, the SEC will begin its formal review process. The Commission has up to 240 days to make a final decision, though an initial response is typically issued within 45 days. With crypto ETFs seeing heavy demand in the U.S., Trump Media has now put forward its second offering. The earlier proposal , filed June 3 via NYSE Arca, seeks to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, a spot product focused solely on Bitcoin, using the same sponsor and custodian as the dual-asset fund. As of now, it remains under SEC review, with the agency’s final decision expected by Jan. 29, 2026, if all extensions are used.

The recovery rally has pushed BTC into a critical supply zone around $106,500–$107,000, a level that previously triggered multiple rejections.

In a recent video, analyst Edward Farina made a comparison, claiming that buying XRP at this level is like buying Bitcoin when it was under $100. Farina warns that many traders are trying to time the market by selling now and hoping to buy back at lower prices, a strategy he thinks will backfire for 95% of them. “The breakout doesn’t wait for your plan,” he warned. Buying $XRP at $2 is the equivalent of buying BTC below $100. And most people are trying to sell now to ""buy back lower."" That’s exactly how 95% will be priced out. The breakout doesn’t wait for your plan. pic.twitter.com/I0FQFdbDhb — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 25, 2025 Drawing from his own experience in 2019-2020, Farina admitted he repeatedly lost out while attempting to outsmart the market. He sees the same pattern unfolding today, with many XRP holders recently selling below $2, convinced a deeper crash was coming. Some even placed buy orders anticipating a 30–70% drop, only to watch the market sharply reverse and turn green, leaving them on the sidelines. With influential figures like Arthur Britto resurfacing and several bullish catalysts emerging around XRP, it could be on the verge of a major breakout. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For June 25 , The Cold Wallet Strategy Farina advised keeping 90% of XRP in a cold wallet to avoid emotional selling and said to use only 10% for trading. His number one rule is to “ Never sell your core XRP bag .” According to him, XRP is the only asset that could “ skyrocket overnight .” A single catalyst, like an official Swift partnership or a major central bank announcement, could send the price soaring. In such a scenario, those who sold XRP to save 20 or 30 cents might find themselves permanently priced out of the market. XRP Under $2 Is a “Gift” Analyst DustyBC says that XRP under $2 is a rare opportunity, predicting the market will look back by December 2025 and recognize its value. Crypto Bitlord agrees, calling XRP under $2 a gift, and has set a $7 target.

The proposed Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF plans to allocate 75% to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum , offering investors exposure to both cryptocurrencies through a single product. Crypto.com has been appointed as the ETF's exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and provider of staking and liquidity services . The ETF's launch is contingent upon the SEC's approval of both the registration statement and a rule change application. If approved, the ETF will be listed on the NYSE Arca exchange. This initiative is part of Trump Media's broader strategy to integrate cryptocurrency into its business model. In May, the company announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to establish a Bitcoin treasury, reflecting its commitment to digital assets. However, the move has sparked controversy due to potential conflicts of interest, as President Trump actively promotes cryptocurrency while his company engages in related financial ventures. Critics argue that this intertwining of political influence and personal business interests could undermine regulatory integrity. The SEC's decision on the ETF is pending, and its outcome could significantly impact the intersection of politics and cryptocurrency investment in the United States.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-media-files-for-bitcoin-ethereum-etf-amid-crypto-expansion,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T07:25:52,"Bitcoin Price Trades Sidewise In June: Is The Bull Market Over?","Bitcoin’s price lost 2.29% in the 30 days ending Jun. 24. Meanwhile, a bevy of tech stocks like Palantir, Nvidia, and Oracle are flying high. Is the BTC bull market over? Or can BTC still hit the $150K – $200K price predictions for 2025, recently made by popular crypto investing commentators? Crypto exchanges are dynamic, fast-moving, open, global markets for these high tech Internet currencies. So no one knows for sure what Bitcoin’s price will do next until markets have moved. But there are some clues and historical patterns that savvy currency traders and investors use to decide what and when to buy, sell, and hold. The daily movements in June’s Bitcoin prices have confounded the bullish 12-month and 24-month trend. Here’s a quick rundown of Bitcoin vs. selected tech stocks in June. Bitcoin Severely Lags Tech Stocks in June 2025 For the 30 days ending Tuesday, Jun. 24, Bitcoin fell more than 2%. But global trade policy and military instability aren’t weighing on several important US tech stocks. Santa Clara, California-based computer chipmaker Nvidia, for example, the second highest-weighted US stock by market size, gained over 9.15% in share prices. Meanwhile, Denver, Colorado-based US data company Palantir, gained over 19.84%. Oracle, another high-tech data company, based in Nashville, Tennessee, and ranked #17 among all US companies by size, surged 32.5% for the 30-day window by market close on Tuesday. All three companies are ultra-high market cap with many useful points of comparison to Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency. They’ve been rallying, while BTC retraces its April and May gains. So is the crypto rally fizzling out? Bitcoin Price Rainbow Chart Recommends ‘BUY!’ Many experts don’t think so. A bear market in Bitcoin any time soon also does not align with the historical trend. Source: Bitbo.io According to the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, a popular trading recommendation tool based on Bitcoin’s historical price trend, the price appears far from its multi-year cycle peak. In fact, it is comparable on the rainbow chart to previous markets like Nov. 2020 and May 2017. The May 2017 market valued BTC at $1,434 per token on May 1. By Dec. 17, 2017, the price had skyrocketed to just above $20,000, for a 1,400% ROI in under 9 months. The Nov. 2020 market appraised Bitcoin at $13,862 on Nov. 1. By Apr. 15, 2021, the price rallied to $62,208, for a 450% ROI in under 6 months. Legendary veteran stock market chart trader Peter Brandt expects Bitcoin to move as high as $150,00 by August or September. In an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box in May, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz said he expects the price to top out above $150,000 before this cycle is over.

2025-06-25T07:21:53,"Crypto Tax Rules in India Trigger Mass Notices to Traders","The post Crypto Tax Rules in India Trigger Mass Notices to Traders appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News India’s stance on cryptocurrency continues to spark debate. On one hand, the government imposes a steep 30% tax on crypto gains, prohibits offsetting losses, and enforces a 1% TDS on every crypto transaction. On the other hand, it hasn’t outright banned digital assets, leaving the sector stuck between regulation and uncertainty. Mixed Signals From India’s Crypto Policy India’s crypto industry is divided. While Raj Kapoor , CEO of the India Blockchain Alliance, believes strict rules are better than ambiguity, many crypto players argue for reform. Local exchanges are pushing for: Reducing TDS from 1% to 0.01% Allowing losses to be offset against gains However, with rising concerns about tax evasion and cybercrime, authorities are hesitant to embrace liberal crypto policies just yet. Indian Tax Authorities Are Watching Crypto Traders Closely The Indian Income Tax Department has issued notices to thousands of individuals who traded digital assets but failed to report them in the FY 2022–23 and 2023–24 tax filings. Authorities suspect that some traders used crypto as a tool for tax evasion, exploiting the lack of detailed reporting standards during the early days of regulation. Crypto traders must now correct their filings using the updated return option. CoinDCX Co-founder Sumit Gupta has advised all users to report crypto income, including earnings from airdrops or global exchanges, and emphasized the need to stay compliant. India’s Crypto Tax Rules: A Barrier to Growth? India’s current crypto tax policy includes: 30% capital gains tax on digital assets No loss offset allowed 1% TDS on transactions exceeding Rs. 10,000 Due to these tough regulations, top global exchanges like OKX have exited the Indian market. Even homegrown platforms feel the pressure, urging policymakers to reconsider the TDS rate and revise the tax structure to promote growth and investment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Income Tax Department Takes Strict Action Against Undisclosed Crypto Income , Crypto Crime Rising in India: A Key Concern India’s reluctance to ease crypto regulations stems in part from the rise in crypto-linked cybercrimes. Recently, the CBI arrested Rahul Arora , seizing over $327,000 in crypto tied to scams in the U.S. and Canada . In February , the GainBitcoin scam led to raids on 60 locations and the seizure of $2.9 million in digital assets — a case involving over $800 million in fraud. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has now built in-house systems to track and seize crypto, signaling the government’s focus on creating a safer crypto environment before relaxing policies. Final Take: India Isn’t Crypto-Unfriendly, But It’s Cautious India isn’t against crypto, but it’s not fully embracing it either. With tax notices being sent, foreign platforms exiting, and cybercrimes increasing, the focus remains on compliance and safety rather than rapid liberalization. Until India establishes a robust regulatory framework, a truly crypto-friendly economy might remain out of reach. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

If approved, the ETF would hold bitcoin BTC and ether ETH in a 3:1 ratio and be custodied and executed by Crypto.com, which also serves as the fund’s liquidity provider. The filing, made under the SEC’s 19b-4 process, marks a key procedural step toward public trading but doesn’t guarantee approval. It comes less than a month after Trump Media said it would raise $2.4 billion to build its own BTC treasury, though there have been no announced purchases so far.

Pseudonymous trader Bluntz tells his 321,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin completed an ABC correction after its brief dip below $100,000 over the weekend. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness new rallies after concluding an ABC pullback. Says the trader, “BTC looking like a nice ABC here, bounced lower channel and reclaimed breakdown range. Send it to all-time high.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $106,111. Turning to Ethereum, the trader thinks that the altcoin has printed a low against Bitcoin ( ETH /BTC) after also completing an ABC correction. “ETH/BTC has probably bottomed here, in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.02308 BTC ($2,451). As for the Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin dogwifhat, Bluntz believes that WIF has completed an ABC correction as well and is now primed to ignite a five-wave surge. According to Elliott Wave principles, a five-wave rally is made up of three upside moves – waves one, three and five – and two corrective periods in waves two and four. “Still a lot of work to put in and need to see price action confirm, but I think there’s a very real chance a new impulse back to all-time high on WIF has commenced.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, WIF is worth $0.875.

2025-06-25T07:00:42,"Japan Eyes Crypto ETFs And Lower Taxes With Digital Assets Reclassification Proposal","Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has proposed a reform that could pave the way for crypto-based investment products and significantly lower the capital gains tax on digital assets in the country. FSA Proposes Crypto Assets Reclassification On Tuesday, local news outlet CoinPost reported that Japan’s Financial Services Agency announced it is considering reclassifying crypto assets as financial products under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA) and establishing a working group on digital asset systems. In a document titled “Review of the Regulatory Framework for Cryptocurrencies (Virtual Currencies),” the FSA proposed transitioning crypto assets, which are regulated under the Payment Services Act, into the FIEA’s framework. This transition would formally categorize cryptocurrencies as “financial instruments” and address the current limits of digital assets in Japan. The proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the FSA’s General Council meeting on Wednesday, June 25. Notably, the reform would lead to a change from the current progressive tax system, where digital asset gains can be taxed at up to 55%, to a system like the one used for stocks, with a flat 20% tax on crypto income. Moreover, it would improve access for institutional and general investors through the domestic approval of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and other investment products, as well as strengthening investor protection under the FIEA. Japan’s regulators have been cautious toward digital asset-based ETFs, with the FSA previously expressing reservations about the investment product, despite the success of US spot ETFs. Earlier this year, Japan’s Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Justice Junichi Kanda discussed with JAN3’s founder, Samson Mow, the “government’s current initiatives to enable Japanese Bitcoin ETFs and reduce taxes on Bitcoin.” Japan’s Regulatory Landscape According to the report, Japan’s regulatory change is reportedly influenced by the “proactive stance (…) taken by the Trump administration (…) and other U.S. government agencies such as Texas,” which recently became the first US state to create a publicly funded BTC reserve. This move is positioned as part of the government’s strategy to realize an investment-oriented nation, aiming to simultaneously create new value using digital assets and expand asset formation opportunities for the public through the comprehensive development of the Web3 and cryptocurrency fields. As reported by Bitcoinist, Japanese authorities have been working on reviewing their regulatory system for nearly a year, developing new policies to offer customer fund safety, while establishing a more reliable industry. In April, the FSA sought the public’s feedback on its framework draft, suggesting digital assets be divided into distinct categories to facilitate regulation and find a balance between user protection and promoting innovation. The proposed framework reviewed multiple aspects of financial regulations, including business regulations, disclosing and providing information, and insider trading measures. Its key proposal separated crypto assets into two categories to apply distinctly different regulatory approaches to each of these categories, depending on the assets’ nature. The FSA has emphasized that developing a “well-balanced environment that protects users and promotes innovation” is required for the crypto industry’s expansion.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/japan-eyes-crypto-etfs-and-lower-taxes-with-digital-assets-reclassification-proposal/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto ETFs|Crypto Regulations|Crypto tax|Japan Crypto ETFs|Japan crypto framework|Japan Crypto Tax|japan FSA",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T06:52:37,"Crypto Trader Sees Bitcoin Hitting $160K by Year-End; ETH, SOL, ADA to Gain on Middle East Truce","Bitcoin BTC is back above $106,000 after dipping below five figures earlier this week, as global markets steadied on signs that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding. Meanwhile, Ether ETH traded at $2,400, up 0.5% on the day, approaching resistance near $2,450. Dogecoin DOGE hovered at 16 cents after a minor 0.6% rise, while Solana’s SOL SOL dipped to $145, down 0.2%. Cardano’s ADA ADA slid nearly 1.3% to 58 cents after briefly testing the 60 cents level earlier in the week. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said BTC’s inability to stabilize immediately after its initial drop below $99,000 signaled lingering caution, even as ETF inflows — now totaling $46 billion — continue to provide structural support. “Its potential as a safe-haven shines through, but tempered risk appetite delays recovery,” Lee said. Despite this, Lee sees bitcoin hitting $110,000–$115,000 by Q3 and potentially $130,000–$160,000 by year-end. Lee expects ether to be in the $2,600–$2,800 in the near term and as high as $5,500 longer term. The rebound comes amid a broader shift in risk sentiment. U.S. equity futures edged higher on Wednesday, building on the Nasdaq 100’s record close the previous session, while Asian stocks extended their two-day rally. Treasuries firmed and the dollar steadied after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said “many paths are possible” for monetary policy, reinforcing bets on interest rate cuts as consumer confidence weakens. Bitcoin's recovery after its weekend fall has reignited debate over whether it’s maturing into a true safe-haven asset or simply responding to macro tailwinds and ETF-driven flows. “Bitcoin’s status as a safe-haven asset is still taking shape,” said Gadi Chait, head of investment at Xapo Bank. “Its V‑shaped recovery back above $105K in under 48 hours after falling into the nineties highlights its growing liquidity and integration into mainstream portfolios.” Chait added that while geopolitical shocks often spark a flight to cash, recent cycles show that institutional bids now help shallow the dips and accelerate rebounds.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/25/crypto-trader-sees-bitcoin-hitting-160k-by-year-end-eth-sol-ada-to-gain-on-middle-east-truce,"ADA|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL","Markets|Markets|Trading|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|Cardano|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T06:51:16,"Mutuum Finance holds strong as crypto slides on Iran-Israel tensions","Over the weekend, as tensions escalated in the Middle East after the US struck Iranian facilities, the crypto market experienced a massive plunge. The price of BTC fell below the critical $100,000 level. These strikes also affected the rest of the market, which slid in response to the plunge of BTC. However, Bitcoin (BTC) has since rebounded to above $103,000 as Trump clarified the strikes were limited in their extent. The rest of the financial markets have also stabilized. However, tensions remain high with fears of another dip if military action rises in the region. Amid this rising volatility in the crypto market, one crypto continues to experience growing attention from the crypto market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has seen a steady stream of capital into the presale as investors seek out new opportunities for growth. That has helped push the presale to astronomical heights, with analysts forecasting that MUTM tokens could rise 24x once they go live. Let us take a closer look at the presale. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. So far, over $11.1 million has been raised in the presale, from around 12,400 buyers. The phase presale price represents a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. This trend of gradual increases is expected to continue until the final listing price. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. As such, the current price of MUTM tokens is a massive 50% discount on the planned listing price. That represents a massive opportunity that investors are working fast to take advantage of. Based on the analysts’ forecast of 24x gains for MUTM tokens when they go live, a $1,300 investment in the presale today could grow to $31,200. Best of all, there is no limit on how much you can invest in the presale. That means you could potentially make a life-changing investment with this one presale. This is one opportunity that you should not let pass you by while you still have an opportunity to do something about it. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a well-designed protocol that will ensure long-term sustainable gains for its users. The team has taken major steps to inspire confidence in its community, including getting a CertiK, which proves that the team cares about the security of its users. According to the results of the audit, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has received a Token Scan Score of 95. This signals that the protocol is of high quality and a secure investment option for those looking for growth in the current crypto market. The protocol allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their assets into the protocol for a chance to earn interest via an APY. The APY in the pools is varied and is determined by the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises, it pushes up the interest rate, which encourages borrowers to repay their loans. At the same time, the rising interest rate encourages new lenders to join the protocol to benefit from the higher yields. This cycle ensures that liquidity in the protocol will rise continuously, while at the same time ensuring optimal capital efficiency. As a result, it will ensure the stability of the protocol in the long term. In real-world terms, if a user deposits $10,000 worth of USDC in a pool, and the utilization rate pushes up the APY to 18%, that means the deposit will receive $1,800 worth of USDC in a year. With the expected massive growth in the user base, this could ensure a long-term stable passive income for participants. Since rates are automatically adjusted in real time based on market demand, it will ensure that depositors always get the best rate possible. To help with tracking earnings on the protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use an innovation called mtTokens. For instance, when a user deposits their USDC in a pool, they will receive mtUSDC tokens in return. These tokens will represent the value of their deposit plus any interest accrued. The value of the mtTokens will be updated in real time to reflect the interest growth over time. A major advantage of this system is that users will not need to actively claim or compound their gains. As a result, it ensures full transparency for users. To support the growth of the protocol, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team plans to use protocol profits for marketing purposes and growing liquidity in the pools. Additionally, they plan to use protocol revenue to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market, which is expected to push up the price of the tokens. As their price increases, it will boost the visibility of the protocol, helping to bring in more profits. That will create a self-sustaining cycle of upward growth. With a 50% discount available in the current phase 5 of the presale, adding MUTM tokens to your portfolio could be your best crypto investment decision of 2025.

2025-06-25T06:30:00,"Bitfinex Securities Is Taking a Different Approach to RWAs, Launches Two New Products in the U.K.","These days, the mention of blockchain-based real world assets (RWAs) conjures up traditional finance institutions, like BlackRock, presiding over billions of dollars in tokenized money market funds. But the original promise of crypto was about opening up finance opportunities to anyone. That’s the ethos Bitfinex Securities is sticking to with its latest tokenized equity issuances: two alternative finance products in the UK, one focused on community banking debt, the other on litigation relating to mis-sold car finance claims. Announced on Wednesday, Bitfinex Securities’ “ TITAN1 ” product will allocate 5 million british pounds ($6.8 million) into subordinate debt issued by Castle Community Bank, a firm supporting loans to financially excluded customers in Edinburgh, Scotland. This alternative debt product will provide investors with a 20% dividend per annum (net of fees), which will be paid quarterly for up to 10 years, with non-callable provisions for the first 5 years, according to a press release. The second structure, “ TITAN2, ” will invest 100 million british pounds ($136 million) into litigation financing related to car finance mis-selling claims in the UK, a market expected to generate billions in compensation. Funds will be deployed through equity-linked notes and Investors will receive a 50% share of the claims recovery proceeds split proportionately among investors, Bitfinex Securities said. Both listings will be accessible to investors as tradable tokens via Bitfinex Securities’ secondary market. The tokens have been issued on the Liquid Network, a side chain of Bitcoin developed by technology firm Blockstream, where transfers require issuer authorization, with a whitelist system ensuring compliance standards and jurisdictional requirements. Looking back in time, Bitfinex Securities’ foray into tokenized RWAs pre-dates by some years the current trend for blockchain-based financial assets issued by institutions like BlackRock or Franklin Templeton. The firm started out with niche products like a tokenized bitcoin mining hashrate contract linked to Blockstream, followed by a number of bond issuances, including the first tokenized U.S. Treasuries offering in the nascent crypto hub of El Salvador, bringing T-Bill investments to individuals and organizations who were previously unable to access these products. Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities, takes a philosophical view of the current tokenization trend. “We want to be able to help people bridge that gap to investors,” Knutson said in an interview. “Whether it's a company or a bond issuance, or whatever it is, to raise capital and kind of fill that gap that's left by banks in many parts of the world that just aren't willing to lend, or where people struggle to get access to capital.” Fresh off a digital assets panel in London alongside BlackRock and UK asset manager Schroders, Knutson said there’s something of a bias in the ecosystem towards fixed income. Most of the focus is around money market funds, where people tend to buy and hold to get a yield, so there's just not a lot of trading, he said. “A big part of this is about disintermediation, and I think that’s something the institutional guys don't quite get,” Knutson said. “When you look at the details of what they've actually done, it's typically left hand to right hand. It's the same kind of people. It's going through depositories, it's going through transfer payment agents, all of the normal kind of parts of the traditional ecosystem, which I don't think are technologically probably necessary.” Read more: How the Next Wave of RWAs is Becoming Crypto’s Real Edge",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/25/bitfinex-securities-is-taking-a-different-approach-to-rwas-launches-two-new-products-in-the-u-k,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED","Finance|Tokenization|Bitfinex securities|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T06:18:18,"Bitcoin's Upcoming $14B Options Expiry Marked by Surge in Put-Call Ratio. What Does it Indicate?","Bitcoin's BTC put-call ratio has jumped ahead of Friday's multi-billion-dollar options expiry on Deribit, but its traditional bearish interpretation may not tell the full story this time. The put-call open interest ratio refers to the ratio of active put contracts to active call contracts at a given time. An increase in the put-call ratio indicates a bias towards put options, offering protection against downside risks, and is interpreted as representing a bearish market sentiment. However, the latest spike is at least partly driven by ""cash-secured puts"" – a yield-generation and BTC accumulation strategy. The strategy involves selling (writing) put options, a move analogous to selling insurance against price drops in return for a small upfront premium. At the same time, the writer keeps enough cash (in stablecoins) on the sidelines to buy BTC as obligated if the prices decline and the buyer decides to exercise the right to sell BTC at the predetermined higher price. The premium collected by writing the put option represents a yield with the potential for BTC accumulation if the put buyer exercises the option. ""The put/call ratio has risen to 0.72 — up from just above 0.5 in 2024— indicating a growing interest in put options, often structured as cash-secured puts,"" Lin Chen, head of business development - Asia at Deribit, told CoinDesk. Options expiry worth $14 billion looming On Friday, at 08:00 UTC, a total of 141,271 BTC options contracts, worth over $14 billion, representing more than 40% of the total open interest will expire on Deribit, according to data source Deribit Metrics. Of the total due for settlement, 81,994 contracts are calls, while the rest are put options. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC. Chen said that nearly 20% of expiring calls are ""in-the-money (in profit),"" meaning that a large number of market participants hold calls at strikes that are below BTC's current spot market rate of $106,000. ""This suggests call buyers have performed well this cycle, aligning with the persistent inflows into BTC ETFs,"" Chen noted. Holders of in-the-money (ITM) calls are already profitable and may choose to book profits or hedge their positions as expiry nears, which can add to market volatility. Alternatively, they might roll over (shift) positions to the next expiry. ""As this is a major quarterly expiry, we expect heightened volatility around the event,"" Chen said. Broadly speaking, most of calls are set to expire out-of-the-money or worthless. Notably, the $300 call has the highest open interest, a sign traders likely hoped for an outsized price rally in the first half. The max pain for the expiry is $102,000, a level where option buyers would suffer the most. Focus on $100K-$105K range Latest market flows indicate expectations for back-and-forth trading, with a slight bullish bias as we approach the expiry. According to data tracked by leading crypto market maker Wintermute, the latest flows are skewed neutral, with traders selling straddles —a volatility bearish strategy — and writing calls around $105,000 and shorting puts at $100,000 for the June 27 expiry. ""For #BTC options, flows skew neutral with straddle/call selling around 105K and short puts at 100K (27 Jun), pointing to expectations of tight price action into expiry. Selective call buying (108K–112K, Jul/Sep) adds a capped bullish tilt. IV remains elevated,"" OTC desk at Wintermute, told CoinDesk in an email.

A June 25 announcement, shared by Pompliano on X, outlines a business merger that would form ProCap Financial, Inc., a Nasdaq-listed entity. The move comes after a series of high-profile events for the company, demonstrating its intention to develop institutional infrastructure around Bitcoin ( BTC ). https://twitter.com/apompliano/status/1937655546695549235?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Just a day before the filing, ProCap disclosed the purchase of 3,724 BTC, worth approximately $387 million, at an average price of $103,785 per coin. In addition, the company recently raised more than $750 million, which included $225 million in convertible debt and $550 million in equity. The funds will support its long-term strategy of treating Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, according to investor materials.

ProCap aims to differentiate itself from traditional financial firms by generating yield on Bitcoin holdings while offering products for institutional investors. If the merger is completed, ProCap would become one of the top 15 publicly traded corporate Bitcoin holders globally, according to data from Bitcointreasuries.com. The special-purpose acquisition company merger route comes as more crypto-native companies explore public listings amid increasing regulatory clarity in the U.S. ProCap’s planned listing joins several digital asset firms seeking market legitimacy through public offerings. As part of the process, Columbus Circle and ProCap will submit a registration statement to the SEC, including a joint prospectus and proxy materials. Investors and stakeholders are encouraged to review those filings once available. Pompliano, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, has positioned ProCap as a pure-play on BTC’s future as institutional demand grows. With significant capital raised and a clear focus on Bitcoin-native financial services, the firm is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched crypto listings of 2025.

2025-06-25T06:11:38,"Ethereum price Eyes 107% Surge as Golden Cross Pattern Returns","The post Ethereum price Eyes 107% Surge as Golden Cross Pattern Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market turned green after a surprise ceasefire in the Middle East. Along with the ceasefire, a few other big changes took place in global markets, creating a bullish mood for cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins. The recent price drop could have been a bottom for altcoins, and the sharp recovery since then supports this view. Indicators also hint that altcoins could soon outperform Bitcoin. Ethereum and the altcoin market are showing signs of something big brewing. After the recent sharp drop in prices, which felt like a final shakeout for many traders, market charts are starting to look very bullish. Interestingly, just like how oil prices hinted at a ceasefire before it was officially announced, crypto charts too have a habit of predicting major moves before they happen. Ethereum and Golden Cross On Crypto Banter’s Ran Show, the analyst said that Ethereum is about to form a golden cross, a technical signal where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. In the past, this pattern has led to huge price jumps for ETH, including rallies of 107%, 25%, and even an incredible 2,500%. What makes it even more exciting is that the entire altcoin market, excluding Bitcoin, is also just days away from forming its own golden cross. Historically, these moments have triggered powerful rallies in the market. With interest rates falling, market sentiment shifting, and technical signals lining up, it looks like Ethereum and altcoins might be getting ready for a strong move upward in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Short-Term Price Targets: Ethereum has seen a short rally in the past 12 hours, but it’s too early to confirm a strong recovery. Important support lies around $2,380, this level must hold to keep hopes alive for a bigger breakout. If Ethereum can push a little higher to around $2,477, it would strengthen the bullish case.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ethereum-price-eyes-107-surge-as-golden-cross-pattern-returns/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
