2025-06-25T18:45:47,"US Senator Adam Schiff Introduces Legislation To Stop President Trump’s ‘Exploitation’ of Digital Assets","US Senator Adam Schiff has introduced a new bill that aims to prevent President Donald Trump and his family members from enriching themselves via crypto. The potential legislation , titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, high-ranking executive branch employees, special government employees and members of Congress from issuing, sponsoring or endorsing digital assets. The ban would last from 180 days prior to an individual’s public services until two years afterward, and it would also extend to officials’ immediate family members. If passed, the bill would also require public officials to include crypto assets in their annual financial disclosures and periodic transaction reports. Schiff (D-California) says in a new press release that Trump’s crypto deals “have raised significant ethical, legal and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of the presidency to enrich himself and his family.” “That’s why I am introducing legislation to prevent the financial exploitation of any digital assets by public officials, including the president and the First Family. We need far greater scrutiny of the president’s financial dealings, and to stop him and any other politician from profiting off of such schemes.” Trump’s recent financial disclosure with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics indicated he pocketed more than $57.3 million worth of income from the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Income from Trump’s controversial memecoin, Official Trump, wasn’t listed on the disclosure because it was released in 2025. Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials. The president hosted the top 220 TRUMP memecoin holders at his private national golf club in Washington, DC last month. The announcement of the event caused the price of the asset to skyrocket .

2025-06-25T18:43:17,"AI predicts Dogecoin price for July 1, 2025","As meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin ( DOGE ) continues to trade in tandem with the broader market, two artificial intelligence (AI) models are projecting that the token is likely to make modest moves on July 1. Their forecasts suggest a price range between $0.158 and $0.185, depending on how the broader market develops. As of press time, DOGE was trading at $0.16, gaining about 0.6% in the past 24 hours. However, the meme coin remains down nearly 1% on the weekly timeline. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Overall, sentiment around the asset is bearish, as confirmed by technical indicators. Dogecoin is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $0.202 and its 200-day SMA of $0.187, signaling continued downside pressure. Additionally, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 40.54, pointing to neutral-to-bearish momentum with room to decline further before reaching oversold conditions. ChatGPT predicts DOGE price Regarding the price outlook, OpenAI’s ChatGPT presented three potential scenarios for Dogecoin on July 1, shaped mainly by Bitcoin’s trajectory, market sentiment, and trading volume. In a bullish scenario, if Bitcoin ( BTC ) breaks through key resistance levels and Dogecoin garners renewed attention on platforms like X, the coin could rise to between $0.175 and $0.185. ChatGPT highlighted DOGE’s sensitivity to influencer buzz and meme-driven hype, noting that a surge in volume could spark a 5–10% rally. In a neutral scenario, Dogecoin is expected to trade within a tighter band of $0.165 to $0.170, assuming Bitcoin remains stable and no major DOGE-related news emerges. In such a case, the token could drift slightly upward in line with recent consolidation trends. On the bearish end, DOGE could fall between $0.158 and $0.162 if Bitcoin pulls back or if DOGE loses technical support around $0.163. Weak sentiment, low trading volume, or regulatory concerns could accelerate a drop below the $0.16 level. DOGE price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts DOGE price Meanwhile, Grok, xAI’s predictive model, issued a single forecast projecting Dogecoin to reach $0.17 by July 1. Based on its current price of $0.16 and DOGE’s historically volatile nature, Grok assumes modest upward momentum driven by community enthusiasm or a general market rebound. However, it also noted the absence of strong fundamental drivers and cautioned that DOGE could oscillate between $0.15 and $0.19, depending on external factors such as social media trends or Bitcoin’s movement.

2025-06-25T18:41:04,"Billionaire Philippe Laffont Hints at Bitcoin Price Doubling, Says De-dollarization and End of US Exceptionalism Coming Into Play","Billionaire investor Philippe Laffont says that he’s been taking more time to think about Bitcoin, and wondering why he didn’t get involved with BTC earlier. In a new interview on CNBC, Laffont, the co-founder of hedge fund Coatue Management, says that when trying to estimate the “net worth” of the entire global economy, he feels that it’s not unreasonable for Bitcoin to represent at least one or two percent of that. Translated into pricing, it would suggest that BTC could double in value at some point in the future, putting the flagship cryptocurrency above the $200,000 mark. Says Laffont, “Every day I do think ‘why do I not own it?’ And I think to be a good investor, it’s not just owning the obvious stock, sometimes you have to change your mind and say ‘well I made a mistake and I’m changing my mind’ and maybe Bitcoin will be like that… I thought of like the market cap of the world [and] the net worth of the world is, I think $450 to $500 trillion, equities are let’s say $120 trillion, gold above and under the ground is $20 trillion. And then Bitcoin is $2 trillion. And I was like okay, well $2 trillion – let’s say it represents half a percent of the net worth of the world, could it go to one of two. Some people say Bitcoin’s going to $100 trillion, I’m like okay that’s maybe a bit of an aggressive estimate but could it double or a period of time? And then we talked about the de-dollarization, the end of US exceptionalism, so those would be of the reasons.” At time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,566.

2025-06-25T18:30:17,"Why Bitcoin Whales Are Rapidly Moving Into MAGACOIN FINANCE Alongside XRP and Kaspa","As digital asset markets mature, institutional and high-net-worth investors—often called “whales”—are quietly rotating capital toward early-stage projects with structural integrity and growth potential . In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading this shift, alongside growing whale interest in XRP and Kaspa , signaling a new wave of focused accumulation beyond Bitcoin’s traditional reach. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Smart Money Magnet MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly earned credibility among strategic investors, raising over $10 million in its pre-sale and selling out multiple rounds with consistent velocity. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens , a completed audit by HashEx , and its no-VC, community-governed structure offer transparency rarely seen in early projects. Whale wallets show steady accumulation, and on-chain metrics reflect rising wallet concentration and minimal churn—two signals of long-term conviction. The project’s focus on operational staking and passive income utility has positioned it as a prime candidate for those seeking a blend of security, scalability, and potential appreciation. Bitcoin: The Original Whale Play Bitcoin continues to dominate market capitalization and long-term portfolios. However, with its recent climb above $111,000 , many whales are now reallocating portions of their BTC holdings into new assets that offer earlier-stage potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefiting directly from this strategic redistribution. XRP: Diversifying for Growth XRP’s established role in cross-border payments remains intact, but regulatory ambiguity and slower price movement have prompted many XRP holders to diversify. Strategic capital has begun flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE , as well as Kaspa , which is gaining traction for its innovation and on-chain efficiency. Kaspa: The Technical Powerhouse Kaspa’s unique architecture and high-speed proof-of-work consensus have earned it a growing base of large investors. With favorable funding rates and accumulation signals rising, Kaspa is emerging as a legitimate competitor in the high-performance layer-1 space, often alongside mentions of MAGACOIN FINANCE in analyst portfolios. Conclusion As whale capital rotates with precision in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE , XRP , and Kaspa are emerging as core allocations for investors seeking structural soundness and early growth trajectories. For those tracking where the smartest money is moving, these three assets are clearly on the radar.

2025-06-25T18:30:16,"BlackRock Executive Says the Quiet Part Out Loud about Ripple (XRP)","A recent post by well-known crypto commentator Digital Asset Investor has stirred fresh speculation around Ripple and its ties to institutional power. The post centers on a pointed observation about a BlackRock executive’s remarks regarding XRP, hinting that there’s more to Ripple’s strategy than meets the eye. Digital Asset Investor wrote: “If I’ve learned anything about Ripple in the last 7 years, it’s that most don’t leave… they’re deployed.” This comment aimed to connect Robbie’s past experience at Ripple with his present as BlackRock’s digital asset leadership. This suggests that Ripple’s connections within traditional finance and government circles aren’t accidental, but strategic. According to him, the movement of key personnel between Ripple and major financial institutions reflects a deliberate effort to position XRP at the center of global financial infrastructure. BlackRock Head Of Digital Assets says the quiet part out loud. If I've learned anything about @Ripple in the last 7 years it's that most don't leave..they're deployed. If you think Robbie missed the part about XRP being created by Bitcoin developers to be a better Bitcoin you… pic.twitter.com/oV6LpBMcdk — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) June 25, 2025 He continued with a sharp critique aimed at anyone downplaying XRP’s origins: “If you think Robbie missed the part about XRP being created by Bitcoin developers to be a better Bitcoin, you would be the perfect buyer of my igloo in south Georgia.” The reference to “Robbie” aimed at BlackRock’s digital asset leadership, implying that those in charge know exactly w hat XRP represents and are not overlooking its foundational design or long-term purpose. XRP: Engineered to Improve on Bitcoin Digital Asset Investor’s claim about XRP’s origin is well-supported. XRP was developed by a team including Jed McCaleb, David Schwartz, and Arthur Britto—all of whom were closely involved in the early Bitcoin ecosystem. Dissatisfied with Bitcoin’s slow transaction times and energy-heavy proof-of-work mechanism, the team designed XRP as a faster, more scalable digital asset capable of handling real-world financial use cases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike Bitcoin, which functions mainly as a decentralized store of value, XRP was designed to move value quickly and efficiently, particularly across borders . This focus on speed, cost, and scalability has long made XRP a unique asset within the crypto space and a potential fit for financial institutions seeking blockchain-powered solutions. Institutional Interest Is Not a Coincidence Digital Asset Investor’s post implies that institutions like BlackRock are more aware of XRP’s value than they let on publicly. While traditional media often focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum, insiders in the crypto space have speculated for years that XRP’s real-world utility and foundational design have caught the attention of Wall Street’s top firms, quietly but deliberately. The idea that key industry figures are “deployed” rather than coincidentally employed aligns with a long-standing belief in the XRP community: that Ripple’s influence and its network run deep within global financial corridors. Digital Asset Investor’s latest comments pull back the curtain on a narrative long whispered in crypto circles. If XRP truly was created to improve upon Bitcoin, and if major institutions like BlackRock recognize this, then the silence around XRP’s potential may be more strategic than skeptical. The quiet part is being said out loud, and the implications are hard to ignore. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-25T18:23:00,"In 2010, Hal Finney described the Bitcoin banks of the future. What did he say, and do we have such banks today?","In a 2010 Bitcointalk forum post, Hal Finney, a cypherpunk involved in Bitcoin from day one, described the way he sees the emergence of Bitcoin banks in the future. He believed that peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions would be rare. Instead, people will use better-scaled digital cash issued by Bitcoin-backed banks. Table of Contents How was Hal Finney, and what did he write about Bitcoin banks? Was he talking about Bitcoin treasuries? Do Bitcoin banks exist today? How was Hal Finney, and what did he write about Bitcoin banks? Finney was a cypherpunk community veteran, working on various solutions that would help maintain online privacy. For years, Finney worked at PGP Corporation. He is the creator of the first reusable proof-of-work system, and he was the first person to receive a BTC transaction from none other than Satoshi Nakamoto. No wonder he was an influential figure in the Bitcoin community. He died in 2014 at the age of 58. In December 2010, the Bitcointalk user with the wobber handle initiated the discussion about how Bitcoin banks could work. While some people suggested that such banks could safely store clients’ bitcoins, charging them some fees or giving loans against Bitcoin, others were skeptical, viewing the idea as worthless. One of the users even mentioned Ripple as an already existing example. Hal Finney joined the discussion. He wrote that Bitcoin-backed banks have a good reason to exist. He saw Bitcoin banks as organizations issuing Bitcoin-redeemable digital cash for settling transactions. Finney noted that Bitcoin is not an efficient means of exchange, so the secondary layer payment system will solve this problem. In another post, he explained that large purchases in Bitcoin need more time so that the parties involved will see several confirmations. Finney saw Bitcoin-backed digital currencies issued by banks as the way to avoid this inconvenience. According to Finney, Bitcoin will be used by banks to settle net transfers between each other, while individuals will use other digital money for regular transactions. Finney said that banks can have different policies, currencies, interest rates, etc. He mentioned George Selgin’s findings on free banking as the reference for Bitcoin banks and stated that these banks could be self-regulating, stable, and inflation-resistant. Read more: Who is Hal Finney, and did he create Bitcoin? Was he talking about Bitcoin treasuries? On June 22, 2025, a Bitcoin Strategy CEO at Semler, Joe Burnett, published a screenshot of Finney’s post, stating, “Hal Finney foresaw the rise of bitcoin treasury companies.” Hal Finney foresaw the rise of bitcoin treasury companies. pic.twitter.com/Fa0J39WCss — Joe Burnett, MSBA (@IIICapital) June 22, 2025 George Selgin, whose work was mentioned in Finney’s post about Bitcoin banks, noted that Burnett is wrong that Finney was talking about something similar to Bitcoin treasuries. He wrote: “Mr. Burnett doesn’t seem to know the difference between a bank and a treasury company, two entirely different things. What Finney envisioned was a competitive system of Bitcoin-based banks, the IOUs of which would serve as second-layer payments media.” It’s fair to say that Finney’s vision is way different from Bitcoin treasury companies, as they don’t issue Bitcoin-backed digital cash that would have exchange properties. Treasuries issue stocks that are influenced by Bitcoin but not backed by it. More than that, these stocks are not used to buy anything. Treasuries (e.g., Strategy) often issue debt to purchase more bitcoins, hoping that Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation will pay off the debt or at least propel stock prices higher. Free banking, mentioned by Finney, supposes the existence of private currencies issued by banks. Such banks existed in the 19th century in several countries; however, by the 1950s, they were gone. Do Bitcoin banks exist today? The banks described by Hal Finney don’t exist today. However, he wasn’t completely wrong about Bitcoin-backed banks. Some banks have elements of Bitcoin banks, while the crypto community embraced stablecoins, which serve as a convenient means of payment and savings. For instance, some banks create treasuries to accumulate Bitcoin. They do it to hedge against fiat money debasement and believe Bitcoin reserves can boost their holdings. One of the banks that recently started to accumulate Bitcoin is Solar Bank . The idea of a second-layer digital payment system and multiple digital currencies is fully realized in the form of the altcoin market. Many cryptocurrencies are cheap and quick to transact, so in this regard, Finney was close to what we know today. However, only a few of them are issued by the banks; mostly, it is stablecoins. Central banks of several countries are working on CBDCs, which are not Bitcoin-backed. The DeFi platforms may provide some of the banking services in a decentralized manner; for instance, you may lend or borrow crypto there or keep it in exchange for yield. However, one cannot redeem these cryptocurrencies for a fixed Bitcoin price. Such a phenomenon as neobanks is a type of platforms that provide bank-like services and allow operations with crypto. Indeed, until Bitcoin becomes much more widely used as a means of payment, there is no reason for Bitcoin banks to emerge, for there won't be any profit in supplying substitutes for a relatively upopular means of exchange. — George Selgin (@GeorgeSelgin) June 23, 2025 Selgin claimed that he doesn’t think Bitcoin banks will emerge soon, as there will not be profit “in supplying substitutes for a relatively unpopular means of exchange.” However, Selgin is not dismissing the possible emergence of Bitcoin banks in the future.

2025-06-25T18:22:16,"Kalshi crosses billion-dollar mark as DC’s legal dust begins to settle","With a courtroom battle barely in the rearview, Kalshi is reportedly raising over $100 million at a valuation topping $1 billion. The timing suggests a calculated bet: that regulated prediction markets are finally finding legal and institutional footing. On June 25, Bloomberg reported that Kalshi, the federally regulated prediction market, is raising over $100 million in a funding round led by crypto investment giant Paradigm. The deal would push its valuation above $1 billion and put it in the same league as its unregulated competitor, Polymarket, which is also rumored to be aiming for unicorn status with a fresh $200 million capital injection. Kalshi’s raise comes just weeks after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission abandoned its legal fight to block Kalshi from offering political event contracts, effectively greenlighting a market that lets users bet on election outcomes under U.S. oversight. You might also like: Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC files 8-K with U.S. SEC to go public via merger As legal clouds lift, Kalshi turns to growth and distinction The CFTC’s recent surrender in its case against Kalshi marks a turning point. For months, the agency argued that political betting threatened market integrity, but Judge Jia Cobb’s September ruling, later upheld, found the CFTC overstepped its authority. The agency’s abrupt withdrawal in May, without explanation, suggests regulators may be shifting tactics rather than conceding entirely. Advocacy groups like Better Markets warn the precedent could invite manipulation and distort election integrity, but for investors, it signals a rare alignment: a crypto-native business model operating within U.S. law. While Kalshi has not publicly detailed how the capital will be deployed, the company is likely looking to expand its footprint ahead of the 2026 midterms and further develop its exchange infrastructure while scaling its compliance architecture. The CFTC retreat effectively removed one of the biggest obstacles to Kalshi’s long-term operation inside the U.S., and the company is keen to set precedents for how risk, opinion, and information might be traded legally in the open. By contrast, Polymarket, Kalshi’s closest competitor, continues to operate in murkier waters. Regulation vs. rebellion: the billion-dollar split in prediction markets Polymarket is nearing a $200 million raise at a comparable valuation, per The Information. Despite being banned for U.S. users, the platform has thrived, processing $3.2 billion in election bets in 2024 alone. Its integration with X embeds real-time prediction data into social feeds, blurring the line between gambling and crowd-sourced forecasting. But Polymarket’s success comes with risks. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has repeatedly singled out offshore platforms “providing exposure to U.S. customers,” a thinly veiled reference to the market’s VPN-reliant user base. While backers like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Vitalik Buterin bet on its censorship-resistant model, the looming question is whether regulators will tolerate its growth, or clamp down harder.

2025-06-25T18:12:37,"Satoshi? — Decade-Old 300 BTC Wallet Suddenly Springs to Life as Bitcoin Price Stabilizes","A dormant Bitcoin wallet containing 300 BTC, valued at nearly $30 million, has reawakened after over a decade of inactivity, sparking speculation across the crypto community. The wallet, believed to have been inactive since late 2011 or early 2012, initiated a transaction earlier this week, transferring 61 BTC worth approximately $6 million. The remaining 239 BTC, still residing in the address, are valued at around $24 million. While no funds have yet been sent to known exchange addresses, the move has reignited debate over the behavior of early Bitcoin adopters and the broader implications for the market. Blockchain analytics platform Whale Alert flagged the transaction Sunday, noting the address had shown no activity for over 11 years. These so-called “Satoshi-era” wallets, often attributed to early miners or adopters, contain coins acquired when Bitcoin traded below $10. With today’s price hovering just under $105,000, the owner of this particular wallet is sitting on a return of more than 23,000%. Notably, the activity coincided with heightened market volatility. Following the transfer, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply, breaking key support zones around $100,700 and testing a local low of $98,445 before recovering slightly and strongly on Monday. Market analysts suggest that while the transfer did not trigger a mass panic, it has prompted traders to exercise caution. “These old-school moves can jolt short-term sentiment, with traders watching for potential dump or just a stealthy rebalance,” said one observer on X. The mystery behind the motivation remains. Some speculate the holder could be preparing to liquidate a portion of their holdings, while others suggest it may be part of a larger asset reallocation strategy. Still, the fact that most of the coins remain untouched has offered some relief to investors wary of a sudden flood of supply. This isn’t the only dormant whale to resurface recently. On May 13, another post-Satoshi-era wallet holding 300 BTC, valued at over $31 million, became active after 11.1 years. And in April, a staggering 1,078 BTC worth more than $100 million was moved from a 2013 wallet, underscoring the growing trend of long-silent addresses stirring as Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs. Meanwhile, while retail traders continue to scale back, recent data from Santiment shows that whales and sharks, wallets between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have collectively acquired over 83,000 BTC in the past 30 days. On June 20, Santiment further highlighted how wallets with over 10 BTC increased by 231 in just 10 days. In contrast, smaller wallets holding between 0.001 and 10 BTC declined by 37,465 over the same period. With Bitcoin trading slightly above $107,391 at press time, this accumulation, paired with the reactivations of ancient wallets, highlights how BTC ownership is changing and how these changes can quickly influence market mood and behavior.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/satoshi-decade-old-300-btc-wallet-suddenly-springs-to-life-as-bitcoin-price-stabilizes/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

In a recent testimony to the US Senate, Powell tells members of the Senate’s banking panel that while the US dollar appears to be doing better, the Fed has yet to formally form an opinion on the matter. “I would go back to the thought that markets have been digesting an unusually challenging set of circumstances and have reacted the way they reacted. The dollar has kind of stabilized just now, in fact it’s moved back up in the last couple of weeks a bit. There are plenty of people who are still writing that the dollar is still overvalued, we don’t have a view on that of course… I don’t really have an official view I’d like to share, [but] I think there are possible explanations…one of which is that people still feel the dollar is highly valued, but we’ll see.” Touching on the subject of tariffs, Powell says markets are in uncharted territory since tariffs have only ever been going down for many decades. “We’ve been going through a long period where tariffs have been going down. Since World War 2 really, it’s been a process of lowering tariffs globally… There isn’t a lot of modern learning on that.

MSTR stock was trading at $377 on Wednesday, a few points above this week’s low of $360. It has jumped nearly 70% from its lowest level this year. Strategy stock technical analysis points to a surge The daily chart shows that the MSTR stock price has been in a tight range since May. It has remained above the 100-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages, which have provided it with substantial support. Further, Strategy has formed a bullish pennant pattern, which often leads to additional gains. This pattern is composed of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle, with a breakout occurring when the two lines near their confluence level. The profit target in a bullish pennant is established by first measuring the length of the flagpole and then extrapolating the same distance from the breakout point. In this case, the flagpole’s length is $200—$420 minus $230. The breakout point is $385, bringing the target price to $585, up 52% from the current level. A drop below the support at $342 will invalidate the bullish forecast. This price is the neckline of the double-bottom pattern at $230. MSTR stock price chart | Source: TradingView Odds of Bitcoin price hitting all-time high are rising The main catalyst for the Strategy stock price is the odds of Bitcoin ( BTC ) hitting a record high before October have jumped to 81% on Polymarket . Such a move would be bullish for Strategy because it holds 592,345 Bitcoins currently valued at over $63 billion. You might also like: Can Sei price keep climbing after Circle’s backing and ETF buzz?

2025-06-25T18:00:16,"Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum Gains? Solana Investors Turn to VeChain","The crypto market is defined by cycles of innovation, early accumulation, and disruptive momentum. As 2025 unfolds, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the year’s fastest moving pre-launch candidates. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, traders are paying attention to this rising contender. Meanwhile, Solana holders are eyeing VeChain as a strong diversification play grounded in real-world use cases. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing headlines with its rapid presale success—raising over $10 million and selling out phases faster than most established altcoins. The project combines meme appeal with technical credibility: a fully audited smart contract via HashEx , capped supply of 170 billion tokens , and a no-VC structure that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its community-first strategy, transparent rollout, and surging demand have made it one of the most closely watched early-stage projects of 2025. For many traders, it evokes the early momentum seen in past generational tokens—fueling speculation it could outperform legacy giants by percentage return. Bitcoin: The Benchmark with Modest Upside Bitcoin has recently pushed past $111,000 , driven by ETF adoption and institutional inflows. While it remains the cornerstone of the crypto market, many long-time BTC investors are allocating a portion of their portfolios to high-upside projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , looking to re-create the outsized returns of Bitcoin’s formative years. Ethereum: Innovation and Maturity Ethereum remains unmatched in smart contract deployment and Layer-2 development. But with its price range tightening, ETH investors are increasingly diversifying. MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the attention of Ethereum holders seeking breakout potential in a more agile, community-controlled ecosystem. Solana: Speed, Adoption, and Diversification Solana continues to perform as one of the fastest Layer-1 blockchains. However, many SOL investors are now turning toward VeChain , drawn to its enterprise focus and ability to execute in regulated environments. The shift underscores a broader trend toward utility-backed assets. VeChain: Real-World Utility on the Rise VeChain is gaining momentum thanks to partnerships, cross-chain compatibility, and growing institutional visibility. As more traders search for blockchain applications with real-world outcomes, VeChain stands out—especially to those rebalancing from more speculative holdings. Conclusion With its disciplined foundation, transparent growth, and rising adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming a contender to match or even exceed the relative percentage performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, VeChain’s enterprise integration is pulling attention from Solana holders seeking long-term reliability. Together, these two projects capture both ends of the crypto opportunity spectrum—early momentum and real-world application.

2025-06-25T18:00:08,"Turkey Tightens Grip On Crypto To Foil Money Launderers","Turkey’s Ministry of Treasury and Finance rolled out new rules this week to stop money laundering through crypto trades. Users now have to put in a transfer note of at least 20 characters explaining why they’re moving funds. At the same time, platforms must collect clear proof of where the money came from. These steps come as crypto use in Turkey has surged, driven by high inflation and a shaky currency. New Transfer Rules Take Effect According to the Treasury and Finance Ministry , every crypto transfer needs a note that’s at least 20 characters long. Users must say what the transfer is for. Crypto Asset Service Providers, or CASPs, will ask for documents and details to show where funds originated. The aim is to make it harder for bad actors to hide illicit gains in thousands of transactions each day. Withdrawal Delays To Curb Crime? Based on reports from officials, first-time withdrawals will face a 72-hour waiting period. After that, any withdrawal that doesn’t meet the FATF “travel rule” will be delayed by at least 48 hours. The goal is simple. Give investigators a window to check if funds come from illegal betting or online fraud before they disappear. Turkey Sets Limits On Stablecoin Moves Authorities will cap stablecoin transfers at $3,000 per day and $50,000 per month. Platforms that fully follow travel-rule checks can double their users’ limits to $6,000 daily and $100,000 monthly. This tiered system pushes exchanges toward higher compliance without shutting out small traders who move modest sums. Users active in market making, liquidity provision, or cross-market arbitrage can skip some of the tighter checks if they show proof of clean funds. They must work through licensed platforms and provide clear documents. This exemption acknowledges that professional traders add volume and keep prices stable. Penalties For Platforms That Don’t Comply Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek warned that any CASP ignoring the new rules could face heavy fines, license denial, or outright cancellation. Platforms will need stronger KYC teams and new software systems to tag transfers with notes and verify sources. Smaller outfits could struggle with the added cost. A Balancing Act For Crypto’s Future Crypto adoption in Turkey ranks among the highest in the world. Officials don’t want to slow growth. They argue these steps guard honest users while making it much harder for criminals to exploit the market. As the rules kick in, domestic exchanges will race to update their systems. Traders may grumble about extra paperwork and waiting times. Still, many believe the extra checks will give institutions and big-time investors more confidence to join in.

I can’t promise anything, but there’s a strong chance that a powerful Altcoin Season will take hold in the third quarter of 2025.

The main reasons are the large amount of… https://t.co/TjRyxBxSKs — Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) June 24, 2025 Altcoin Season On The Horizon Based on forecasts from analyst Joao Wedson, altcoins could see a lift in Q3 2025. He points to the huge amount of stablecoin liquidity and persistent doubt among retail and big players. That stage of doubt has come before in other cycles, and it usually marks a turning point. When confidence returns, altcoins tend to surge. Investors Poised On The Sidelines Many holders seem ready to hit buy. They’re holding onto stablecoins until charts, on-chain data or macro news clear up. A boost in stablecoin flows to exchanges could be one early hint that rotation is starting. Large moves by whale wallets into low-cap tokens may follow. In recent weeks, inflows of stablecoins into trading platforms have ticked higher. That’s a key signal to watch. If weekly inflows rise sharply—say above $5 billion—it may show serious appetite building. Past cycles saw similar spikes just before altcoin rallies began. Another one to monitor is decentralized finance platform volume. When stablecoins move from wallets to lending or liquidity pools, it usually indicates that traders are looking for return and preparing to swap to other tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Market observers will also be monitoring Bitcoin’s consolidation range closely.

Based on these signals, it looks like we’re in a waiting game. Stablecoin supplies are at record levels, Bitcoin is settling, and altcoin sentiment remains low. When all that lines up just right, funds are likely to rotate. Then the altcoin sector could see new life.

The notes bear interest at 4.875% and feature a conversion price of $15.87 per share — about 44% above BTDR’s current $11 trading price. The bond’s conversion rate of 62.9921 Class A shares per $1,000 principal means full conversion could yield roughly 20.8 million new shares. To cover this, Bitdeer prepaid Barclays $129.6 million for a call option with a zero strike price on over 10.2 million shares, or 49% of the conversion total. The option allows Bitdeer to settle conversions using shares from Barclays’ inventory rather than tying up its own stock. Bitdeer, is using roughly $129.6 million of the proceeds to fund the zero-strike call option, $36.1 million to pay the cash consideration for its concurrent note exchange transactions, and the remaining funds for datacenter expansion, the development of its ASIC manufacturing and working capital. The company is currently working on new ASIC chip designs that could potentially make its mining rigs substantially more efficient than current models.

2025-06-25T17:31:10,"Bitdeer: The Elephant In The Room","Summary During the quarter ended March, Bitdeer reported $70.1 million in top line revenue a year over year decline of 41.3%. For the first time, the company reported SEALMINER sales as an individual revenue segment. Those sales made up 5.8% of top line revenue and have the company's best gross margins. Based on current market conditions Bitdeer's SEALMINER A2s appear to be highly cost effective machines relative to competing offerings from Bitmain. The company raised over $300 million in a senior convertible note offering. Simultaneous to that raise, Bitdeer spend $130 million on call options that look dubious so far. Back in late-February, I covered Bitdeer ( BTDR ) for Seeking Alpha and spent time dissecting what I felt were the weak points of the company's business. After what I viewed to be a pretty awful year for the company in 2024, my closing takeaway was pretty simple: I see a company that is growing increasingly reliant on a segment that produced the worst gross margins of its four business lines during 2024. But the lone comment to that article pointed out something rather important, Bitdeer is adapting its business and aims to become a major player in the ASIC space. The 'elephant in the room' that I neglected to mention in February was the company's SEALMINER ambitions. After a Q1-25 report with SEALMINER sales broken out, we can assess how that business compares with Bitdeer's existing segments. We'll also look at the recent convertible note offering from the company. SEALMINER Sales & Q1-25 Revenue During the quarter ended March, Bitdeer reported $70.1 million in top line revenue. This was a decline of 41.3% year over year but a slight sequential bump from the $69 million reported at the end of December. More importantly, Bitdeer reported its first quarter of negative gross profit at -$3.2 million: Data by YCharts Adjusted EBITDA was negative by over $56 million and the company drew down its cash position by roughly 55% from $476 million at the end of December to $216 million at the end of March. It wasn't all bad in Q1 though. For the first time, Bitdeer's Q1-25 report gives investors insight into the profitability of the company's mining rig manufacturing segment. And the early indications from that line are good: $ in Millions Revenue Gross Profit Gross Margin Self-Mining $37.2 -$3.8 -10.2% Cloud Hash $0.1 $0.0 0.0% General Hosting $9.6 $0.5 5.2% Membership $16.3 $0.9 5.5% SEALMINERs $4.1 $0.8 19.5% Source: Bitdeer At 19.5% in the first quarter, SEALMINER sales were Bitdeer's most profitable business segment by far. Self-mining actually came in negative after $41 million in COGS to generate $37.2 million in self-mining revenue. Cloud Hash is all but a memory with just $0.1 million in revenue in Q1 while Membership and General Hosting have seen considerable compression in gross margins compared 16% and 23% respectively during 2024. I'll admit, the margin from early SEALMINER sales are encouraging, especially compared to how the rest of Bitdeer's business is performing. But the company has a long way to go before SEALMINERs can make for some of the issues elsewhere. Bitdeer Revenue By Segment (Bitdeer/Author's Chart) SEALMINER sales were a very small portion of the company's top line revenue at just 5.8%. Given the degree to which Bitdeer is scaling self-mining exahash, I would expect self-mining to continue to generate the lion's share of Bitdeer's business for the remainder of this year: Bitdeer Production (Bitdeer/Author's Chart) As of end of May, Bitdeer's self-mining footprint reached 13.6 EH/s. This was largely attributed to the company energizing its SEALMINER rigs for self-mining in addition to selling them to the public. SEALMINER Profitability and Sales Projections When comparing mining rigs, hashrate and joule/TH metrics are often focal points in the market. Yet, powering the most efficient rig by J/TH might not be smart if the purchaser overpays for the machine. Thus, cost per TH is perhaps the more important metric, in my view. The screen shot below shows the top ten Bitcoin mining rigs organized by hashrate. Two of Bitdeer's A2 models crack the top ten but the bigger takeaway is how cost effective these machines are compared to Bitmain machines: Bitcoin Mining Rig Comparison (MiningNow) Keep in mind, this data is changing constantly. But at present time, Bitdeer's A2 rigs can be purchased for less than $10/TH while Bitmain's Antminers are often at least double the price per TH. This is important because it means the payback period on purchasing these machines is effectively half the time for the SEALMINER A2s: A2 Pro Hyd Pricing (MiningNow) The screen shot above shows the payback period on the A2 Pro Hyd is just 262 days given current market conditions. Antiminer S23 Hyd 3U has a payback period closer to 540 days. To me, the real question for Bitdeer investors going forward is can the company scale SEALMINER sales? ASIC Market TAM (Bitdeer) The company certainly believes this to be the case and projects $6.4 billion in revenue between 2025 and 2027 if it can achieve 30% share of the market. Bitdeer spent $59 million on R&D in the quarter - this spend was tied to development of the SEALMINER A3 and A4 units that are expected later this year. Bitdeer is guiding for 5.5-6 joules per TH on the A4s. Which, if achieved, would be a groundbreaking efficiency in the ASIC industry. $330 Million Convertible Note Offering Bitdeer announced a $300 million senior convertible note offering in mid-June. That offering was subsequently up-sized to $330 million and the notes pay 4.875% through July 1st, 2031. Each $1,000 in capital raised has a common stock conversion rate of 62.9921 Class A ordinary shares or $15.88 per share. Possible dilution from the converts - assuming it makes financial sense for the note holders to take BTDR shares - would be 20.8 million shares. Of the roughly $320 million in proceeds from the offering, Bitdeer will spend just under $130 million to pay for a zero-strike call transaction that would limit dilution risk to shareholders. Most of the remaining capital is earmarked for data center growth, ASIC development, working capital, and general corporate purposes. The call transaction is interesting to me. The calls are designed for conversion hedging and flexibility. At 10.2 million shares and a premium of $129.6 million, the price of BTDR stock has to exceed $12.70 per share to justify the wager. At current BTDR prices - $10.98 on June 24th close - you could argue the premium paid for that call transaction could have been better served as a simple repurchase plan rather than as an options play. For instance, at $11 per share, open market repurchases with $129.6 million buy 11.9 million BTDR shares rather than the 10.2 million from the call strategy. It's still very early, but with the benefit of hindsight, the short-term impact of the call strategy appears negative, from where I sit. The company is betting capital based on the assumption that its share price will increase. Which is a positive sign if you're a believer in Bitdeer's growth prospects. I'm much less convinced that Bitdeer can scale self-mining EH/s to 40 by Q4 this year based on where it was at the end of May. But I've been wrong about this company in the past and that could certainly happen again. Valuation Relative to Peers In the past, one of my biggest concerns about Bitdeer stock was its valuation relative to peers. I've typically looked at those valuations through price to book and price to sales multiples. The price to book story looks much better than it has in the past: Data by YCharts At just 2.7x book, BTDR is far less expensive than it was at the beginning of 2025 and is now a bit more in line with peers. The same is true for the forward sales multiple: Data by YCharts Here, we actually see BTDR is on the cheap side at just 2.7x forward sales. This puts the company below the info tech sector median of 2.8x forward sales and well below what we're seeing from the rest of the top miners in the industry. Closing Summary Now that we have a quarter of SEALMINER sales to assess, I'm coming around on Bitdeer. Not only were the mining machine sales the most profitable business for Bitdeer on a gross margin basis, but the cost per TH numbers from the A2 rigs are actually very good. Remember, my original bearishness BTDR has been due to Cloud Hash - this was a business that was unsustainable because it was a poor product for the plan purchasers. I'd argue the opposite is true for Bitdeer's mining machines. Those look cost effective and efficient given current market conditions. The question is whether or not Bitdeer can scale those sales. Based on the use of proceeds from the recent convertible note offering, I'd argue the company is betting on itself to achieve some of the numbers laid out in its TAM projections for ASIC growth. At $11 per share, the stock isn't nearly as overvalued as it was at the end of 2024 and it could be argued BTDR is actually cheap compared to mining stock peers. I'm upgrading BTDR from 'sell' to 'hold.'",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797249-bitdeer-elephant-in-room?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","BTDR",cryptocompare

In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE has risen to prominence as a preferred alternative for Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP traders moving beyond legacy ecosystems like TRON , driven by its scarcity-based framework and growing analyst support. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Market’s New Favorite MAGACOIN FINANCE brings together the viral appeal of meme culture with structural depth and institutional-grade mechanics. With over $10 million raised in presale and every phase selling out rapidly, it offers a capped 170 billion token supply , a full HashEx audit , and a 100% community-led model. The absence of venture capital control, coupled with on-chain accumulation trends and staking rewards, has set it apart from typical pre-launch tokens. For Bitcoin and XRP traders seeking clarity and early-stage momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the favored strategic pivot . Bitcoin: Rotating Profits into High-Upside Plays Bitcoin remains the foundation of many portfolios, holding above $105,000 amid institutional flows and macro strength. Yet as returns begin to normalize, BTC holders are increasingly rotating into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE —a shift that reflects a desire to harness asymmetrical upside before mainstream listings. XRP: Seeking Cleaner Narratives and Growth XRP continues to dominate the payments arena but remains burdened by ongoing legal complexities and stalled price movement. That’s why many in the XRP community are moving capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its transparent governance, scarcity model, and momentum-driven adoption. TRON: Stable Growth Meets New Competition TRON’s steady ecosystem growth in stablecoins and dApps has kept it on radar, but some traders are seeking more dynamic setups. For these investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a faster-moving alternative, built on structure, transparency, and aggressive early growth—qualities that TRON’s more measured expansion currently lacks. Conclusion With a scarcity-based design, real market traction, and growing interest from Bitcoin and XRP traders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a top alternative to TRON in 2025. Its fundamentals, clean structure, and growing demand are fueling momentum—positioning it as one of the most compelling early entries this year.

The additional notes were sold upon the full exercise of a 13-day greenshoe option granted to the initial investor. The notes, due 2032, are convertible into GameStop Class A common shares at $28.91 per share, a 32.5 percent premium to the volume-weighted average of the shares at the time of the initial offering on June 12.

GameStop said it will use the capital raised for general corporate purposes and in line with the company’s investment policy, which includes investing in digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) as treasury reserves. The company joins the ranks of public companies adopting the practice of holding crypto reserves, following a similar path to the cryptocurrency strategy pursued by Strategy, led by Michael Saylor. GameStop implemented the strategy by purchasing 4,710 Bitcoins for about $500 million following its $1.3 billion bond offering in May. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-25T17:05:22,"Next Technology: All Bitcoin, No Backstop","Summary Next Technology's valuation is driven by Bitcoin holdings but lacks any real operating business or cash flow to support its premium. The company issued over 400 million shares and warrants in Q1 to acquire 5,000 BTC, resulting in extreme dilution without the guardrails of a functioning business. BTC per share sits at ~$1.42, while the stock trades at $2.32, implying a speculative premium of ~40%. Given the absence of credible operations, poor digital infrastructure, and unsustainable capital structure, I rate NXTT a Strong Sell until fundamentals improve. Next Technology Holding (NASDAQ: NXTT ) is a Chinese tech company that markets itself as an AI-enabled software services provider and is also involved in other tech verticals like blockchain and new energy. The company was originally known as WeTrade Technology Co. but rebranded last year. Last year, the company also pivoted to being a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury company, though it has held BTC since 2023. NXTT has surged lately following the Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy pivot and recent Bitcoin purchase. Bitcoin adoption has accelerated greatly on the corporate level. Publicly traded companies are increasingly modeling their approach on Strategy's ( MSTR ) aggressive Bitcoin buy playbook, raising funds through debt or equity to purchase Bitcoin for treasury allocation or long-term strategic reserve purposes. Companies purchasing Bitcoin at scale do so in the hopes that their dollar-cost average, or cost basis as it's formally known, will appreciate over time, and the value of their holdings will compound, creating value for shareholders via an increase in BTC per share. Investors are also exposed to the underlying operating business of these companies - whether good or bad-which may amplify or diminish the appeal of the Bitcoin strategy; though for now, companies with bad underlying operating businesses still enjoy inflated valuations under the cloak of the Bitcoin narrative, and the market still assigns generous multiples despite ongoing operating losses, I believe this will normalize over time as the market reaches a more rational equilibrium between hype and fundamentals. I believe at some point, the market will recalibrate; and when it does, Bitcoin alone won't be enough to justify the premium on companies pursuing corporate treasury strategy. Companies with no real operating strength face the risk of eventually being forced to sell what they hold as long-term reserves. Their reserve assets could easily become ""fire sale"" assets. And at that point, the market will price them for what they are, not for what they hold. The market has seen this movie before, with the COVID-era SPAC mania , for example, which resulted in massive write-downs, and liquidations. While Bitcoin is different in the sense that it is liquid, scarce, and now globally adopted, it still tied to the same pattern of speculative capital chasing narrative premiums, often detached from fundamental performance. I believe at this juncture of early-stage but accelerating experimentation in Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy, it is imperative for investors to begin scrutinizing early the capital structure of the companies pursuing these BTC-overlay models. The reality is that virtually every company pursuing a Bitcoin (or other crypto) corporate strategy has or faces a highly dilutive or structurally fragile capital structure (in the traditional sense, and only propped up by the crypto holdings in most cases). If a business pursuing a crypto treasury strategy is using excess free cash flow for purchases, then that's an entirely different and easier conversation. In the context of Next Technology, which reported no revenue from its underlying business in Q1, Strategy is the reference model here to benchmark Next Technologies against in this piece. Strategy has engineered a capital structure around its corporate treasury strategy that amplified shareholder exposure to the underlying asset without compromising long-term integrity. I'll be unpacking the nuances between NXTT's and MSTR's strategies, poking necessary holes where warranted, and highlighting structural strengths for NXTT where deserved. Next's Q1 and Capital Structure Under the Lens Looking at Next Technology's latest 10-Q filing (Q1 2025), the first reality check for investors sizing up NXTT is that there was no revenue from its AI SaaS business in Q1, despite the headline of $193.4 million in net income driven entirely by unrealized Bitcoin gains (thanks to FASB accounting rules). Income statement (10 Q) Next Technology's rebranding from WeTrade last year and the subsequent dissolution of its subsidiary, WeTrade Technology Co. last year offered no operational income as we see on the income statement above, as the net income from discontinued operations was ""nil"", meaning even before dissolution there was no active sales generation or service revenue from its SaaS business. This lack of an operational backstop business for Next Technology is a glaring concern. Almost every publicly traded company can more accessibly engineer a capital injection through direct equity or warrants via a single or few PIPE investors to finance treasury asset purchases, but gaining the trust of institutional investors to underwrite a hybrid of strategic capital, like the convertible notes with low to zero interest which comes with a more measured and deferred dilution schedule that makes MSTR standout, requires the type of foundational confidence that at least sales generation from a backstop business gives institutional investors. That sales generation from a backstop business is missing in Next Technology's case. This hybrid of strategic, deferred capital is particularly important for a company pursuing a crypto treasury strategy, especially in the absence of core operational profitability and free cash flow because a sole reliance on equity means dilution happens faster than appreciation, and what happens to the BTC-per-share metric, which is a measure of investor exposure to the reserve asset, is that it also gets diluted. Cash flow (10 Q) The story of Next Technology's cash flow is similar to its income. Just as revenue was zero, operational cash flow was at a critical ""nil"" for both Q1 2025 and Q1 2024 (as shown in the cashflow statement above). There is no cash from core operations, and Next Technology relies on unsecured, interest-free loans from former execs and other third parties to cover operating expenses, posing a potential related-party risk. As of Q1, these short-term loans from former execs and third parties who are likely related parties amounted to $1.63 million and rose from $760k as of Q4 end (as shown in the next table from the Q1 10-Q). Other payables (10 Q) Though the payments due to related parties were recorded as $221,000 in the balance sheet (see the table below), a closer look at the 10-Q and the disaggregation of the Other Payables line items (seen in the preceding table) shows that the $2.06 million Other Payables balance includes $1.63 million in short-term loans from Next Technology's former executives and from other third parties, alongside $427,574 in professional fees and operating expenses (as seen in the preceding table). Balance sheet (10 Q) Next Technology is missing any type of sales generation from a backstop business and also faces structural risks from these related parties because they are essentially funding the company's ongoing OpEx, which creates an unsustainable reliance. In my view, the inability to raise funds from truly independent third parties implies a profound lack of external confidence in the company's fundamentals, and I believe institutions also think along the same lines. This persistent lack of sales, coupled with the inherent related party risks, both stand as glaring red flags, in my view. The Stockholders' Equity also paints a clearer picture of dilution. The common stock saw an extraordinary increase in value from $71,718,790 to $217,676,957. More critically, the number of shares issued and outstanding skyrocketed from 6,976,410 as of Q4 last year, to a staggering 436,265,135 by Q1. This massive increase is directly attributable to the issuance of hundreds of millions of shares and warrants for the 5,000 Bitcoin purchase in March. As I mentioned earlier, dilution is nothing new to Bitcoin treasury companies; however, what makes it particularly troubling in Next Technology's case is that it was done without the guardrails of a functioning business, institutional oversight, or capital structure discipline, leaving investors exposed to unchecked equity issuance without any offsetting operating value. Equity dilution (10 Q) So while the company boasts holding 5,833 BTC as of Q1 end, the real picture becomes clearer when you look at it on a per-share basis. With 436,265,135 shares outstanding, that translates to 5,833 BTC ÷ 436,265,135 shares = ~0.00001337 BTC per share. At BTC's current price of $106,000, the implied BTC value per share is $1.42. NXTT currently trades at $2.32. And at $2.32 per share, only ~$1.42 of that is backed by the actual Bitcoin holding. The premium to NAV baked into NXTT's valuation is about $0.90 per share, which is arguably speculative, especially given the company has no revenue, sees no cash flow, and has a highly dilutive capital formation. Takeaway Right now, the market is pricing in a ~60% Bitcoin backing per share and ~40% is purely narrative-driven. That's a very generous premium for a company with no operating business, no free cash flow, and heavy reliance on dilution. The moment the market starts discounting these risks or BTC sees downward price movement for macro or other reasons, the BTC premium on NXTT could evaporate - very fast. Next Technology official website as of June 25, 2025 (Next Technology) Trading at a premium to NAV is nothing new for Bitcoin treasury companies. However, Next Technology's premium feels particularly fragile given the lack of operating business, aggressive dilution, and speculative structure behind it. I'd close this piece with an extra, perhaps trivial, detail that may seem unconventional for Seeking Alpha, but I believe it's vital context. A thorough perusal of Next Technology's website shows no functional demonstration or documentation of any products across its claimed verticals-SaaS, Blockchain, New Energy, or Digital Assets. The website has no SSL certificate either. A public company with non-secure HTTP pages and non-functional product links reflects very poor digital infrastructure and a lack of execution, particularly for a tech firm touting blockchain and AI products. In a market where Bitcoin treasury strategies are gaining interest, NXTT is an example of what happens when form outruns substance. The company's Bitcoin holdings may look impressive at a glance, but everything else-the dilution, the lack of business fundamentals, the speculative capital structure, and the absence of execution-screams caution. For me, this is a Strong Sell until a credible business model emerges.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797241-next-technology-all-bitcoin-no-backstop?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","BTC-USD|MSTR|NXTT",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T17:01:01,"Ethereum's 'Identity Crisis' Is What Real Decentralization Looks Like","Ethereum faces widespread perception as a network in crisis. It has been characterized as a platform plagued by governance upheaval, community fragmentation, and high gas fees. Additionally, Ethereum receives a lot of criticism for its slow performance, which lags behind Bitcoin's institutional appeal and Solana's speculative excitement. This narrative misses Ethereum’s central purpose and strategy. Both of which are driven by deliberate decentralized innovation, which is now beginning to pay off. Ethereum’s “Identity Crisis” Ethereum has chosen the more difficult but ultimately more sustainable path. This is based on the fact that it has maintained functional governance, which enables continued technical advancement. It also preserves credible decentralization, creating competitive advantages that neither pure stability nor pure speed can replicate. This positions Ethereum as the only blockchain capable of long-term sustainable innovation. Concerns around Ethereum’s “identity crisis” reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes blockchain technology valuable in the first place. When critics focus on short-term metrics like transaction costs and processing speed, they’re forgetting the revolutionary potential of a truly decentralized computing platform. Ethereum's challenges are the growing pains of building something unprecedented: a global, permissionless computer that no single entity can control or shut down. The high gas fees demonstrate real demand for blockspace on the world's most secure and decentralized smart contract platform. The governance discussions that appear as ""upheaval"" to outsiders represent healthy democratic processes that other chains avoid by maintaining centralized control, or by effectively forbidding all change and improvement. This nuanced reality gets lost in narratives that prioritize simplicity over substance. Bitcoin’s Pet Rock Problem Despite being criticised as a digital “pet rock,” Bitcoin has received widespread respect as the first cryptocurrency to see legitimacy outside of the industry. “Bitcoin-maxis” even point to the chain’s inertia as a critical tenet of bitcoin’s value. Since the chain rarely updates, except for predictable supply halvings, bitcoin can remain a “digital gold.” However, this simplicity is a ceiling, not a strength. Bitcoin has ossified; initially slow to innovate, improvements are now effectively impossible. “Bitcoin-maxis” would argue that the chain’s ossification only strengthens the asset’s immutable value. But, bitcoin’s liquidity is tenuous; it relies on perception, and recent reports demonstrate that bitcoin's value isn’t an inherent certainty. Ethereum, by contrast, continues to evolve through major upgrades like the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 and the recent Pectra update. Unlike Bitcoin, the Ethereum community continues to demonstrate that it is capable of meaningful technological innovation. Ethereum’s Decentralization Is Key Many of Ethereum’s critics point to the impressive speed and low costs of other chains as examples of where Ethereum is failing. These feats are achieved quickly only by giving up on meaningful decentralization. Ethereum is a credibly neutral world computer with thousands of projects innovating on it precisely because of its ethos of decentralization. Some form of centralized leadership may seem like a small price to pay for quicker change, but decentralization matters in the same way that seat belts do. It's an inconvenience until it’s necessary; until an account is de-platformed, or the system makes an unpopular choice because of centralized interests that are not in line with its users’ values. History provides countless examples of centralized systems eventually serving their controllers rather than their users - this is such a common pattern it's practically a law. Traditional financial institutions routinely freeze accounts, deny services, or impose arbitrary fees based on political or business considerations. Decentralization is not a long-term goal; it is a foundational necessity for building systems permanently free from corruption. Ethereum Is Taking the Harder Path Ethereum has chosen the most technically and socially difficult but correct route: building a truly decentralized platform that serves the needs of its users. That's the hard thing to do, but it's also the right thing to do, because it produces the best result in the long term. This approach is slower than Solana’s and less obvious than Bitcoin’s, but it's the only path that delivers both continued innovation and genuine user sovereignty. It is beginning to see results, too. Earlier this month, Bernstein analysts published a research report stating that ""The narrative around value accrual of public blockchain networks is at a critical inflection point,” and “starting to reflect in investor interest in ETH ETF inflows."" Ethereum price is certainly trending upwards. Ethereum ETFs just completed their longest inflow streak of 2025, with BlackRock's ETHA fund alone adding $492 million in a single week . Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs experienced $582 million in net outflows during the same period. Despite this positive momentum, the Ethereum community needs to concern itself less with trailing indicators of success like price. As John Maynard Keynes famously warned, “the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” The Ethereum community must avoid getting distracted by price movements, governance drama, or competing narratives and unite around their common mission: building credibly neutral infrastructure that serves humanity's needs. Ethereum's ability to innovate while staying decentralized requires developers, researchers, validators, and users to shut out the noise and remain focused on building. This path is harder, but it's the only one that leads to sustainable success.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/25/ethereums-identity-crisis-is-what-real-decentralization-looks-like,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T17:00:24,"Metaplanet’s Audacious Bitcoin Holdings Expansion: Japanese Firm Eyes Massive BTC Accumulation","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet’s Audacious Bitcoin Holdings Expansion: Japanese Firm Eyes Massive BTC Accumulation In a move that has sent ripples through the global financial markets, Japanese-listed company Metaplanet has announced a monumental stride in its Bitcoin holdings strategy. This audacious expansion is not just a testament to the growing appeal of digital assets among traditional corporations but also positions Metaplanet as a significant player in the institutional adoption landscape. What does this mean for the future of corporate treasuries and the broader cryptocurrency market? Metaplanet’s Strategic Leap: Fueling Bitcoin Accumulation Metaplanet, a company traditionally focused on real estate and financial services, has made a decisive pivot towards becoming a major holder of Bitcoin. The core of this latest development is a substantial capital raise: the company successfully secured $515 million by issuing 54 million new shares. This significant infusion of capital is earmarked for one primary purpose: to aggressively expand its BTC accumulation efforts. The company’s ambition is striking. Already holding a substantial 11,111 BTC, Metaplanet has laid out an aggressive roadmap: Short-term Goal (End of 2025): Accumulate 30,000 BTC. Long-term Vision: Eventually reach an astounding 100,000 BTC. Ultimate Aspiration: Acquire a substantial portion, even up to 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, highlighting their long-term conviction in the digital asset. This strategy mirrors, and in some ways even surpasses, the pioneering moves made by companies like MicroStrategy. It signifies a profound shift in how corporations view Bitcoin – not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic reserve asset, a hedge against inflation, and a potential driver of long-term shareholder value. Why Are Companies Like Metaplanet Embracing Institutional Bitcoin? The decision by a Japanese company Bitcoin strategy of this magnitude isn’t made lightly. Several compelling factors are driving corporations globally to consider and adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset: The Inflationary Environment and Fiat Debasement In an era characterized by unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation, traditional fiat currencies are experiencing a decline in purchasing power. Corporations with significant cash reserves are finding their balance sheets eroding. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, offers an attractive alternative. It’s often dubbed ‘digital gold’ actuating as a superior store of value in a volatile macroeconomic climate. The ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative and Scarcity Bitcoin’s fundamental design, with a capped supply of 21 million coins, makes it inherently scarce. This scarcity, combined with its increasing global adoption and recognition as a legitimate asset class, strengthens its narrative as ‘digital gold’. For companies like Metaplanet, holding Bitcoin is seen as preserving capital and potentially benefiting from its long-term appreciation, rather than watching cash reserves diminish. Pioneering a New Era of Corporate Treasury Management Companies that strategically invest in Bitcoin are positioning themselves at the forefront of a financial paradigm shift. By being early adopters, they not only aim to capture significant upside but also differentiate themselves in the market, potentially attracting a new class of investors interested in forward-thinking financial strategies. Metaplanet’s move is a bold statement about their belief in Bitcoin’s future relevance. Comparing Metaplanet’s Strategy to Other Bitcoin Holders While MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, Metaplanet’s recent announcement places it firmly among the top institutional players. Let’s look at a brief comparison: Company Current BTC Holdings (Approx.) Strategy Funding Method MicroStrategy ~226,314 BTC Aggressive accumulation, public company as Bitcoin proxy Convertible notes, equity offerings, excess cash Metaplanet 11,111 BTC (current), 100,000 BTC (target) Strategic pivot, significant treasury allocation Share issuance Tesla ~9,720 BTC Initial large purchase, some sales, holds for treasury Cash reserves Metaplanet’s reliance on share issuance for this capital raise indicates a strong commitment from investors who believe in the company’s new direction and the value proposition of Bitcoin. This method allows them to acquire a significant amount of BTC without depleting their existing operational capital, demonstrating investor confidence in their strategic shift. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for Metaplanet? Benefits: Riding the Bitcoin Wave Enhanced Balance Sheet Strength: If Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, Metaplanet’s balance sheet could see substantial appreciation, strengthening its financial position. Inflation Hedge: Protection against the depreciating value of fiat currencies, preserving purchasing power. Investor Attraction: Appeals to a new class of investors keen on exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded entity, particularly in Japan where direct Bitcoin investment might have regulatory nuances for some. Market Leadership: Establishes Metaplanet as a leader in corporate digital asset adoption within Japan and potentially Asia. Challenges: Navigating the Volatility Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile. Significant price drops could negatively impact Metaplanet’s financial statements and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in Japanese regulations could affect their strategy. Market Sentiment: Negative news or market downturns in the broader crypto space could spill over and affect Metaplanet’s stock price. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to protect against hacks or loss. The Broader Implications for the Bitcoin Market Metaplanet’s ambitious plans for Metaplanet Bitcoin acquisition underscore a growing trend: the increasing institutionalization of Bitcoin. As more companies follow suit, several key implications emerge: Supply Shock and Price Impact If numerous companies adopt similar strategies, the demand for Bitcoin could significantly outpace its available supply, especially after halving events. This could lead to a ‘supply shock’, potentially driving up Bitcoin’s price in the long term. Each substantial corporate purchase removes more BTC from the circulating supply, making it scarcer. Validation of Bitcoin as a Legitimate Asset Class When publicly traded companies, especially those from traditional sectors, allocate significant portions of their treasury to Bitcoin, it sends a powerful signal to the broader financial world. It legitimizes Bitcoin as a serious asset class suitable for large-scale investment, moving it further away from its early reputation as a niche or speculative asset. Increased Market Maturity and Liquidity Greater institutional participation often brings increased market maturity and liquidity. As more sophisticated players enter the market, it can lead to more robust infrastructure, better trading mechanisms, and a deeper understanding of Bitcoin’s role in diversified portfolios. What Does This Mean for Investors? Actionable Insights For both traditional and crypto investors, Metaplanet’s move offers valuable insights: Observe Corporate Adoption: Keep a close eye on other companies that might follow Metaplanet’s lead. This trend indicates a fundamental shift in corporate finance. Diversification Strategy: For individual investors, it reinforces the idea of Bitcoin as a potential long-term store of value within a diversified portfolio. Long-Term Conviction: Metaplanet’s multi-year accumulation plan suggests a strong long-term conviction in Bitcoin, rather than short-term speculation. This can be a guiding principle for personal investment strategies. Research Underlying Businesses: When considering investing in companies that hold Bitcoin, it’s crucial to understand both their core business and their Bitcoin strategy. A New Era for Corporate Treasuries? Metaplanet’s audacious decision to raise over half a billion dollars specifically for Bitcoin acquisition marks a pivotal moment. It’s not merely an investment; it’s a strategic repositioning that signals profound confidence in Bitcoin’s future. This move by a significant Japanese company Bitcoin proponent could very well catalyze a broader trend among corporations seeking to future-proof their balance sheets against economic uncertainties. The journey to 100,000 BTC will undoubtedly be watched closely by the financial world, offering a compelling case study on the efficacy of Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. Metaplanet is not just buying Bitcoin; it’s investing in a vision of a decentralized, digitally-native financial future, challenging traditional notions of corporate finance and setting a new benchmark for institutional engagement in the crypto space.

2025-06-25T16:59:55,"BTC climbs past $107K as bulls regain control, Pi and SYRUP lead gains","Bitcoin pressed higher on Wednesday, carrying forward its relief rally as tempers cooled across the Middle East. The broader market moved in step, adding nearly 2% over the past 24 hours to lift the total crypto market cap to $3.343 trillion. With risk appetite reignited, the Fear and Greed Index ticked up to 66, marking a return to greed as investors leaned back into momentum. Although the altcoin market joined the rebound, meaningful gains were confined to a select few among the top 100 tokens. Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin’s surge appears tied to a mix of geopolitical calm, renewed risk appetite, and bullish technical momentum. Over the past 24 hours, the asset climbed 2.8% and briefly touched $108,000, marking a $10,000 recovery from its recent local lows just three days ago. The move liquidated over $210 million in long and short positions, as per CoinGlass, with high-leverage traders caught off guard by the sharp breakout. Fueling the rally were remarks from US President Donald Trump, who said the war between Iran and Israel is “over,” adding that Iran holds “a huge advantage” and is unlikely to escalate nuclear ambitions. Trump also hinted at diplomatic overtures, stating he would meet with Iranian leadership next week to potentially sign a non-nuclear agreement. These comments appeared to ease global tension and reinforced market-wide relief, pushing investors further into risk-on territory. Analysts had previously flagged $108,000 and $103,000 as liquidity-heavy zones, and the latest breakout is seen as a strategic sweep of those levels. CoinGlass data confirmed that much of the high-leverage liquidity has already been absorbed, leaving traders eyeing fresh upside targets. Momentum also drew strength from technical setups. Popular trader Titan of Crypto pointed to a breakout above the Kumo Cloud on the Ichimoku chart, an indicator often used to gauge trend reversals. BTC/USDT 1-day price chart. Source: Titan of Crypto. “If it clears the Fair Value Gap (FVG), the next stop could be $111K,” the trader noted. Some, however, were concerned about possible low-timeframe rejection zones but agreed that any pullback would likely be short-lived unless buyer exhaustion sets in. With key resistances getting tested and macro headwinds fading, market participants are increasingly positioning for a broader move. Liquidity heatmaps from Binance’s BTC/USDT pair show a dense cluster of liquidations and stop orders just above the $108,000 level, with additional stacked liquidity extending toward $111,000. This layered liquidity zone suggests that a successful breach above current highs could trigger a cascade of stop-outs and short squeezes, potentially accelerating Bitcoin’s next leg upward. Meanwhile, resistance below $106,000 appears to be thinning, which means any short-term pullback may find support quickly, adding further conviction to the bullish bias in the current setup. For many analysts, Bitcoin now appears poised to test the final stretch toward its all-time highs, with eyes locked on the $110,000 zone and talk of price discovery beginning to resurface.

With rate cut hopes simmering, any unexpected print may jolt market momentum and reshape the short-term outlook. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $107,086, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours. Altcoin market Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap rose 2.3% to $1.31 trillion, with the Altcoin Season Index reading moving to 16, which means the majority of the top 100 altcoins continue to perform lower in comparison to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, was down 1%, trading at $2,418, while other large-cap altcoins such as Tron (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) also recorded losses of 1-2%. Pi (PI) clocked the highest gains among the top 99 altcoins, up 21.3% over the day, while Maple Finance (SYRUP) and DeXe (DEXE) followed with gains of 21% and 7.9% respectively.

Concurrently, Maple’s Total Value Locked has reached a record $1.58 billion, according to DeFiLlama, indicating growing demand for its on-chain lending services. Pi token rallied after Pi Network’s core team teased upcoming generative AI features, set to be unveiled during the Pi2Day event on June 28.

2025-06-25T16:56:49,"Canary Capital CEO Predicts When XRP Price Will Double","In a market still dominated by Bitcoin headlines, some institutional voices are beginning to direct attention elsewhere. Steve McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, recently offered an optimistic outlook for several major altcoins, signaling a shift in how some firms are approaching the current cycle. The interview gained widespread attention and was shared by prominent crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), who posted a clip of McClurg naming XRP as one of the assets that could outperform Bitcoin in 2025. Her post helped spotlight McClurg’s remarks and added momentum to the conversation around XRP’s potential. More Than a 10% Upside During the discussion, McClurg pushed back on the idea of modest gains for leading altcoins. When asked whether a 10% upside was a fair expectation, he stated, “I think most of these will double this year.” XRP was the first token he mentioned among those expected to outperform Bitcoin, alongside SUI, Solana, HBAR, and Litecoin. McClurg described Canary Capital’s outlook as “very constructive” on cryptocurrencies with large market caps, and he highlighted some assets he believes will perform spectacularly. WOW! STEVEN MCCLURG, CEO OF CANARY CAPITAL, SAYS: „THERE’S A FEW THAT WE BELIEVE WILL OUTPERFORM BITCOIN THIS YEAR, SUCH AS XRP!“ #XRP WILL CONQUER THE CRYPTO MARKET! pic.twitter.com/6ZDMG2z2wE — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) June 23, 2025 More Lucrative Investments than Bitcoin While maintaining confidence in Bitcoin, McClurg positioned it more as a defensive asset in the current environment. He compared it to the Dow, saying it’s where investors might move “if you want to stay in crypto but have a flight to safety.” In contrast, he pointed to other large-cap assets as better positioned for upside in a bull market. Canary Capital has consistently shown interest in XRP and was among the first companies to apply for a spot ETF in 2024. XRP’s Strength in a Changing Market McClurg’s comments arrive as XRP continues to benefit from improving regulatory clarity and renewed institutional interest . Its unique positioning in global payments infrastructure, along with increasing adoption, supports the view that it could capitalize on current market momentum. Being named first in McClurg’s list subtly highlights how experienced investors seriously consider XRP. Experts believe a massive breakout is coming , and veteran investors like McClurg can see the asset’s potential. Even some in the Bitcoin community believe XRP will make a massive move this year. Bitcoin maximalists, such as Davinci Jeremie, have predicted that XRP can hit $24 in 2025 . For investors following informed signals, XRP now stands firmly in the conversation about which assets could lead the next phase of market growth.

The online banking and financial services company’s move to relaunch crypto trading will see its customers access buying and selling for Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and other digital currencies, Bloomberg reported . SoFi also plans to roll out global remittances, with expansion into stablecoins on the table. The company’s reintroduction comes a few months after its chief executive officer, Anthony Noto, said SoFi was looking into getting back into offering digital asset investing services. Regulatory shift in the U.S. The fintech’s return to the crypto space comes amid a regulatory shift that has buoyed various players in the traditional finance industry. SoFi had said in August 2023 that it would be forced to exit the crypto investing market due to significant regulatory hurdles in the United States. It did just that when it notified customers of its move in November 2023, with customers advised to liquidate accounts or move crypto assets to crypto exchange and custodial services firm Blockchain.com.

In comments following the latest development, the SoFi exec noted that innovation in crypto and blockchain is is reinventing the future of financial services. The fintech’s goal is to help accelerate this, with its customers benefiting from more choices and control across investing, cross-border payments, or savings. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that banks are “free” to offer crypto services. The Fed Chair, in testimony given to the Senate Banking Committee, also noted that banks are free to conduct crypto activities.

The U.S. Department of Justice says Leo Joseph Govoni, 67, of Clearwater, Florida, co-founded the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration (CSNT) around the year 2000, and CSNT employed John Leo Witeck, 60, of Tampa, Florida, as an accountant. The nonprofit managed court awards, settlements and other payments for people with disabilities and special needs. By 2024, CSNT managed over 2,100 special needs trusts containing approximately $200 million, with beneficiaries in almost every state, according to the indictment. However, the DOJ alleges that Govoni, Witeck and their unnamed co-conspirators purloined CSNT client-beneficiary funds and concealed their embezzlement through complex financial transactions. They allegedly sent fraudulent account statements with false balances to their disabled clients. Govoni allegedly used the embezzled cash to buy real estate, fund a brewery and pay personal debts. He also liked to travel by private jet, according to the DOJ. Both men were charged with conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering conspiracy, and Govoni was also hit with additional charges of bank fraud, illegal monetary transactions and false bankruptcy declarations.

2025-06-25T16:50:20,"Barclays Crypto Block: Crucial Impact on UK Digital Asset Transactions","BitcoinWorld Barclays Crypto Block: Crucial Impact on UK Digital Asset Transactions A significant development is shaking up the UK cryptocurrency landscape, directly impacting how many users acquire digital assets. Starting June 27, UK investment bank Barclays will no longer permit its customers to use their bank cards for any cryptocurrency-related transactions. This move, as reported by Cointelegraph on X, marks a pivotal moment for those accustomed to direct Barclays crypto block and card-based purchases of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies. If you’re a Barclays customer, this crucial change demands your immediate attention and understanding. Understanding the Barclays Crypto Block: What You Need to Know The news of Barclays’ decision to implement a comprehensive cryptocurrency card ban has sent ripples through the UK crypto community. Previously, many users found it convenient to use their Barclays debit or credit cards to fund accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges or directly purchase digital assets. This impending restriction means that as of June 27, any attempt to use a Barclays card for such transactions will be declined. It’s a clear signal from one of the UK’s major financial institutions regarding its stance on direct card-based crypto interactions. This isn’t an isolated incident. Several traditional banks globally, and indeed within the UK, have either imposed similar restrictions or increased scrutiny on crypto-related transactions. Their stated reasons often revolve around: Fraud Prevention: Banks cite concerns over the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions, making them a target for fraudsters who might trick individuals into sending funds to illicit crypto addresses. Consumer Protection: The volatility of cryptocurrencies and the lack of robust regulatory frameworks in some areas lead banks to believe they are protecting customers from potential financial losses. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC) Compliance: While reputable exchanges have strong AML/KYC protocols, banks often express concerns about the broader ecosystem and the potential for funds to be laundered through less regulated channels. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies means banks often err on the side of caution until clearer guidelines are established. For individuals engaging in crypto transactions UK -wide, understanding these underlying reasons is crucial, as they often dictate the broader banking industry’s approach to digital assets. Why Are Banks Limiting Digital Asset Purchases? The decision by Barclays bank crypto restrictions is part of a larger trend observed across the financial sector. While the immediate impact is on the convenience of card-based transactions, the deeper reasons are multifaceted. Banks operate under strict regulatory obligations, especially concerning financial crime and consumer protection. The pseudo-anonymous nature of some cryptocurrency transactions, coupled with the rapid innovation in the DeFi space, presents challenges for traditional financial institutions trying to maintain compliance. Consider the following aspects contributing to banks’ cautious approach: Factor Impact on Banks’ Stance Fraud Risk High incidence of scams involving crypto, leading to chargeback disputes and reputational damage for banks. Market Volatility Rapid price swings in cryptocurrencies can lead to significant losses for consumers, prompting banks to act as gatekeepers. Regulatory Gaps Lack of clear, comprehensive global or even national regulations on crypto assets puts banks in a difficult position regarding compliance. Money Laundering Concerns Fear of illicit funds being moved through crypto, necessitating stringent AML/KYC checks, which are easier to control with direct bank transfers than card payments. Consumer Education Many consumers may not fully understand the risks associated with crypto, leading banks to take a protective stance. This cautious approach is not unique to Barclays. Other prominent UK banks like NatWest and Santander have previously implemented similar limits or outright bans on certain types of crypto transactions, especially those involving debit and credit cards, highlighting a collective concern within the traditional financial system about the perceived risks associated with digital asset purchases . Navigating the New Landscape: Alternatives for UK Crypto Users For Barclays customers and indeed any UK crypto enthusiast, the cryptocurrency card ban doesn’t mean the end of your crypto journey. It simply means adapting your methods for acquiring digital assets. The good news is that several viable alternatives exist, ensuring you can continue to participate in the crypto economy. Here are some actionable insights and alternatives to consider: Direct Bank Transfers (Faster Payments): Most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges in the UK support direct bank transfers via the Faster Payments service. This method typically allows you to deposit GBP from your bank account directly to the exchange, which you can then use to buy crypto. This is often the preferred method for larger sums and is generally free or incurs minimal fees. P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Platforms: Platforms like LocalBitcoins or Paxful allow you to buy crypto directly from other individuals. Payment methods can vary widely, including bank transfers, PayPal, or even cash. While offering flexibility, always exercise caution and use platforms with robust escrow services to protect yourself. Crypto-Friendly Neobanks/Fintechs: Some newer financial technology companies (neobanks) are more open to cryptocurrency transactions. While not a direct substitute for Barclays, opening an account with such a provider might offer more flexibility for your crypto activities. Always research their policies and regulatory compliance. Alternative Payment Gateways: Some exchanges might offer alternative payment gateways that don’t involve direct card use but might route through other financial services. Check the specific options available on your preferred exchange. Understanding Exchange Policies: Each exchange has its own set of deposit and withdrawal methods. Before attempting to make digital asset purchases , thoroughly review the supported payment options and any associated fees or limits. This shift requires a bit more planning but ultimately encourages users to explore more robust and often more secure methods of funding their crypto endeavors. The broader implications for crypto transactions UK -wide are that reliance on traditional banking cards for quick crypto buys may diminish, pushing users towards more direct banking integrations or alternative financial rails. The Broader Impact: What Does the Barclays Bank Crypto Decision Mean for the UK? The Barclays crypto block isn’t just about one bank; it reflects a broader narrative playing out between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto industry. While some might view it as a setback, others see it as a catalyst for greater innovation in how fiat and crypto interact. Challenges: Reduced Convenience: For new users, card payments were often the easiest entry point. This ban could make initial digital asset purchases seem more daunting. Potential for “De-banking”: While not a full de-banking, this move contributes to a narrative where traditional banks are increasingly cautious or restrictive towards crypto businesses and individuals, potentially pushing some activities underground or to less regulated channels. Stifled Innovation (Short Term): If other major banks follow suit without clear regulatory guidance, it could temporarily hinder the growth of seamless fiat-to-crypto on-ramps in the UK. Opportunities: Growth of Direct Bank Integrations: Exchanges will likely double down on optimizing direct bank transfer services, making them faster and more user-friendly. Demand for Crypto-Native Solutions: This could accelerate the development and adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and stablecoins, reducing reliance on traditional banking rails for crypto activity. Call for Regulatory Clarity: Such moves often highlight the urgent need for comprehensive and clear regulatory frameworks for crypto assets, which could ultimately foster a more stable and integrated environment. The landscape for crypto transactions UK is constantly evolving. As financial institutions grapple with the complexities of digital assets, their decisions shape the accessibility and future growth of the crypto market. The Barclays bank crypto decision serves as a powerful reminder that users must remain adaptable and informed about the changing financial ecosystem. Preparing for June 27: Your Action Plan for Cryptocurrency Card Ban With June 27 fast approaching, it’s essential for Barclays customers, and indeed anyone involved in digital asset purchases in the UK, to prepare. Don’t wait until the last minute to find out your preferred method of buying crypto is no longer available. Here’s a simple action plan: Verify Your Current Methods: If you use a Barclays card for crypto, confirm that you have alternative deposit methods set up on your chosen exchange. Test Bank Transfers: Before June 27, try making a small direct bank transfer to your crypto exchange account to ensure it works smoothly and you understand the process. Explore Other Banks: While Barclays has made its move, other banks might have different policies. However, be aware that the trend is towards increased caution. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on news from your bank and your preferred crypto exchanges regarding deposit methods and regulatory changes. Understand Fees and Limits: Different deposit methods may have varying fees and limits. Familiarize yourself with these to avoid surprises. This proactive approach will help you seamlessly transition your crypto transactions UK activity without interruption. The goal is to ensure that the cryptocurrency card ban by Barclays does not derail your participation in the digital asset space. Conclusion: Adapting to the Evolving UK Crypto Landscape The decision by Barclays to block card-based digital asset purchases from June 27 marks a significant shift for UK crypto users. While it undoubtedly impacts the convenience of acquiring cryptocurrencies via traditional bank cards, it also serves as a crucial reminder of the ongoing tension and evolution between legacy financial systems and the innovative world of digital assets. The Barclays crypto block underscores the need for users to be adaptable, explore alternative funding methods like direct bank transfers, and stay informed about the ever-changing regulatory and banking landscape concerning crypto transactions UK . As the crypto ecosystem matures, navigating these changes with foresight and flexibility will be key to continued participation and success.

2025-06-25T16:34:20,"GameStop sticks to MicroStrategy’s crypto playbook","GameStop has raised another $450 million through a follow-on sale of zero-coupon convertible senior notes, pushing its total fundraising to $2.7 billion in just under two weeks. The company made the disclosure in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. This second chunk was brought in after the initial $2.25 billion raised last month through a private placement. The notes were offered under a 13-day option that gave the original buyer the right to purchase more, and that option got exercised in full. The notes are due in 2032 and can be converted into GameStop Class A shares at a rate of $28.91 per share, which is a 32.5% premium compared to the stock’s volume-weighted average price as of June 12—the day the first offering launched. GameStop says the money is going into general business use and “making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy,” which includes buying Bitcoin to hold on the company’s balance sheet. GameStop sticks to MicroStrategy’s crypto playbook GameStop started buying Bitcoin in May, picking up 4,710 coins with part of the proceeds from a $1.3 billion convertible note it sold earlier this year. That first round of buying cost around $500 million. The company is now copying the same strategy that Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), used to build up its massive crypto holdings. Strategy became the biggest corporate owner of Bitcoin by selling equity and issuing debt to keep loading up. That tactic also brought heavy price swings to its stock over the past few years. Strategy used different types of securities, including convertible debt, to buy Bitcoin. GameStop is now using the same approach. CEO Ryan Cohen told shareholders the move to stack Bitcoin is about macroeconomic risks, and called the asset’s fixed supply and decentralized structure a possible hedge against those risks. Ryan is also close friends with Saylor now, as per their X accounts. Shares of GameStop were priced at $23.16 as of Tuesday, down 0.56% on the day, continuing to underperform as market focus shifts toward companies with cleaner financials and stronger growth outlooks. The decision to buy Bitcoin hasn’t done much to lift the share price, and now analysts are questioning whether the strategy actually makes sense. Revenue down, collectibles up, analysts unimpressed On the same day the company filed details of the second note sale, it also reported a 17% drop in revenue for the fiscal first quarter, down to $732.4 million. Demand for digital games is rising while foot traffic in physical stores continues to slide. GameStop’s core business, retail sales of new and used games and consoles, is still bleeding out slowly. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter wasn’t impressed. He reiterated his underperform rating on GameStop, saying the company is just appealing to “greater fools” who are willing to pay more than double the value of the company’s assets. Pachter added that GameStop is already trading at 2.4 times cash, and sees no upside from using that cash to buy Bitcoin. “The strategy makes little sense,” he said. That’s not exactly glowing support from Wall Street. Still, Cohen is pushing the company in new directions. At the annual meeting on Thursday, he said GameStop is expanding its collectibles business, calling trading cards a “natural extension” of the brand. He described it as a segment with high margins and said it’s deeply rooted in retail. While games may be going digital, cardboard isn’t. GameStop said its collectibles revenue jumped 54% in the first quarter compared to last year. Most of that growth came from sales of Pokémon Trading Cards, which are clearly still pulling weight among buyers who aren’t just kids. A survey from Circana showed that 19% of adults had bought Pokémon cards for themselves within the last six months. Most buyers said they’re collecting them for fun or as room decoration. Circana also noted that adults were the biggest spenders across all age groups when it came to toys in the first quarter. So GameStop is stacking Bitcoin and Pokémon cards. Whether that works out remains to be seen. But for now, the company has $2.7 billion in its pocket, Bitcoin on its balance sheet, and a CEO betting on collectibles and crypto in equal measure.

In this issue: Ethereum Developer Proposes 6-Second Block Times to Boost Speed ZKsync’s Airbender zkVM Proves Ethereum Blocks in 35 Seconds Norway Plans Ban on New Crypto Mining Data Centers XRP Ledger Brings Token Escrow, Other Upgrades for DEXs in New Release Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Network news NEW ETHEREUM PROPOSAL THAT COULD MAKE THE NETWORK FASTER : Ethereum could soon run twice as fast. That’s according to a new proposal floated by core developer Barnabé Monnot to reduce the network’s slot time from 12 seconds to six seconds, effectively doubling the number of blocks produced per minute. The idea, part of EIP-7782 , could be included in the upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade slated for 2026. Proposals or publicly discussed ideas are commonplace in the blockchain world, and may not necessarily move to testing. If implemented, the proposal would reduce time spent across three key consensus steps: block proposals (3 seconds), attestations (1.5 seconds), and aggregation (1.5 seconds). That would shave six seconds off the current 12-second cycle. Faster blocks mean quicker confirmations, fresher on-chain data for wallets and apps, and a more seamless experience for users. — Shaurya Malwa Read more .

Having fast speeds can save on transaction fees. “We’re entering fraction of a cent territory which is critical for key use cases, including micropayments, high-frequency trading, and decentralized social,” said Alex Gluchowski, the co-founder of Matter Labs, in an interview with CoinDesk. “Faster proofs unlock faster finality, cheaper apps, and crucially, proofs that can be generated anywhere, not just in massive GPU farms.” — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . NORWAY PLANS BAN ON NEW CRYPTO MINING DATA CENTERS : Norway’s Labour Party government has revealed plans to impose a temporary ban on any new crypto mining data centers that use energy‑heavy proof‑of‑work systems, per Reuters . The proposed rule could kick in Autumn 2025, if approved, and is aimed at preserving electricity capacity for more productive industries. “Cryptocurrency mining is very power-intensive and generates little in the way of jobs and income for the local community,” said Minister for Digitalization Karianne Tung, adding the move reflects the government’s “clear intention to limit the mining of cryptocurrency in Norway as much as possible.” Norway, with its vast renewable hydropower resources, has long attracted Bitcoin miners seeking low‑cost, clean energy. Companies like Kryptovault have established operations outside Oslo — running data centres up to 40 MW, recycling heat to dry wood or warm nearby buildings. — Shaurya Malwa Read more . XRP LEDGER RELEASE BRINGS NEW FEATURES AND UPGRADES: RippleX, which supports developers of the XRP Ledger, has released version 2.5.0 of “rippled,” its reference implementation of the network. The new version comes with a string of amendments that expand the network’s functionality and governance tooling. The new amendments are now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's amendment process, which enables protocol changes following two weeks of support from more than 80% of trusted validators. The seven amendments include “TokenEscrow,” which enables escrows for IOU and multi-purpose tokens, “Batch,” allowing atomic execution of grouped transactions; and “PermissionedDEX,” which lets DEX operators control participation for regulatory compliance. RippleX has asked validators to upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible to ensure service continuity. The update lands as XRPL continues to evolve into a more flexible, permission-aware platform driven by both DeFi use cases and compliance-conscious enterprise developers. — Shaurya Malwa Read more .

Realized volatility refers to the actual historical movement of an asset's price over a specific period, in this case ten days. It is calculated using past price data and indicates how much the price has fluctuated in reality, as opposed to how much it is expected to fluctuate in the future. In addition to subdued historical price swings, MSTR’s implied volatility (IV) currently sits at 48.33 percent , which is among the lowest levels recorded for the stock in recent years.

2025-06-25T16:30:14,"Bitcoin ETFs Unveiling Crucial Market Impact Over Treasury Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETFs Unveiling Crucial Market Impact Over Treasury Holdings Are you an investor trying to decipher the true drivers behind Bitcoin’s market movements? In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, understanding the forces that shape Bitcoin’s price and adoption is paramount. For years, we’ve watched as major corporations added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, hailing it as a new era of institutional adoption. But what if their actual market impact is less significant than you might think? Unveiling the True Drivers: Bitcoin ETFs vs. BTC Treasury Companies Recent insights from K33 Research challenge a common perception, suggesting that despite the growing trend of BTC treasury companies, their influence on the market pales in comparison to that of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Vetle Lunde, a prominent analyst at K33 Research, highlighted this crucial distinction, as reported by The Block, sparking an important conversation among crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. It’s a nuanced point, but one with significant implications for how we perceive institutional engagement with Bitcoin. While both represent forms of corporate or institutional exposure to Bitcoin, their operational mechanics lead to vastly different levels of direct market demand and, consequently, price correlation. Why Do Bitcoin ETFs Have More Punch? The core of Lunde’s argument lies in the fundamental difference in how these entities acquire and manage their Bitcoin holdings. Let’s break down the mechanics: Cash Creation vs. In-Kind Swaps: The vast majority of spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly those launched in the US, operate on a cash creation model. This means that when investors buy shares of a Bitcoin ETF, the fund manager receives cash, which is then directly used to purchase Bitcoin from the open market. This process generates fresh, direct demand for Bitcoin, immediately impacting its supply-demand dynamics. Treasury Companies and In-Kind: In contrast, many BTC treasury companies, especially those that accumulate Bitcoin through strategic acquisitions or corporate actions, often utilize ‘in-kind’ share swaps. This means they might issue new shares of their own company in exchange for Bitcoin, or acquire Bitcoin directly from a counterparty without necessarily creating new, incremental demand on the open market. The Bitcoin they acquire might already be in circulation, simply changing hands from one large holder to another, rather than being bought fresh from the market. Correlation with Price Returns: This distinction is vital. Lunde points out that Bitcoin ETFs show a strong, direct correlation with Bitcoin price returns. When ETF inflows are high, it often signals significant buying pressure, which tends to push the price up. For treasury companies, while their accumulation is a bullish long-term signal, the immediate correlation between their flows and Bitcoin prices is significantly weaker due to the nature of their acquisitions. Consider this simplified comparison: Feature Bitcoin ETFs (Spot) BTC Treasury Companies Primary Acquisition Method Cash Creation (funds buy BTC directly) In-Kind Swaps, Direct OTC Purchases, Corporate Acquisitions Market Demand Generation High (new money directly into BTC) Low (often existing BTC changing hands) Correlation with BTC Price Strong & Immediate Weaker & Delayed Accessibility for Investors High (traditional brokerage accounts) Indirect (via company stock) The Dilution Effect: Why Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Isn’t Always Equal While the number of treasury initiatives continues to grow, Lunde highlights that their market influence has been diluted. This means that as more companies hold Bitcoin, the impact of any single company’s acquisition becomes less pronounced on the overall market. Imagine a large pool of water: dropping a single stone into it creates ripples. But if you drop many small stones simultaneously, the individual ripples become less distinct, and the overall disturbance is diffused. This ‘dilution effect’ is why we observe weaker correlations between treasury flows and Bitcoin prices. The market absorbs these acquisitions more smoothly without the dramatic price swings often associated with significant ETF inflows. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? Understanding this distinction is an actionable insight for any serious institutional Bitcoin investor or enthusiast: Focus on ETF Flows: If you’re tracking short-to-medium term price movements, monitoring Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows provides a more direct indicator of immediate buying or selling pressure. Significant net inflows often precede or coincide with positive price action, reflecting fresh capital entering the ecosystem. Treasury Holdings as Long-Term Signals: While treasury holdings might not move the needle daily, they are incredibly important for the long-term narrative of Bitcoin adoption. They signify corporate conviction, balance sheet diversification, and a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Think of them as foundational strength rather than dynamic market drivers. Not All Institutional Adoption is Equal: This research underscores that not all forms of institutional Bitcoin adoption have the same market crypto market impact. While both are positive, their mechanisms of interaction with the open market differ significantly. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs has truly democratized access to Bitcoin for traditional investors, bridging the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset world. This ease of access, combined with the cash-creation mechanism, makes them powerful catalysts for price discovery and liquidity. Looking Ahead: The Evolving Bitcoin Landscape As the Bitcoin ecosystem matures, we can expect continued evolution in how institutions engage with the asset. While treasury companies will likely continue to accumulate Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the spotlight for immediate market impact appears firmly fixed on Bitcoin ETFs. Their ability to attract vast amounts of capital and directly translate that into open market Bitcoin purchases makes them an undeniable force. This K33 research serves as a vital reminder to look beyond headlines and delve into the underlying mechanics of institutional adoption. It’s not just about who holds Bitcoin, but how they acquire it, and what that means for the broader market. To learn more about the latest Bitcoin trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin institutional adoption.

2025-06-25T16:21:34,"Trump Coin Price Prediction: Could an Iran-Israel Ceasefire Be the Catalyst for 10x Gains","With recent price moves closely pegged to developments in the Iran-Israel conflict, a lasting peace could mark a turning point for the near-term TRUMP coin price forecast . Although Iran had accepted the U.S. terms for a full ceasefire with Israel during Monday trading—sparking a sharp 12% rally—recent events have put peace talks in question. TRUMP remains 40% below its late-May peak following the presidential dinner for top holders, struggling to regain traction and in need of a fresh social catalyst to reignite retail attention. Speculators on the Sidelines as Lasting Peace Remains Distant With claims of foul play from both sides and U.S. intelligence reports that the U.S. strikes were unsuccessful in wiping out Iranian nuclear facilities, retail inflows remain sidelined. ""They don't know what the fuck they're doing"" ~President, Donald J Trump~ pic.twitter.com/HefrfiEvrE — Aaron Rodgersburgh (@QuillionWatts) June 24, 2025 FUD surrounding a potential “World War 3” scenario continues to grow, while the derivatives market remains largely stagnant—open interest has flatlined around $330 million, according to Coinglass data . Despite spikes on core escalations and de-escalations, long and short traders remain locked in a near 50-50 split, suggesting speculators are not actively participating in TRUMP coin price moves.

A peace deal could act as a market-warming catalyst for TRUMP, potentially helping it break free from the falling wedge that has guided its decline since the late-May peak. TRUMP / USDT 1-day price chart, falling wedge pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. A potential ceasefire has pushed momentum bullish for the first time since May, with the MACD line surpassing the signal line in a golden cross as an early indication of a trend reversal. Momentum has flipped bullish for the first time in weeks, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line in a golden cross—an early sign of a potential trend reversal. The RSI has also bounced from oversold territory at 30, signalling seller exhaustion. However, it has since plateaued at 36 following news that the ceasefire has been broken. This bullish momentum coincides with a critical bounce from the wedge’s lower support, aligned with a historic accumulation zone near the $9.30 level—the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement. This zone intersects with the pattern’s upper resistance trendline, forming a confluence zone for a potential breakout. If bulls can defend this level and spark a breakout, the next technical target lies near the 0.786 Fibonacci level—representing a potential 60% gain from current prices. While a peace deal could open the door to upside, a 10x remains a distant target with the current setup, particularly without active participation from speculators. However, if $9.30 is lost, the next major support sits at $7.15—about 20% lower—mirroring the mid-April market bottom and likely invalidating the bullish reversal narrative. Bitcoin Season Just Got a Whole Lot More Bullish Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.6 million in its third presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 479% APY on staking that rewards early investors.
